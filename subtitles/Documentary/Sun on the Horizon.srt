<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Sky Team @ Viki</i>

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,500
I think they're the police. I'll leave.

3
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,240
CEO Han Young Won.

4
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,490
Yes.

5
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,570
We just came from Belle La Fair.
I'm detective Lee Cha Yun from the regional precinct.

6
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,400
If it's about Lee Eun Soo, let's talk later.

7
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,550
Yes, I understand.

8
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,430
Let's go.

9
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,940
Eun Soo.

10
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,080
They're here to take me.

11
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,760
Everything that has happened between you and me,

12
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,210
erase it all

13
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,700
and remember me as I am now.

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,430
Me, standing in front of you, running away.

15
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,690
How childish and cowardly I was.

16
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,000
Watch carefully, and remember that.

17
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,140
Even if it's for you.

18
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,450
<i>Do you have a place to go?</i>

19
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you have to do this?

20
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,130
I'll leave everything and go empty-handed.

21
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,460
You're so great.

22
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,460
No matter how hard it may be to forgive, how can you say "My father is a swindler"

23
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,280
in front of the reporters?

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,130
In the least, I don't wish for any harm on anyone in this family.

25
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,330
Then to me,

26
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,270
why did you tell me the truth about Woo Jin?

27
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,810
So,

28
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,880
how far are you going?

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,860
The current problem with the slush funds existed since you were the CEO.

30
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,490
You think you won't be blamed?

31
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,980
Is that the only thing you have to say to me?

32
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,380
You were blinded by love, so in place of Jung Se Ro,

33
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,000
aren't you saying that you're going to get revenge?

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,610
Father made Woo Jin like that,

35
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,590
and buried Eun Soo socially.

36
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,730
How did you expect me to act after knowing all that?

37
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,000
Did you think I was going to suffer for a couple of days and get better?

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,870
Noona, even though I say I don't care about anything but myself,

39
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,110
I know this:

40
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,250
You can throw a man away.

41
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,740
You can abandon mom, and me too, but not dad!

42
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,330
Even if you take mom and me out, dad is your only family!

43
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,580
You'll only have a hard time if you fight against dad.

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,080
No.

45
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,720
For me, it's hard to abandon you and mother.

46
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,130
So abandon me, please.

47
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
Because of father, Lee Eun Soo was unjustly

48
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,090
framed as a murderer and spent five years in prison.

49
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,140
I would have nothing to say if he drowned me in the Han River.

50
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,970
That person was afraid that I'd find out what father did, so do you know what he said?

51
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
That he made Woo Jin like that.

52
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not enough for that person to hate me,

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,740
I didn't know anything and called him a swindler,

54
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,750
but that person still

55
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,380
loved me.

56
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,660
"Do you know what your father did?"

57
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,370
He needed to say just that one thing.

58
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,340
Because he thought I would be hurting,

59
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,220
he couldn't say that til the end.

60
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,320
I knew everything,

61
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,080
so how can I act like I don't know him?

62
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,000
So? So are you going to hold hands with Jung Se Ro

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,460
and drive father to the edge of a cliff?

64
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,050
Yes.

65
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,540
That is all I can do.

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,190
I...am not your sister anymore.

67
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm not father's daughter. I'm not a member of this family.

68
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,710
Even if you say I can't have it,

69
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,410
I have only that person now.

70
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,810
So please abandon me!

71
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,690
Think of it as the last thing you can do for me.

72
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,000
You didn't like me that much anyways.

73
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm finally starting to like her, but I no longer have any excuse to hold on to her.

74
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Am I right?

75
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,740



76
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,140
<i>She's out!</i>

77
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,680
<i>Is it true?!</i>

78
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,860
<i>About your father, Han Tae Oh...</i>

79
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,140
You're the one who exposed your father's deeds.

80
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,460
What I said...

81
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,180
everything is true.

82
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,620



83
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:37,430
<i>Beyond the Clouds 
 Episode 15</i>

84
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,390
<i>Mirum Party's senator Jung Soon Young, in an emergency press conference,</i>

85
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,850
<i>exposed Chairman HanTae Oh's personal list of</i>

86
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,780
<i>10 people with whom illicit funds were discovered.</i>

87
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,110
<i>At 11:00 AM, Senator Jung at the press conference, in regards to an internet posting,</i>

88
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,240
<i>stated that the 10 names and the documents were</i>

89
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,380
<i>sent to him by the person who posted the news item.</i>

90
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,550
<i>These people used Belle La Fair, which was operated by Han Young Won,</i>

91
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,050
<i>and HK Distribution in Hong Kong.</i>

92
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,660
<i>It was discovered that they laundered their illicit funds.</i>

93
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,860
<i>Senator Jung strongly requested to the prosecutor, in order to expose the full truth,</i>

94
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,180
<i>the names of the people involved and the original transaction documents.</i>

95
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,720
<i>The people's identity...</i>

96
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,710
Let's hand over the file to Senator Jung.

97
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,150
Yes.

98
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,370
Se Ro will give the original document to Senator Jung.

99
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,180
We need to block it before he does it.

100
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:38,180
If Han Tae Woo falls, we fall, too.

101
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,020
Hyung... Hyung.

102
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,940
Hyung!
What?

103
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,270
It's almost time to meet Senator Jung.

104
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,240
Oh! Really?

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,900
You don't look good.

106
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,710
Aren't you having after-effects after the car accident?

107
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,150
What after-effects?

108
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,670
I think you should go to the hospital.

109
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,460
Right now, I'm obvious, don't you know?

110
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,150
Who knows what will happen if I leave a trace behind.

111
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,370
Alright, are you following him well?

112
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,450
Yes.There's no problem as of now.

113
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,130
Don't let Senator Jung meet Se Ro.

114
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,350
If he meets Se Ro, catch him!

115
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,360
I understand.

116
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,310
Give it to me!

117
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,680
All the kids who followed Park Kang Jae around,

118
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,420
You've already learned disgusting things!
-Jung Se Ro betrayed us, first.

119
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,210
Then Kang Jae hyungim was supposed to look the other way with all those?

120
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,260
Is money your loyalty? Whether it's Hyungim or loyalty,

121
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,040
don't try acting like a gangster, you punk!

122
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't even distinguish your tasks!

123
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,480
<i>I found it.</i>

124
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,440
<i>You found it? Good job.</i>

125
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,540
<i>Verify the document right away,
 to see if it's the original copy.</i>

126
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,710
Oh, this bastard!

127
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,180
<i>What's wrong?</i>

128
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,260
<i>I'm sorry, but it's not the original copy.</i>

129
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,380
<i>They threw us off on purpose,
 because they thought we'd follow them.</i>

130
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,510
What?

131
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,750
<i>Then what about the original copy?</i>

132
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,880
You were the one that called...

133
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,080
It's the original copy.

134
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,910
Thank you. We'll use it for a good cause.

135
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,110
Please take good care of it.

136
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,080
Your contact information?

137
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,750



138
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,330
Stop right there!

139
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,960
<i>Cha Pyo caught on.</i>

140
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,700
<i>I'll lose him,
 but you bolt from here, immediately!</i>

141
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,580
<i>Hello, Hong?</i>

142
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,150
<i>Hong?!</i>

143
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,230
Jung Se Ro... where is he?

144
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,060
<i>If you want to meet Hong,</i>

145
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,890
<i>come by Kang Jae Hyung's office.
-Don't come, Hyung!</i>

146
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,570
<i>It's bait... to catch you. So don't come!</i>

147
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,610
<i>I'm going now!</i>

148
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,950
I have a bad feeling this time.

149
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,550
In whose hand will,
 the original copy be passed on to?

150
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,420
I can't just wait for a prolonged time.

151
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,410
We need to clear out,
before the prosecutor barges in.

152
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,250
Incinerate all of secretary Kim's files, and wipe out all the computer hard drives.

153
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,840
So they can't even find a speck of dust.

154
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:42,360



155
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,030
But... what about the documents
 that Assistant Ahn concealed...

156
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,550
If I can't intercept that...

157
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,040
Why do you want Se Ro Hyung here?

158
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,600
Do you honestly plan on sending him to prison again?

159
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,250
You're the one that 'honestly' needs to go to a prison!!

160
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,970
<i>Wasn't it only an errand?</i>

161
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,960
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

162
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,130
<i>I didn't think the cop would
 suspect a young child like you.</i>

163
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,580
This world is not fair.

164
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,910
You brought it onto yourself, 
yet you're blaming the world, like a loser!

165
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,870
Now,

166
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,490
I'm you?

167
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,280
Talking like that...
-Then should I call you 'Hyung', when you turn me into your bait?!

168
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,600
At the least, I..

169
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,830
didn't tell Se Ro Hyung your secret.

170
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,550
Because of you Se Ro Hyung's father was in an accident.

171
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,010
How you cunningly hid the truth,

172
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,100
and how you played on naïve Se Ro Hyung.

173
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,610
Then you joined forces with Han Tae Oh...

174
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,210
You also turned him into a thief.

175
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,250
Even though I wanted to tell him so many times in a given day,

176
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,830
it's so disgusting and complicated that I held it in.

177
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,400
Hyung...

178
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,750
It's all right for you to leave now.

179
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,880
Can you leave?

180
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,160
Hong... leave.

181
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,060
I'll be in front of the door.

182
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,830
Hyung.

183
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,580
The original copy?
- I didn't hear correctly, right?

184
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,700
Where is the original copy!?

185
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,550
I heard it incorrectly, right?
- Where is the original copy?

186
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,620
It's already been handed over. Tell me.

187
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,840
What did I exactly hear?

188
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,500
What about my dad?

189
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,840
While he was being chased by me,

190
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,050
he got into an accident.

191
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,510
Answer.

192
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,170
Answer! What about my dad?!

193
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,180
Gong Woo Jin's <i>Gong Jin Diamond</i>, we stole it.

194
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,420
We were supposed to divide it.

195
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,330
Your great dad took it and ran.

196
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,210
And I was chasing him.

197
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,750
We ran through Bangkok's dark streets,

198
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,130
like dogs.

199
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,040
Then...in front of my eyes~

200
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,830
Why didn't you say anything to me?

201
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,540
I'm the one who put Gong Woo Jin in ahjussi's storeroom,

202
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,510
and I'm the one who was chasing ahjussi.

203
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,780
Why didn't you say a word?
Every day, you looked upon my face,

204
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,630
pretending to be the best hyung in the world, but hiding all of that!

205
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,130
You want to kill me, right?

206
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,430
Shoot me.

207
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,660
Shoot! Shoot!

208
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,520
Shoot me!

209
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,000
You can't do it, right?

210
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm telling you to do it, but you can't. Then, how about me

211
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,420
to Jung Do Joon.

212
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,450
No matter how crazy angry I might have been,

213
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,940
do you think I would want to kill him?

214
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,620
Well, that's just an excuse. Then how about this?

215
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,540
Because of Han Tae Oh,

216
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,630
similar to when you went to prison,

217
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,190
because of your father, I

218
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,600
went to prison.

219
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,870
I was only 15 years old.

220
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,300
What?

221
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,680
I went on an errand.

222
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,300
I should obey, so I did what I was told.

223
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,250
But it wasn't just an errand.

224
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,330
The police came.

225
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,750
I was caught! And at age 15,

226
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,730
I lived in there for a few months, with the sentiment of
 "You did so well!"

227
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,500
After that, my life got twisted like this.

228
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,790
But, I thought Jung Do Joon would

229
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,670
compensate... at least to me...

230
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,460
until the day he closed his eyes.

231
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,450
Maybe I should have taken revenge... like you.

232
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,910
Stop there! Stop there!

233
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,670
Do you think I would believe you if you talk about nonsense?

234
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,430
Do I still look that innocent?

235
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,600
Come here!

236
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,920



237
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,530



238
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,240
It's not the truth. Don't lie, bastard.

239
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:35,410
Your father ultimately gave you the diamond
 he took from my pocket.

240
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,070
After screwing other people,

241
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,710
putting it in their kid's mouth, is the same for your father or 
Han Tae Oh.

242
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,220
You know?!

243
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,170
No. Don't say it like that.

244
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,090
There's something I realized.

245
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,030
Revenge, reconciliation, forgiveness, love... 
those are all bull s**t...

246
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,150
Living well on my own...

247
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,480
is the easiest way to live in this damned world.

248
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,600
Interfere till the end.
I'm going to go to the end, too.

249
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,230
Why are you doing this to me, Hyung?
It's not true.

250
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,040
It's not true!

251
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,490
After being on the run his whole life... 
why in front of my eyes,

252
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,330
why in front of me, because he couldn't avoid that one car!

253
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,080
Your father who screwed me over till the end, that great man... !

254
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,940
Your father was Han Tae Oh to me.

255
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,400
Let me make a request for the last time.

256
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,760
Please, get lost from me.

257
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,650
What are you doing here at this time?

258
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,780
You said you didn't want to see me anymore.

259
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,710
You said that you didn't need me anymore!
You said I was nothing to you!

260
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,790
I thought you might be lonely,

261
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,960
that you might be lonesome.

262
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,760
Perhaps... you might have been waiting for me.

263
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,330
I just need you.

264
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,810
Oppa, you changed too much.

265
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,760
You make me nervous. You scare me.

266
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,410
Yes.

267
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,710
It hurts.

268
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,110
Even if I love you,

269
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,670
I won't love you.

270
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:37,800
But... can't you trust me, just this one time?

271
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:44,320
I don't know... who Park Kang Jae is.

272
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,650
<i>Just as you went to prison because of Han Tae Oh,</i>

273
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,640
<i>I was in prison, because of your father.</i>

274
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,890
<i>I was only 15.</i>

275
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,230
<i>Screwing other people,</i>

276
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,840
<i>and putting it in their kid's mouth, is the same for
 your father and Han Tae Oh.</i>

277
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,650
You know?!

278
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,500
<i>I am... to Lee Eun Soo, I am...</i>

279
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,770
<i>the daughter of a conman.</i>

280
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,410
<i>Young Won, why are we so similar?</i>

281
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,480
<i>Maybe that's why I couldn't help but to love you.</i>

282
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,600
<i>This is Hangook Hospital's ER,</i>

283
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,630
<i>do you know Lee Eun Soo?</i>

284
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,850
<i>I'm calling you because your number was stored in #1 in his phone.</i>

285
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,840
<i>Have you regained your consciousness?</i>

286
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,240
We checked the accident patient.

287
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,510
My belongings?

288
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,010
I called your guardian...

289
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,720
I don't have such thing as a guardian.

290
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,480
Patient? Patient?

291
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,570
I came after getting a call. Lee Eun Soo...

292
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,080
I got a call saying that he was carried in here a few hours ago.

293
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,480
Are you Lee Eun Soo's guardian?
-Yes-Please come this way.

294
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,800
What happened here?

295
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,470
Nurse Baek.
- Yes.

296
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,470
Where did patient Lee Eun Soo go?

297
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,580
He stubbornly left.

298
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,050
He left?

299
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,020
Yes.

300
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,430
How can you just let him go?

301
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm his guardian. Is there something wrong with him?

302
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,300
Why was he here?

303
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,180
Ah. A few days ago, he was in a car accident.

304
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,180
At that time, he probably didn't get properly treated.

305
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,850
No wonder.

306
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,010
Why? What is wrong with him?

307
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,800
We would know the specifics once we do an MRI,

308
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,780
but the CT scan showed signs of hemorrhaging.

309
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,650
Do you mean in his brain?
- Yes.

310
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,470
If he is still hemorrhaging, then his condition is serious.

311
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,350
Every minute is urgent.
- Where is he now?

312
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,010
You should have looked after a patient. You just let someone who is sick leave?

313
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,180
<i> Han Young Won</i>

314
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,100
<i>♫ I’m hurting more ♫</i>

315
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,450
It's me. Where are you right now?

316
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,220
What is this, running away from the hospital?

317
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,570
I'm near the hospital. If you get this message...

318
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,050
Eun Soo,

319
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,350
they say you must

320
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,700
receive treatment.

321
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,010
Eun Soo, you have done nothing wrong.

322
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,050
Let's, you and I, meet the judge.

323
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,720
The video you took...

324
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,510
That... From my father's lips, if he were to say you have committed no crime,

325
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,630
you just need to hear that it's all his fault.
 That's all you need to hear, right?

326
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:01,520
That kind of video... I can take hundreds of them.

327
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,220
So let's meet each other.

328
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,320
Call me. I'll be waiting.

329
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,790
<i>♫ When I can get over you as meaningless memories ♫</i>

330
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:23,850
<i>♫ Then I can forget you even if I’m forced to remember you ♫</i>

331
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:29,930
<i>♫ That person, that one person... ♫</i>

332
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:37,770
<i>♫ That person I hate, the only person ♫</i>

333
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:43,750
<i>♫ The person deeply engraved in my heart, ♫</i>

334
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:52,430
<i>♫ painfully piercing me and my faded memories. ♫</i>

335
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,180
<i>♫ The person that is you ♫</i>

336
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,010
Chairman Han Tae Oh,

337
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,680
this is a search and seizure warrant.

338
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,750
You've probably already cleaned up everything.

339
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,700
We expended some effort trying to get the warrant.

340
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,010
So, you skillfully got it.

341
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,440
Few hours ago, through Assemblyman Jung,

342
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,180
we got your original copies of the corruption incidents.

343
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
So he went over.

344
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,180
Don't expect a criminal investigation without detention.

345
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,640
As a formality, we'll start the investigation
 by confiscating your things.

346
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
Let's start.

347
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Yes!

348
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,840
<i>Prosecution Services</i>

349
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,950
There isn't a day that's calm.

350
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,740
It seems really serious this time.

351
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,180
I gave all the years of my youth to Belle La Fair.

352
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,430
I guess it's time for me to leave here.

353
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:24,950
It's nothing compared to CEO Han Young Won.

354
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,350
Then, what's going to happen to us now?

355
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,100
What do you mean "split up?"

356
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,760
What are you scared of when all that is left now is for Han Tae Oh to go to jail?

357
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,040
Shouldn't we be happily dancing right now?

358
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,430
Be it Han Tae Oh or Park Kang Jae, they won't just stand still?

359
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,600
Because of me, you two could be in danger.

360
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,390
Then, how about you? What are you being framed for?

361
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,800
I'll take care of it.

362
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,100
By yourself, how?

363
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,430
This isn't much, but it's what I have.

364
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,640
This is all I have to give.

365
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,050
Here.

366
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,680
You sure know how to stab a person in the back.

367
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,720
We've come all this way together,

368
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,260
what kind of nonsense is this?

369
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,080
Who said we want something like this?!

370
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,300
This is the first thing in my life that I did something, 
without wanting something out of it.

371
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,600
I already know that.

372
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,160
Still, I'm giving you this because I want to.

373
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,890
Later, when you want to set up a store, it'll come in handy.

374
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,720
Where are you planning to go?
- Go? What do you mean go?

375
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm thinking of going down to the country.

376
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,140
I want to take a rest, too.

377
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,140
I'm going.

378
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,180
Hyung!

379
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,100
What do you want?

380
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,010
I can't seem to contact Eun Soo,

381
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,470
so I thought you might be able to contact him.

382
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,930
Why should I tell you that?

383
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,600
He is not in good health because of the car accident.

384
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,190
They say that he needs to be examined immediately.

385
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,640
What do you mean...

386
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,580
That's why I'm asking if you can contact him.

387
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,140
I don't know either.

388
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,140
Hyung!

389
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,850
What did you talk about with Park Kang Jae yesterday?
You're like this because you're in shock from that, right?

390
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,510
Hong.

391
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:45,050
I don't have the right to say something like this, but

392
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:50,350
you being angry because your family was unfairly ruined and your parents passing away...

393
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,710
don't let that anger be your life.

394
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,780
No matter how much this world makes you angry, if it's damaging and ruining you, relieve your anger.

395
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,860
I think you're more valuable than wasting away like that.

396
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,110
How about you?

397
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,300
That's why. I'll be in touch.

398
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,850
Or why don't you take Han Young Won?

399
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,850
At least go and set up a house.
What is this? As if you're going to your death.

400
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,390
Let's see each other again.

401
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,760
I'm not joking. Take Han Young Won with you.

402
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,640
Should I tell her for you?

403
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,930
That hyung can live happily forever, if he has you.

404
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,950
That Jung Se Ro is way too kind and stupid.

405
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,140
Shall I tell her for you?

406
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,600
It's because of you.

407
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,260
If it weren't for you, do you think Se Ro would have turned out this way?

408
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,990
I didn't come here to be lectured by you.

409
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,600
All I need to know is where Lee Eun Soo is.

410
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,260
Why do you keep calling him Lee Eun Soo?

411
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,920
Because his real name pains my heart.

412
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,970
And I don't have the right to say it either.

413
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,760
Jung Se Ro,

414
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,050
under a 3rd rated conman as a father,

415
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,970
he passed the Higher Civil Service Examination of Foreign Affairs.

416
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,890
He went to meet his father in Thailand,

417
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,470
and was falsely accused of something absolutely unfathomable.

418
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,480
He was notified at the police station that he passed,
 after his father passed away.

419
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,720
I wondered how much effort he put in to live that way.

420
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,010
But all he got was a prison life in a foreign country.

421
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,180
Do you think you can compensate him with your love?

422
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,180
If I was you,

423
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,950
I would be gone from Se Ro.

424
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,490
Don't you think your existence itself...

425
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,600
is too harsh for Se Ro?

426
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,760
<i>We have to clean up the vegetables.</i>

427
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,080
<i>This... the one with 3... when are you going to eat it all?</i>

428
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,160
<i>It's okay. Give it to me.</i>

429
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:51,850
<i>♫ I can't believe it, they say it's love ♫</i>

430
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:59,130
<i>♫ What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? ♫</i>

431
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:05,920
<i>♫ I push it away, but it comes to me ♫</i>

432
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,890
<i>♫ What do I do with you? What do I do? ♫</i>

433
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,920
<i>♫ The more I hate you, the more you fill me up ♫</i>

434
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,770
<i>♫ I'm so afraid, I'm going crazy ♫
- Is there a law that says that a criminal's son has turn out like that?</i>

435
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:30,890
<i>♫ The sun fully shines all over ♫
- He could've been an ordinary kid who wanted to be a doctor or the President.</i>

436
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:37,540
<i>♫ my body. Because it's you, because it's you, because it's you ♫
Because of people who come to a conclusion like you,</i>

437
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:47,300
<i>♫ Words I'm saying with an aching heart and tears ♫
they might just be ending up like that.</i>

438
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:54,240
<i>♫ I love you, I love you, I love you ♫</i>

439
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,290
You can go.

440
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,320
Chairman Han Tae Oh.

441
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,110
Did all the Korean police die? 
I don't think it's time for you to be running around like this.

442
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,810
Please apologize.

443
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,030
With just one phrase, "I'm sorry," 
I'll forgive you.

444
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,710
Apologize.

445
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,500
Don't forgive me. 
Did someone tell you that I need your forgiveness?

446
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,400
All the things you've done to me...

447
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,260
how dare you after making me like this.

448
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,770
Forgive?

449
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,410
Compare to what you did to me, I don't think it's nothing... 
that's what I think.

450
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,600
Don't tell me your thoughts. It's really humorous.

451
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,910
Why do you find me humorous?

452
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:23,160
Why is a person... why is he humorous?

453
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,700
If your father wasn't a 3rd rated conman, you wouldn't have been involved with Gong Woo Jin.

454
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,170
If your father had as much power as me, 
you wouldn't have been accused unjustly.

455
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:40,100
If you had a little bit of substance, 
you'd have been able to get millions from me.

456
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,300
Then, now, you'd be living comfortably.

457
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,600
You foolish man.

458
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,550
You're getting beat up because you're allowing it.
Forgive?

459
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,260
Do you think you're in a position to forgive me?

460
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,520
The thoughts like that is repulsive.

461
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,370
Look at the reality. Who you are and who I am.

462
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,300
Jung Se Ro, making you like this... Yes, I regret it.

463
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,930
But... I can't apologize to you.

464
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,950
I should have killed you like Gong Woo Jin instead.

465
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,200
I could kill you, too.

466
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,120
You...

467
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,080
I want to kill you.

468
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,760
Put it down.

469
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,930
I could shoot you.

470
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,130
No. You can't shoot me.

471
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:56,200
Put the gun down.

472
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:02,840
Even though I said I'd forgive you, if you apologize,
yet, you still say you've done nothing wrong?

473
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,470
You still don't know?

474
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,870
You didn't just ruin my life.

475
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:16,620
You should know that you ruined your daughter's life, too.

476
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,910
Even then, you're right?

477
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,820
Say that you're sorry.

478
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,350
Say that you've done wrong.

479
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,600
At least, as a father.

480
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,680
What would change even if I do that?

481
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,100
To regret the path I walked on now,

482
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,710
I've lived for too long.

483
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,080
Instead of denying all that, I'd rather die.

484
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,990
Stop talking nonsense.

485
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,900
You are just a vicious and pitiful person, 
who gave up living like a human being.

486
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,520
The reason why I want to get an apology from you,

487
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:30,600
is because your daughter, Han Young Won, could live while breathing a little easier.

488
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,670
Please,

489
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,020
don't make your daughter like me.

490
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,240
Speak.

491
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,990
Chairman, didn't anything happen?

492
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,800
<i>What kind of anything?</i>

493
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,290
Perhaps... did Jung Se Ro come to see you?

494
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,790
<i>Why do you want to know that?</i>

495
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,780
Don't meet him.

496
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,750
He...

497
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,860
has a gun.

498
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,620
<i>So, even if you get a call, make sure you don't meet him.</i>

499
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,580
He already came and left.

500
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,760
He didn't do anything.

501
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,120
<i>You want to kill me, right?</i>

502
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,590
It's me. Is Se Ro there?

503
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,220
Even if he's here, he's not, and if he's not, he's not, so hang up.

504
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,090
<i>Find that punk.</i>

505
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,000
Se Ro dropped everything and left as you wished 
so stop looking for him.

506
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,570
Is that for real?
-Yes, it's for real.

507
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,210
Find him.

508
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,270
That guy has a gun.

509
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,790
What?

510
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,400
<i>Dream</i>

511
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,430
Yes?

512
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,260
<i>It's me.</i>

513
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,030
Hong?

514
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:37,470
Yes. Did you not get a call from Se Ro?

515
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,830
Yes.

516
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,610
I have a bad feeling.

517
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,600
<i>Se Ro disappeared with a gun.</i>

518
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,340
Disappeared with a gun?

519
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,710
What do you mean?

520
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,830
It's strange that he settled everything, 
and left as if he's going to end it all...

521
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,720
It won't happen, but

522
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:05,220
I keep having ominous thoughts.

523
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,770
<i>Can you perhaps think of a place that Se Ro might go to?</i>

524
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,810
Why do you need the car suddenly?
What's going on?

525
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,410
Oh... thank you.

526
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,840
So why did you have to leave the car? 
 Making it troublesome for someone.

527
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,720
Get it! I'll take you there.
Where are you going?

528
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,240
I'll tell you later. It's urgent.

529
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:02,940
<i>No, no Eun Soo.</i>

530
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,360
<i>If I could return,</i>

531
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,530
<i>to my younger days,</i>

532
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:12,490
<i>to my dad's wide back, who'd run with me on his back 
when I blow the whistle.</i>

533
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:20,590
<i>Or when I first saw</i>

534
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,660
<i>your bright smile.</i>

535
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,190
<i>Or</i>

536
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,620
<i>if I could return to the day when</i>

537
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,610
<i>everything became a mess.</i>

538
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,050
<i>I don't know anything! I really don't know anything!</i>

539
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,520
<i>How could I kill someone!</i>

540
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,570
<i>Why would I kill a person! Why would I!</i>

541
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,510
<i>If I wiped your tears back then.</i>

542
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,960
<i>Should we run away?</i>

543
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,130
<i>Yes.
-Should we?</i>

544
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,700
<i>I'm Jung Se Ro.</i>

545
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,790
<i>And I killed Gong Woo Jin.</i>

546
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,990
<i>Could I have as myself ,</i>

547
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,160
<i>lived as Jung Se Ro?</i>

548
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,720
Jung Se Ro!

549
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,480
Se Ro... Jung Se Ro.

550
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,000
Jung Se Ro!

551
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,570
Se Ro...

552
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,350
You... are Jung Se Ro.

553
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,110
Is that right?

554
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,050
You didn't hurt Woo Jin.

555
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:15,690
Is that right?

556
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,560
Answer me!

557
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,720
You didn't hurt... Woo Jin!

558
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,090
You were framed!

559
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,210
Is that right?

560
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,880
Yes.

561
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,540
You came to look for me because you were angry.

562
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,660
You wanted revenge.

563
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,750
Is that right?

564
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,750
Yes.

565
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:58,220
But then you,

566
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,980
you told me that you killed Woo Jin.

567
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,780
I was wrong.

568
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,580
Why did you deceive me?

569
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,540
Why did you lie to me?!

570
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:45,370
I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

571
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,280
I'm sorry. I am sorry.

572
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,430
I am sorry.

573
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,900
I was wrong.

574
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,090
I was wrong.
