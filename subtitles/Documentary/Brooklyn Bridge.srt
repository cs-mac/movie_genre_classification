00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:45,306
I thought you were gonna
"last forever, bitches!"

163
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,107
Turns out I gave up easy.

164
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,742
You hear that, bitches?

165
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:51,612
I gave up so easy!

166
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:53,948
Thank you!

167
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,303
Hey, are you sure
it's a good idea

168
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,184
to eat all this shawarma
right before your tux fitting?

169
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:58,519
Oh, yeah.

170
00:05:58,553 --> 00:05:59,887
I'm not gonna be one
of those grooms who doesn't eat.

171
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:01,288
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

172
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:02,790
Thanks for being
so supportive all day.

173
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:04,959
Best man...
whatever you need, I will do.

174
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,760
Actually, there is one thing.

175
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:08,462
Do you have a pen I could borrow
to sign these forms?

176
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,698
You bet I don't have a pen.
I never do.

177
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,299
But I will get you one.

178
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,001
What is it, some sort
of marriage license thingy?

179
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:15,402
Oh, no, it's
my retirement paperwork.

180
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:17,271
- What? Shut up. What?
- Yeah.

181
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,073
Vivian got a job
in suburban Ottawa.

182
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:21,408
She wants me to retire from
the NYPD and go with her.

183
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:22,743
Retire?

184
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,578
Boyle, we're supposed to
die on the force together...

185
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:25,980
me in a big explosion,

186
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:27,982
and you committing suicide
at my funeral out of respect.

187
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,250
I know.

188
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:31,552
But Vivian needs to make
this move for her career,

189
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:33,220
and I'm excited to go.

190
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:34,955
I mean,
suburban Ottawa's great.

191
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,490
It has everything
Brooklyn does.

192
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,425
- Really?
- Yes...

193
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,061
Other than my job
and my friends and my family,

194
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:44,298
you, interesting people,
museums, restaurants,

195
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:46,267
every other reason
that I have to live.

196
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:48,435
Okay, I'm kind of picking up
on a couple of clues

197
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,471
that you maybe don't want
to retire in Canada.

198
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:51,739
Oh, my God.

199
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:52,840
Jake, you're such
an amazing detective.

200
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:54,674
I don't want to go.

201
00:06:56,472 --> 00:06:57,839
Okay, Boyle, let's strategize

202
00:06:57,873 --> 00:06:59,140
on how you're gonna tell Vivian

203
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,508
that you don't want to move
to Canada.

204
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:01,909
No, Jake, I'm not
gonna say anything.

205
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:03,111
Just drop it.

206
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,379
We have the perfect
relationship.

207
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:05,546
We've never fought.

208
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:06,648
I don't want to mess up
and ruin it.

209
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:07,815
She's my everything.

210
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,183
- Move your testicles to the left.
- 10-4.

211
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:10,351
She's your fiancee.

212
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,853
You can't be scared
to talk to her.

213
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,321
Testicles to the right...

214
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:15,723
You know, can we actually cool it
on the testicles for a minute?

215
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,392
No, I'm on the testicle part.

216
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,893
[Sighs]

217
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,828
Honestly, Jake, I wouldn't
even know how to bring it up.

218
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:21,996
What if it goes badly?

219
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:23,998
It won't.
Just tell her how you feel.

220
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:25,900
Say something like,
"Vivian, I love you,

221
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:27,435
but we need to talk
about Ottawa."

222
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:30,571
Right. And then she'll say,
"you're a selfish man-pig,

223
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,940
and I hope you die alone,
and I never loved you."

224
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:34,709
Oh, God.
She never loved me.

225
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,144
She's not gonna say any of that

226
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,979
because she's not
criminally insane.

227
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:39,380
<i>Okay, just calm down.</i>

228
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,736
We'll think of something
together.

229
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,083
We're going
to the stationery store next.

230
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,318
We can write
a bunch of stuff down.

231
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,520
It's gonna be all right.
Take a deep breath.

232
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:47,121
No deep breaths.

233
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:48,923
Makes the testicles clap.

234
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,325
Mm.

235
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,926
Detective Diaz.

236
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:53,895
How's your apology
to officer Deetmore coming?

237
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,530
I've been working on a letter
to send him.

238
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,198
Yes, I saw a draft of it
on your desk.

239
00:07:57,232 --> 00:07:58,566
What did you think?

240
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,135
It was so horrifying,
I had to destroy the whole pad.

241
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:05,940
Just go downstairs
and apologize.

242
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,076
Fine.
I'll say, "I'm sorry."

243
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,144
No, be sincere, like this...

244
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,146
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

245
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:14,148
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

246
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:15,350
I'm sorry.

247
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:16,384
I'm sorry.

248
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:18,353
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

249
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:19,787
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

250
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:21,189
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

251
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:23,424
Good.
That's the one.

252
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,510
Still working
on that afternoon almond?

253
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:29,480
I've been sucking on it so long,
it's smooth.

254
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:31,449
- It's like sea glass.
- You do you.

255
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:35,253
[Gasps] [Dramatic music]

256
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:36,487
I'll get that for you, Ames.

Oops!
[Squeaks]

260
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:42,059
Butter feet...
sorry about that.

261
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,696
Sorry? You bumbling
son of a bitch!

262
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,531
You just ruined my life!

263
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:49,000
I hope you get hit by a truck

264
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,535
and a dog takes a dump
on your face!

265
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:51,702
Nothing to see here...

266
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:53,204
just a little
hypoglycemic rage.

267
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,338
Move along.

268
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,041
I'm so sorry, Hitchcock.
That's not me.

269
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:58,743
I'm never like that.

270
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,244
That's okay.
It was my fault.

271
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,146
I shouldn't have bumped
your cashew.

272
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:05,049
Cashew?
It was an almond, you idiot!

273
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,851
I hope you drown in a tub!

274
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:10,655
I hope you have aneurysm
after aneurysm after aneurysm!

275
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:12,223
(Jake) <i>Okay, buddy.</i>

276
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,897
We have got some great
opening lines here,

277
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:16,227
three very reasonable
explanations

278
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:17,762
as to why you don't want
to go to Canada,

279
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:21,666
and four very attractive options
for your invitation card stock.

280
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,635
Well, I like
" Romantic Opening 'C.' "

281
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,737
this page about how my life
is New York,

282
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,874
and I love the Chantilly Ecru
paper for place cards.

283
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:31,609
That is an excellent choice.

284
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:33,578
Those are all
excellent choices.

285
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:34,579
You can do this.

286
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:35,893
You're a smart
and wonderful man.

287
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,682
With fantastic handwriting.

288
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,183
Sure, with fantastic
handwriting.

289
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,618
You really think so?

290
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:42,887
Yeah, I think that you could be
a professional calligrapher.

291
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:45,423
Charles,
a professional calligrapher.

292
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,391
You can do anything,

293
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,927
including, but not limited to,
talking to Vivian.

294
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:52,797
Right.
Right. Right.

295
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:54,632
Look, I know
it's gonna be hard.

296
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,067
And she might even
get mad at you.

297
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,069
But I promise you will be back
to doing weird sex stuff

together in no time.

299

[Sighs] All right.

300
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,574
All right,
I'm gonna go talk to Vivi.

301
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:06,143
Great idea, buddy!
Eh?

302
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:07,278
- Yep!
- <i>Yeah!</i>

303
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:09,380
So who's gonna pay
for the paper?

304
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:12,383
It's gonna be $250.

305
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,285
Her name is Amy Santiago.

It's an ice cream cone.

308
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,058
You can't tempt me, traitor,

309
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:23,628
not when I got this big,
juicy cantaloupe wedge

310
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:25,963
to keep me company.

311
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,932
It's so thin
I can see through it.

312
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,800
Santiago!

313
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,036
Come hold this so it looks
bigger in your tiny hand.

314
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,605
Aw, Amy left the building
20 minutes ago.

315
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,940
That doesn't make sense.

316
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:38,209
Santiago loves cantaloupe time.

317
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:39,844

He's not being himself.

Maybe because he's facing
a terrible decision
