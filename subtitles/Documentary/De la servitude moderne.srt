1
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:41,725
PRICE FOR HIS HEAD:

2
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,192
PRICE FOR HER HEAD:

3
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,029
"BRING ME THE HEAD
OF THE MACHINE GUN WOMAN"

4
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,610
I got in through the back door...

5
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,029
I looked through the kitchen window...

6
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,823
and there were those assholes.

7
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,075
Twelve mother fuckers waiting for me.

8
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,159
Twelve guys?

9
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,244
Yes, twelve.

10
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,997
All of them aiming their guns
at the door and windows...

11
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,165
The bastards were armed to the teeth.

12
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,084
I had to go Clint Eastwood
on their asses...

13
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,460
How many bullets did you have left?

14
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,670
Only 8 bullets...

15
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,173
I didn't know then. I just made
my way shooting like a crazy person...

16
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,592
Everybody dropped dead on the floor...

17
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,969
I killed them all!

18
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,762
With only 8 bullets left?

19
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,806
With 8 bullets! That was it!

20
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,851
I don't know if they shot each other,
or bullets bounced...

21
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,395
I fucked them all up!

22
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,355
I won three stars!

23
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,481
Nice!

24
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,066
I knew you'd like it.

25
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,568
It's just like "GTA."

26
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,069
The game is awesome!

27
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,905
Thanks. I made a copy of it.

28
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,539
That's what I would like to do.

29
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,208
Invent a game, about anything.

30
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,378
But it allows you to play
any song you want.

31
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,049
Imagine having 40 thousand songs
to listen to while you play.

32
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,925
Very good, uh?

33
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,719
Would you stop it?

34
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,471
C'mon! Stop playing
those stupid things!

35
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,306
You spend the whole day
shooting and killing...

36
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,517
Why don't you go outside,
it's so nice out?

37
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,394
I want to be the best in the world!

38
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,146
There are people making
a living off this.

39
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,983
You have to stop doing this
and study, ok?

40
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,360
And get a decent job...

41
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,404
Without that nasty Argentinean
mobster!

42
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,663
Alright, man. I have to
go work next door.

43
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,082
You're leaving?

44
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,250
Yeah, I have a lot of
work to do yet.

45
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,213
Tell him about your salary.

46
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,019
Excuse me...

47
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,355
Can I speak to Don Che Sausage?

48
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,481
He's dancing.

49
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,984
But he told me he
can talk now.

50
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,362
He-is-dancing.

51
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,239
But he told me.

52
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,122
Well... I'll wait!

53
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,193
Piton!

54
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,863
Shut the door, don't let anybody in.

55
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,407
She is making you look bad...

56
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,868
That fucking bitch!

57
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,496
We were supposed to
hire professionals, Brancolli.

58
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,957
I sent her "El Chinchinero".

59
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,917
What? That bitch killed
the Chinchinero?

60
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,919
Yes, with no mercy.

61
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,382
Bring me the head of
the Machine Gun Woman...

62
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,471
Spread the word. The
reward is $300 million.

63
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,058
Put up posters in the
street like in the old west...

64
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,645
"Machine Gun Woman Wanted,
Dead Or Alive".

65
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,439
Preferably dead!

66
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,941
Ok...

67
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,527
What's that?

68
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,279
What's that smell?

69
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,990
It smells like shit...

70
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,835
CHE SAUSAGE

71
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,837
It's the DJ...

72
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,838
What?

73
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,423
The DJ.

74
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,593
What are you
still doing here?

75
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,097
I wanted to speak to.
Don Che Sausage...

76
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,518
Who wants to talk to me?
You or your ass?

77
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,564
Anything you want to discuss with him
you have to talk with me first.

78
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,777
Yes, I was going to do that but.

79
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,072
I think the kid is a little nervous...

80
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,369
Why don't you take him
to his place?

81
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,704
You know, to rest...

82
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,250
To rest.

83
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,919

in peace.

84
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,714
Tell Piton to join you.

85
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,385
Alright, kid! Wipe your
ass, we're leaving!

86
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,345
Wait, wait!

87
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,139
I can bring her.

88
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,433
What?

89
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,354
You, DJ? You can bring who?

90
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,232
The...

91
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,234
the Machine Gun Woman.

92
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,406
Who is Machine Gun Woman?

93
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,992
She is.

94
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,620
Don Che's ex girlfriend.

95
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,373
I met her when she
came over here.

96
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,213
I think I'm not getting it...

97
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,800
You mean. DJ...

98
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:59,097
A little brat who was scared shitless
by our little conversation...

99
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,684
You want to bring the
Machine Gun Woman over?

100
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,439
When Brancolli, my right hand.

101
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,026
A man that I've known
for over 9 years.

102
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,237
hired the best professionals,
isn't that right?

103
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,407
You spilt so much blood
in this fucking city.

104
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,452
To capture the woman
who wants to kill me.

105
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,288
And you couldn't do it,
could you?

106
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,290
This little bitch.

107
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:30,337
says that he can capture the most blood
thirsty woman on this continent?

108
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,430
This fucking dip shit...

109
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,643
To enjoy this, you have to suck hard...

110
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,113
You have 24 hours...

111
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,128
You're late, Chaguito.

112
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,129
Hi, mom.

113
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,771
Come here and give me a kiss.

114
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,065
I'm coming.

115
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,511
Hello? Israelito?

116
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,221
What was the name of that chick?

117
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,848
The one with a really weird name.

118
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,683
Blonde hair and wore a wig...

119
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,145
A friend of Che Sausage's ex girlfriend...

120
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,439
No, not that one...

121
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,858
Shadeline!

122
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,193
Shadeline Soto! Yeah, that one!

123
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,906
Do you know how I can reach her?

124
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,990
MISSION #01:

125
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,159
"GETTING A CLUE WITH SHADELINE SOTO"

126
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,776
Hello!

127
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,652
Hi, sweetie!

128
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,863
Two kisses...

129
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,573
How are you?

130
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,075
I'm fine.

131
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,701
What can I get you?

132
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,453
An Espresso.

133
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,956
Do you need it to wake up, daddy-o?

134
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,085
What's your name?

135
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,836
Margarita! And you are.?

136
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,881
Juan.

137
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,883
Juan Soto.

138
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,053
I'm Shadeline's cousin...

139
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,096
Really?

140
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,640
Yeah, I haven't seen her in a long while.

141
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,683
Shadeline!

142
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,018
Your cousin is here!

143
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,771
Hi, cousin...

144
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,692
Do I know you?

145
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,531
Well, I'm not your real cousin...

146
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,201
I need to reach The Machine Gun Woman.

147
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,624
You?

148
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,627
Yes. Me.

149
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,379
What for?

150
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,631
To take her to do what
she does best.

151
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,342
And what would that be?

152
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,014
I can't tell you here!

153
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,644
Are you a cop?

154
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,313
Do I look like a cop?

155
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,778
You're going to tip
me very well, ok?

156
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,156
Can I pay with a credit card?

157
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,160
Cash...

158
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,955
Five "orange" bills and
we talk later...

159
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:33,885
So?

160
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,512
I don't have "orange" bills but.

161
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,973
I have this.

162
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,434
I already have one of those.

163
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,438
It's not like this one! It contains
30 thousand songs...

164
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,235
I'm a DJ. Look, I'm giving you
years of downloaded music.

165
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,738
It has whatever song
you want!

166
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,448
Do you like Reggaeton?

167
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,241
I hate it.

168
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,746
What do you listen to?

169
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,958
I listen to...

170
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,711
Laura Pausini...

171
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,921
Got it!

172
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,172
Raffaella Carra...

173
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,298
Got it too!

174
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,466
New wave?

175
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,509
I got it all!

176
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,343
Lady Gaga?

177
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,345
I got everything!

178
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,598
Here! Take it!

179
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,230
Are you sure you want
to meet her?

180
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,484
A pretty boy like you
dealing with this.

181
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,988
You can lose your balls, sweetie.

182
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,200
Did you know that?

183
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,078
Are you sure?

184
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,081
Yes.

185
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,918
78, Lo Barnechea Street.

186
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,379
It's an auto repair shop...

187
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,382
You have to say this:

188
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,387
"I want my oil checked.
Very deeply"

189
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,890
Very deeply...

190
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,644
Are you shitting me?

191
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,355
It really seems like it, but it's true.

192
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,652
Please, I'm not an idiot.

193
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,239
I don't think you're
an idiot, sweetie...

194
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,702
Mekano came up with that code...

195
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,372
It's for filtering people. Alright?

196
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,419
How was it again?

197
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,797
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

198
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,427
MISSION #02

199
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,679
"OIL CHECKING"

200
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,434
Hello!

201
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,978
How can I help you?

202
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,692
Well.

203
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,361
I want my oil checked.

204
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,364
very deeply.

205
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,744
Ok! Go ahead.

206
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,541
Alright, that's good!

207
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,001
There you go!

208
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,137
I'll have to change the
air filter, I'll check inside...

209
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,265
First you have to change
the oil, stupid pig.

210
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,730
What the hell are you doing
with that wrench, you dumb fuck?

211
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,358
You're going to mess it up!

212
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:37,902
Hey!

213
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,028
Yeah?

214
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,283
I think you didn't understand me...

215
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,702
I don't want my oil changed...

216
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,038
I want my "oil checked".

217
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,790
"Very deeply".

218
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,709
Of course that fucker
didn't understand!

219
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,504
MEKANO
Hit Men Agent

220
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,884
Alright!
Go and buy some smokes!

221
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,723
Please, come in...

222
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,981
Go ahead...

223
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,818
Get in!

224
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,373
So, you want it very deeply, uh?

225
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,292
Yes.

226
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,627
You better drop your
pants, mother fucker!

227
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,843
You almost shat yourself, kiddo!

228
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,014
Yeah. You got me there!

229
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,765
Well, what do you need?

230
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,601
Hire The Machine Gun Woman.

231
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,439
The Machine Gun Woman...

232
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,776
Yeah.

233
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,195
What do you want her for?

234
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,238
I have many others.

235
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,364
She's the best.

236
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,325
She's the best and the
most expensive, man.

237
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,368
Yeah! But we can work
something out.

238
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,995
Are you shitting me?

239
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,080
Do you think this is a
grocery store or what?

240
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,583
Do you think I sell tomatoes?
Are you here to bargain?

241
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,169
No, man! Things are simple.
The fees are non-negotiable.

242
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,339
The guys who get all the way to here,
they know how we do things in here.

243
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,216
We have to make everybody happy.
Fifty-fifty.

244
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:28,346
Half up front and half
after the job is done.

245
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,891
Yeah.

246
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,727
Are you familiar with our website?

247
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,899
The Machine Gun Woman...

248
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,609
Damn, she's hot!

249
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,197
We got "El Tronador",
Mexican product...

250
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,782
for international jobs.

251
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,743
El Chinchinero was killed...

252
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,913
We have Magnum Gonzalez...

253
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,166
We also have "Mandrill",
this guy is very expensive.

254
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,502
How about "Panguinao"
AKA "Air Head"...

255
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,338
The call him that because
he doesn't have anything inside...

256
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,964
he just kills.

257
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,219
You're here because
you need to kill somebody, aren't you?

258
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,056
Yes. but she has to do it.

259
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,312
Why?

260
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,608
What?!

261
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,778
Pig! What happened?!

262
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,198
You, fucking pig!

263
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,493
Start talking, fucker!

264
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,080
Son of a bitch! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

265
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,457
Alright, asshole!
You know why I'm here...

266
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,292
You're breaking the code, stupid!

267
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,128
You're going to pay for this.

268
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,046
Shut the fuck up!
Tell me where she is!

269
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,217
Do you want a bullet in
the head?

270
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,718
Tell me where she is!

271
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,011
Where, asshole!

272
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,638
In your mom's cunt!

273
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,272
Where is she?

274
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,109
I'm not going to talk,
mother fucker.

275
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,987
You won't talk, uh?

276
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,822
I'll make you talk!

277
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,453
How the fuck did you come up
with that damn cool secret code?

278
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,247
You're clever, asshole!

279
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,082
Ready to talk now?

280
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,250
No!

281
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,544
Or you want me to
check your oil very deeply?

282
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,838
Speak!

283
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,720
Last chance.

284
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,721
Alright! Alright!

285
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,557
You win!

286
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,602
Send a text message
from my cell phone.

287
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:46,275
Text the place and time. That's it!

288
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,198
Thank you, faggot! Thank you!

289
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,002
Did I hear something?

290
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,183
Anybody else want their oil checked?

291
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,936
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

292
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,078
Can I borrow a gun?

293
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,790
What an asshole!

294
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,417
What's wrong, kiddo?

295
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,878
If you want me to bring her,
you have to help me.

296
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,256
What are you thinking
asking us for a gun?

297
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,259
Machine Gun Woman.

298
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,263
Tarapaca Avenue and Zenteno,
that's where you get a gun.

299
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:25,309
They sell hand guns, shotguns,
grenades and Molotov Cocktails, anything!

300
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,561
You have to be careful...

301
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,564
Do you know what The Machine
Gun Woman did to Cowboy Ramon?

302
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,398
No.

303
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,650
He died.

304
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,277
No! She killed him.

305
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,738
And how did she kill him?

306
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,657
That chick is very dangerous, man!

307
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,700
She enetered in his brain...

308
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,870
And his brains
spread everywhere, man!

309
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,041
Cowboy Ramon!
God bless your soul!

310
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,878
He must be buried
like 10 feet under.

311
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,046
Alright, then...

312
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,632
Walk away, man! Walk away!

313
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,027
MISSION #03

314
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,238
"GETTING A GUN"

315
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,031
What do you need, pal?

316
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,576
A gun.

317
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,161
Model?

318
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,538
The easiest one to use.

319
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,123
Caliber?

320
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,210
I don't know. The easiest one.

321
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,380
What do you need the gun for?

322
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,551
To recommend a gun,
I need to know what you need it for.

323
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,598
Well the thing is. There is a sick horse mare
at my house and we don't want...

324
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,475
it to continue suffering, poor thing.

325
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,060
Do you have a license to carry a gun?

326
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,271
No, I don't have any.

327
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,816
How do you want me to sell you a gun,
when you don't even have a license?

328
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,985
No license, no gun.

329
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,281
Don't you have anything that you
can sell to me? Even without a license?

330
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:49,703
Sure! Starting guns,
replicas, air soft guns...

331
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,415
I don't think you can
kill a mare with it.

332
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,125
Which one is the most powerful?

333
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,835
Air soft gun.

334
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,545
May I see one?

335
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,718
You better take the
horse mare to a veterinarian...

336
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,971
you're going to hurt it but
you're not going to kill it.

337
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,518
What if, for instance, I accidentally
shoot a person with it?

338
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,688
What did the mare do to you
to make you so pissed?

339
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,317
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

340
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,203
MISSION #04

341
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,497
"HUNTING MACHINE GUN WOMAN DOWN"

342
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,979
I have a job for you...

343
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,691
I want you to.

344
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,444
I want you to kill Che Sausage.

345
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,324
Hey! Hands in air!

346
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,080
I'm going to shoot you.

347
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,356
What is this?

348
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,527
A toy gun?

349
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,365
It's an air soft gun...

350
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,295
Here.

351
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,052
So how much are they paying you
to kill me?

352
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,762
Who?!

353
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,100
Why are you with
Che Sausage's men?

354
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,769
They're following me.

355
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,395
Why?

356
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,022
I don't know.

357
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:55,323
They were going to kill me and I talked
them out of it saying that I'd find you.

358
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,700
And you found me.

359
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,243
Yes! I'm sorry!

360
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,999
Please, forgive me! I was just.

361
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,711
I'm a good boy, I'm the
DJ from the Tango Club.

362
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,005
Pussy!

363
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,384
Now!

364
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,105
Who is this?

365
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,029
This kid is the DJ from
the Tango Club.

366
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,951
Is it true that he was forced
to hunt me?

367
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,415
Yes.

368
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,259
Tell Che Sausage that...

369
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,929
... it was a nice try.

370
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,141
Go away.

371
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,704
I think you owe me one
reason to let you live.

372
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,459
Let's see.

373
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,380
I'll give you two options...

374
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,883
First, you tell me
something so powerful...

375
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,677
that it moves me or makes
me feel sorry for you.

376
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,387
Option two...

377
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,849
you tell me something so clever
that I end up liking you...

378
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,893
and I let you live.

379
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,855
I don't have anything to do with this!

380
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,776
I didn't know. I am a good boy...

381
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,486
I'm a DJ...

382
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,031
I live with my mom!

383
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,700
I'm going to cry!

384
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,580
Second option, then?

385
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,378
I can check your oil...

386
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,797
Very deeply.

387
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,479
Last chance...

388
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,902
I'll play a song. Yeah! That's it!

389
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,738
If you like it, you let me live...

390
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,742
If you don't like it. well, we'll see...

391
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm waiting...

392
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,564
Turn it off!

393
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,779
Please.

394
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,739
I want you to leave...

395
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,829
They're going to kill you...

396
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,457
They're going to kill
you and your family...

397
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,793
Give me that tape.

398
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,086
Yes!

399
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,633
Take it.

400
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,663
Holy shit!

401
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,930
MISSION FAILED

402
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,310
MISSION #05

403
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,562
"ESCAPING THE CITY"

404
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,105
Hello, mom?

405
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:19,939
it's me...

406
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,317
We'll have to travel. Like right now!

407
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,444
Mom, don't ask me! It's just a trip!

408
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,364
A trip out of Chile. I need you
to pack your things...

409
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,199
I'll explain it to you
at home.

410
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:33,411
Please, don't ask me shit! Alright,
I'll talk to you when I get back.

411
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,437
What's up!

412
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,356
I can't open it, man!
Open it please!

413
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,066
Relax, man!

414
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,528
I'm in a hurry!

415
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,405
Easy, man!

416
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,364
What happened?

417
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,617
Some assholes were looking for you,
ugly bastards to say the least.

418
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,369
Is my Mom up there?

419
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,329
I don't see her down here...

420
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,998
Did you let those men go up?

421
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,709
Son of a.

422
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,003
How do you figure!
What do you think I do here?

423
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,840
You have keys, so you can
come and go as you please.

424
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,883
You live here, right?

425
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,718
Those ugly assholes
don't live here...

426
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,263
How are they going to come
and go as they please?

427
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,931
Let me in, please!

428
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:39,978
They even offered me money to
tell them where you were.

429
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,147
Did you say yes?

430
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,898
Yeah! $20 thousand pesos!

431
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,401
God damn it!
Did you tell them?

432
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,112
I didn't say anything, man!
I just gave them wrong information.

433
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,155
Thank God!

434
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,157
Relax, man! Don't rush me!

435
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,783
For fuck's sake.

436
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,909
Alright!

437
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,536
C'mon! Hurry up!

438
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,627
Mom?

439
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,796
Chago, I'm over here.

440
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,633
You didn't pack!

441
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,512
Why would I? Just because you
told me to over the phone?

442
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,306
Please, mom! Shit got real!

443
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,224
Pack your things! We need to go!

444
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,726
Explain everything to me first.

445
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,728
Let me explain it to you in the car!

446
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,563
Let's get out of here!

447
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,733
I bet you're involved with
that Argentinean gangster!

448
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,110
Pack your things!
Then I'll explain!

449
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:33,114
I'll stay right here until
you tell me everything!

450
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:37,368
C'mon! Just pack your things!
I'm in trouble! Please!

451
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,788
We're going to travel for some time,
maybe a week or more.

452
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,124
Is that gangster involved?

453
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,667
Yes! You're right!

454
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,296
Che Sausage is the
worst piece of shit ever.

455
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,631
But you are innocent!

456
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,842
I got into trouble by chance,
he is after me!

457
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,719
Let's call the cops!

458
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,055
If we call the cops we're fucked!

459
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,516
These guys kill people!

460
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,144
Who is it?

461
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,979
Silence! Don't make any sound!

462
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,274
It's them.
Don't call the cops!

463
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,026
I'll solve this!

464
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,778
Go to the kitchen, go now!

465
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,533
If they do something to you,
I'll kill them!

466
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,291
I'm coming, I'm coming!

467
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,215
Hey! What do you mean "Hey"?
Say: hello, boss!

468
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,132
Say hello!

469
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,759
Hello!

470
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,302
How are you, DJ?

471
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,721
You were supposed to be
after that bitch, weren't you?

472
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,139
Yes, I'm on it!

473
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,642
Are you packing?

474
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,143
It's a backpack.

475
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,896
I know it's a backpack!
I'm not stupid

476
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,941
I was told you met her. Where is she?

477
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,861
Damn, she's not here!
She went away!

478
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,407
Let's play a game...

479
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,743
I ask you questions and you answer me...

480
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,537
Is that clear?

481
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,497
Stay still, you're making me nervous!

482
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,542
Where is The Machine Gun Woman?

483
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,211
I don't know.

484
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,505
I was with her but she left...

485
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,385
She found out about the
two guys following me...

486
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,513
And she killed them!

487
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,268
She also found out that I
knew you and... she left.

488
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,564
She just left you there in peace?

489
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:30,565
Yes.

490
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,317
She didn't blow your head off...

491
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,237
She didn't stick a giant piece of wood
in your ass. None of that, right?

492
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,573
She didn't do anything...

493
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,283
You know what, boss?

494
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,118
Maybe this kid is right!

495
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,038
And The Machine Gun Woman
fell in love with him.

496
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,625
She found him cute and
she let him go...

497
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,211
A woman that can kill
any asshole that crosses her.

498
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,048
Love at first sight!
That might be it, boss!

499
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,467
Love at first sight!

500
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,346
You think so?

501
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,850
No, this is impossible. You invented
all of this. Nobody believes you!

502
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,810
Tell us the truth...

503
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,938
or I'll blow your face away...

504
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,732
I swear to God I was trying.

505
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,400
Let my son go!

506
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,610
No, Mom!

507
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,575
He has a gun, Chago!
They have guns!

508
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,202
Please, be quiet!

509
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,789
You had her hidden!

510
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,333
She is a real kitten...

511
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,125
Shut up!

512
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,794
Silence, silence.

513
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,213
Shut your mouth, kid!

514
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,508
We're not going to do anything...

515
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,052
If you don't want me to
hurt your mom...

516
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,389
you have to bring me that
other bitch, alright?

517
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,516
You have 3 hours left, kid...

518
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:52,397
3 hours. If you don't deliver,
I will have fun with this little bitch.

519
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,816
Please, don't hurt her! Please!

520
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,275
Hurt her?

521
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,277
3 hours, asshole!

522
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,830
MISSION FAILED

523
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,429
See you later!

524
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,159
Where is my cousin?

525
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,076
Say hi first!

526
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,119
Where is she?

527
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,247
She is talking to a guy
in the back.

528
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,548
Tell me, bitch!

529
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,468
Where is she!

530
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,939
Where?

531
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,246
Shadeline! Shadeline!

532
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,124
Help her...

533
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,793
Where is she now?

534
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,169
They're going to kill her.

535
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,086
Where?!

536
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,798
She is going to... .. .

537
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,341
Where?!

538
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,717
Shadeline!

539
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,053
Damn it!

540
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,156
MISSION #06

541
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,033
"HUNTING MACHINE GUN WOMAN DOWN"
Attempt 2

542
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,478
What?

543
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,938
The heads...

544
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,858
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

545
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,458
Help me to kill Sausage...

546
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,921
I'll do anything...

547
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,881
Anything you want...

548
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,268
If you don't remove that bullet
I'll die right here...

549
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,567
That would work for you, right?

550
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,408
It's easier to turn me in if I'm dead.

551
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,829
I would do that...

552
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,380
But you're not like me.

553
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,430
You are thankful because
I saved your life...

554
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,765
right?

555
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,312
Have you ever removed a bullet before?

556
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,146
No...

557
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,737
There is a medicine kit in the back...

558
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,495
There is rubbing alcohol, bandages
and a pin...

559
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,048
I'm trying, I'm trying...

560
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,700
I got it, I got it!

561
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,918
Do you want to check my oil?

562
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,470
I'm not going to untie you.

563
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,181
You don't have to do it...

564
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,776
I was the one who played
your song at the Tango Club...

565
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,447
My song?

566
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,664
"The Falling Star, No Time For Love"

567
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:27,257
I played it once and saw
that you liked it...

568
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,139
Then I played it every day.

569
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,726
To see you dance.

570
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,311
Help me.

571
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:46,443
Let's pretend you turn me in,
we go armed and then.

572
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,365
we trap them like rats.

573
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:58,997
Do you really believe you'll be
freed if you turn me in?

574
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:07,965
You know too much... Do you
really think he is going to let you go?

575
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,678
You know what's going to happen...

576
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,888
You are dead man walking...

577
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,474
even if you turn me in.

578
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,957
I'm going to untie the ropes...

579
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,461
when we arrive at the Tango Club...

580
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,590
That way, you'll be forced
to kill them all.

581
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,887
Sounds like a good deal to me.

582
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,431
MISSION #07

583
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,641
"KILL CHE SAUSAGE"

584
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,676
Is Don Che Sausage here?

585
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,764
Untie me!

586
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,057
Wait!

587
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,315
I can't believe you, DJ...

588
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,735
You brought that bitch
all the way here!

589
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,075
Be careful with my mom!

590
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,745
Give me the gun...

591
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,747
Tell her to put the gun down!

592
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,083
Tell her! Now!

593
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,756
You didn't tell me
they had your mom.

594
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,552
What are you waiting for, kiddo?

595
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,513
What part did you not
understand, asshole!

596
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:23,767
Tell her to put the gun down or do you
want me to blow her brains out?

597
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,811
Put the gun down, I said!

598
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,150
Drop the gun.

599
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,281
Drop the gun, please.
I don't have any other option!

600
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,956
Kill her, asshole!
Kill her now!

601
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,209
Drop it...

602
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,572
Well done... well done...

603
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,241
That's how I like it...

604
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,078
Let my mom go.

605
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,997
"Let my mom go"

606
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,458
What did this asshole say?

607
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,919
"Let my mom go"

608
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:37,132
Your mom likes Sausage,
did you know that?

609
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,886
Get over there!

610
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:49,019
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

611
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,566
MISSION FAILED

612
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,235
Look, mom! You'll be staying here
for a couple of days.

613
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,028
Be careful!

614
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,155
Hurry up!
They can see you!

615
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,049
Shit...

616
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,476
FINAL MISSION:

617
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:40,190
"KILL CHE SAUSAGE +
RESCUE MACHINE GUN WOMAN"

618
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,427
He is here!

619
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,337
Get out of here, bro!

620
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,048
You are fucking crazy, man!
What are you doing?!

621
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,867
What?

622
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:19,789
Don't tell me that this
little bitch moved its little tail...

623
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,418
And you fell in love.

624
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,378
Let her go, asshole!

625
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,505
Wow! How tough...

626
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,050
"Let her go", "Let her go"

627
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,887
There is a difference between
having balls...

628
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:38,433
and having the most idiotic asshole
that has entered my place!

629
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:41,102
This is suicidal for you...

630
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,022
Did you know that? A suicide?

631
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,108
In case I don't kill you,
she'll end up doing it.

632
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,777
I'd rather get killed by her.

633
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,987
Well, I'm not going to allow that...

634
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,586
Untie me...

635
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,726
Wait! Don't! Don't!

636
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,481
Let the cops get him and die in jail.

637
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,442
Why?

638
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,073
You're not like this...

639
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,161
I know you are not like this...

640
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,415
I'm seeing it right now...

641
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,419
Let's go away together...

642
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,594
I could go away with you.

643
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,097
With you and your Mommy.

644
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,517
But you'll have to accept my habits...

645
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,657
And get used to my temper.

646
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,624
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

647
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,251
Let's go!
