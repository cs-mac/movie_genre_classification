1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,632
- Chow time!
- It's time!

2
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,598
Floyd, step up to the door. Dinner time.

3
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,636
Only my friends call me Floyd.

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,120
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
What's that?

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,836
- That is called loaf.
- Loaf.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,195
It's got a little bit of pasghetti
in there.

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,759
Toenails.

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Rat shit.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,636
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,496
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,555
Yeah.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,074
One day,

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,913
somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,392
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the Holy Ghost.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,080
Man, you just threatened a staff member.

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,830
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you have.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,035
Do something.

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,033
Let's have some fun.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,678
Open the goddamn gate!

21
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,876
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,875
Sector C! Pull your heads outta your ass!
Boss is on deck!

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Open!

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,136
Bravo 14, open perimeter fence.

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,376
Stay back!

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,868
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,556
You gonna come down from there or what?

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,755
Look at you.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
You know the rules, hotness.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,633
You gotta keep off these bars.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,677
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,391
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,953
You are really
in bad shape upstairs, lady!

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
Gonna come in here and tell me that?

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,352
Or are you too scared?

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,393
Come on, I'm bored.

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,238
I'm bored. Play with me.

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,640
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,512
No one's gonna play with you.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
You sleep on the ground.

41
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,554
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,599
Oh, man. I love you.

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,759
Alpha One, hit her.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,271
Come on, man. You're
six foot four. She's a tiny little girl.

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,176
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,839
We got chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,310
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
Ahh!

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Spring break!

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Whoo.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,070
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,752
The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,515
And then it changed again when he didn't.

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,311
And that is why I'm here.

55
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,553
We lose a national hero,

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
but you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,872
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,709
It's taken some work.

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,910
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,875
There's rumors, Amanda,
that some of them have abilities.

61
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,397
Well, the rumors are right.

62
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,034
You know what the problem
with a metahuman is?

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,269
The human part.

64
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,677
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,034
The next Superman might not.

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,838
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,036
I'm fighting fire with fire.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,416
You're not going to pitch us that

69
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,398
Task Force X project
of yours again, are you?

70
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Yes.

71
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,360
But this time, you're gonna listen.

72
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,278
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,960
He's the most wanted hitman in the world.

74
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,113
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

75
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,589
- What?
- Hey, Angelo.

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,877
This is the exterminator
you called for your rat problem.

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,712
My account's looking a little thin.

78
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,595
No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.

79
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,751
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,158
Whoa. Here's your boy right now.

81
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,915
With about 20 of his new best friends.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,518
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,029
Listen, stop being cute and do your job!

84
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,896
They're taking him
outta the car now.

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,957
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,032
Okay. Okay, okay. Relax.
There was an accounting error.

87
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,799
We sent it.

88
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,554
Now double it for being a dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

89
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,551
We're not the kind of people
you play with.

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,517
Did you just... Did you threaten me?

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,600
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,789
You son of a bitch.

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,116
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,909
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

95
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,072
His is an 11-year-old honor student
in Gotham City.

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
His daughter.

97
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,115
So we watched her and waited.

98
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,912
You should talk to Mama more.

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,829
Yeah, yeah, I know.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,797
Mama stays in bed a lot.

101
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,110
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

102
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,511
Dad, it's okay. I can take care of her.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,477
I know how to make pancakes now.

104
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,517
Hey, babe, that's beautiful.

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,511
Um, she's supposed to be
taking care of you.

106
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,520
You know, that's how
that's supposed to work.

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,517
I want you to come live with me.

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,119
All right? I came into some resources.
I'mma get us a spot.

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,032
It's gonna be nice, all right?

110
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,476
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.

111
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,038
That's not true.
That's a lie. She's lying to you.

112
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,272
Daddy... I know you do bad things.

113
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,270
Don't worry, I still love you.

114
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,549
Come on.

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,757
- And you caught him?
- Not me.

116
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,077
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham City.

117
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,357
I'mma figure this out. All right?

118
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,320
It's over, Deadshot.

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,640
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.

120
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,950
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

121
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,750
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

122
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,069
Please.

123
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't do it.

124
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
All right.

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,473
Love you, Daddy.

126
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,790
So now we have the man who never misses.

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Where'd you put him?

128
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,480
Let's just say, I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,035
Harley Quinn.

130
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,556
Before she ran off
and joined the circus,

131
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,154
she was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

132
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,595
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.

133
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,632
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

134
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,717
Dr. Quinzel.

135
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,240
You know,
I live for these moments with you.

136
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,670
- What do you got?
- I got you a kitty.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,149
So thoughtful.

138
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,596
She thought she was curing him,
but she was falling in love.

139
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,279
There is something
you could do for me, doctor.

140
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Anything. I mean, yeah.

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,876
I need a machine gun.

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,195
A machine gun?

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,074
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

144
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,588
Get off me.

145
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Shh!

146
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,910
What do we have here?

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,828
I did everything you said. I helped you.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ah.

149
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,358
You helped me.

150
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,994
By erasing my mind?

151
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,755
What few faded memories I had.

152
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,875
No.

153
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,553
You left me in a black hole
of rage and confusion.

154
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,110
Is that the medicine
you practice, Dr. Quinzel?

155
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,236
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

156
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,719
What?

157
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,912
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

158
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,637
I'm just gonna hurt ya

159
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,992
really, really bad.

160
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
You think so?

161
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,751
Well, I can take it.

162
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,639
I wouldn't want you to break
those perfect porcelain-capped teeth

163
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,633
when the juice hits your brain.

164
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,717
They became the king
and queen of Gotham City.

165
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,872
And God help anyone
who disrespected the queen.

166
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,039
We finally meet.

167
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,456
Nah, he don't shake hands.

168
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,948
But sit down and have a drink.

169
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,875
Hey, J.

170
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,396
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

171
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,120
I wanted to come by
and personally say thank you.

172
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,874
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

173
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,635
Are you sweet talking me?

174
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,551
I love this guy.

175
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,470
He's so intense!

176
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,637
Mmm. You're a lucky man.

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,837
You got a bad bitch.

178
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,958
Oh, that she is.

179
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,516
The fire in my loins.

180
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,152
The itch in my crotch.

181
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,189
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

182
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,116
Oh, come to Daddy.

183
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,478
Puddin'!

184
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,275
Listen,

185
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,632
you are my gift
to this handsome hunka hunka!

186
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
You belong to him now.

187
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,839
Well...

188
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,313
You're cute.

189
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,079
You want me?

190
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,833
I'm all yours.

191
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I don't want no beef.

192
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,034
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

193
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,270
Why, what's wrong?
You don't like me?

194
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,112
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

195
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,508
This is your lady.

196
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,871
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

197
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,554
No.

198
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,434
That's your lady, Joker.

199
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
That's right.

200
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,869
Yo, J.

201
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,120
And that was just the beginning.

202
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,711
Come on, Puddin'. Do it!

203
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,353
We have got company.

205
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,670
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

206
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,952
She's crazier than him.

207
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,917
And more fearless.

208
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,393
Stupid Bat, you're ruining date night!

209
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,195
Puddin'.

210
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,591
Puddin', I can't swim!

211
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,078
But the Bat got her, too.
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.

212
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,993
And then there's the Aussie.

213
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,153
Digger Harkness.

214
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,153
Or as the tabloids call him,
Captain Boomerang.

215
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,319
We're gonna be rich.

216
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,794
Yeah, you and me, mate.

217
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,359
Go and get the car.

218
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,790
He robbed every bank
in Australia at least once.

219
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,077
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.

220
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,038
Doesn't work well with others.

221
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,792
No honor among thieves, eh?

222
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,832
But he tangled with a metahuman
and lived to tell about it.

223
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,717
And have you heard of
the pyrokinetic homeboy?

224
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,953
How'd you catch him?

225
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,678
We didn't. He surrendered.

226
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,229
Chato Santana.
On the streets they call him El Diablo.

227
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,914
This LA gangbanger thought
he was king of the world...

228
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,559
...until he lost his queen.

229
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,797
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

230
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,076
The security video is incredible.

231
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,709
Oh, Jesus. The hell is that?

232
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,518
His name is Waylon Jones.

233
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,793
Evolution took a step
backwards with this one.

234
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,151
Yo, K.C., it's supper.

235
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,992
Go ahead, open that up, B.

236
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,440
Got something
real nice for you today, boy.

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,036
Hey, boss,
it true he chewed a dude's hand off?

238
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,633
Look at that, right there.
Vulcanized rubber.

239
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,233
Give me that, Smitty.

240
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,549
Where you at?

241
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,073
Don't make me get you.

242
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,431
They call him Killer Croc.

243
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,080
Here you are! You hungry?

244
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,272
You want some food?
Go ahead, feed the man.

245
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,552
What are you in the mood for tonight?

246
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,396
I got a double cheeseburger,
onion rings, a little coleslaw.

247
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,189
Or a giant skinless goat.

248
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,193
He looked like a monster.

249
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,236
So they treated him like a monster.

250
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,348
Then he became a monster.

251
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,551
He was chased out of Gotham by the Bat.

252
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,314
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

253
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,879
He never found it.

254
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,309
I saved the best for last.

255
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,596
- The witch.
- A witch?

256
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,031
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

257
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,033
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

258
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,833
Archeologist Dr. June Moone,

259
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,071
wandered into the wrong cave.

260
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,639
June...

261
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,880
She opened something she shouldn't have...

262
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,630
...releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

263
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,068
The Enchantress.

264
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,076
She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.

265
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,869
And where is this witch?

266
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,913
In my pocket.

267
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,230
Now tell him
why she won't turn you into a frog.

268
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,273
Some say the witch
has a secret buried heart,

269
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,908
and whoever finds it
can control the witch.

270
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
So we searched the cave
where she turned up

271
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,518
and we found her heart.

272
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,479
That thing's her heart?

273
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,711
Mmm-hmm. She's vulnerable without it.

274
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,474
You want to put our national security
in the hands of

275
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,837
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

276
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,416
Don't forget about The Joker's girlfriend.

277
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,555
These are villains, Amanda.

278
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,671
What makes you think you can control them?

279
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,800
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interest

280
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,076
for the national security
of the United States

281
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,912
is what I do for a living.

282
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,914
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced,

283
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,195
Colonel Rick Flag.

284
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,433
Help me.

285
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone,

286
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,238
and just as I hoped, it got personal.

287
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,512
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

288
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,278
I have the witch's heart.

289
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,271
And Dr. Moone has his.

290
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,718
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

291
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,590
In a world of flying men and monsters,

292
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,797
this is the only way
to protect our country.

293
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,035
What if Superman had decided to fly down,

294
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,997
rip off the roof of the White House

295
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,840
and grab the President
of the United States

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,160
right out of the Oval Office?

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,433
Who would've stopped him?

298
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,592
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea,

299
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,030
anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.

300
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,876
But what happens if the next Superman
becomes a terrorist?

301
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,116
Amanda Waller has a plan. Amanda?

302
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,589
I wanna build a team
of some very bad people

303
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,398
who I think can do some good.

304
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,028
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

305
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,679
Not on my watch.

306
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,276
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

307
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,715
General, we run them
covertly, non-attributed.

308
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,359
Strictly need to know.

309
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,670
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.

310
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,436
The next war will be fought
with these metahumans.

311
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,591
Ours, or theirs.

312
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,149
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

313
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,390
You know we can't control these people.

314
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,673
June, be strong.

315
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,029
Dr. Moone.

316
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,638
Enchantress.

317
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,117
Meet the Enchantress.

318
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,397
Everything we know about her
is in your briefing packs.

319
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,319
She's walked this earth
for a very long time

320
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,750
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

321
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,480
This meeting is now a magic show?

322
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,632
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

323
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,793
Go get it, girl.

324
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,433
How about a little something
from the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

325
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,593
We've been chasing these plans for years.

326
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,995
Uh, please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

327
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,116
Thank you. We'd like Dr. Moone back.

328
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,833
Enchantress.

329
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,478
Please. Please.

330
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,870
I'm sorry, I can't do that again.

331
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,598
Flag, get her out of here.

332
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,314
I move to, uh, authorize Amanda Waller
to establish Task Force X

333
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,038
under the ARGUS program.

334
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,673
All right.

335
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,877
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

336
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,833
I know you do bad things.

337
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,513
Don't worry, I still love you.

338
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,520
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

339
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,879
How you doing, man?

340
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,760
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.

341
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,592
Welcome, ma'am. How are you?

342
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,716
I'm here to assist you in any way.

343
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,719
Where are they?

344
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,151
Are you the Devil?

345
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,919
Maybe.

346
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,791
Ain't you scared?

347
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,069
Why'd they put you down here?

348
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,518
I asked.

349
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,119
Open that gate.

350
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,992
Yo, ese.

351
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,752
Hola, amigo.

352
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,115
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

353
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,233
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?

354
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Then come down here.

355
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,118
That ain't me.

356
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
That wasn't you?

357
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,637
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.
That guy's gone.

358
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,989
He's dead.

359
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,116
- And yet, here you are.
- Ma'am.

360
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,679
Let me try to talk to him.

361
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,670
You wanna die in here, buddy?

362
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,195
You got a real shot
at walking the block again.

363
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,153
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

364
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
A woman.

365
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,709
Look, man, you ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

366
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,359
Ask what?

367
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,512
I'm a man, okay? I ain't no weapon.

368
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,194
I'mma die in peace
before I raise my fists again.

369
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,471
I've caused enough harm.

370
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,080
All right, unlock him.

371
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,312
- What?
- You heard me.

372
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,708
You know what this man can do?

373
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,031
I'm here to find out. Lose the restraints.

374
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,394
Okay.

375
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,359
What is this? Uh, cheerleading tryouts?

376
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,872
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

377
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,713
They say you never missed a shot.
Prove it.

378
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Mmm-hmm.

379
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,751
Now you got one in the chamber.
What you gonna do with it?

380
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,514
Shit!

381
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,077
Give me the word, boss. I'll drop him.

382
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,434
Everybody calm down.

383
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,080
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

384
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,576
Tell them, "Put it down."

385
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Stand down.

386
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,553
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

387
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
What's for dinner?

388
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,239
Ames, if this man shoots me,

389
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,232
I want you to kill him

390
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,837
and I want you to go clear
my browser history.

391
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,915
See, uh,
the firing pin is filed down, right?

392
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,551
Mag full of dummy rounds.
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

393
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,358
You're absolutely right.

394
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,239
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

395
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,914
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

396
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,435
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

397
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,352
I've known you, like, nine months.

398
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,040
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.

399
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,358
What?

400
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Oops.

401
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,356
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

402
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,275
All right. Now you know
what you're buying.

403
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,671
Let me tell you the price.
First, I want out of here.

404
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,912
Second, I want full custody
of my daughter.

405
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,032
All right? And her mom can have, like,
supervised visits.

406
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,431
But her stank-ass boyfriend can't come.
Darnell can't come.

407
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,192
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

408
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,193
Third, y'all gonna pay
for my daughter's whole education.

409
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,033
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

410
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,713
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

411
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,677
- So Ivy League.
- Ivy League, yeah.

412
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,416
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

413
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,352
And, uh, if she can't cut it
and her grades start slipping,

414
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,080
I need you to white-people that thing.

415
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,336
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know how y'all do.

416
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,760
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, right? Okay.

417
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,154
Now that's my price.

418
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,511
But I'm concerned 'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

419
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,035
You're in no position to make any demands.

420
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,034
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

421
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,792
No, errand boy. I'm talking to your boss.

422
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,197
That's my price, sweetie.
You know what it is.

423
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,551
You notice these are criminals, hmm?

424
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,070
They're psychotic, antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

425
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,120
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you

426
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,176
a team of pipe hitters who'll
do anything you can dream up.

427
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,350
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

428
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,074
In World War Two,
the US Navy made a deal with the mafia

429
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,878
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

430
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,473
This ain't World War Two.

431
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,959
It's World War Three.

432
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,033
What are you really up to?

433
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,873
It's a "need to know", and all you need
to know is you work for me.

434
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,350
That can change with a phone call.
I have friends, too, you know.

435
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,312
There you go. Call.

436
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,960
But without you minding her,

437
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,994
your lady friend stays here strapped
to a board in a drug-induced coma.

438
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,112
They warned me about you.

439
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,075
My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.

440
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,153
Nobody does.

441
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,433
Where is she?

442
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,637
It's complex. This is not just her.

443
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,631
Everybody's disappearing.

444
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
There's this new law,

445
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,960
where if you're a bad enough bad guy,
they stamp "terrorist" on your jacket.

446
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,999
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.
A black site.

447
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,152
That's where she is.

448
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,238
So what are we doing?

449
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,958
Bring the car around.

450
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,790
We're going for a drive.

451
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,433
Lester, Lester!
Hit me one more time!

452
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,349
Come on, man!

453
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,080
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10 K.

454
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
- Hey!
- Ow!

455
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,349
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

456
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,670
Good job, man. He's killing it.

457
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,108
Come on, man. Why am I here?

458
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,236
All right, yeah, I'm down.
I get it, all right?

459
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,518
I've had a run of bad decks.
Not my fault. All right?

460
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,233
Dude, this is real.

461
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,392
I had to stop these guys from burning
down your house with your kids in it.

462
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,119
But you're lucky.

463
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,276
Maybe. Why do you think so?

464
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,992
Yo, slick. What's up?

465
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,231
Griggs. You are?

466
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,880
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

467
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,756
Can I go, man?
What the hell is going on, man?

468
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,279
This is crazy.

469
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,038
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.

470
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,316
Blah-blah, blah, blah.

471
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,479
All of that chitchat's gonna get ya hurt.

472
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,909
Oh! My God!

473
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Mmm.

474
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,078
I could tell you meant that.

475
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,158
Yeah.

476
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,430
You're gonna be my friend.

477
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,430
Enchantress.

478
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,315
- Log time of death. 1620.
- June?

479
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,200
Let's get her down to the morgue.

480
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,992
June? June?

481
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,315
June.

482
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,709
June.

483
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,073
What did you do?

484
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Shh.

485
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,069
Okay.

486
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,316
Plus, it could be the routing number.

487
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,350
Wanna go for drinks?

488
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,912
Enchantress.

489
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,952
God damn it!

490
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,315
June! June!

491
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,438
June, I'm sorry.

492
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,515
Shh.

493
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,918
She went somewhere.

494
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,791
If you have to choose between her or me,
stop her.

495
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,996
Promise me you'll stop her.

496
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,479
Even if it kills me.

497
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,673
Sir. Sir. You okay?

498
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,675
Can you breathe? Did you take anything?

499
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,354
This is 21.
Send medical to my location.

500
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,548
I'm a physician.

501
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,656
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.

502
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,910
No pulse. Starting compressions.

503
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,668
Sir.

504
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,519
Midway City is under attack.
It's a non-human entity.

505
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,040
I think you know what to do, sir.

506
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,077
Activate Task Force X

507
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,800
and get Amanda Waller
and her whole circus on scene ASAP.

508
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,995
Sir.

509
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,911
We're going live
with Task Force X. Pull 'em.

510
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,596
Prisoner,
get down on your knees, now!

511
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,176
Down on your knees!
Hands in the air! Turn around.

512
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,235
Hands up high!

513
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,879
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

514
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,917
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

515
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,076
Do not fire
that goddamn weapon!

516
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Damn it!

517
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,358
Open the gate!

518
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,112
Everybody, line up for extraction.

519
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,918
Let's go! Let's move, move.

520
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,790
Yeah. Open the door! Let's go!

521
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,555
Hit him!

522
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,200
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

523
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,835
Where you at?

524
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Whoa!

525
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,749
Is that the new guy?

526
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,760
What is that? What is that? Who are you?

527
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,576
- Stand by. Arming device.
- Who are you?

528
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,056
- I don't know who you are.
- Device armed.

529
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,833
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

530
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,032
Injection successful.

531
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,154
Location verified.

532
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,630
- Anybody who touches me is dead.
- Anybody who...

533
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,639
- Lady. Hey.
- Injection successful.

534
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,189
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

535
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Next!

536
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,915
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

537
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,629
Come on.

538
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,400
Shut up, and get it done.

539
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Whee!

540
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,360
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

541
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
It's from Mr. J.

542
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,296
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

543
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,276
You're so screwed.

544
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,635
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

545
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,155
Get off me! Get off me!
Harley, what do you mean by that?

546
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,592
Harley!

547
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,632
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss.

548
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,473
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

549
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,592
Hey, cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

550
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,318
Thank you. You're a good man.

551
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,353
Open up!

552
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,031
Just please, do whatever they say.

553
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,160
Do whatever they say. Just do it.

554
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,920
Hmm.

555
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,909
This looks neat.

556
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,756
Light it up!
Light it up! Light it up!

557
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,838
He's right above us.

558
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,792
This is a mistake. Rick, I can't do this.

559
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,399
- I can't...
- Listen, listen.

560
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,039
There's no other way.

561
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,278
Just get it done.

562
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,913
Just get it done.

563
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,434
Enchantress.

564
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,160
Flag, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

565
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,953
Amanda, she bolted.

566
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,473
Say it again?

567
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,153
She bolted!

568
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,915
Shit!

569
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,475
Go!

570
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,753
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

571
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,831
I thought this was contained!

572
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,998
This is the worst day of my life!

573
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,796
All evacuees
must report to a FEMA representative.

574
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,511
What's going on in that city?

575
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,718
Those assholes here yet?

576
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Yeah, they're here.

577
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,509
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

578
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,476
What the hell, Flag?

579
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,189
Unlock 'em.

580
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,680
Mmm!

581
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,550
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

582
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,199
How do you do?

583
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,349
Huh?

584
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,037
What was that?
I should kill everyone and escape?

585
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,433
Sorry. It's the voices.

586
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,076
I'm kidding! Jeez!

587
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,872
That's not what they really said.

588
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,553
What do we got here?

589
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,115
Twelve pounds of shit in a 10-pound sack.

590
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,230
Welcome to the party,
Captain Boomerang.

591
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,480
Hey, what's going on, man?

592
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Calm down.

593
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,916
Hey, one minute
I'm playing Mahjong with me nanna,

594
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,355
then this red streak hits me
outta nowhere.

595
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,080
Shut up! You were caught
robbing a diamond exchange.

596
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,434
I was not!

597
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,273
Here comes Slipknot,
the man who can climb anything. Wonderful.

598
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,112
Have a good time, scumbag.

599
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,799
Ooh.

600
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,715
Straighten up.

601
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,279
She had a mouth.

602
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,636
Listen up!

603
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,798
In your necks,

604
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,996
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

605
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,119
It's the size of a rice grain,
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

606
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,754
You disobey me, you die.

607
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,949
You try to escape, you die.

608
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,631
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?

609
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,549
You die.

610
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,598
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

611
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,795
Lady, shut up!

612
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,194
This is the deal.

613
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,631
You're going somewhere very bad,
to do something that'll get you killed.

614
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,319
But until that happens,

615
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,749
you're my problem.

616
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Mmm.

617
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,910
So was that like a, uh, pep talk?

618
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,308
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

619
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,714
There's your shit.

620
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,869
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

621
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,110
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

622
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,912
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

623
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,150
He's like the gold standard, okay?

624
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,999
Triangle, bitch. Study.

625
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,880
What?

626
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,640
Won't fit anymore?

627
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,078
Too much junk in the trunk?

628
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,074
Nah. Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.

629
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,240
And?

630
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,912
I like putting it on.

631
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,875
Goody.

632
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,277
Somethin' tells me
a whole lotta people are about to die!

633
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,839
Yeah. It's us.

634
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,240
We're being led to our deaths.

635
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,720
Speak for yourself, mate.

636
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,240
Hey, what's that crap on your face?
Does it wash off?

637
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,798
Hey, if you like a girl, can you light
her cigarette with your pinkie?

638
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,552
Because that would be real classy!

639
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,274
Hey, y'all might
wanna leave old boy alone.

640
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,716
He could torch this whole joint.
Ain't that right, ese?

641
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,953
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.
I'm cool, homie.

642
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,951
Behold the voice of God.

643
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,936
For those of you
who don't know me officially,

644
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,632
my name is Amanda Waller.

645
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,918
There's an active terrorist event
in Midway City.

646
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,432
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1, and get them to safety.

647
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,798
I'm sorry. Uh...

648
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,595
For those of us who don't
speak good guy, what is HVT-1?

649
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,680
The only person
that matters in the city,

650
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,472
the one person you can't kill.

651
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,359
Complete the mission,
you get time off your prison sentence.

652
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,272
Fail the mission, you die.

653
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,989
Anything happens to Colonel Flag,
I'll kill every single one of you.

654
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,678
Remember, I'm watching.

655
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,799
I see everything.

656
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,152
There's your pep talk.

657
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,671
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

658
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,669
So that's it?

659
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,718
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

660
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,348
I'll notify your next of kin.

661
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,195
Alpha, Bravo team. Mount up!

662
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,440
You're late.

663
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,154
This is Katana. She's got my back.

664
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,232
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke,

665
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,868
just like mowing the lawn.

666
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,991
I would advise not getting killed by her.

667
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,391
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

668
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,555
Harley Quinn. Nice to meet ya.

669
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,760
Love your perfume.

670
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,309
What is that? The stench of death?

671
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,120
Whoa! Easy, cowgirl.
Ain't that kind of a mission. Have a seat.

672
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,079
She seems nice.

673
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
Shh.

674
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
Hey.

675
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,280
Is he supposed to be green like that?

676
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Oh!

677
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,473
Party foul!

678
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,713
Not cool.

679
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,437
Ooh. Look at the pretty lights!

680
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,677
Are you guys seeing this?

681
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,040
What happened?

682
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,633
Terror attack.

683
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,031
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

684
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,156
You know, usual shit.

685
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,320
Right.

686
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,151
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

687
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,336
I don't know if they told you,

688
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,477
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

689
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,153
Anything for a dollar, right?

690
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,633
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

691
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,677
I'm a soldier!

692
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,673
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

693
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,152
When the shooting starts,
and it will, you'll cut and run.

694
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,198
Six-one is going down.

695
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,237
Six-one is going down hard.

696
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,238
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

697
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,151
Whoo! What a ride!

698
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,476
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

699
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,071
- Mind games.
- What's that?

700
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,276
All this bomb in the neck crap.

701
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,229
That ain't real, mate.

702
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,120
See, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?

703
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,795
But you look around, we're free, brah.

704
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,960
How do you know this?

705
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,270
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

706
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,438
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

707
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,591
Question is, are you coming?

708
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,676
Yeah. Smart!

709
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Hold your fire.

710
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,192
Sorry. It's what I do.

711
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,520
Damn it.

712
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,749
Now that's a killer app!

713
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,478
Okay. You wanna keep playing

714
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,256
the Hollywood Squares version
of "I'll Blow Your Freaking Head Off"?

715
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,280
Are you next?

716
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,434
You tripping, homie.

717
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,918
You next, Deadshot?

718
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,029
You just threatened me?

719
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,599
Oh, yeah.

720
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,313
He just threatened me.

721
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,439
Move.

722
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,198
You got a boyfriend?

723
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,518
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

724
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,816
Well, you better make it quick

725
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,560
'cause he's gonna kill
all of us one by one.

726
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,920
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady,
five or seven of these SEALs.

727
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,076
After that, I'm gonna need
some help. You down?

728
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,794
Always. What about the shit in our necks?

729
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,633
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

730
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,910
You're my friend, too.

731
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,517
Stay evil, doll face. Spread the word.

732
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
So...

733
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,150
I'm thinking if we move together,

734
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,118
we can kill all these guys
and go our separate ways.

735
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,674
- Yeah?
- Sounds good.

736
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,159
Spread the word.

737
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,799
Psst. Oi. Oi.

738
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,119
We need your help, man.

739
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,953
When the time's right,

740
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,673
you hit Flag with a fireball.

741
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,551
He'll be too busy burning to death
to have a go at us with his phone of doom.

742
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,120
Then what?

743
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,319
Then we get out of here.

744
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,789
And do what?

745
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,280
What are you,
bloody Socrates, with all the questions?

746
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,435
Freedom, man.

747
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,878
Freedom! You remember that, don't you?

748
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,760
We're criminals. You know that, right?

749
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,359
Yeah. It's great.

750
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,908
Come on, do the bastard.

751
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,589
Hey, be careful.

752
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,115
He eats people.

753
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,599
Sorry, Mother Superior, what?

754
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,718
He eats people for reals, homie.

755
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,920
He's a cannibal.

756
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,628
Oh.

757
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,075
No.

758
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,640
What did you say to him?

759
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,756
Nothing. Just having a laugh.

760
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,754
No worries.

761
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,160
I'm standing by for follow on tac team.

762
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,438
C2, what is the operational load
of the PLS?

763
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,039
Boss, we got people up here.

764
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,832
I'm on my way.

765
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Shit.

766
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,236
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.

767
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,158
Flag, get out of there.

768
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,669
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

769
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,558
Copy that.

770
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,994
We're diverting.

771
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,714
Bump out second squad two blocks east.

772
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,519
We'll pass through you, continue north.

773
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,216
Take Bravo two blocks east.

774
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,176
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

775
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Copy that.

776
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,832
Hey. I like these odds, mate.
You just say the word.

777
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah.

778
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,915
Come on.

779
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,360
Yeah, uh...

780
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,879
Hold that thought.

781
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,429
Rick, why do they look like that?

782
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,272
Just stay cool.

783
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,155
What the hell are they?

784
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,071
You cut and run, I'll blow your head off.

785
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
Hit them!

786
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,400
Huh.

787
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,080
Hey.

788
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
Ha!

789
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Get off me!

790
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,395
Get off me! Son of a...

791
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,115
Flag!

792
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,976
- Good riddance.
- Harley!

793
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,353
He dies, we die.

794
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,073
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

795
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,269
Backblast, clear!

796
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,715
Pinky.

797
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,916
That's how I cut and run.

798
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,193
Hey.

799
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,360
Hey, come on.

800
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,750
What? I saw it move.

801
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,154
See? It flinched. I think.

802
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,479
Hey, you were some help, princess.

803
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,914
It's better this way.

804
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,520
Trust me.

805
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,438
Oh, yeah, you're the fire bloke, eh?

806
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,795
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah. Hey.

807
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,269
Well, looky here.

808
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,998
Whoo! It's fire.

809
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,240
Whoo!

810
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,236
The brief said terrorists.

811
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,976
You wanna start explaining this?

812
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,680
If I told you, would you believe me?

813
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,718
- What are they?
- I don't know.

814
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,359
That's bullshit.

815
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,349
Thing has on a $3,000 watch.

816
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,119
Is that a person?

817
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,760
It was.

818
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,999
Now it's not.

819
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,355
Hey, don't!

820
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,194
What?

821
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,634
We got a job to do.

822
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
We're moving.

823
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,831
Get your boys moving.

824
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,673
Let's go.

825
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,396
Waller,
we're moving on the objective.

826
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,136
We lost contact with Bravo.
You got a visual?

827
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,195
Stand by.

828
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,669
- Anything on the other squad?
- No, ma'am.

829
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,195
Go-7, I need your sensors
on those coordinates.

830
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,360
Flag, it's a negative.

831
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,478
They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.

832
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,429
Seriously?

833
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,909
The hell is wrong with you people?

834
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,078
We're bad guys. It's what we do.

835
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,231
Hey, Deadshot. I've been thinking.

836
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,597
If we don't come together,
no one's walking out of here alive.

837
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,275
Hmm.

838
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,674
And?

839
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,236
These people respect you.
You got influence.

840
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,117
All right. What's your play right now?

841
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,793
You're a man of your word, right?

842
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,114
I want my mission.

843
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,431
You want your life and your kid back.

844
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,230
You help me keep this Mardi Gras parade
in line and I'll hook you up.

845
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,076
Waller is the puppet master.

846
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,000
You ain't got shit to hook me up with.

847
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,798
I got plenty of my own strings to pull.

848
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,856
You just get them
to the top of that target building

849
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,791
and get my rescuee
on that extraction helo.

850
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,936
And you're gonna make sure I get paid?

851
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,109
And you get paid.

852
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,960
You get paid,
and you get your fresh start.

853
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,200
Take a knee.

854
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,560
Our body's at the top of that building.

855
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,999
We get up there,

856
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,920
pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.

857
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,752
Helos extract us off the roof.

858
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,518
- It's Miller time.
- Check.

859
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,915
Flag, who's up there?

860
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,296
That's none of your concern.

861
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,216
- Do you know who's up there?
- No.

862
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,468
Is it the President?

863
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,840
It's not the President.

864
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,154
Argh!

865
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,349
Oh, you!

866
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,476
You're not leaving me.
You're not leaving me!

867
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,875
You're a pain in the ass.

868
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,115
I have done everything you said.

869
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,511
Every test, every trial, every initiation.

870
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,478
I have proved I love you. Just accept it.

871
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,153
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

872
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,399
I am not someone who is loved.

873
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,829
I'm an idea.

874
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,230
A state of mind.

875
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,995
I execute my will according to my plan.

876
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,118
And you, Doctor...

877
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,096
Are not part of my plan.

878
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,749
Just let me in. I promise...
Let me in! I promise I won't hurt you.

879
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,239
A promise-promise?

880
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,833
Hey, dickface!

881
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,755
Mind screaming at your bitch
somewhere else?

882
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,114
I was gonna say,
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."

883
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,753
Don't hurt me.

884
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,435
I'll be your friend.

885
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,040
Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

886
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,755
My heart scares you, and a gun doesn't?

887
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,989
Do it!

888
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,955
If you weren't so crazy,
I'd think you were insane.

889
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,830
Go away.

890
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,758
Harley, you coming?

891
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,472
Why do you eat people?

892
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,795
Gives me their power.

893
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,755
Would you like to eat me?

894
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,868
Hell, no.

895
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,309
Aw, why not?

896
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,791
I don't want your crazy.

897
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,636
Says the guy who lives in a sewer.

898
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,831
At least I know it's a sewer.

899
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,278
Oh, I get it.

900
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,830
'Cause like, this is a sewer, too,

901
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,310
only with
nice shops and restaurants, right?

902
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,994
- Mmm.
- You hate mankind much?

903
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,669
Let me guess.

904
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,355
Mommy didn't take you to Chuck E. Cheese
on your sixth birthday.

905
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,240
I can recommend a good therapist.

906
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,960
Why?

907
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,553
Because I'm bored.

908
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,759
I need a victim,
a mind to pry apart and spit in.

909
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,195
Leave it, mate.
She's a rabbit hole. Don't fall in.

910
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,197
And here's one now.

911
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,750
Japanese, female.

912
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,152
Mid-20s, 5'5", good health, athletic.

913
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,873
And...

914
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,959
An only child.

915
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,752
With deep-seated father issues.

916
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,874
Daddy wanted a son,
so she has to hide behind a mask.

917
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,597
I am not

918
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,194
hiding.

919
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,193
Now, that was gangster.

920
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,029
Harley.

921
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,056
Why don't you
stop acting like a drunken stripper?

922
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,040
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on, then?

923
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,080
'Cause...

924
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,475
I smell a rat.

925
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,476
If they don't blow our heads off,

926
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,711
we'll have to
fight our way out of this city.

927
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,069
I need you to
play nice with the other children.

928
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,352
And quietly return to my cage.

929
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,559
Sure, okay.

930
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,437
Hey, that's okay, sellout.
I get it. I get it.

931
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,870
I know how the world works, okay?

932
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,596
And when it comes to the heart,

933
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,478
everyone for themselves, right?

934
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,355
Waller?

935
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,073
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.

936
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,680
What do you say we get this over with?

937
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,155
What the hell? Deadshot. Fall back.

938
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,833
You mind if we tag along?

939
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,436
Whoo! Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

940
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,676
Be a walk in the park.

941
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,432
Easy peasy.

942
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,312
Don't make me shoot you.

943
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,353
God damn it. Harley!

944
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,149
Go, go, go, go!

945
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,355
Hey, guys!

946
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,239
Come on. Let's go.

947
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,070
Ma'am. I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.

948
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,031
- Flag, they're all around you.
- Hold.

949
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,191
Use extreme caution.

950
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,439
I don't like this, Flag.

951
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,798
I don't like it either.

952
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,280
Pussy.

953
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,556
I will knock your ass out.

954
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,073
I do not care that you're a girl.

955
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,119
They're after Flag again.

956
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,758
Son of a bitch. Get off me.

957
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,992
Circle up. Circle around him.

958
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,750
- Let me fight!
- You die, we die.

959
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,831
Clear! Everyone move out!

960
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,176
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

961
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,953
You know what? You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

962
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,240
Don't touch me, man!

963
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,656
Don't touch you? What you gonna do?

964
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,656
- Don't touch me!
- I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

965
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,520
- Do something. Do something!
- Don't touch me!

966
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,136
- You wanna see something?
- Oh, yeah, I wanna see...

967
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,360
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something.

968
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,151
I was just trying to get you there.

969
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,879
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

970
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,879
I knew you'd come through.

971
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,913
That shit crazy.

972
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,234
Clear.

973
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,596
I gotta work on my cardio.

974
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,272
Question.

975
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,398
Would you die for me?

976
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,640
Yes.

977
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,398
That's too easy.

978
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,879
Would you...

979
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,396
Would you live for me?

980
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,360
Mmm?

981
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,794
Yes.

982
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,118
Careful.

983
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,956
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

984
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,157
Desire becomes surrender.
Surrender becomes power.

985
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,388
Do you want this?

986
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,720
I do.

987
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,273
Say it.

988
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,159
Say it. Say it.

989
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,834
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

990
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,115
Please.

991
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,838
Aw! God, you're so...

992
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,475
Good.

993
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,718
Whoa!

994
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,752
Relax. Just me.

995
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,512
You ever been in love?

996
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,558
Nah. Never.

997
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,034
Bullshit.

998
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,031
You don't kill as many people
as I've killed

999
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,829
and still sleep like a kitten
if you feel shit like love.

1000
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,357
Another textbook sociopath.

1001
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,869
Clear.

1002
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,274
All right, secure the roof.

1003
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,000
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

1004
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,235
Going to the roof.

1005
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,672
Oh. Wait here.

1006
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,320
Please.

1007
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,080
I don't wanna give this dude
a heart attack. Okay?

1008
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,957
Aw, he's embarrassed of us!

1009
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,348
Hey, Flag.

1010
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,829
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

1011
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,190
You ready? Let's go.

1012
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,110
You wouldn't have made it without them.

1013
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,317
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

1014
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,835
Admit it, Rick. I was right.

1015
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,639
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.
Why'd you stay?

1016
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,552
I was studying your girlfriend.

1017
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,395
She takes an average person,
a yoga mom, an elderly retiree,

1018
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,480
and she turns them into a soldier
who can take a headshot and still fight.

1019
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,798
It's an instant army.

1020
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,028
How'd she do it, Flag?

1021
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,230
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

1022
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,832
I'll accept the consequences.

1023
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,396
I am your consequence.

1024
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,160
You might need to be careful.

1025
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,750
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

1026
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,433
I can take care of myself.

1027
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,800
Shut it down, wipe the drives.

1028
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,440
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

1029
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,200
Uh, hey, man. I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped

1030
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,874
in your temple of soldierly
self-righteousness,

1031
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,476
but a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

1032
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,517
Oh, says the guy
who shoots people for money.

1033
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,880
My cards is on the table, man.

1034
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,439
It got done, didn't it?

1035
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:46,592
Damn. That is just a mean lady.

1036
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,232
Yeah. You get used to it.

1037
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,031
And I'm the bad guy?

1038
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,519
That's gangsta.

1039
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,715
What?

1040
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,760
They weren't cleared for any of this.
Any of it.

1041
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,832
Hey, I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

1042
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,554
No way.

1043
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,232
Let's go home.

1044
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,958
Yeah, let's go home.

1045
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,792
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home? Hmm?

1046
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,951
Or you wanna go back to prison?

1047
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,599
I'm not going back to prison.

1048
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,513
What I'm saying is we kill the pair of 'em
now before they kill us.

1049
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,757
I got this.

1050
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,551
You all made it this far.

1051
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,558
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.

1052
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,798
I like her.

1053
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,715
Savior One-Zero,
this is Ground Element.

1054
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,113
Savior One-Zero, how copy?

1055
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,595
Savior One-Zero, the LZ's clear.

1056
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,680
Boss, they're not talking to me.

1057
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,915
Our bird's been jacked.

1058
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,720
Light it up!

1059
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,877
What? I got a hickey or something?

1060
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,031
Professor,
could you pick up the pace?

1061
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,395
Harley!

1062
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,034
Hello, baby.

1063
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,480
Kill her!

1064
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,231
Her nanite's disarmed!

1065
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,914
Come on, baby.

1066
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,515
Deadshot,

1067
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,391
shoot that woman right now!

1068
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,437
She ain't do shit to me.

1069
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,670
You're a hitman, right?

1070
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,068
I got a contract.

1071
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:09,119
Kill Harley Quinn.
Do it for your freedom and your kid.

1072
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,912
Now she dead.

1073
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,669
I missed.

1074
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,600
Good one, mate.

1075
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,879
It's Waller.

1076
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,470
Savior One-Zero's been hijacked.
Shoot it down.

1077
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,636
Roger that, ma'am. Going hot.

1078
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,915
Puddin'!

1079
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,956
You got all dressed up for me?

1080
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,628
Oh, you know I'd do anything for you.

1081
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,314
By the way,
I've got some grape soda on ice,

1082
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,754
and a bear skin rug waiting.

1083
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:31,960
Yeah?

1084
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,634
Boss, we got a problem!

1085
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,189
Huh?

1086
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,553
- This bird is baked.
- No.

1087
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,669
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

1088
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,068
Let's do it.

1089
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,159
Target destroyed, ma'am.

1090
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,356
Thank you. Now get me off this roof.

1091
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,918
Yes, ma'am. We are inbound.

1092
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,396
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

1093
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,954
You couldn't save her.

1094
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,919
Roger. I see ya.

1095
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,280
Watch your step, ma'am.

1096
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,518
Stand by. I'll send another helo!

1097
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,236
Waller's down.

1098
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,400
It's over.

1099
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,515
Ops just confirmed. She's down. 1 k west.

1100
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,758
Let's go get her.

1101
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,679
The mission's not over.

1102
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,037
Nah. It is for me. We had a deal.

1103
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,351
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1104
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,198
Hey, guys. I'm back!

1105
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,909
I missed you all so much.

1106
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,473
We're glad you could make it.

1107
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,231
Hey, craziness.

1108
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,949
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1109
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,314
Now tell me how to destroy your armies.

1110
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,397
Do your worst, bitch!

1111
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,960
So let me guess.

1112
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,152
We're going to
the swirling ring of trash in the sky.

1113
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,312
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?

1114
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,837
When does this end, Flag?

1115
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,553
Load up. We're in for a fight.

1116
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:31,956
You tell everybody everything.

1117
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,869
Or me and you gonna go right now.

1118
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,200
Three days ago,

1119
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,158
a non-human entity appeared
in the subway station.

1120
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,551
Waller, we're almost there.

1121
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,190
So Waller sent me and a woman
with incredible abilities.

1122
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,191
Enchantress.

1123
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,713
A witch.

1124
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,991
See, nobody could get near this thing,
but the witch could.

1125
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,308
Bomb's ready.

1126
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,078
Set for two seconds.

1127
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,760
You just press the button and drop it.

1128
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,632
Needless to say,
the whole thing was a bad idea.

1129
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,949
She bolted!

1130
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,599
Shit!

1131
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,233
And that's how she escaped from Waller.

1132
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,999
So now you know.

1133
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,311
You can just kill me right now,

1134
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,273
but I'm going to have a drink.

1135
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,279
Hey, Deadshot, I need your help.

1136
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,872
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1137
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,032
What ya having, K.C.?

1138
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,032
Bloody Mary, right?

1139
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,990
Drink dulls the mind.

1140
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,955
K.C., it's the end of the world.

1141
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,878
Have a drink with us.

1142
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:31,955
Beer.

1143
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,430
There he is. Give the man a beer.

1144
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,159
How about you, hot stuff?

1145
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,955
Water.

1146
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,798
That's a good idea, honey.

1147
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,515
Ninja?

1148
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,120
You want some sake?

1149
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,995
Whiskey.

1150
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,429
Whiskey.

1151
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,309
Okay.

1152
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:57,840
What am I, 12?

1153
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,991
Here's to honor among thieves.

1154
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,079
I'm not a thief.

1155
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:13,632
Oh. She's not a thief.

1156
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,672
I actually prefer to think of myself
as an asset relocation specialist.

1157
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,519
Mmm.

1158
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,349
Well, we almost pulled it off

1159
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,239
despite what everybody thought.

1160
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,310
We weren't picked to succeed.
You know that, right?

1161
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,839
We were all chosen to fail.

1162
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,433
Yeah, I know that.

1163
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,797
Worst part of it is, they're going to
blame us for the whole thing.

1164
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,595
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.

1165
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,792
We're the patsies.

1166
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,188
The cover-up.

1167
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,715
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

1168
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,794
So you gonna tell us now
what your "big deal" with Flag was?

1169
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,032
Same thing Waller offered me, to kill you.

1170
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,277
The chance to be a father.

1171
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,150
Chance at a life outside the shadows.

1172
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,673
I trusted Flag.

1173
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,356
Flag had you
chasing a carrot on a stick, homie.

1174
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,880
You don't... You don't know that?

1175
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,549
I love this guy.

1176
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,148
You played yourself, dawg.

1177
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,198
Bitch, I'm having a drink.

1178
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,228
I'm breathing fresh air.

1179
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,794
And, uh,

1180
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,110
for two sweet seconds...

1181
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,878
I had hope.

1182
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,112
You had hope, huh?

1183
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,070
Hope don't stop
the wheel from turning, my brother.

1184
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,032
Hmm. You preaching?

1185
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,071
It's coming back around for you.

1186
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,273
How many people you killed, man?

1187
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,155
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1188
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,073
You ain't ever whacked down no women.

1189
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,719
No kids.

1190
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,832
I don't kill women or children.

1191
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,360
I do.

1192
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,434
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

1193
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,956
I kept it hidden
for most of my life, but...

1194
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,079
The older I got, the stronger it got.

1195
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,992
So I started using it.

1196
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,952
For business, you know.

1197
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,268
The more power on the street I got,
the more fire power I got.

1198
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,840
Like, that shit went hand in hand.

1199
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,440
You know? One was feeding the other.

1200
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,590
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1201
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,273
Except my old lady.

1202
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,229
You know, she used to, uh, pray for me.

1203
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,400
You're welcome.

1204
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,028
Even when I didn't want it.

1205
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,636
God didn't give me this.

1206
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,829
Why should he take it away?

1207
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,829
Hey.

1208
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,155
This is our home.

1209
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,800
You put that back where you found it.

1210
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,359
I'm taking my kids to Mom's.

1211
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,511
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

1212
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,911
See, when I get mad, I lose control.
You know, I just...

1213
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,200
I don't know what I do...

1214
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,838
...till it's done.

1215
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,793
And the kids?

1216
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,553
He killed them.

1217
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,953
Didn't you?

1218
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,752
Own that shit.

1219
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,720
Own it!

1220
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,394
What'd you think was gonna happen? Huh?

1221
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,232
Hey, Harley. Come on.

1222
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,118
What, you were just...

1223
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,872
Thinking you can have a happy family

1224
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,793
and coach little leagues,
and make car payments?

1225
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,678
Normal's a setting on the dryer.

1226
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,314
People like us, we don't get normal!

1227
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,675
Why is it always a knife fight

1228
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,559
every single time you open your mouth?

1229
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,595
You know, outside you're amazing.

1230
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,879
But inside, you're ugly.

1231
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,792
We all are.

1232
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,270
We all are! Except for him.

1233
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,958
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1234
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,230
Not me, shorty.

1235
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,111
I'm beautiful.

1236
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:46,875
Yeah, you are.

1237
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,353
We don't want you here.

1238
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:09,794
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1239
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,348
Yeah.

1240
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,473
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

1241
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:23,030
Apparently, that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1242
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,078
'Cause, uh, the witch is scared of him.

1243
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,151
The only woman I ever cared about

1244
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:31,280
is trapped inside that monster.

1245
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,000
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.

1246
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,673
Everything is over.

1247
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,558
Everything.

1248
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,760
You're free to go.

1249
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,992
Your daughter writes you every day.

1250
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,037
Every single day.

1251
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,637
You had these the whole time?

1252
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,636
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?

1253
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,199
I'm gonna get you there.

1254
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,038
And you're gonna end this.

1255
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,509
I'm gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1256
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:42,116
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1257
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,910
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

1258
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:50,554
And my daughter is gonna know
that her daddy is not a piece of shit.

1259
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,753
I'll come.

1260
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,999
What?

1261
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,559
You got something better to do?

1262
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,233
Come on!

1263
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,429
Pussies.

1264
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,349
We think that thing's a weapon.

1265
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,629
Here. Lower.

1266
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,237
We gotta take out the big one.

1267
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,231
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1268
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:12,752
There's a flooded tunnel,
leads right underneath that building.

1269
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,351
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim in underneath that thing's feet.

1270
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,432
We get in its face and distract the hell
out of that son of a bitch

1271
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,960
so the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1272
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,751
That's how we take it out.

1273
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,152
I'm going with ya.

1274
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,433
We got this.

1275
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,636
I'm not asking, bro.

1276
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,355
I live underground.

1277
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,829
Y'all are just tourists.

1278
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,314
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1279
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,230
His soul's trapped inside of it.

1280
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,632
She talks to him.

1281
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,713
Hey, well,

1282
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,110
you know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1283
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,680
Huh?

1284
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,389
Let's do this.

1285
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:20,679
You must really love this girl.

1286
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:28,277
Man, I thought love was bullshit.
Dead serious.

1287
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,474
Desire, mutual benefit, whatever.

1288
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,958
I mean, I get that, but actual love?

1289
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,271
I rated that with UFOs.

1290
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,720
Lot of believers, no proof.

1291
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,878
And then I met June.

1292
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,472
Do what you gotta do.

1293
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,434
I got your back.

1294
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,080
You gonna fight with us?

1295
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,956
What if I lose control?

1296
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,076
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1297
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,520
Duck in.

1298
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:41,075
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff, right?

1299
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,038
Yeah. Why?

1300
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,077
I'm off my meds.

1301
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,240
So that's your old lady, huh?

1302
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:49,994
Yeah.

1303
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,037
Well, you need to handle
this shit, all right?

1304
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:55,875
Get up there, smack on her ass,
tell her, "Knock this shit off."

1305
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,190
I do not think that'd be wise.

1306
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,351
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

1307
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,994
My boys will detonate the bomb
underneath him.

1308
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,868
You know, we should get a drink sometime.

1309
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,678
I've been waiting for you all night.

1310
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,913
Step out of the shadows. I won't bite.

1311
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,675
Hmm.

1312
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,671
What the hell? Grab her.

1313
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,515
Why are you here?

1314
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,831
Because the soldier led you?

1315
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,558
And all for Waller.

1316
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,718
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1317
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:39,195
I am your ally.

1318
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,794
And I know what you want.

1319
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:44,838
Exactly what you want.

1320
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,118
Baby. Baby.

1321
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,799
Baby, it's just a nightmare.

1322
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,798
It's just a bad dream.

1323
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:36,634
I'm here.

1324
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,555
Miss me?

1325
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,390
I'll put the kids to sleep
and then maybe we can kick it?

1326
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,240
Yeah?

1327
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:08,239
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!

1328
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,032
He married me!

1329
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,999
It's not real.

1330
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:14,715
I killed the Bat.

1331
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,472
Nah, homie. You don't want that.

1332
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:18,718
What? I want that.

1333
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,440
She trying to play games with you, man.

1334
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,318
- It's not real!
- He's right.

1335
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,354
It's not real.

1336
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,588
How long have you been able to see?

1337
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,719
My whole life.

1338
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:34,792
You can't have them.

1339
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,234
These are my people right here.

1340
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,197
But it is our time.

1341
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:43,195
The sun is setting, and the magic rises.
The metahumans are a sign of change.

1342
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,952
Lady, you are evil!

1343
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:54,189
Oh, wow.

1344
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,589
Uh-oh.

1345
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,668
Who's this?

1346
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,191
- It's gonna be bad!
- We should run.

1347
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,798
GQ, come in. We're in position.

1348
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,760
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

1349
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,598
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1350
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,560
I lost one family.
I ain't gonna lose another one.

1351
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:47,919
Look, think it through.

1352
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:51,430
I got this.
Let me show you what I really am.

1353
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,120
Over here!

1354
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,840
Go!

1355
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,759
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1356
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,751
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1357
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,669
- Get him, mate!
- Come on.

1358
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:15,039
Yeah, do it!

1359
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,197
Diablo, get clear! Get outta there!

1360
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,793
Blow it!

1361
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,029
Blow it.

1362
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:38,234
- Now, GQ. Now.
- No!

1363
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,108
Everybody, down!

1364
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:20,229
You next.

1365
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,957
My spell is complete.

1366
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:28,908
Once you and your armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1367
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:32,516
And it will be mine to rule.

1368
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,677
That was our main satellite uplink.

1369
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,616
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?

1370
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,471
It's a secret facility.

1371
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,032
You got a move here, Flag?

1372
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:07,236
We gotta cut her heart out.

1373
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,640
While we're fighting,

1374
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,995
that thing's laying waste
to the whole damn world.

1375
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:50,514
Where is she?

1376
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,400
I don't know.

1377
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,160
Hey.

1378
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,748
Look out. Look out!

1379
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:29,600
Uh-oh.

1380
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,028
Sorry.

1381
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,239
Flag!

1382
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,834
Enough!

1383
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:23,039
Of all who have faced me,
you have earned mercy.

1384
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,077
For the last time,

1385
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,957
join me, or die.

1386
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:33,874
I'm not much of a joiner,

1387
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,076
but maybe we should.

1388
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,639
Hey!

1389
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,438
She's trying to take over the world.

1390
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,755
So?

1391
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:45,591
What's the world ever done for us, anyway?
It hates us.

1392
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,039
Hey, Harley!

1393
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:54,153
Hey, lady? Um...

1394
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,957
I lost my Puddin'.

1395
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:01,232
But you can get him back, right?

1396
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,310
I can, my dear.

1397
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:07,433
Anything you want.

1398
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,515
You promise?

1399
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,398
Yes, child.

1400
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:16,479
You need only bow

1401
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,636
and serve beneath my feet.

1402
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,795
I like what you're sellin', lady.

1403
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,956
There's just one teeny problem.

1404
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:35,600
You messed with my friends.

1405
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:43,910
Her heart's out! We can end this!

1406
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,156
Hey, Croc!

1407
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,188
Harley!

1408
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,030
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

1409
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,394
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1410
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:48,912
Daddy, I love you.

1411
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,796
Please, don't do this.

1412
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,000
That was a great shot, man.

1413
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,395
Hey, I don't do hugs. I'm not a hugger.

1414
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,199
I'm not a hugger. All right?

1415
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,309
Let me join my brother.

1416
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,514
Katana, no!

1417
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:10,754
Give me that.

1418
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:15,638
You bring June back. You bring her back.

1419
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,756
She's not coming back.

1420
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,559
I'll crush this. Do you hear me?

1421
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,597
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1422
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:23,988
Go ahead.

1423
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,797
You don't have the balls.

1424
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:20,915
Hey, Flag.

1425
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:31,589
June!

1426
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,832
She's gone.

1427
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,276
I thought I killed you.

1428
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,788
Y'all don't mind,

1429
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,599
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1430
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:55,274
Yeah, and I got some business to handle
back in Gotham.

1431
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,112
I'm going to hotwire a car. Need a ride?

1432
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:58,554
Your ass is not driving.

1433
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,755
Why not?

1434
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,317
How are you not dead?

1435
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,632
We just saved the world.

1436
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,317
A "thank you" would be nice.

1437
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:11,075
Thank you.

1438
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,075
You're welcome.

1439
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,000
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1440
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,674
Ten years off your prison sentences.

1441
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,833
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1442
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:27,639
That can be arranged.

1443
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,279
Any other requests?

1444
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,478
Ooh. An espresso machine.

1445
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,118
BET.

1446
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,439
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1447
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,352
Darling, I'm walking
out of here a free man

1448
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,351
or we're going
to start having some real fun.

1449
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,431
Why don't we have some fun?

1450
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,880
You're trying to figure out this length.

1451
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:58,989
That's the hypotenuse.

1452
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:00,991
So, you have to know this angle.

1453
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:05,392
Okay. So, if you're up here,
like in a building,

1454
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,677
and you shoot a man
down here on the street,

1455
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,956
that's how far the bullet actually goes?

1456
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,831
Yeah. That's right.

1457
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,656
You are so smart. Right.

1458
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:18,319
The hypotenuse. Good one. Um...

1459
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,000
So, that would make you
have to know the angle

1460
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,349
between the building and the sidewalk.

1461
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,033
You got to know that angle.

1462
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,919
No, I mean, in real life,
you have variables.

1463
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,360
You know, you got rifling twist.

1464
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,875
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1465
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,836
Some shots you'll even
have to take the curvature

1466
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,016
of the Earth in with the...

1467
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,040
It's time.

1468
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,754
...wind effect.

1469
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,150
You know, there's a lot of variables

1470
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:46,879
in the street.

1471
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,869
I gotta go.

1472
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,199
Are you coming back?

1473
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:56,755
Yeah.

1474
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:59,514
I'm working it out. All right?

1475
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:03,639
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go,

1476
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,234
without killing them all.

1477
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,549
Bring it in.

1478
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,074
I love you, Daddy.

1479
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:13,240
Hmm.

1480
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,114
I love you.

1481
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:44,595
Hey! Let me out!

1482
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,637
Let me out of here right now!

1483
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,758
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1484
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:52,551
Let me out of here, darling, please.

1485
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:54,096
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1486
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:57,430
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1487
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,993
Come on!

1488
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:55,473
Puddin'!

1489
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,472
Let's go home.

1490
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:26,269
This is crown jewels here,
Mr. Wayne.

1491
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,316
And you do understand my legal exposure.

1492
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:31,516
If anyone knew what I procured for you...

1493
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:34,877
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?

1494
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,268
What do you want?

1495
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,040
People are asking questions
about Midway City.

1496
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,880
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1497
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,997
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

1498
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,794
Consider yourself under my protection.

1499
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,234
If you deliver.

1500
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:05,999
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1501
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:09,918
Just like to make friends.

1502
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,696
That's the difference between us.

1503
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:15,029
You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.

1504
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,475
Good night.

1505
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:19,631
You look tired.

1506
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,916
You should stop working nights.

1507
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,873
You should shut it down,
or my friends and I'll do it for you.
