1
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:57,002
<i>The monk you sent
to find your wife is dead.</i>

2
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:00,281
<i>Did you hear?</i>

3
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,643
When I was nine years old..

4
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:32,323
<i>my father took me to the Merkit clan
to choose a bride.</i>

5
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,044
<i>He stole my mother from the Merkits..</i>

6
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:41,839
and they never forgot it.

7
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,399
<i>Now he needed peace..</i>

8
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:50,202
<i>so I had to take a Merkit bride.</i>

9
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:58,762
<i>I couldn't say no to my father.</i>

10
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:08,158
My friend Dai Sechen lives here.

11
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:10,795
<i>Let's stop here for a night!</i>

12
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,446
Welcome, my friend Esugei!

13
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,359
<i>Good to see you!</i>

14
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:40,240
<i>Your son got big!</i>

15
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:50,280
What's your name?

16
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,235
Temudgin.

17
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:55,160
It's me that should ask first.

18
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:00,755
<i>How old are you?</i>

19
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,080
Nine.

20
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:09,204
You're even younger than me!

21
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,245
By a lot?

22
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,720
By a whole year.

23
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:15,606
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

24
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,722
<i>I'm going to the Merkits
to choose a bride.</i>

25
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,998
<i>I'm here for the night.</i>

26
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,961
<i>Smart people choose our brides.</i>

27
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,205
Goodbye, Temudgin.

28
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,077
Wait!

29
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,636
What's your name?

30
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,082
Borte.

31
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,521
Temudgin!

32
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:41,680
<i>You should choose me!</i>

33
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:03,805
Let's fight, Targutai!

34
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:06,680
<i>I'm drunk, you can beat me.</i>

35
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:25,839
<i>You're not just a fool, you're weak!</i>

36
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:55,479
These mosquitoes are hungry!

37
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,322
<i>I want to look for a bride here.</i>

38
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:05,644
This clan's weak.

39
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,082
<i>People come here for brides.</i>

40
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:17,079
I must make peace with the Merkits.

41
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,362
<i>I want to practice.</i>

42
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:25,039
<i>You can't just practice.
They'll be offended.</i>

43
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:28,723
If they're weak,
let them be offended.

44
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:37,123
<i>Listen carefully to what I tell you.</i>

45
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:42,476
<i>Don't make a mistake
when you choose a bride.</i>

46
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:46,920
<i>Her face has to be flat like a salt lake.</i>

47
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,085
<i>Her eyes have to be narrow.</i>

48
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:55,962
<i>Evil spirits dive into big eyes..</i>

49
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:01,195
<i>and she will go mad..</i>

50
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:04,440
seeing things that aren't there.

51
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:09,680
<i>And most important:
Don't forget to look at her legs.</i>

52
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:14,716
<i>A woman has to have strong legs..
to make a man happy.</i>

53
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:16,556
Understand?

54
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,519
<i>I choose you.</i>

55
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,925
I agree.

56
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:53,999
I have chosen my bride.

57
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,676
<i>I'll give a sable coat for her.</i>

58
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:12,238
<i>Your son made a good choice, Esugei.</i>

59
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,239
<i>For sure he saved us time.</i>

60
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:19,797
We can ride back home now.

61
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,366
You're right!

62
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:25,281
<i>For my clan, it is a great honor.</i>

63
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:29,480
They can marry in five years.

64
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,202
<i>This is a wishbone from a white raven.</i>

65
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:39,883
Rub it and make your wish.

66
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,003
I'll be back in five years.

67
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:54,006
<i>Why didn't you listen to me?
You're stubborn.</i>

68
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:59,160
I saw her and I knew she's my wife.

69
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,045
<i>What will I say to the Merkits now?</i>

70
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:07,160
My head hurts thinking about it.
Merkits will never forget this offense.

71
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,885
We rode back home.

72
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,676
My father didn't talk.

73
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,238
<i>Finally he said to me:</i>

74
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:28,684
<i>"You did good.
A man has to choose his wife."</i>

75
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:36,040
<i>I didn't know that day..</i>

76
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:40,240
would change my life forever.

77
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:03,996
Scared?

78
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,122
Yes.

79
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,679
Thunder means..

80
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:13,717
<i>our God Tengri is angry.</i>

81
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,446
<i>All Mongols are afraid of it.</i>

82
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,355
Enemies.

83
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:45,686
<i>So what?</i>

84
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:49,124
<i>You can't spill blood by a rest place.</i>

85
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:13,725
<i>Accept this milk from my master.</i>

86
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,039
Thanks. Sit.

87
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,760
Thank you.

88
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:49,159
Esugei, let the servant drink it first.

89
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:51,916
<i>See how they're looking at us.</i>

90
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,238
They're our enemies.

91
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:00,284
But if I, Khan Esugei,
start breaking the customs..

92
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:04,924
the world will turn upside down.

93
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:35,042
<i>Are you sick, Esugei?</i>

94
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,237
Let's stop.

95
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,484
<i>Shut up! It's not for you to decide.</i>

96
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:07,119
They've poisoned our Khan!

97
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:17,720
<i>You little bastard!</i>

98
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:32,805
I'm leaving you, my son.

99
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:35,641
You'll be Khan now.

100
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:38,206
Be strong..

101
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:43,480
<i>and ask our Lord of the Blue Sky,
Great Tengri..</i>

102
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,044
<i>to help you.</i>

103
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,526
Take everything!

104
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,326
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

105
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:42,476
<i>That's the herd of your Khan!</i>

106
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:46,763
He protected you!

107
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,758
<i>Get away from there! Stop it!</i>

108
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,923
<i>You ungrateful piece of shit!</i>

109
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,602
<i>You're not afraid to steal, Targutai?</i>

110
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,724
<i>No! Khan Esugei is dead!</i>

111
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:16,445
<i>My son is Khan now! He'll avenge us!</i>

112
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,160
<i>You want me to kill him?</i>

113
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,366
Run! Quick!

114
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,482
Catch him!

115
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,316
Run!

116
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,558
<i>You have the devil in you!</i>

117
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,486
Targutai!

118
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:58,682
What's come over you?

119
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:09,564
Mongols don't kill children!

120
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,566
I curse you!

121
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,405
<i>Rot in hell!</i>

122
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,646
As Esugei said:

123
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,765
<i>Never break the customs,
even if you want to.</i>

124
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,278
When he grows up, I'll kill him.

125
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,837
<i>He will grow up soon.</i>

126
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,437
We'll come after him in the winter.

127
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,198
Someday..

128
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,316
<i>you'll have to kill him.</i>

129
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:18,564
But save yourself first.

130
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:32,003
<i>That winter I had no place to hide.</i>

131
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:42,125
<i>I went to the Sacred Mountain..</i>

132
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,804
<i>to ask our God Tengri to help me.</i>

133
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,998
<i>I was on my own.</i>

134
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:55,083
The mountain was far away.

135
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,520
<i>And I ran for my life.</i>

136
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,726
Hey!

137
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:08,835
I'm Jamukha.

138
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:10,766
What's your name?

139
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,521
My name is Temudgin.

140
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,436
<i>A Mongol has to be on a horse.</i>

141
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,003
<i>My enemy Targutai took all our horses.</i>

142
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:44,480
<i>Will you be my brother?</i>

143
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:25,157
Taichar, give me a rag.

144
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,363
<i>We're blood brothers now.</i>

145
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:42,085
<i>When I become Khan,
I'll make you my second-in-command.</i>

146
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:43,800
Jamukha..

147
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:48,241
I must kill my enemy Targutai first.

148
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:51,085
<i>How can you? You have no horse.</i>

149
00:20:58,247 --> 00:20:59,885
My bride has strong legs.

150
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:06,519
<i>Who cares about legs?</i>

151
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:14,000
My father said it makes a man happy.

152
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:18,762
<i>You need a horse more than a woman.</i>

153
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,325
Run!

154
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,040
Targutai!

155
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:46,201
<i>Tell people I don't want to be Khan.</i>

156
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,280
You're a dog.

157
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,927
<i>Nobody cares about you anymore.</i>

158
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,402
<i>Why do you still want to kill me?</i>

159
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,518
I'll sleep better.

160
00:22:58,007 --> 00:22:59,884
I'll kill you!

161
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,883
<i>I'll kill you first.</i>

162
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:06,600
Bastard!

163
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:32,125
<i>You need to be strong.</i>

164
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:36,765
Eat!

165
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:40,316
Drink.

166
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:52,164
<i>These flies.. suck your blood.</i>

167
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:57,600
Temudgin!

168
00:23:58,487 --> 00:23:59,920
Your family is safe.

169
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:02,280
Don't worry.

170
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,956
Jamukha! Find my bride.

171
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,119
<i>Tell her to wait for me.</i>

172
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,361
He's still short.

173
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,166
Feed him more!

174
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:24,758
When I get back, I want him grown.

175
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:51,606
<i>Great Tengri, Lord of the Blue Sky!</i>

176
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:56,044
<i>I bow before you.
Free me, Great Tengri!</i>

177
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:28,805
<i>No matter how far the wolf runs..</i>

178
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:34,082
he comes home one day.

179
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:57,599
Temudgin.

180
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,965
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

181
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:10,244
I'm Khan now.

182
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:14,645
I'm smarter than your father.

183
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:16,604
<i>He was a fool.</i>

184
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,437
<i>You call yourself Khan?</i>

185
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,806
Shit is always shit.

186
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:32,038
<i>I won't just kill you.
I'll kill you piece by piece.</i>

187
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:38,361
<i>You see the wooden donkey?</i>

188
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:42,876
<i>I'll nail you to it myself!</i>

189
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:47,285
<i>It takes a week to die!</i>

190
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:08,916
Come closer, old man.

191
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:17,842
<i>You scare me!</i>

192
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,765
If I don't die..

193
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:27,684
<i>I'll forgive all of you.</i>

194
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:32,318
<i>You won't forgive any of us.</i>

195
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:58,437
Come here.

196
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,242
Give me water.

197
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:05,326
<i>You idiot.</i>

198
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:06,318
Shut up!

199
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:12,683
<i>I'll show you who's an idiot.</i>

200
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:08,522
Don't move!

201
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:23,321
I'm Temudgin.

202
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:24,686
I'm Boorchu.

203
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:26,959
<i>Why are you helping me?</i>

204
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,680
<i>I know who you are.</i>

205
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:31,475
Take my horse.

206
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,123
I won't forget you, Boorchu.

207
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:08,406
Great Tengri watched over me
and I survived.

208
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:18,641
<i>I was ready to face my enemies
and take back what was mine.</i>

209
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:25,965
<i>But first I had
to find my bride, Borte.</i>

210
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,080
<i>I thought you were dead.</i>

211
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,600
I'm not.

212
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:43,567
<i>You know why I came.</i>

213
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:47,437
<i>You chose her years ago.</i>

214
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:52,283
I don't know..
if Borte still wants you.

215
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,958
My Temudgin came back.

216
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:13,356
Father..

217
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,639
<i>I have to go with Temudgin.</i>

218
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:25,042
Bring the sable coat. Quick!

219
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:03,595
<i>Don't you want to touch me, Temudgin?</i>

220
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,682
<i>My touch will break you in two.</i>

221
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:23,885
My son.. Temudgin.

222
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:38,959
I like you.

223
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:43,285
You're strong, like me.

224
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,638
<i>You're good.</i>

225
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:57,004
This is my dowry. Take it.

226
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:01,279
<i>For me..</i>

227
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:04,403
<i>It's too much.</i>

228
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,156
<i>This is for you.</i>

229
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:36,436
<i>Brother, when will you
put up your yurt?</i>

230
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:38,756
Tomorrow.

231
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:42,876
<i>It's good to have our brother back.</i>

232
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:45,561
And with such a beautiful wife.

233
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:13,119
I caught you.

234
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:14,959
Only because I let you.

235
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,479
<i>I'll make a good wife.</i>

236
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,123
I know.

237
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:31,246
Stay here!

238
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:33,640
0elun!

239
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,042
0elun!

240
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:41,283
0elun!

241
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,996
Chiledu?

242
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:47,597
<i>You remember my voice?</i>

243
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:51,605
A woman never forgets
her first husband!

244
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,838
<i>Get down! I want to see your face.</i>

245
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,279
<i>Why should I look at you, old woman?</i>

246
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,321
I want Temudgin's bride!

247
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,881
<i>Get out of here! Leave us alone!</i>

248
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,762
<i>They're not here! Go!</i>

249
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:09,277
Shut up!

250
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:30,679
Khasar, watch out!

251
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:38,157
Where are they? Speak!

252
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:40,924
I found their tracks.

253
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:43,281
<i>Let's go!</i>

254
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:55,204
<i>Temudgin, I waited so long for you.</i>

255
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:58,005
<i>I rubbed this wishbone so many times.</i>

256
00:38:58,047 --> 00:38:59,765
I had only one wish:

257
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,286
<i>That you would come back.</i>

258
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:09,718
<i>I always want to be with you, Temudgin.</i>

259
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:12,841
I promise.

260
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,316
Merkits.

261
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:04,126
<i>Go home!</i>

262
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:57,961
When Temudgin's father
stole my bride..

263
00:41:58,247 --> 00:42:00,477
I swore revenge.

264
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:03,167
You're mine now.

265
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:05,006
Take her!

266
00:42:18,487 --> 00:42:19,636
My son.

267
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:25,399
My brother.

268
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:34,077
<i>What did they do to you?</i>

269
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:01,762
<i>How are you, Jamukha, my brother!</i>

270
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,643
I'm glad you're alive, brother.

271
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:16,718
Accept my gift, brother.

272
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:44,167
When I heard that the Merkits
had stolen your wife..

273
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,797
<i>my liver began to ache.</i>

274
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,876
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

275
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:01,164
Mongols don't make war over a woman.

276
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:08,962
<i>I'll tell Taichar now
and he'll bring you two new wives.</i>

277
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,200
I want Borte back.

278
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:20,519
<i>Temudgin, have you
never tried another one?</i>

279
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:25,806
<i>And you think she's the only one
with strong legs?</i>

280
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:32,202
My time is short.

281
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:47,446
Say welcome.

282
00:44:52,727 --> 00:44:54,046
Taichar..

283
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:58,041
Merkits have offended my brother.

284
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:12,204
<i>How many warriors can you bring?</i>

285
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,164
I have my sword and some people.

286
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:19,836
<i>That's not enough, brother.</i>

287
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:22,676
<i>That's why I came to you.</i>

288
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:51,477
<i>I'll do it.</i>

289
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:57,200
Next year.

290
00:45:58,207 --> 00:46:00,243
<i>That's too late.</i>

291
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,796
Next year's better.

292
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,126
We wait.

293
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:20,206
<i>Don't tell anyone we went to war
over a woman.</i>

294
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:42,126
This is Merkit territory.

295
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,359
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

296
00:50:58,487 --> 00:51:01,285
<i>I knew you would come for me.</i>

297
00:51:05,807 --> 00:51:09,356
<i>Borte, I can't stay away from you.</i>

298
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:24,006
This is my son.

299
00:51:37,607 --> 00:51:39,245
I see.

300
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:26,602
<i>Are you happy
to have your wife back?</i>

301
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:36,316
I wouldn't sleep with such a woman.

302
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:42,245
You're brave.

303
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:49,086
Very brave!

304
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,724
<i>I want to thank you, brother.</i>

305
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:06,963
You'll stay with me now.

306
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:12,326
<i>I'm used to being my own master.</i>

307
00:53:15,087 --> 00:53:20,241
<i>You don't know Mongols.
You won't survive on your own.</i>

308
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:24,718
You'll be my second-in-command.

309
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:29,037
Temudgin, your people are waiting.

310
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,075
<i>- I have to go.
- Go.</i>

311
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:48,395
<i>Temudgin, I grabbed
the best sword for you.</i>

312
00:53:51,287 --> 00:53:53,446
<i>Jamukha took most of the plunder.</i>

313
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:55,961
<i>Tell us how to divide what's left.</i>

314
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:02,926
I'll take a tenth portion.

315
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,840
Divide the rest between the warriors.

316
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,765
<i>Don't forget the families
of the warriors who died.</i>

317
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:14,838
<i>- This is for you.
- Thank you, Temudgin.</i>

318
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:21,119
<i>Listen, everyone!
Temudgin is generous to us!</i>

319
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:28,835
Everyone gets their share!

320
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:38,840
<i>Look at him!
He gave away all his plunder.</i>

321
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:43,160
Next time he'll take it all.

322
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:46,279
<i>He's taking
a Merkit child into his yurt.</i>

323
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:49,685
<i>Don't speak ill of my brother.</i>

324
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:52,719
<i>What brother is he to you?
I'm your brother!</i>

325
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:21,236
<i>You can't cook
two ram heads in one pot..</i>

326
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:23,525
Temudgin.

327
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,326
Wake up!

328
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:48,798
My brother left me. He's stubborn!

329
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:57,358
Get up!

330
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:02,925
Daritai!
Altan!

331
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:09,966
Daritai!

332
00:57:13,887 --> 00:57:15,240
Taichar!

333
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:20,564
Where is Daritai?
Where is Altan?

334
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:26,876
<i>They should be close to my boots.</i>

335
00:57:27,967 --> 00:57:30,242
They left with Temudgin.

336
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:33,396
What?

337
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:38,201
They left with Temudgin.

338
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:14,436
<i>Brother! You didn't say goodbye to me.</i>

339
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:18,079
<i>You were sleeping, brother.</i>

340
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:24,165
<i>My people are with you now.
Why, brother?</i>

341
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:31,363
<i>Mongols can change their
master if they wish to.</i>

342
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:39,359
Daritai, Altan!

343
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,997
<i>Why have you deserted me?</i>

344
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:47,158
<i>Temudgin is fair to his warriors.</i>

345
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:48,755
Give us back our horses!

346
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:52,396
<i>You gave me this horse, so it's mine.</i>

347
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:59,362
Daritai, I'm the law.

348
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:02,766
I'll tear your rotting liver out.

349
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:04,886
Try!

350
00:59:05,967 --> 00:59:09,642
My liver has a new master now.

351
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:25,767
<i>I can't send them back to you, brother.</i>

352
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:28,401
<i>Mongols have the right to choose.</i>

353
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:55,760
<i>Look after our horse. I'll be back!</i>

354
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:09,962
Daritai!
Thieves are stealing Temudgin's horses!

355
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:02,960
<i>Jamukha's people tried
to steal your horses.</i>

356
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:10,200
<i>We killed one of them.</i>

357
01:01:17,328 --> 01:01:18,920
We killed Jamukha's brother.

358
01:01:20,728 --> 01:01:21,717
Taichar.

359
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:25,525
<i>Who killed him?</i>

360
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:31,647
I did. I didn't recognize him.

361
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:37,407
<i>You saved the horses,
but you brought us war.</i>

362
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:44,563
<i>Forgive me, lord.
Send my head to Jamukha.</i>

363
01:01:54,968 --> 01:01:57,198
He guarded your herd well.

364
01:01:58,408 --> 01:02:01,684
<i>If you hand him over,
what will people say?</i>

365
01:02:35,808 --> 01:02:39,198
<i>I've heard of your sorrow, Jamukha.</i>

366
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:52,561
<i>I'll help you get revenge.</i>

367
01:03:01,888 --> 01:03:06,200
<i>I want to tie Temudgin's head
to the tail of my horse.</i>

368
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:08,888
<i>Do it.</i>

369
01:03:13,888 --> 01:03:17,722
Without you, I can't.

370
01:03:25,808 --> 01:03:27,480
<i>Are you afraid, Targutai?</i>

371
01:03:34,328 --> 01:03:36,603
<i>What kind of Khan are you?</i>

372
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:43,279
<i>There are only two strong Mongols
in the steppe.</i>

373
01:03:44,328 --> 01:03:48,037
Me and my brother Temudgin.

374
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:51,920
Understand?

375
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:57,722
I'll bring all my horsemen.
Give me Temudgin!

376
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:49,246
Temudgin,
Jamukha is following your tracks.

377
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:54,276
<i>- There will be 10 of them for each of us.
- Tell us what to do.</i>

378
01:04:55,408 --> 01:04:57,127
<i>I will not abandon our families.</i>

379
01:04:57,128 --> 01:05:02,361
<i>If we survive we'll get back for them.
We haven't any other choice.</i>

380
01:05:05,488 --> 01:05:08,487
<i>Altan, Daritai.
You trusted me with your families.</i>

381
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:13,482
<i>Jamukha will show them no mercy.
Are you ready to abandon them?</i>

382
01:05:17,368 --> 01:05:19,165
<i>You decide, Temudgin.</i>

383
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:22,997
Temudgin.

384
01:05:24,448 --> 01:05:28,487
Leave us. Save yourself!

385
01:05:30,568 --> 01:05:33,799
<i>Do what Mongols
always do.</i>

386
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:36,286
Everyone will understand.

387
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:38,000
<i>Not me.</i>

388
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:49,878
<i>Go to the mountains, quick!</i>

389
01:05:59,888 --> 01:06:03,039
<i>Let's move, Jamukha!
What are you waiting for?</i>

390
01:06:03,968 --> 01:06:06,118
What's the rush, Targutai?

391
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:10,324
Temudgin will run away.
We'll never find him!

392
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:18,205
<i>You don't know my brother.</i>

393
01:06:39,008 --> 01:06:41,363
<i>- Are you ready?
- Ready, Temudgin.</i>

394
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:54,197
Khasar!

395
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:58,847
<i>Take enough men
to protect our families!</i>

396
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:37,046
Temudgin, we're staying with you.

397
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,880
<i>It's time to go.</i>

398
01:07:58,968 --> 01:08:01,687
<i>Look after yourself and our son.</i>

399
01:08:02,008 --> 01:08:04,363
Stay alive, Temudgin.

400
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:20,319
Don't forget us.

401
01:09:24,408 --> 01:09:26,478
<i>You see how smart my brother is?</i>

402
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:29,883
<i>It won't be easy to take him.</i>

403
01:09:44,808 --> 01:09:46,446
Attack!

404
01:11:36,128 --> 01:11:37,561
I want Temudgin alive!

405
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:41,967
<i>Me too!</i>

406
01:12:36,288 --> 01:12:39,280
<i>You promised, he's mine!</i>

407
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:46,125
<i>Everything here is mine, Targutai.
And you're mine too.</i>

408
01:13:17,128 --> 01:13:18,800
<i>You say nothing.</i>

409
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:27,118
<i>At least beg me for mercy.</i>

410
01:13:30,328 --> 01:13:32,558
<i>You want to die, Temudgin?</i>

411
01:13:39,968 --> 01:13:43,483
<i>I'm not a beggar, brother.</i>

412
01:13:48,168 --> 01:13:50,887
<i>Beg me for your life.</i>

413
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:55,879
I can't.

414
01:14:00,128 --> 01:14:02,358
I'm asking you.

415
01:14:06,048 --> 01:14:08,562
Forgive me brother!

416
01:14:11,888 --> 01:14:14,402
<i>I am not your brother.</i>

417
01:14:16,968 --> 01:14:18,799
I'm your Khan.

418
01:14:25,448 --> 01:14:27,404
<i>And you are my slave.</i>

419
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:33,007
Take him!

420
01:15:03,088 --> 01:15:05,602
Hold on!

421
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:12,284
<i>I can't go on.</i>

422
01:15:14,608 --> 01:15:18,999
Forgive me, I lost the battle.

423
01:15:19,888 --> 01:15:23,483
<i>You fought well.</i>

424
01:15:23,768 --> 01:15:27,363
<i>You saved our families.</i>

425
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:31,921
<i>Now Mongols know your name,
Temudgin.</i>

426
01:15:57,968 --> 01:16:00,038
Get up!

427
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,687
<i>Go! Push!</i>

428
01:16:07,168 --> 01:16:10,240
I'm finished..

429
01:16:48,968 --> 01:16:51,038
<i>How are you, Garrison Chief?</i>

430
01:16:51,728 --> 01:16:53,127
<i>Stop here.</i>

431
01:16:54,848 --> 01:16:57,203
<i>Want to buy slaves?</i>

432
01:16:57,688 --> 01:16:59,121
<i>How much?</i>

433
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,284
<i>One rope of Tangut money.</i>

434
01:17:02,488 --> 01:17:04,558
<i>That one is two.</i>

435
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:15,163
And that one.. five ropes!

436
01:17:16,328 --> 01:17:17,886
<i>Too high. Three.</i>

437
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:24,638
<i>I can't go lower.
This one killed my best guard.</i>

438
01:17:26,328 --> 01:17:29,320
<i>Don't buy that one.
He will bring sorrow upon us.</i>

439
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:33,680
<i>What sorrow can a slave bring?
We have thousands of them.</i>

440
01:17:36,408 --> 01:17:39,400
<i>He'll never forgive the humiliation.
Let him go.</i>

441
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:42,199
Foolish talk, old monk.

442
01:17:42,928 --> 01:17:47,285
He's a slave, and he'll die a slave.

443
01:17:48,488 --> 01:17:51,241
<i>I see hordes of Mongol horsemen..</i>

444
01:17:51,528 --> 01:17:55,567
ravaging your land, death..

445
01:18:00,888 --> 01:18:05,598
<i>Hey, Mongol!
You want to destroy my kingdom?</i>

446
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:16,646
<i>I know what to do with him.</i>

447
01:18:53,488 --> 01:18:58,084
I haven't been paid in months.

448
01:19:00,248 --> 01:19:02,967
Listen. Let's sell the beast!

449
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:08,486
Who'd buy him?

450
01:19:35,768 --> 01:19:38,328
<i>Hey, Mongol! Show us your teeth!</i>

451
01:19:38,528 --> 01:19:43,556
"M0NG0L WH0 WANTED
To DESTR0Y TANGUT KINGD0M"

452
01:20:06,328 --> 01:20:10,082
Forgive us!

453
01:20:18,728 --> 01:20:24,564
Mongols die in cages.

454
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,358
I'm alive.

455
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:31,403
Your spirit is strong.

456
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,523
<i>I am here to ask you..</i>

457
01:20:35,008 --> 01:20:41,402
<i>when the terrible time comes,
do not destroy our monastery.</i>

458
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:46,880
Kill the guard tonight..

459
01:20:47,248 --> 01:20:50,445
bring me the key.

460
01:20:52,168 --> 01:20:55,922
<i>My faith does not allow me to kill.</i>

461
01:20:56,288 --> 01:20:58,404
My faith does.

462
01:21:00,728 --> 01:21:06,121
The monastery has many sacred books.
They must be saved.

463
01:21:07,928 --> 01:21:10,283
I can't read.

464
01:21:15,408 --> 01:21:18,605
<i>Go to the merchants
who trade with Mongols.</i>

465
01:21:19,128 --> 01:21:22,484
<i>Ask them to find Temudgin's clan
and give this bone to Borte.</i>

466
01:21:24,888 --> 01:21:28,164
Remember.. Borte.

467
01:21:35,168 --> 01:21:38,956
<i>I'll do it.</i>

468
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:45,197
In Mongolia, everyone gets robbed.

469
01:21:46,888 --> 01:21:49,641
<i>Among us merchants,
only Golden Earring goes there.</i>

470
01:21:50,048 --> 01:21:51,401
But he's a thief himself.

471
01:21:52,728 --> 01:21:59,247
<i>Nobody knows when he comes
or when he goes.</i>

472
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:04,280
Nobody can help you, old monk.

473
01:23:47,408 --> 01:23:49,285
Juchi. Juchi!

474
01:23:50,448 --> 01:23:52,325
<i>We must go.</i>

475
01:25:13,848 --> 01:25:16,487
<i>I know how to bury a monk.</i>

476
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:28,047
<i>- What are you waiting for?
- A caravan.</i>

477
01:25:28,968 --> 01:25:31,118
This is the last caravan..

478
01:25:32,048 --> 01:25:34,198
<i>and I won't be back soon.</i>

479
01:25:43,848 --> 01:25:45,918
<i>Take us with you now!</i>

480
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:53,203
<i>It's a long road.
I can see you have no money.</i>

481
01:26:01,288 --> 01:26:05,042
<i>- How will you pay me?
- You know how I'll pay you.</i>

482
01:28:55,968 --> 01:28:58,960
<i>- It is not enough.
- We had a deal.</i>

483
01:29:00,808 --> 01:29:06,838
<i>- He wants more. Or he'll tell on me.
- I haven't got anymore.</i>

484
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:12,322
<i>You don't look like a poor woman.</i>

485
01:29:18,128 --> 01:29:19,402
Hey, wait!

486
01:29:21,728 --> 01:29:23,320
<i>I want to talk.</i>

487
01:29:24,768 --> 01:29:27,407
<i>Don't try to cross me!</i>

488
01:29:30,248 --> 01:29:31,647
Give me the key.

489
01:30:51,888 --> 01:30:53,958
What's her name?

490
01:30:54,888 --> 01:30:55,923
Mongen.

491
01:31:00,328 --> 01:31:02,717
I am your father, Mongen.

492
01:31:08,808 --> 01:31:11,481
Where is my other father?

493
01:31:11,808 --> 01:31:14,641
Forget him. This is your father now.

494
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:35,879
<i>Go and sleep.</i>

495
01:33:57,648 --> 01:34:00,367
Don't worry, he's our father.

496
01:35:11,488 --> 01:35:13,126
<i>Do you want to play too?</i>

497
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:27,962
<i>Father. Why don't you braid your hair?</i>

498
01:35:29,168 --> 01:35:31,728
Shouldn't a man always braid his hair?

499
01:35:33,408 --> 01:35:35,205
<i>Not me.</i>

500
01:35:49,328 --> 01:35:51,796
- We call this meat.
- Meat.

501
01:36:03,128 --> 01:36:07,918
Someday,
everyone will understand Mongol.

502
01:36:08,568 --> 01:36:12,402
<i>Listen to how beautiful it sounds:
Meat!</i>

503
01:36:15,488 --> 01:36:16,523
Meat!

504
01:36:27,568 --> 01:36:31,720
<i>- Jochi, how old are you?
- Ten, Father.</i>

505
01:36:31,808 --> 01:36:35,005
<i>You must choose a bride soon.</i>

506
01:36:36,728 --> 01:36:38,480
<i>How do I choose?</i>

507
01:36:39,248 --> 01:36:44,481
<i>I will teach you because finding
a good woman is the hardest thing.</i>

508
01:36:44,688 --> 01:36:46,121
I agree.

509
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:53,390
<i>I told you not to be scared.</i>

510
01:36:53,403 --> 01:36:55,916
<i>I'm not scared. 0ur
father is very funny.</i>

511
01:37:04,888 --> 01:37:08,642
<i>I have names for the sons
you will bear me.</i>

512
01:37:11,408 --> 01:37:14,286
<i>Don't you know what Mongols are like?</i>

513
01:37:15,888 --> 01:37:18,641
I'm Mongol. I know.

514
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:24,683
<i>They are worse than ever.
All they do is kill and steal.</i>

515
01:37:25,088 --> 01:37:27,044
They don't even spare the children.

516
01:37:40,328 --> 01:37:43,718
<i>I know what to do with Mongols.</i>

517
01:37:51,888 --> 01:37:54,561
<i>Take the children and go home.</i>

518
01:38:03,328 --> 01:38:07,640
<i>When will you be back?
A year? Two years?</i>

519
01:38:16,968 --> 01:38:18,959
<i>I won't see you soon, Temudgin.</i>

520
01:38:55,928 --> 01:39:00,922
<i>Lord of the Blue Sky, Great Tengri!
I bow before you.</i>

521
01:39:01,528 --> 01:39:04,486
Give me the strength.

522
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:30,644
Mongols need laws.
I will make them obey..

523
01:39:31,128 --> 01:39:37,078
<i>even if I have to kill half of them.</i>

524
01:39:48,928 --> 01:39:52,887
<i>0ur laws will be simple.
Don't kill women or children.</i>

525
01:39:56,208 --> 01:40:00,804
Don't forget your debts.

526
01:40:02,048 --> 01:40:04,198
<i>Fight enemies to the end.</i>

527
01:40:06,488 --> 01:40:08,399
And never betray your Khan.

528
01:40:31,648 --> 01:40:36,005
Many warriors came under my banner.

529
01:40:38,488 --> 01:40:46,076
<i>They knew I wanted to unite
all Mongols to make us strong.</i>

530
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:56,804
<i>But Jamukha tried to tear us apart.</i>

531
01:40:58,128 --> 01:41:05,603
<i>The time came for our final battle
to decide who would rule Mongolia.</i>

532
01:41:16,848 --> 01:41:19,078
Jamukha's army was bigger.

533
01:41:19,968 --> 01:41:28,398
<i>But I had my strategy
and I knew how to win</i>

534
01:41:29,288 --> 01:41:31,563
<i>I still needed Tengri..
Lord of the Blue Sky..</i>

535
01:41:33,968 --> 01:41:36,323
<i>to be on my side.</i>

536
01:41:58,768 --> 01:42:03,398
<i>My brother's warriors shoot well.</i>

537
01:42:06,288 --> 01:42:08,404
Let's attack, Jamukha!

538
01:42:12,608 --> 01:42:18,843
My brother is crafty as a wolf.

539
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,959
First detachment.

540
01:46:51,808 --> 01:46:53,161
Attack!

541
01:47:23,928 --> 01:47:24,997
<i>Go!</i>

542
01:49:35,968 --> 01:49:39,967
<i>Temudgin!
We throw our Khan at your feet.</i>

543
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:42,607
<i>He tried to run, but we killed him.</i>

544
01:49:43,728 --> 01:49:47,038
<i>- Who is this?
- Your enemy, Targutai.</i>

545
01:49:57,488 --> 01:50:00,286
<i>- Kill them!
- For what?</i>

546
01:50:04,048 --> 01:50:07,404
<i>Altan! What did we do wrong?</i>

547
01:50:08,208 --> 01:50:13,077
<i>You broke the law.
You betrayed your Khan!</i>

548
01:50:14,288 --> 01:50:16,483
We didn't know..

549
01:50:24,888 --> 01:50:27,607
<i>How are you, old man?</i>

550
01:50:27,928 --> 01:50:33,924
<i>Thank you for remembering,
Khan Temudgin.</i>

551
01:50:37,608 --> 01:50:40,884
<i>Give him one hundred horses
and put his yurt next to mine.</i>

552
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:50,641
<i>Take all these men into my army.</i>

553
01:50:52,968 --> 01:50:55,436
Temudgin. We caught him.

554
01:51:14,288 --> 01:51:15,767
Temudgin.

555
01:51:17,408 --> 01:51:22,687
<i>Now you're Khan and I'm at your feet.
Are you happy?</i>

556
01:51:32,048 --> 01:51:36,485
<i>- I forgive you, brother.
- It's too late.</i>

557
01:51:40,728 --> 01:51:45,756
<i>I'll always be a rock in your boot.</i>

558
01:51:51,768 --> 01:51:56,888
<i>I want to ask you:
All Mongols fear the thunder..</i>

559
01:51:59,408 --> 01:52:01,126
<i>but not you?</i>

560
01:52:04,048 --> 01:52:08,087
<i>I had no place to hide
from the thunder..</i>

561
01:52:09,888 --> 01:52:14,200
<i>so I wasn't afraid anymore.</i>

562
01:52:23,088 --> 01:52:28,401
<i>What are you going to do with me,
Temudgin?</i>

563
01:52:29,888 --> 01:52:33,403
<i>What would you do?</i>

564
01:52:36,368 --> 01:52:39,121
I would kill you, brother.

565
01:52:56,608 --> 01:52:58,200
<i>Go!</i>

566
01:53:08,408 --> 01:53:10,638
<i>You're letting your enemy go.</i>

567
01:53:14,008 --> 01:53:16,044
<i>I'm letting my brother go.</i>

568
01:53:26,128 --> 01:53:27,163
Father!

569
01:53:28,808 --> 01:53:33,643
<i>When will we go to choose my bride?
You must keep your promise.</i>

570
01:53:34,888 --> 01:53:36,287
<i>We'll go soon.</i>

571
01:53:50,288 --> 01:53:52,483
<i>See how well I chose your mother.</i>

572
01:53:53,288 --> 01:53:55,882
Temudgin, I chose you.

573
01:54:03,568 --> 01:54:04,717
True!

574
01:54:28,408 --> 01:54:31,320
<i>I have to finish what I started.</i>

575
01:54:41,968 --> 01:54:44,198
<i>You're a good wife, Borte.</i>

576
01:54:57,128 --> 01:54:59,403
<i>You know I'll always come back.</i>

577
01:55:19,288 --> 01:55:21,119
Don't be afraid.

578
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:40,962
<i>You know your future, Great Khan.</i>

579
01:55:49,408 --> 01:55:59,602
<i>Temujin was acknowledged
as ruler of all Mongols.</i>

580
01:56:06,488 --> 01:56:10,527
<i>The Tungus Kingdom was erased
from the face of the earth.</i>

581
01:56:11,968 --> 01:56:15,324
But the monastery was preserved.

582
