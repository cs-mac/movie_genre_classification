Let's get him up! On the hatch.

160
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,249
Facedown.

161
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,691
Goddamn! If I'd been a few minutes
earlier, he'd be breathing now.

162
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,777
You did your best, Chief Sunday.
Lieutenant Hanks.

163
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,072
Complete the diving operation.

164
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,826
HANKS:
The copilot is still in the water.

165
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,953
It's your turn, bring him home.

166
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,248
Take Chief Sunday to the chamber
for decompression.

167
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,299
Lay back. On the side.

168
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,636
Diver coming up and over.

169
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,442
- Chief?
- Cut the weight. Drop the weight!

170
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,291
LOUDSPEAKER: <i>Man overboard.</i>
- Stand by.

171
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,712
- What the hell's going on?
- We lost Caughlin, sir.

172
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,633
- Standby's going in.
- We can't wait. Look at him.

173
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,927
What are you doing?
I've got a man on.

174
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,429
I'll bounce dive,
put him on a rescue line.

175
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,474
- Bounce dive?
- I've done it before.

176
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,686
You can't. He's too deep.
And you will call me "sir"!

177
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,771
Goddamn it, I got a man dying, sir!

178
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,650
Give me a wrench, a spare lifeline
and an air hose!

179
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:51,947
I've lost two men, another drowning.
I won't let you commit suicide.

180
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,616
- Stand fast.
- He'll be dead before you get him!

181
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,993
- Sir, the air...
- Stand off!

182
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:00,664
You will lose if you touch that water.
Do you hear me?

183
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:01,999
Yes, sir!

184
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,338
Goddamn it!

185
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:32,571
Master Chief Sunday,
you sustained a serious embolism.

186
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,989
Embolism.

187
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:37,409
Both lobes of the lungs
were severely scarred.

188
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,703
Can't cheat the laws
of nature forever.

189
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,706
I'm afraid the condition
is totally inoperable.

190
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,375
Ain't that a bitch.

191
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,132
So, what happens next time I dive
and take on pressure?

192
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,594
Any increased pressure
at all will kill you instantly.

193
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,182
Kill me? Goddamn. For a minute,
I thought this was serious.

194
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,187
- Keep your voice down.
- Hell, no. I feel like singing.

195
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,273
- Fuck.
- Where are you going?

196
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,486
To celebrate. You had me going.
I thought I couldn't dive no more.

197
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,489
- You're scaring the patients.
- How about me?

198
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:20,077
Goddamn! Hey, I got an idea.
Maybe you could use me around here.

199
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,329
I'm looking to make a career move.

200
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,500
Maybe you could get someone
to change the bedpans.

201
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,544
Change the bedpans!

202
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,045
DOCTOR:
Chief!

203
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,840
Change a fucking bedpan!

204
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,765
Master Chief Sunday, given
your current physical condition...

205
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,354
...and the far graver issue
of recent acts of misconduct...

206
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:48,438
(MEN LAUGH)

207
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,024
...you will be medically disqualified
from diving...

208
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,151
...fined 1/2 month's pay
for 3 months...

209
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,362
...and reassigned
to a training position...

210
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,574
...where it is my greatest wish...

211
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:02,703
...that you will embrace
a newfound respect for authority.

212
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,667
This hearing is concluded.

213
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,077
That's what I want to be, sir.

214
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,497
- A Navy master diver?
- Yes, sir.

215
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,499
Last week, you were a cook.

216
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,046
- The man I just saw...
- The man you saw is a master chief.

217
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,174
That's the highest rank an enlisted
man can achieve in the Navy.

218
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,844
Lot of good men spend
their career trying and fail.

219
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,888
Besides...

220
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:07,893
...they're not going to take a colored
at diving school. It's that simple.

221
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,687
What if you personally
recommended me, sir?

222
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,983
I just made you a deck seaman
three days ago.

223
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,819
What else do I owe you?

224
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,239
The way I see it...

225
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,033
...I owe you, sir.

226
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,001
I'll endorse your request.

227
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,255
But it ain't gonna work.

228
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,625
Wait outside.

229
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:40,360
(MUSIC PLAYS ON CAR RADIO)

230
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,286
Well, look at Mr. Navy.
Bell-bottoms bleached.

231
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,206
Shoes all shined up.

232
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,666
Now all we need is an organ grinder.

233
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,668
Welcome to Bayonne, New Jersey.

234
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,420
Pimple on God's ass.

235
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,964
Chief Sunday, we never met,
but I served with you.

236
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:06,136
<i>U. S. S. Hoist.</i>
I expect I remember you now.

237
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,555
So, what's for chow, Cookie?

238
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:11,642
I wouldn't know, chief.
I'm reporting for diving school.

239
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,144
Oh, yeah, that's right.

240
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,481
They say you wrote over 100 letters
requesting admission.

241
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,358
You got you some grit, you have.

242
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,692
Yes, sir.

243
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,571
Fucking gonna be a hot one today.

244
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,870
Hope you're better
than the last cook.

245
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,956
Man's food could kill your dog.

246
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,376
Chief.

247
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,172
Had anything to drink today?

248
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,548
No, sir, chief.

249
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,302
Say we go into town
and get us a nice cold one.

250
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,221
I can't do that, chief.
I haven't reported for duty.

251
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,848
I'll tell you what.

252
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,267
I'll buy you a tall one over there.

253
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,894
A bus ticket too.

254
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,730
So you can go on back to whatever
burrow you sprang from.

255
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,773
What do you say?

256
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,526
Sir, I am a Navy man.

257
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,112
Where I come from
there are no oceans...

258
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,282
...only dirt farms and ornery mules.

259
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:56,705
And no self-respecting Navy man
makes a living driving mules.

260
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:03,879
Sir.

261
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,265
You know what the Chinese say?

262
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,354
Beware what you wish for.

263
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:26,109
Let him in.

264
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,700
I stole the pot!

265
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:45,587
Get in. Hoist away.

266
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,398
Don't stare at him.

267
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,985
- Who is he?
- Commanding officer.

268
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,196
Everyone calls him Mr. Pappy.

269
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,865
He's a war hero.

270
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,534
They were going to make him an admiral
in D. C...

271
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:19,788
...before they found out he has more
screws loose than a Studebaker.

272
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:21,874
So they sent him here.

273
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:26,211
Better salute him, or you'll spend
your first night in the brig.

274
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,387
I'll show you the barracks.

275
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,539
SAILOR:
Attention on deck!

276
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,591
Gentlemen...

277
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:17,888
...in 1948, President Truman had
the courage and enlightenment...

278
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,557
...to desegregate
the United States military.

279
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,978
I want you to welcome Bayonne Diving
School's first colored trainee...

280
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,981
...Boatswain's Mate Second Class
Carl Brashear.

281
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,740
I don't hear anyone welcoming
Boatswain's Mate Brashear.

282
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,039
Master chief.

283
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,542
No disrespect to the president...

284
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,961
...but I don't bunk with niggers.

285
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:06,496
- Aren't you going to go too?
- No.

286
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,250
I'm from Wisconsin.

287
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,462
Never been there.

288
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,495
Rise and shine, Cookie.
Time for training.

289
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,212
Are you familiar with the principle
of Boyle's Law?

290
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:56,964
The what?!

291
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,842
I didn't hear your answer!

292
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,305
Come on, Cookie. Get up.

293
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,684
At a constant temperature...

294
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:13,272
...the volume of a confined gas
varies conversely with its pressure.

295
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,066
Why is this law important in diving?

296
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,401
I don't know, chief!

297
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,696
That's because you're just
some dumb nigger from Podunk.

298
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:25,117
I know you. Your smell hung
in every damn shack I ever lived in.

299
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,911
Your face staring
when we had to leave...

300
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,081
...because your daddy
could farm it cheaper than mine.

301
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,126
He drank himself into a $ 7 casket,
but not me!

302
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,420
Because I'm a master diver!

303
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,422
Maybe you'll remember that
next time...

304
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,509
...you imply we got anything
in common. You read me, Cookie?

305
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:50,058
Get your goddamn Wisconsin ass
back to bed, Snowhill!

306
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,633
SUNDAY:
The men you are watching...

307
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,177
...are going to be Navy divers.

308
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,555
You bottom suckers are not fit
to observe them.

309
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,140
Avert your eyes!

310
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,685
My name is Master Chief Billy Sunday.

311
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,939
There was a preacher by the same name
who rid Chicago...

312
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:40,817
...of the whoring spics, drunken wops
and motherfucking niggers...

313
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:44,780
...who were making that place unfit
for decent white folks to live.

314
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:48,450
The only difference
between me and that preacher...

315
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,995
...is that he worked for God,
and I am God!

316
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,335
Now, the first 10 of you
Girl Scouts step forward.

317
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,338
Come on, drop your dicks!
Let's go!

318
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,762
Three-quarters of you standing here
will fail to become Navy divers.

319
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,056
Three from the first row,
step forward.

320
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,349
Step forward!

321
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:20,524
Of those unfortunates who pass, only
three of you will live to retirement.

322
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:24,069
Because diving is
the most dangerous job in the Navy.

323
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,197
So who wants to quit?

324
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,825
Say now, who wants to quit?

325
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,702
You got something to offer?

326
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,667
Who wants to save me the sweat...

327
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,420
...of training your sorry ass?

328
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:42,588
You?

329
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,256
You?

330
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:45,966
Cookie?

331
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:51,847
You?

332
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,392
You gonna look me in the eye?

333
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:00,230
What are you, some broke-dick Popeye?

334
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:07,029
Let me guess.
You were captain of the swim team.

335
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:10,991
You and your girlfriend used
to practice the breaststroke!

336
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,831
Say it like you got a pair!

337
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:20,042
My wife.

338
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,378
It's in your record.
You knocked her up sophomore year.

339
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,050
Maybe you can bring
the little woman down one night...

340
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,054
...and all the boys can practice
the breaststroke.

341
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:38,310
I heard you were a hell of a swimmer,
Snowhill. State champ?

342
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,271
Yes, yes, master chief.

343
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,736
Snowhill, please step forward.

344
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:48,946
March.

345
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:51,907
About face.

346
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:57,496
(SNOWHILL YELLS)

347
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,791
You let go before I relieve you,
you fail my course.

348
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,668
Got it, swim champ?

349
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:14,137
Swimming don't got dick-shit
to do with deep-sea diving.

350
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:18,851
If Johnny Weissmuller were in the soup
wearing a 200-pound diving rig...

351
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:23,730
...he couldn't swim to fuck Esther
Williams if she was right there naked.

352
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,400
The only way to survive
is to trust each other.

353
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,652
Underwater, all you got
is the man next to you.

354
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:33,532
That's why the only men to get through
my course are the very, very best.

355
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,742
Now get out of my sight.

356
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,298
Permission to relieve the man below.

357
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,718
What are you, Cookie?
Some kind of goddamn hero?

358
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,848
I got no room for heroes or stuttering
swim champs with a wife and kids.

359
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:01,351
Flunk me. But don't punish
him for being decent to me.

360
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,937
You'll flunk all on your own.

361
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,856
Swim champ had half a chance.

362
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,609
He still does.
Permission to relieve him.

363
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:10,861
Says he can hold his breath
for 4 minutes.

364
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,321
Ain't even been two.

365
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,283
I believe
Gunner's Mate Snowhill's a liar!

366
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:19,494
We're men of honor, ain't we?
We don't abide liars.

367
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,122
You're out of my program, Snowhill!

368
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,875
Brashear, you have the barracks
to yourself.

369
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:29,338
Damn!

370
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:33,675
The Navy diver is not a fighting man
but a salvage expert.

371
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,511
If it's lost, he finds it.

372
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:38,805
If it's sunk, he brings it up.
If it's in the way, he moves it.

373
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:42,226
If he's lucky, he'll die 200 feet
beneath the waves.

374
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,520
That's the closest he'll get
to being a hero.

375
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:48,190
Hell, I don't know why anybody'd want
to be a Navy diver.

376
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,526
Good flange work, Rourke.

377
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,736
- Almost there.
- Thank you, master chief.

378
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,539
CLASS INSTRUCTOR:
Machinist's Mate Rourke, 91.

379
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:06,959
Boatswain's Mate Brashear, 37.

380
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:11,547
- You fail the next test, you're out.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:16,134
There are seats of learning beyond
the walls and control of this camp.

382
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,769
Ladies, this is weekend liberty.

383
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:31,108
Anyone who ain't back here on time
will have to answer to me personally.

384
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:34,695
And remember: One-night stands
may be over by morning...

385
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:37,573
...but syphilis lasts a lifetime.

386
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,700
Dismissed!

387
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,540
(CAR HONKS)

388
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,172
(MEN TALKING)

389
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:01,263
Hey! Hey! How about some flowers
for your young lady?

390
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,697
What's the hitch?

391
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,580
- You're the one who called.
- Yes, ma'am.

392
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:32,002
I told you. We're a public library,
not a tutoring service.

393
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,880
Now if you don't mind...

394
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,966
...there is a Mr. Biddle at home.

395
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:40,636
In fact,
he's probably brought flowers.

396
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,944
Have a wonderful weekend.

397
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:59,071
And lock up, would you?

398
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,740
And be sure to kick him out.

399
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:04,785
Hello.

400
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:07,746
We're closed.

401
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,040
Not for three minutes.

402
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,543
You studying on nursing?

403
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,712
A person doesn't study "on" anything,
boatswain's mate.

404
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:22,344
You know your rates and ranks.
Did you get that from these books?

405
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,850
Look, I am not here to flirt with you.

406
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,769
I'm in diving school
across the river.

407
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,897
I'm not just good at it.
I was born for it.

408
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:37,693
But the joke is, I'll wash out
if I fail my next exam.

409
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,237
What's the last grade you completed?

410
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:41,405
Seventh.

411
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,824
- I can't help you.
- Why not?

412
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:48,036
It took me four years of work
to get through med school.

413
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,289
Now I have six weeks
to study for my exam.

414
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:54,334
I pass, I become an intern,
maybe someday a doctor.

415
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:58,088
You're too far behind.
And I don't have the time.

416
00:38:58,797 --> 00:38:59,882
Okay. Go on.

417
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:02,843
Go read to yourself.
Don't give me another thought.

418
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:06,221
Don't you get it?
It doesn't matter if I help you.

419
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,807
- You're gonna fail anyway.
- I won't.

420
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,102
I can't.

421
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,773
Why do you want this so badly?

422
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,151
Because they said I couldn't have it.

423
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,841
I may know a professor at City...

424
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:34,142
Boyle's Law describes the behavior
of gases under varying pressure.

425
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:38,021
It states if a diver holds
his breath at 100 feet...

426
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,440
...continues holding while rising
to 10 feet...

427
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:43,777
...the gases in his lungs
increase four times.

428
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:48,240
Why is this important? Forget to
exhale going up, your lungs explode.

429
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:55,747
I can work with you,
but my time is precious.

430
00:40:55,956 --> 00:41:00,752
So the first time you go drinking
and fighting and leave me waiting...

431
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,504
...our arrangement ends.

432
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,427
MRS BIDDLE:
Good morning.

433
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,231
I...

434
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,901
...have to open up.

435
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,069
What's your name? Or is it a secret?

436
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:28,947
My name is Jo.

437
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,494
My father always wanted a boy.

438
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,081
He was in the Navy too.

439
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:39,499
Is he still active?

440
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,669
I haven't seen him since I was 9.

441
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,986
Good night.

00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,931
SUNDAY: Boots, Cookie, square away,
ladies. You're next in the water.

448
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:40,185
Patch the hull of the training vessel
so we can pump her full of air...

449
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,937
...and raise her up.

450
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,481
Then we'll sink her and do it again.

451
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:52,698
What's going on?

452
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:55,325
He stays down any longer,
he'll get mail.

453
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,086
ROURKE:
Isert, finish torching that hole.

454
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:09,214
ISERT: I'm trying,
but this thing's real awkward.

455
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,218
ROURKE: How's it look?
ISERT: Looks like hell.

456
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:18,432
<i>Green diver, you have three minutes</i>
<i>to get your patch hung...</i>

457
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,311

<i>Move your raggedy ass, Isert.</i>

458
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,271
SUNDAY: <i>Red diver.</i>
ROURKE: Yes, master chief.

<i>who welded faster. Move him along.</i>

460
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:30,152
(ROURKE LAUGHS)

461
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,822
- Come on, Isert, hang the patch.
- Yeah, okay, Rourke. I'm trying.

462
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,206
ROURKE:
Do you feel that?

463
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,291
ISERT:
Do I feel what?

464
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,835
ISERT:
What the hell?

465
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,297
ROURKE:
This wreck is rolling!

466
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:54,760
ROURKE: She's limping, chief.
We're sliding down.

467
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,179
ISERT:
Can somebody tell me what happened?

468
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,473
SAILOR:

Negative on the come-home order.
Isert's air hose is tangled.

Why are we moving?

ROURKE:
We slipped down the channel bank.

478

This wreck is alive.

<i>- Listen, Rourke...</i>

Unfoul his line and get him out.

Master chief...

489

...it looks like the ship slid down on
some pipes coming from that factory.

those pipes, chief.

Sweetheart...

941
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:10,145
...you'll never dive again.

942
01:36:14,983 --> 01:36:16,860
And what you gotta do now...

943
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:19,696
...I can't help you with.

944
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:27,287
But when you're ready to leave...

945
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:32,543
...and if you can promise me you'll
never take another drink again...

946
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:36,171
...I'll be waiting for you
in that car over there.

947
01:36:40,384 --> 01:36:41,969
But if you can't...

I want to come back.</i>

951
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:05,135
- To where, chief?
- Full diving duty.

952
01:38:05,928 --> 01:38:07,596
I want to dive again.

953
01:38:07,846 --> 01:38:09,431
Carl...

954
01:38:09,765 --> 01:38:12,100
...I understand but...
- But...

955
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:14,645
...it's just not possible.

956
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:17,773
Good afternoon, admiral.

957

- Captain Hanks.

Chief Brashear.

959
01:38:22,027 --> 01:38:24,613
Captain Hanks is the senior officer...

960
01:38:24,821 --> 01:38:28,659
...of the Personnel Policy
Control Board at the Pentagon.

961
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:30,410
He'll be with us a few weeks...

962
01:38:30,619 --> 01:38:34,122
...meeting some of the men from the
front lines, hearing their concerns.

963
01:38:34,373 --> 01:38:36,917
To return to the chief's
primary concern.

964
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:41,255
Working as a Navy diver
with one good leg and the other...

965
01:38:41,922 --> 01:38:44,299
I'm sorry, it's just not possible.

966
01:38:44,508 --> 01:38:45,551

969
01:38:57,813 --> 01:38:58,939
I'm asking this:

970
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:04,111
Cut off my leg and assemble a medical
review board 12 weeks from today.

971
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:08,407
Then I will demonstrate that I am fit
to return to full diving duty.

972
01:39:09,074 --> 01:39:10,993
I want to make master chief.

973
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:17,791
We admire your courage, chief,
however misplaced it may be.

My opinion might mean something here.

978
01:39:39,188 --> 01:39:40,647
I guess not.

979
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:45,027
How will you come back with one leg?

980
01:39:45,569 --> 01:39:47,571
I could barely read once.
I found a way.

981
01:39:51,033 --> 01:39:53,827
I could put up with the months
at sea...

982

...the dangerous assignments
you never refused.

983
01:39:57,414 --> 01:39:59,374
- But this?
- What do you want from me?

984
01:40:00,792 --> 01:40:04,963
That I come home, mow the lawn,
put a wheelchair ramp in?

985
01:40:05,631 --> 01:40:09,009
- How am I gonna look at my son?
- Leave him out of this.

986
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:14,139
You're not doing this for him or me.
This is about you.

01:40:14,598 --> 01:40:16,767
It's always been about you.

01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:23,357
At least give me that much.

Why are you doing this to me?

991
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:42,334
Answer me, goddamn it!

992
01:40:42,793 --> 01:40:46,630

On Friday, that Captain Hanks...

1006
01:44:23,472 --> 01:44:27,100
...is convening a medical review board
and he's gonna retire you.

- He said I had 4 weeks.
- He lied, Cookie.

He don't care how many one-legged
pushups you can do.

01:44:36,151 --> 01:44:39,196
He'd trade you and me

...for one glass-eyed
electronics technician.

The man's gonna retire your ass.

1012

My leg's back. I ain't done yet.

You got a stump on a stick
and no chance of beating Hanks, son.

- All I wanted was to stay one.

You want to beat Hanks,
you got to go around him...

Yes, sir.

1026
01:45:45,262 --> 01:45:49,099
Then why is it you don't know
where Chief Brashear is?

1027
01:45:49,808 --> 01:45:51,768
He shouldn't be too hard to spot.

He's the only negro diver
in the Navy...

...and he's got one leg.

It seems that the chief
has transferred, sir.

I see. Fine.

Four weeks to train him,

The Navy I grew up in

A diver's life may depend on you.

Do you honestly feel that,
as a man...

1064
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:53,362
You're almost 40.

1065

You have one leg.

1066
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:59,409
Can you really keep up
with healthy divers half your age?

1067
01:51:00,244 --> 01:51:02,079
The question is, sir:

1068
01:51:02,412 --> 01:51:03,997
Can they keep up with me?

1069
01:51:10,587 --> 01:51:11,922
No smoking, chief.

1070
01:51:28,313 --> 01:51:32,776
Navy diving studies indicate that
if a subject were to become...

1071
01:51:32,985 --> 01:51:35,612
...unconscious or deceased...

1072
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:39,908
...the disparity between the buoyancy
of a prosthetic...

1073
01:51:40,117 --> 01:51:43,245
...and a limb would hinder him
in a free dive mode.

1074
01:51:43,453 --> 01:51:47,040
You mean if he drowned,
he wouldn't float right, yes?

1075
01:51:48,292 --> 01:51:51,795
Sirs, I promise
if I am killed at sea...

1076
01:51:52,045 --> 01:51:54,631
...I will make every effort
to die like a Navy man.

Yes, sir, I could.

- I want them all to see, sir.

1095
01:53:16,505 --> 01:53:19,132
Captain, I concur
with your assessment.

1096
01:53:23,554 --> 01:53:26,098
These slippery floors prohibit
a demonstration.

1097
01:53:26,306 --> 01:53:28,642
Haven't you had enough career trouble?

1098
01:53:29,226 --> 01:53:31,395
Your advice and presence
are unwelcome.

1099
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:34,731
- Who is this man?
- Chief Leslie W. Sunday, sir.

1100
01:53:35,774 --> 01:53:39,278
<i>You swam out of the Saint Lo
at Leyte Gulf.</i>

1101
01:53:41,029 --> 01:53:42,406
Held your breath for...

1102
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:45,576
...four minutes.
- Five, sir.

1103
01:53:49,204 --> 01:53:50,330
He can stay.

1104
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:55,502
HANKS:
Fine. Irrelevant.

1105
01:53:56,378 --> 01:53:59,631
Gentlemen, sirs, returning
to the issue at hand...

1106
01:53:59,965 --> 01:54:03,969
...this is not the time or place
for Senior Chief Bra...

1107
01:54:05,929 --> 01:54:08,640
Excuse me, senior chief.
Is there a problem?

1108
01:54:12,644 --> 01:54:13,645
Captain Hanks...

1109
01:54:14,813 --> 01:54:18,150
...I've spent my life in the Navy
trying only to succeed.

1110
01:54:18,609 --> 01:54:22,112
But my quest has caused great
personal loss to those who love me.

1111
01:54:22,779 --> 01:54:24,740
They too have made sacrifices.

1112
01:54:24,948 --> 01:54:27,951
They too have endured
great pains to support me.

1113
01:54:28,202 --> 01:54:30,704
If I walk these 12 steps today...

1114
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:33,332
...reinstate me to active duty.

1115
01:54:33,874 --> 01:54:35,459
Give me my career back.

1116
01:54:35,918 --> 01:54:39,213
Let me finish it,
and go home in peace.

1117
01:54:42,341 --> 01:54:45,594
Senior Chief Brashear,
the business of the modern Navy...

1118
01:54:45,802 --> 01:54:49,765
Forgive me, sir, but to me
the Navy is not a business.

1119
01:54:50,015 --> 01:54:53,727
We have many traditions. In my
career, I've experienced most of them.

1120
01:54:53,936 --> 01:54:56,396
Some good, some bad.

1121
01:54:56,688 --> 01:55:00,484
However, I wouldn't be here today
if not for our greatest tradition.

1122
01:55:01,693 --> 01:55:03,237
And which one is that?

1123
01:55:04,821 --> 01:55:06,073
Honor, sir.

1124
01:55:14,998 --> 01:55:17,459
Get on with it, senior chief.

1125
01:55:21,004 --> 01:55:22,339
Leslie?

1126
01:55:24,174 --> 01:55:25,717
What leg you got on?

1127
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:27,845
My walking leg...

1128
01:55:28,053 --> 01:55:29,304
...Leslie.

1129
01:55:29,513 --> 01:55:31,139
It was my dad's name.
Got a problem?

1130
01:55:31,348 --> 01:55:33,851
Oh, no, no problem at all.

1131
01:55:40,524 --> 01:55:43,610
That thing's light duty.
It'll snap like a matchstick.

1132
01:55:43,819 --> 01:55:47,030
- I'll put my weight on my good leg.
- 290 pounds on one leg?

1133
01:55:47,239 --> 01:55:50,200
You'll be passed out by the sixth step.

1134
01:55:52,369 --> 01:55:54,580
Tenders, hat the diver.

1135
01:56:44,213 --> 01:56:46,215
Navy diver, stand up.

1136
01:56:48,217 --> 01:56:49,343
Leave him.

1137
01:56:50,886 --> 01:56:55,474
Captain, if I recall Navy regulations,
the diver may be helped to his feet.

1138
01:56:56,558 --> 01:56:59,269
It's a lot of brass to sling up
from a seated position.

1139
01:56:59,978 --> 01:57:03,398
It's spun copper, chief.
We haven't used brass in a decade.

1140
01:57:03,607 --> 01:57:07,110
The new manual states the diver
must rise unassisted.

1141
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:09,321
That's what it says in the new book?

1142
01:57:10,822 --> 01:57:14,034
If I may ask, captain,
how would you know?

1143
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:15,869
I wrote it.

1144
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,416
Yes, sir.

1145
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:27,840
Navy diver...

1146
01:57:28,048 --> 01:57:29,466
...stand up.

1147
01:57:39,142 --> 01:57:41,812
Square that rig and approach the rail.

1148
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:03,709
One.

1149
01:58:06,545 --> 01:58:07,588
Two.

1150
01:58:10,757 --> 01:58:11,800
Three.

1151
01:58:15,429 --> 01:58:16,430
Four.

1152
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:20,767
Five.

1153
01:58:24,021 --> 01:58:25,022
Six.

1154
01:58:27,024 --> 01:58:28,025
Seven.

1155
01:58:31,195 --> 01:58:32,112
Eight.

1156
01:58:38,076 --> 01:58:39,203
Gentlemen, his leg.

1157
01:58:40,537 --> 01:58:41,622
HANKS:
Please.

1158
01:58:42,748 --> 01:58:43,749
HANKS:
Gentlemen.

1159
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:48,879
- Navy diver, stand down.
- Diver, you will disregard.

1160
01:58:49,254 --> 01:58:51,048
- This is my detail.
- Admiral?

1161
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:56,887
Goddamn it, Cookie, move your ass!
I want my 12.

1162
01:59:08,941 --> 01:59:11,318
Nine. The Navy diver
is not a fighting man.

1163
01:59:11,527 --> 01:59:13,570
He is a salvage expert.

1164
01:59:14,404 --> 01:59:16,990
Ten. If it's lost underwater,
he finds it.

1165
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:18,784
If it's sunk, he brings it up.

1166
01:59:18,992 --> 01:59:21,495
If it's in the way, he moves it.

1167
01:59:21,912 --> 01:59:26,708
Eleven. If he's lucky, he'll die
young, 200 feet beneath the waves.

1168
01:59:26,917 --> 01:59:29,878
For that is the closest
he will ever get to being a hero.

1169
01:59:30,087 --> 01:59:33,298
Hell, I don't know why anyone
would want to be a Navy diver.

1170
01:59:33,507 --> 01:59:36,176
Now you report to this line, Cookie.

1171
01:59:40,806 --> 01:59:42,558
At ease.

1172
01:59:55,654 --> 01:59:57,322
Tenders, unhat that diver.

1173
02:00:20,012 --> 02:00:23,056
The United States Navy
proudly reinstates...

1174
02:00:23,724 --> 02:00:25,517
...senior chief and diver...

1175
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:30,147
...Carl Brashear to full active duty.

1176
02:00:50,334 --> 02:00:51,376
Thank you.

1177
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:08,477
I can quit.

1178
02:01:09,061 --> 02:01:12,523
The man I married never quit anything
a day in his life.

1179
02:01:16,818 --> 02:01:18,070
I love you.

1180
02:01:18,278 --> 02:01:22,115
I love you too, baby.
I love you too.
