1
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:00,758
-We draw?
-Yes.

2
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:11,335
Wait a minute. Mama!
Close the window!

3
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:25,703
Basically I was a long skinny guy

4
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,715
Stop. I have something wrong here.
We give you a break.

5
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:07,376
When I first saw a professional game

6
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,800
It was a heavyweight match.

7
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,900
I first heard

8
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:16,345
as a human fist inside the glove strikes the head of a human being.

9
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:19,602
The sound of the beat I do not like

10
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,442
then I thought: Wow that's brutal!

11
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,262
When I had my first match, I was very nervous

12
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,522
I was afraid to fight, my legs were quite weak

13
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:49,897
felt that the audience is there a danger

14
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:52,307
and felt a lot of fear, but also that you have to survive

15
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:59,634
The difference between looking outside the ring and inside the ring is huge

16
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:06,688
Klitschko

17
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:52,547
Our opponents know our secret weapon

18
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:56,245
Only one of us is in the ring, but the opponent has to fight against us both.

19
00:03:56,245 --> 00:04:00,892
The pair are much stronger.

20
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:04,472
One other psychological power supply

21
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:07,691
and nobody can stop it.

22
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:35,539
Vitali is fighting in the heart,

23
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,806
born as a warrior
I did it had to happen.

24
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:43,526
As a boxer, but as you sekundant gets too much adrenaline

25
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:45,826
And as we enter the tunnel

26
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:50,822
has absolutely do not think about anything,

27
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:55,314
just what you expect and strategy.

28
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:03,202
As will be hit on the right and left.

29
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,467
has long range arms

30
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:08,968
you have to cover or retreat to the side

31
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:10,642
you have to catch up fast to cover a series of

32
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:15,969
but as you walk into a half away from you

33
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:16,953
you do a series of short strokes

34
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:19,004
lose balance and you have won

35
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:33,064
Zameriavaj ?drery the hull, no punches below the belt

36
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:35,959
the tail and no blows to the kidneys

37
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,490
If you send your opponent to the ground and throw on the side

38
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,224
accompanied him one more blow

39
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:44,724
you earned two points

40
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:48,744
If contact occurs without a fight I'll give you a sign STOP

41
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:53,035
Protect yourself time and was down by two steps back

42
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:21,147
The risk is enormous box

43
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,519
Every blow they could break the nose

44
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:31,285
You can lose an eye or even your life

45
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,882
However, if the athlete is afraid of injury or loss of health

46
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:41,415
If the athlete is not willing to give maximum
then can never be successful.

47
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:45,281
It is always terribly afraid when my kids boxes

48
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:50,726
but it is their life and have my blessing, but when boxes

49
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:55,723
Always I walk alone and I have cell phone with you

50
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:59,097
and waiting when it rings.

51
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,517
It brings you into madness

52
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:13,816
Vladimir will permanently leave the balance

53
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:17,222
Vladimir has a much stronger punch

54
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:22,069
no offense but Vitaliy Vladimir strike is really powerful.

55
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,350
All success starts outside the ring

56
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,522
You can sleep with empty stomach?

57
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:41,756
You can live without sex with your girlfriend?

58
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:45,683
We motivate each day enough?

59
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:48,324
Do you suffer from muscle?

60
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:51,885
Your nose is broken? A what?

61
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,668
You have to continue because this is a real ?ampi?nstvo!

62
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:08,503
Box sorts men from boys

63
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:13,887
It's really a male sport

64
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:19,388
Box is fair, if you are in the form turns out to

65
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,982
unless you are also to be seen.

66
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,482
If you're afraid to show it.

67
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:28,625
Box will be punished for your sins.

68
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,657
If you eat the cake and then enter the ring

69
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:38,474
show it!

70
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,394
Mama! I'm okay

71
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm fine.

72
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,161
Not anything like

73
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:11,056
Gash under the eye

74
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:13,257
Otherwise all good.

75
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:15,977
Avola from me and say everything is fine.

76
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:19,319
Then call again. And I said to him:

77
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,663
Vladimir did not forget anything for you?

78
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:26,538
I forgot to tell you that I love.

79
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,475


80
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:58,255
One day I was standing at the airport with Vital

81
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:03,640
away from us stood the father and son

82
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:07,551
  

83
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,407
When the boy saw Vitali asked:

84
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:13,563
It really is Vitali Klitschko?

85
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:16,346
Can I touch it?

86
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:19,721
For a child it was something special touch Vitali.

87
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:22,899
In the eyes of the boy was a lot of joy.

88
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,565
My son quickly won the hearts of people.

89
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,774
Vladimir and Vitali have a really unusual situation in their family

90
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:48,303
Their parents have two sons, who are champions in heavyweight.

91
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:53,787
It is unusual that their parents never attempt to watch the games their children,

92
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:57,382
On the other hand, family is very closed

93
00:13:57,382 --> 00:14:01,538
and you have to understand how growing up that you all understand

94
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:05,789
I never heard them talk about no one else

95
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:16,090
and it seems that there are only Vladimir and Vitali their parents.

96
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:38,663
I was born in Central Asia in 1971.

97
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:45,119
I Ukrainec, my father was in the military

98
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:49,304
As long as I lived with my parents

99
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:53,498
We traveled, almost across the Soviet Union

100
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,784
Then I worked. Vitaliy was 6 and Wowczik

101
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:09,807
what was pet name for Vladimir had one year

102
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:13,653
Vitali took care of his little brother

103
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,840
and I have flexible working hours

104
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:24,343
I went home and cooked for my young sons and then went back to work.

105
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:34,671
It was for me a huge responsibility

106
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:39,656
I had to take his brother wherever I go

107
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:44,406
and still take care of his little brother.
 
108
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:49,006
If I try to give him some advice today

109
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:55,688
It was not like him so much.

110
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,130
But he still remembered that when we were children,

111
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:04,398
parents gave me the responsibility to take care of him,

112
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,508
and still to this day I bear the responsibility.

112
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,508


113
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:33,282
I know that many people can not recognize Vladimir and Vitali

114
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:37,250
Many people think they are twins.

115
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,494
In fact, however, very different.

116
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:46,533
If Vitali is a goal

117
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,534
is behind

118
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:52,736
Vladimir also has its objectives

119
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:56,330
But goes beyond them carefully and diplomatickej?ie.

120
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:16,854
My father always traveled

121
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:19,734
from city to city

122
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:23,884


123
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:27,292
so I also constantly changing schools.

124
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,932
Vitali was always provoked by the school

125
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,657
So I taught him to defend himself.

126
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:45,887
And I said to him:

127
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,685
If you fight you win

128
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:54,685
no matter at what price.

129
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:20,723
We never foresaw,

130
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:26,349
that our sons to become a professional boxer.

131
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:32,054
One day a mother came with her son to us home

132
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:36,318
her son bleeding from the nose because he had broken

133
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,995
I told Vitaliy:

134
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,976
You need to apologize.

135
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,330
Vitali, however, said no.

136
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,478
I asked him: Why not?

137
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,640
He replied that it was just

138
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,728
because he threw the hat in a puddle,

139
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:52,824
I warned him but he threw me there again.

140
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:54,824
So I hit him.

141
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:40,093
My father was then in the army based in Kiev.

142
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:42,843
We came here from Prague, former Czechoslovakia

143
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:47,343
The father said that there is indeed only a few weeks

144
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:53,706
But these few weeks became two years.

145
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:55,186


146
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:58,207
In this small room to live five people.

147
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:03,014
Grandmother, mother, father, brother and I

148
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,099
and sometimes even a grandfather.

149
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,266


150
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:13,881
There was, however, the kitchen

151
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,859
directly, there was a wall once, but it's gone.

152
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:19,954
So there was a kitchen.

153
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:24,396
No shower, no toilet.

154
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,455
Toilet is outside.

155
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:29,300
And right there on the floor ...

156
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,650
Vitali shouted at me:

157
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,238
Come Vladimir Put the gloves and we box.

158
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:40,769
I was only 10 or 11 years and he wanted to box.

159
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:46,113
I stood right here, I remember it like yesterday

160
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:49,899
Vitali was standing right in front of me and udral me in the face.

161
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:53,461
I did not like it, I feared box.

162
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:19,211
Often I would take the children with me to the shooting

163
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,541
I showed them how to handle a weapon,

164
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,609
as well as charge and hit something.

165
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:45,668
Vitali as a kid always got himself

166
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:48,807
so little to the problems and

167
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:51,478
experimented a lot.

168
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:55,933
Once the shooting found some ammo and grenades

169
00:21:55,933 --> 00:22:00,470
So we threw them into the fire

170
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:03,220
that erupted.

171
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,122
It was fun: D

172
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:09,527
And once we found anti-tank mine

173
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,095
She looked like a plate,

174
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:17,173
I took it home and

175
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:21,406
jedniné place where I could hide
was under his father's bed

176
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,424
Then I went to sleep.
177
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:33,246
Suddenly I hear the father screaming, then came into my room

178
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:37,183
He asked: What is it?
"Mine" I say.

179
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:41,517
You took it home?
-Yes.

180
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:45,943
We had very strict parents

181
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:48,194
We often carried away with the belt.

182
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,254
Colonel!

183
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:59,408
Report the arrival of troops to secure the Chernobyl disaster ...

184
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:00,434

185
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:08,496
First they said that was something very wrong

186
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,832
Therefore, our base was Alarmed

187
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:21,443
Then I was commander of the air units,

188
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:28,225
immediately took us to the place where it became a disaster.

189
00:23:56,295 --> 00:24:01,513
Immediately after the explosion sent the workers there

190
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:07,952
with bare hands had odprat?va? radioactive waste.

191
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:24,581
You should go! Go away!

192
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:41,400
We used helicopters for stopping reactors

193
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:44,123
until I have been completely covered

194
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:48,669
Helicopters flew day and night away

195
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:45,592


196
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:51,952
only 100 meters as the crow flies from the window

197
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:53,108
But the point came

198
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:57,303
when we just got used to it.

199
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:11,629
The government hides the truth from the beginning

200
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:17,612
and wanted to downplay the situation.

201
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:22,347
We were told that the situation is under control.

202
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:34,736
Vehicles and helicopters had to be washed

203
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:34,911


204
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:49,535
There were a lot of water, naturally radioactive
and there I played with paper boats.

205
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,988


206
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,074


207
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:01,585
It was a great tragedy

208
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:05,586
Especially children are transported away

209
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:11,212
We sent to the camp of Vladimir Azov Sea

210
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:19,007
Who had the opportunity to leave, he went

211
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:24,871
But as a soldier must fulfill orders.

212
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:28,931
Many of my friends has absorbed a lethal dose of radiation

213
00:26:28,974 --> 00:26:32,807
and died.

214
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:34,807

215
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,521
His father spent much time in Chernobyl

216
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:59,207
and eventually became a victim of Chernobyl

217
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,990
Doctors said that is the result of Chernobyl ...

218
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,491
Cancer.

219
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:15,932
In Germany, the father got very good medical care.

220
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:19,587
Today he is doing given the circumstances quite well.

221
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:42,747
This is our gallery, here are all the photos

222
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:47,230
Our guest was also Chuck Norris.

223
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:51,922
Combat sports have long been banned in our country
224
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,955
even punished

225
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:59,208
as well as watching those films.

226
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:04,797
But as you know forbidden fruit tastes najle?ie

227
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:13,194
Boys and girls were fascinated Read these sports

228
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:17,159
People trained in karate every yard

229
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,883
Parents for us strive kimono of bed linen

230
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:29,930
We screamed like crazy and also tried rozb?ja? board.

231
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:33,035
We wanted to imitate everything.

232
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,429
In the rooms of my sons were posters Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris

233
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:40,336
and all the stars of the Western world.

234
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,180
All these stars were in perfect form
 
235
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,515
and my sons wanted to be just like them.

236
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:50,950
The whole room had obve?an? posters and photos

237
00:28:57,913 --> 00:29:00,162
Once when I was one of the illegal training

238
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:03,846
some teenagers came

239
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:06,723
when I show them some basics

240
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:09,738
one of them was completely uncoordinated

241
00:29:09,738 --> 00:29:15,644
When I told him to rob the right made it to the left

242
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:24,146
always did the opposite as I said.

243
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,036
That's how I met Vitali Klitschko.

244
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:46,640
In 1989, the prohibition of the operation was canceled Kickboxing

245
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:26,216
He became a champion in Kickboxing in Ukraine

246
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:30,500
then master of the Soviet Union

247
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:34,099
Then he went to America at the invitation of tender.

248
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:58,067
When I was growing up we were scrubbed brains

249
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:02,738
every morning at school we had to write

250
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,259
what is bad for America

251
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:10,383
Taught us: America is our enemy,
America means capitalism

252
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:13,537
They said that there are some people use others as slaves

253
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:17,024
Fed us from the nursery

254
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:23,932
Going to America was for me to go to the moon

255
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:43,702
I had heard a lot about Coca Cole

256
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:47,685
When I first tasted

257
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:51,904
I thought that I could drink it all K?bel.

258
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,219
I was absolutely thrilled

259
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:02,310
that we could run all day to shop.

260
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,267
We looked left, right with mouth open

261
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:08,032
Of course I had no money

262
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:11,078
so we have targeted only the smell and touch things.

263
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,328


264
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:23,659
I thought, why is whom 100 kinds of cheese?

265
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,242
That's incredible

266
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:30,502
We are only one kind of cheese: Cheese

267
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:34,378
They are 100 species that I could not understand.

268
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:36,612
Also, many pairs of shoes.

269
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:39,582
In our country, I needed a few

270
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,363
be two - one for sport


271
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:52,039
When I returned home I asked the father

272
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,960
who was a Communist

273
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,306
What are the things that you hear every day?

274
00:32:59,885 --> 00:33:03,934
America is a beautiful country with friendly people

275
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:06,962
I remember his reply:

276
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:10,749
Not only do you want to show the good side

277
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:15,920
this is america is evil propaganda.

278
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,473
My parents like to go to Florida in the winter

279
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,180
because it is winter in Ukraine.

280
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,087
I understand what you went through my father in my life

281
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,912
but now can see America with different eyes

282
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:52,386
so now go to Florida Due to leave.

283
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,220
And I like him not only weather but also the people and country.

284
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:34,483
Look at her father, a soldier who believes in discipline

285
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:39,324
senior military officer

286
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:43,015
That nothing would be achieved without discipline.

287
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:46,886
Vladimir and Vitali are very proud of him
 
288
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:58,995
These two brothers are not long-haired guys

289
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:02,670
with piercings and earrings and such things.

290
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,196
Someone should be able to present them as soldiers or policemen

290
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:10,310
or as chairperson of a company.

292
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,465
This fact has been conducted.

293
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:27,251
Vitali came from kickboxing.

294
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:31,094
He was perfectly trained body but only 90 pounds

295
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,361
I knew immediately that it would be difficult to be switched to boxing.

296
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,269
Ran around the stadium and finished

297
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:46,127
if it nepichalo in the side.

298
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,127

299
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:51,345
Vitali is not so fast!

300
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:53,259
So add.

301
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:05,282
Today, for the laughs and says that I tortured him.

302
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:09,142
and I think it was true, I tortured him.

303
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:11,176
But the result is not really good.


304
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:16,830


305
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:22,661
Wadim, my coach gave me a lot of power when it was really hard

306
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,088
I remember that I wanted to quit

307
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:31,504
because I have non-government, I had no strength

308
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:33,928
I thought, I do not want to train, I'm sick of it

309
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:35,791
My body is nezvl?dalo

310
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,616
Mind telling me: you do not need to do these things

311
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:44,151
but still I trained

312
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:47,197
and it was not easy.

313
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:48,820


314
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,838
One day he came Vitali

315
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:02,541
and can not say whether his brother come?

316
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,328
I say: Sure no problem.

317
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,682
Since then, always went together

318
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:23,227
How can you compare Vitali and Vladimir?

319
00:37:24,227 --> 00:37:26,527
Vitali is like a stone

320
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:30,377
Vladimir is like clay.

321
00:37:38,377 --> 00:37:41,937
With Vitali it takes some time to learn if

322
00:37:41,937 --> 00:37:44,987
but it takes time until the stone breaks

323
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:52,987
Vladimir was easier to train but also easier to break.

324
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:56,387
They are two different boxers

325
00:37:56,387 --> 00:38:03,467
I had to treat them and train differently.


326
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:22,507
I met them at a disco in 1993

327
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:26,986
the American Club in the city center

328
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:30,699
arrived there on the ice, which was then very popular car

329
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:33,605
the color of wet asphalt

330
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:36,105
It was the most car then what you have.

331
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:40,745
Mali wearing sports jerseys and so entered the disco

332
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:45,122
It was a top disco across Ukraine

333
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,811
We cried because of panthers

334
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:51,907
always went together and moved onto the Panthers as

335
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:55,846
The girls rotate and said: Wow these are Klitschkovci

336
00:38:55,846 --> 00:39:01,262
were then still known as such, but now given the easily recognizable

337
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:05,263
they were moved onto high and as a panther.

338
00:39:05,263 --> 00:39:11,693
I think not dance, but always played billiards and looked at pretty girls ...

339
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:29,471
You must understand that in 1992 the city of Kiew

340
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:32,128
that people are leaving to move somewhere else.

341
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:34,660
After the collapse of the Soviet Union

342
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,020
the intelligent and wealthy people aware
343
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,785
in Kiew is the future.

344
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:45,738
Then emigrated to Germany or America

345
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:48,697
They were difficult times for Ukraine.

346
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:59,322
They were difficult times for the company

347
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:01,227
economy fell

348
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:04,038
the whole Soviet system fell

349
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:07,773
He wanted the new system, but how old was killed

350
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:12,229
there were no laws regulating just nothing

351
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:16,493
There were huge social problems

352
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:21,354
Many professional athletes have become criminals.

353
00:40:21,354 --> 00:40:25,152
Rob people in broad daylight.

354
00:40:25,354 --> 00:40:30,152
They became mafia, real mafia.

355
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:44,549
When I was a child my father would say:

356
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:49,051
Boy you're everything, you have strong skills.

357
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:53,627
You do not go to school, join the army.

358
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:59,088
Such advice my father tried to give.

359
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:03,583
But it is not easily earned money on this trip is not for me.

360
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:06,584
You know what you want from life.

361
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,052
Somewhere here was the center of the ring.

362
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:36,147
Ring was on the green line to ...
no, it was a 5x5 meter here somewhere

365
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:45,024
Need team of 11 to 15 boxers

366
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:48,102
because some of them may opt out for any reason.

367
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:52,040
Each victory gives you points so you can not afford to waver

368
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,483
We participated in the amateur boxing federation Berlin

369
00:41:56,483 --> 00:41:58,525
to help us in finding new hope.

370
00:42:08,052 --> 00:42:12,736
We saw Vitali and thought that has very good potential

371
00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:15,909
We offered him spar in the German league

372
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,196
which began in November.

373
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:21,457
He agreed, but before

374
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:24,597
there was a military facility in Bankogu,

375
00:42:24,597 --> 00:42:27,255
where he received suspensions.

376
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:30,148
We learned about it only three weeks before the start of our league

377
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:33,473
We had paid for his money

378
00:42:33,473 --> 00:42:36,880
Therefore it was with us in Flensburg.

379
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,039
But not now compete for the suspensions.

380
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:43,820
We looked like idiots, but when we called on Ukraine

381
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,368
They said: No problem, we have a boxer

382
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:50,274
Vitali-looking just like

383
00:42:50,274 --> 00:42:54,632
and it's just as good.


384
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:04,074
Actually, we had no other alternative as we arrived at the airport

385
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:08,226
We see in this guy who comes out of the hall and looks exactly like Vitali.

386
00:43:08,226 --> 00:43:13,476
We look at ourselves and say: It must be Vitali Klitschko.

387
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:17,634
Impossible to someone so similar to

388
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:21,683
until we found out that Vitali has a brother,

389
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:25,367
No one told us about it and

390
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:28,353
or about to come his brother.

391
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:32,463


392
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:40,494
Here in Flensburg to achieve a new dimension of the box

393
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,606
New Star came from Ukraine

394
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:46,995
and the only 19 year old Vladimir Klitschko.

394
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:57,995
The match ended in a minute.

395
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:07,169
Vladimir Klitschko lost only 10 of his 120 amateur meetings.

396
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:10,093
Ukraine has in him the great hope for the Olympic Games.

397
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:17,142
We watched Oplymp?jske games

398
00:44:17,142 --> 00:44:20,610
because we had a contract with Vladimir for next season.

399
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:24,610
There he became an Olympic champion, which was fantastic

400
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:28,298
We were proud that we have a team Olympic Champion.

401
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,473
Have we a new hall for more people

402
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:34,925
because matches will now want to see more than 1200 people

403
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,863
It was said to number 4,000 people.

404
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:42,457
But then we heard the news that both brothers

405
00:44:42,457 --> 00:44:44,948
go into professional boxing.

406
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:46,964
So plans for the arena fell.

407
00:45:02,306 --> 00:45:07,220
When Vladimir became the Olympic champion,

408
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:12,987
guy next to me says: Congratulations to success.

409
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,566
Here is the phone Don King wants to talk to you.

410
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:26,111
Hello, here is Don King. Congratulations to the success of a brother.

411
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:30,442
I would be happy if you and I could see his brother

412
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:33,818
You are welcome in my house.

413
00:45:33,354 --> 00:45:35,069
I was completely surprised.

414
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:38,303
Don King? Don King!

415
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:43,041
Manager Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson.

416
00:45:43,585 --> 00:45:46,883
Complete surprise.

417
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:47,774


418
00:45:50,587 --> 00:45:53,337
I told about Vladimir

419
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:56,122
and we decided to go for him in America.

420
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,689
If you want to sign any contract you have a good lawyer

421
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:06,425
I've seen it many times

422
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:10,047
A friend, a good boxer has signed a contract with the promoter itself completely

423
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:14,998
whose name we all know, but I will not appoint him now,

424
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:18,454
I asked him why he signed a contract without a lawyer?

425
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:22,984
He said he showed me more money than I had ever seen in my life.

426
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,370
The promoter told him that he offered the money only once

427
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,970
times offer comes.

428
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,670
So you just signed.

429
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,470
Well signed to the devil.

430
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,970
Hi Vitali.

431
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,670
Great to see you.

432
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:00,757
Hi guys. I watch your entire career.

433
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:04,841
You are the best.

434
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:10,148
Sign the contract and you have mountains of gold.

435
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:13,230
What did he say? Mountains of gold?

436
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,915
Simply just sign ...

437
00:47:15,915 --> 00:47:17,791
I thought not.

438
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:22,354
Vladimir I say: do not sign anything.

439
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:25,057
Will earn lots of money

440
00:47:25,057 --> 00:47:27,136


441
00:47:30,452 --> 00:47:33,513
We will be one big happy family

442
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:41,904
Piano. Don King said that a special play for us.

443
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,015
A really began to play professionally

444
00:47:56,568 --> 00:48:00,007
It was really impressive

445
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:05,065
not only the boxing promoter, but also an artist.

446
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:11,019
Don Giovanni - W.A. Mozart

447
00:48:19,237 --> 00:48:22,384
Yes, the real artist ...

448
00:48:22,854 --> 00:48:27,239
Except when I underwent a piano to see that he does not play at all

449
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,616
piano keys moved up and down all by yourself.

450
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,412
It pedals that moved without the help of Don King.


451
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:42,686
So!

452
00:48:42,983 --> 00:48:44,688
I'm from Berlin.

453
00:48:45,393 --> 00:48:47,349
He was a good actor.

454
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:49,859
We decided not to sign

455
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:53,033
contract with Don King as played fairly.

456
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,861

457
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:59,331
Do not get a better promoter.

458
00:49:36,561 --> 00:49:40,793
It is normal that when you become Olympic champion in the heavyweight

459
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:45,640
so you want to sign any contract.

460
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,773
But we should then have a closer relationship with Klitschkovcami.

461
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:51,030
Now give it to all!

462
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,236
There are many ways to train boxers

463
00:49:57,236 --> 00:50:01,298
But Vladimir was very young, and had no experience with professional box

464
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,142
Vitali as well.

465
00:50:03,142 --> 00:50:05,424
No matter how much sparring and training you have

466
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:08,101
professional ring is something else.

467
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:11,394
PROFIDEBT 16th November 1996

468
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:16,833
When I had my first pro fight, it was something new

469
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,295
smaller gloves, no shirts, no head protection

470
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:21,850
I was a little nervous.

471
00:50:23,445 --> 00:50:26,512
You feel the heat reflectors ringo

472
00:50:27,602 --> 00:50:32,554
then you see your opponent in the second corner and suddenly you will,

473
00:50:35,196 --> 00:50:38,733
struggle that awaits you.


474
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:52,668
I felt a tremendous power in the hands of

475
00:50:52,668 --> 00:50:56,047
and at the same pastes,

476
00:50:56,283 --> 00:51:00,768
because I had a smaller glove,

477
00:51:00,982 --> 00:51:03,268
the blows landed on an opponent.

478
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:12,749
It went very quickly

479
00:51:12,749 --> 00:51:15,858
and the opponent was on the ground.

480
00:51:15,858 --> 00:51:18,782
I thought not raised!

481
00:51:18,782 --> 00:51:21,551
I felt a killer instinct.

482
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:23,899
Not raised! Not raised! Because I'll kill you!

483
00:51:24,396 --> 00:51:26,002
He got up.

484
00:51:49,503 --> 00:51:52,148
Before the match I expect him to knock

485
00:51:52,148 --> 00:51:54,691
but I realized what I was capable.

486
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:58,337
That's how I started in the professional ring.

487
00:51:57,337 --> 00:52:00,693


488
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:05,755
Won by KO in the first minute and 36 second

489
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,116
Vladimir Klitschko.

490
00:52:32,826 --> 00:52:36,451
From the very beginning they were very curious.
491
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:40,076
What is the plan? What happens next?

492
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:43,597
The plan was to become world champions

493
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:46,579
I knew it from the beginning.

494
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:51,032
People laughed at because they were tall and completely different.

494
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:49,032


495
00:52:58,273 --> 00:53:04,445
As a professional boxing began, distributing itself KO

496
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:08,135
Usually both the same night in an event

497
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:13,258
all realize that they are incredibly strong.

498
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:14,119


499
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:23,260
Vitali has an unorthodox style

500
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,698
His brother Vladimir is called severe style.

501
00:53:26,698 --> 00:53:31,012
Vitali is very nepredv?date?n?, fights as a Cowboy

502
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:34,357
his hands are very low and suddenly shoots powerful punch.

503
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,887
Moreover, great reflexes,

504
00:53:38,669 --> 00:53:43,064
therefore used to cover his sufficient defense reflexes.

505
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,872
Vladimir has a classic style

506
00:53:49,872 --> 00:53:53,764
has a very strong left punch

507
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:57,111
which controls the fight.

508
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:59,126
That is his main weapon.

509
00:53:59,377 --> 00:54:01,954
Also very smart boxes

510
00:54:01,954 --> 00:54:05,892
According to him it's like playing chess.

511
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:14,407
I quickly realized that both are special Klitschovci

512
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:17,229
and both can become world champions.

513
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:20,168
Maybe both of them but at least one of them.

514
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:36,360
I am happy because it was a record,

515
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,815
which is still registered in the Guinness Book of Records

516
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:50,769
I knocked him to start the second round

517
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:53,567
which was quicker than Mike Tyson,

518
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:56,090
who previously held the record.

519
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,358
In 2000 I began writing about boxing for full-time

520
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,018
Klitschkovci had already been stars in Europe.

521
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,455
Since then I started to follow their career

522
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:29,173
Vitali took the WBO title Herbie Hidovi

523
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:32,626
but in America no one took him seriously.

524
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:36,047
People in America think:

525
00:55:36,047 --> 00:55:38,813
If you want to prove something

526
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:41,077
Americans must fight to earn respect.

527
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,677
When I entered with him into the ring

528
00:56:01,677 --> 00:56:05,726
I relied tall boxers that are slow

529
00:56:05,726 --> 00:56:09,012
against them, I was always faster, so the fights I overindulge

530
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:12,056
But Vitali was different, I could not reach him.

531
00:56:11,056 --> 00:56:14,558
 

532
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:21,180
Vitali had a phase where he believed that his body tells him enough

533
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,658



534
00:56:22,658 --> 00:56:25,074
It was Vitali biggest handicap.

535
00:56:25,074 --> 00:56:28,715
And that's exactly happened against Chris Byrd.

536
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,466
In the third round I got hit in the arm

537
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:37,342
or it was some movement

538
00:56:37,342 --> 00:56:41,998
after which I began to feel great pain in the shoulder.

539
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,934
From that moment I saw more of the opponent.

540
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,277
As if I had eyes in the fog.

541
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:53,596
pain intensified and I began to lose power.

542
00:57:01,596 --> 00:57:04,822
Vitali has a point prevalence

543
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:11,965
Once surrendered the match, no one understood it

544
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:21,850
He had a lot of pain

545
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:27,351
and when I realized that it can no longer defend

546
00:57:27,351 --> 00:57:29,053
and no further chance so I track match.

547
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:31,369
I know the people in their charge

548
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:34,413
So I know whether or not they have more chance

549
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:37,041
and if I close match.

550
00:57:41,852 --> 00:57:45,229
He resigned in the championship match with an opponent with whom he won

551
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:48,980
He remained vysmiaty from fans and the media

552
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:54,794
People did not see any blood

553
00:57:54,794 --> 00:57:58,762
no broken nose, broken eye or any other cause

554
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:04,233
They did not know that the shoulder injury.

555
00:58:09,441 --> 00:58:14,376
I remember that after the match

556
00:58:14,376 --> 00:58:17,984
I could not sleep so I went to Vitaliy

557
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:20,844
He was sitting at home alone and I saw that

558
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:23,236
reads all the newspapers in which he cursed variety.

559
00:58:23,236 --> 00:58:25,922
I knew he needed psychological support

560
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:28,020
I told him that we have to hold press conference

561
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,613
and say that doctors have confirmed that if it continued to struggle

562
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:34,253
You can complete tendon tear supraspinat?lnu

563
00:58:34,253 --> 00:58:36,276
and it would end his career.

564
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:41,891

564
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:41,891
Then I received a letter from Max Schmeling

565
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:44,317
Really helped me psychologically.

566
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:48,505
Max wrote: I have been a few times in my life counting down on the ground

567
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:51,536
but most importantly do not stop at country

568
00:58:52,363 --> 00:59:00,934
You find the strength within himself to pick up and move on

569
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:29,645
First, we are not weak!

570
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:35,483
The second time, now I'm world champion

571
00:59:35,483 --> 00:59:39,334
Third, I love my brother.


572
00:59:43,428 --> 00:59:48,257
The title is returned to the family through Vladimir.

573
00:59:48,257 --> 00:59:52,830
One brother always compensate for the failure of the other

574
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,902
all in the family has returned to its place.

575
00:59:57,143 --> 01:00:00,381
It was a match that right to take

576
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:04,381
well-known in Germany,

577
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:07,398
mainly because they identify with their country

578
01:00:07,398 --> 01:00:10,692
and in what they do is exceptional.

579
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:14,098
People see that Klitschkovci

580
01:00:14,098 --> 01:00:16,582
Germany seems to have adopted the

581
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:20,774
for his second home since 1996.

582
01:00:20,774 --> 01:00:23,788
Therefore Klitschkovci so popular.

583
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:26,663
That's me?

584
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:28,227
I like how boxujete.

585
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,789
Your brother also.


586
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:06,630
Max Schmeling was a great inspiration for me

587
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:11,538
Inside the ring, but mainly outside the ring.

588
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:17,614
I am very glad that we became friends.

589
01:01:17,614 --> 01:01:19,458
Max once said:

590
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:23,320
To be a true boxing champions, you have to go to America.

591
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,867
You have to box in the U.S..

592
01:01:40,652 --> 01:01:45,557
We were preparing for another opponent as was Lewis.

593
01:01:45,557 --> 01:01:48,948
While we train in Los Angeles

594
01:01:48,948 --> 01:01:51,809
we heard that Lewis was wounded opponent.

595
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:54,604
Op?tlali us whether we are willing to fight against Lennox.

596
01:01:54,604 --> 01:01:59,372
Once we have agreed to fight remained three weeks.

597
01:01:59,372 --> 01:02:03,122
We also exchanged our sparring partners.

598
01:02:03,122 --> 01:02:05,589
Vitali was excited about this opportunity.

599
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:10,234
In Kiev, the Ukraine, Vitali Klitschko!

600
01:02:18,591 --> 01:02:22,442
It should be remembered that the battle with Lennox

601
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:28,410
Vitali was in the public reputation of a fighter without heart

602
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:34,305
because they gave up fight with Chris Byrd.

603
01:02:34,305 --> 01:02:38,377
All of America stared at him as a weakling.

604
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:47,570
A champion is coming, who said that Klitschko eats for lunch.

605
01:02:47,775 --> 01:02:50,979
He said that is not paid for overtime.

606
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:56,125
Until the end of the career coach Lennox Lewis Emanuel Steward.

607
01:02:57,151 --> 01:02:59,888
Never before have met two such

608
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:02,288
heavy and tall boxers to world championship belt.

609
01:03:17,899 --> 01:03:21,741
Lennox has always been more boxer in the ring

610
01:03:21,741 --> 01:03:24,963
but suddenly was no longer out of reach.

611
01:03:24,963 --> 01:03:28,853
Vitali hitting from all angles and very hard.

612
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:31,742
After the first round, I realized that we are in trouble.

613
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:58,076
The atmosphere in the arena was completely changed.

614
01:03:58,076 --> 01:04:00,655
In the beginning was against Vitaliy,

615
01:04:00,655 --> 01:04:03,458
and suddenly cried out Klitschko, Klitschko!

616
01:04:16,494 --> 01:04:19,712
I said Lennox: You lose the title, beating you

617
01:04:19,712 --> 01:04:23,821
You have to start a strike force to be dominant,

618
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:28,439
because if you get between the hooks can not spar with him.

619
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,761
Lewis began to believe more

620
01:04:38,197 --> 01:04:40,965
but the points still to play so well.

621
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:43,531
Nevertheless, Vitali was able to injure.

622
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:46,465


623
01:04:59,297 --> 01:05:06,594
It happened that the power head blow hole was right where the eye ball

624
01:05:06,874 --> 01:05:10,702
Orbital bone has sharp edges.

625
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:13,609
This edge can cause substantial damage

626
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:16,083
if the skin is hitting over this edge.

627
01:05:29,831 --> 01:05:35,083
There are 3 things that can stop bleeding.

628
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,223
First - what is Avertine substance that promotes blood clotting.

629
01:05:40,223 --> 01:05:45,271
The second is epinephrine, which has the same effect as epinephrine and stops bleeding

630
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,725
the third is a gel foam, which also stops bleeding

631
01:05:48,728 --> 01:05:53,725
but it must be attached directly to the wound.


632
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:09,245
Do you know the wounds are in the normal box.

633
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:14,446
But in boxing, people who complete the match for such a blow.

634
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,901
The real fighters, however, continue to struggle.

635
01:06:33,235 --> 01:06:36,783
Is there a way to induce bleeding.

636
01:06:36,783 --> 01:06:39,831
Gloves are in fact tied with twine at the bottom of the glove.

637
01:06:40,218 --> 01:06:44,719
then when you hit your opponent by tying it can cause

638
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,407
bleeding, or increase an existing wound.

639
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:05,095
When I looked at the wound

640
01:07:05,095 --> 01:07:07,300
tampon in the wound has completely vanished.

641
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,256
It hurt me just when I look at it.


642
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:49,291
On a scale from 1 to 10 the wound was on the 8-ball.

643
01:07:50,227 --> 01:07:54,965
Number 10 is the damage to arteries.

644
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:58,448
The greatest danger is that the wound increases

645
01:07:58,448 --> 01:08:03,952
in which case there may be permanent damage to the eye.

646
01:08:04,245 --> 01:08:07,813
So at this point

647
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:11,811
need to think about the end of the match.


648
01:08:14,613 --> 01:08:18,909
I remember only that the doctor came

649
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:21,349
in our corner, looked at the wound and shouted:

650
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:22,638
Full Time!


651
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:46,418
I think that no one wanted to end the match. We all wanted to continue.

652
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:48,850
But when it turned out that the wound was really serious

653
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,639
and the doctor made the decision to protect the health of Vitali

654
01:08:51,639 --> 01:08:54,768
I realized that it was a good decision from Ring's official.

655
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:59,284
Stopped the match despite the fact that Vitali wanted to continue.

656
01:09:01,896 --> 01:09:04,766
Despite losing the match was memorable

657
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,603
exactly what the fans want to see.

658
01:09:06,603 --> 01:09:09,754
Great action, both were injured.

659
01:09:09,754 --> 01:09:12,272
And even though Vitali lost the match

660
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:15,268
American audiences began to respect him.

661
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:18,268
My friend Lerry Merchant of HBO said it best:

662
01:09:18,272 --> 01:09:22,268
Lennox won the match, but Vitali won the evening.

663
01:09:40,408 --> 01:09:44,612
Now it has become like Vitali Gallic warrior.

664
01:09:44,612 --> 01:09:47,020
Despite his great victories

665
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:50,261
this was the most dramatic match.

666
01:09:50,261 --> 01:09:55,581
This game changed the look of it more than any other game.

667
01:10:00,022 --> 01:10:02,787
The wound was so deep that I had

668
01:10:02,787 --> 01:10:06,990
Fails to keep the two layers.

669
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:11,193
Outside it was about 120 inside and about 60 stitches.

670
01:10:22,099 --> 01:10:26,774
Boxing is no joke. It's brutal, dangerous.

671
01:10:26,774 --> 01:10:30,683
People who go box must understand

672
01:10:30,683 --> 01:10:34,461
Every opponent is dangerous.

673
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:40,026
In history there are many examples. For example, when

674
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:40,711


675
01:10:40,711 --> 01:10:43,391
Max Schmeling beat the previously undefeated Joe Louis.

676
01:10:43,391 --> 01:10:45,978
or Mike Tyson

677
01:10:45,978 --> 01:10:50,418
lost the match with Buster Dougles in Tokyo.

678
01:10:50,418 --> 01:10:53,059
I also lost a match with Corrie Sanders

679
01:10:53,059 --> 01:10:57,702
Nobody would say that I play.


680
01:10:57,702 --> 01:11:01,333
So in heavyweight history there are many examples

681
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:04,904
 when one decided to blow the match.

682
01:11:18,809 --> 01:11:22,107
I was on the ground and I was angry

683
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:26,013
You little ... This I will not do.

684
01:11:26,013 --> 01:11:29,031
Anyway plowed my ego as a tractor.

685
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:31,591
I wanted him to reciprocate


686
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:33,875
Vladimir made a mistake,

687
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:36,939
had to knock box with the front shock.

688
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:40,640
but he wanted to reciprocate quickly and so are not controlled.

689
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,691
He was too open and Corrie Sanders

690
01:11:43,691 --> 01:11:47,457
old veteran who was just waiting for it.

691
01:11:47,659 --> 01:11:51,064
Moreover, a very hard blow.

692
01:12:01,069 --> 01:12:05,064
This is a sport where everyone who has hit hard

693
01:12:05,099 --> 01:12:09,064
even if it can not say that,

694
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:14,064
has a chance to end the match with one blow.

695
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:18,064
In that one second can turn the match.

696
01:12:29,483 --> 01:12:32,014
Boxing is a brutal sport

697
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:42,439
I've already had four operations and will have another

698
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,755
I hope that I get a sight again.

699
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:50,378
Lamon Brewster lost his sight after the match with Robert Heleniusom
 
700
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:57,285
If you do not have anything in your life, no family, money, work, no chance

701
01:12:57,785 --> 01:13:00,861
then you can box.

702
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:05,020
That is why I do not understand that Klitschkovci become boxers

703
01:13:05,959 --> 01:13:10,676
The whole world was open to them, they are intelligent and educated

704
01:13:10,676 --> 01:13:15,910
They could be doctors or lawyers.

705
01:13:19,366 --> 01:13:21,973
Year later I had the chance again to a world boxing title

706
01:13:21,973 --> 01:13:24,655
We prepared with Vitali in Los Angeles.

707
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:28,365
We wanted to become masters at the same time in different organizations.

708
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:33,290
This is the heavyweight never happened before

709
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:38,868
Brewster and style was just for me.


710
01:13:54,733 --> 01:13:58,761
Vladimir gave a lot of hits

711
01:14:01,827 --> 01:14:06,516
but those punches, he returned with his

712
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:09,125
opponent can continue to struggle.


713
01:14:18,184 --> 01:14:22,935
It was one of those rounds that everything will change.

714
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:29,002
Vladimir is with the never knit reconciled.

715
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:44,140
I heard a gong and the referee came between us

716
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:47,205
I completely lost his balance

717
01:14:47,205 --> 01:14:51,362
and so I made a step forward that I did not fall

718
01:14:52,752 --> 01:14:57,879
However, I stumbled on the referee's legs.

719
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:02,756
Then I felt that I can not get up

720
01:15:18,382 --> 01:15:20,943
The woman was tested

721
01:15:20,943 --> 01:15:24,039
look into my eyes but could not because I could not keep his head

722
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:27,546
I also could not open my eyes.

723
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:32,788
then said that my pupils are too open

724
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:36,385
and that there is a suspicion of a brain haemorrhage.

725
01:15:48,116 --> 01:15:54,462
Of memory as we were in the ambulance, and I heard sirens

726
01:15:54,462 --> 01:15:59,118
My brother was with me, but I could not tell

727
01:15:59,118 --> 01:16:01,185
one brother, what I said was:

728
01:16:01,185 --> 01:16:04,669
I'm sorry that I broke it.

729
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:10,980
When Vladimir was in the hospital,

730
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,878
Vitali called their mother and they both wept.

731
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:18,250
There were bad moments.

732
01:16:19,546 --> 01:16:23,312
Vitali told me the whole truth, so I will not bother

733
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:28,204
had to carry everything yourself.

734
01:16:36,299 --> 01:16:39,357
An hour later I woke up

735
01:16:39,357 --> 01:16:43,719
I could talk again,

736
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:47,393
I stood and I left the hospital

737
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,239
The next morning we Vitali and I sat on the plane

738
01:16:57,455 --> 01:17:02,647
Vitali said: Look directly into the mirror

739
01:17:05,223 --> 01:17:08,848
Then he said: I think your boxing career is over.

740
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:16,149
I think it is the end of the road Vladimir.

741
01:17:37,155 --> 01:17:42,663
Vladimir and I have walked the streets of New York

742
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:48,148
Suddenly a guy came up and said: Hello Mr. Stewart, health Klitschko

743
01:17:48,148 --> 01:17:50,586
A great match with Lewis, I really enjoyed it!

744
01:17:51,086 --> 01:17:57,282
I tell him: This is Vitali's is Vladimir.

745
01:17:57,282 --> 01:18:02,294
The guy says: Oh, Vladimir, the boxer is unable to stay and has no stamina.

746
01:18:02,338 --> 01:18:08,701
It was really embarrassed I wanted to hit this guy.

747
01:18:08,906 --> 01:18:12,356
Vladimir me and let's not just

748
01:18:12,356 --> 01:18:16,407
left in tears because it hurt him.

749
01:18:16,751 --> 01:18:19,982
Vladimir told me since I started playing sports

750
01:18:19,982 --> 01:18:25,720
I was always a star, I was always top.

751
01:18:25,797 --> 01:18:29,892
Suddenly I am on the day.
  

752
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:53,287
Vitali if he did not believe his brother was difficult for Vladimir.

753
01:18:53,287 --> 01:18:58,775
Vladimir completely changed the whole team.

754
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:01,836
He told me:

755
01:19:01,836 --> 01:19:04,386
We need to focus on my strengths

756
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:07,871
and my team needs me to do everything

757
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:10,869
They must stand behind me.

758
01:19:11,604 --> 01:19:15,493
I think I'm the only one who actually replaced.

759
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:58,641
Vladimir likes praise, but does not like criticism.

760
01:19:58,924 --> 01:20:04,826
I like criticism, because it gives you the opportunity to improve.

761
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:12,142
I came to the training center, I saw a pair of Vladimir

762
01:20:12,347 --> 01:20:15,298
He was not in good shape.

763
01:20:15,298 --> 01:20:26,626
He made beginner mistakes and his coach said: Excellent, excellent.

764
01:20:26,828 --> 01:20:32,158
I said, Stop! What is excellent which is great?

765
01:20:32,615 --> 01:20:35,266
This is terrible!

766
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:43,018
I criticized him and coach him praise,

767
01:20:46,301 --> 01:20:52,430
Vitali should always talk about things that do not like him

768
01:20:54,430 --> 01:21:02,520
This was the first time we were screaming at each other.

769
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:13,932
Vladimir said: Everything was fine until you came.

770
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:18,932
Then he told me: Vital news for me something

771
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:21,932
Vitali, do not be angry

772
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:26,932
but I do not want to be in my training camp.

773
01:21:26,964 --> 01:21:29,236
I train alone.

774
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:34,221
I said that I know is that adult

775
01:21:34,221 --> 01:21:37,117
I have a good team.

776
01:21:37,117 --> 01:21:40,618
If you want advice from older brother, will not hinder him.


777
01:21:46,184 --> 01:21:54,778
What always struck me was that the box appeared to be a sport for them

778
01:21:54,778 --> 01:22:02,856
You can play football, baseball, basketball

779
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:10,491
But you can not play boxing, boxing a serious thing.

780
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:15,312
American boxer believe Klitschkovcom,

781
01:22:15,743 --> 01:22:23,238
believe they have the mental strength to be true boxer, let alone champions.

782
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,802
Vladimir realized that everything must change

783
01:22:28,802 --> 01:22:34,255
I told him that I believe in white.

784
01:22:34,255 --> 01:22:38,473
White shoes generates more power.

785
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:43,193
Black is too slow, with black shoes you slower.

786
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:48,365
We started using cocoa butter instead of grease

787
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:51,232
because cocoa butter is absorbed into the skin and makes it softer.

788
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:55,117
Vaseline just remains on the surface.

789
01:22:56,133 --> 01:23:02,117
It was on his protective belt too much weight

790
01:23:02,117 --> 01:23:08,789
so he took a razor and cut some skin from there.

791
01:23:09,011 --> 01:23:12,368
so we focused on many details

792
01:23:12,996 --> 01:23:17,245
Because the small things make big rodiely in battle.

793
01:23:20,047 --> 01:23:24,081
Ponatieraj the sauce by the man!

794
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,905
Relax, this is not your concern.

795
01:23:27,615 --> 01:23:30,999
Did you know at all what it is grill until you recognize me?

796
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:35,220
We do not use any special diet.

797
01:23:35,421 --> 01:23:38,342
Mainly fresh products.

798
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:46,843
Not too much salt, no fatty foods, creamy sauces and things

799
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:52,645
Many proteins, fruits, vegetables

800
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:55,708
Just common sense ...

801
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:59,096
And in addition to desserts, chocolates, cakes ...

802
01:23:59,097 --> 01:23:59,696

803
01:24:01,784 --> 01:24:07,725
Usually no one but me to touch the grill

804
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:10,220
because I grill

805
01:24:10,271 --> 01:24:13,900
David has learned how to broil.

806
01:24:13,845 --> 01:24:21,445
Before I knew it but after 4 years is quite.

807
01:24:24,168 --> 01:24:27,309
Sometimes I call and Vitali says:

808
01:24:28,373 --> 01:24:31,561
Emanuel can ask Vladimir

809
01:24:31,825 --> 01:24:35,391
if I can come to camp for two days? I will not say anything.

810
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:39,140
So I go to the gym and I ask Vladimir and Vitali could lose.

811
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:43,278
Vladimir says Vitali can not come.

812
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:53,897
Did not you lower your skin?

813
01:24:55,742 --> 01:24:57,610
It prip?lnen?.


814
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:07,321
And then we natrafili the most feared boxer in the time

815
01:25:07,832 --> 01:25:11,305
undefeated Samuel Peter

816
01:25:11,512 --> 01:25:16,523
Nigerian nightmare.


817
01:25:23,853 --> 01:25:28,853
Sam Peter was undefeated and won all KO

818
01:25:28,853 --> 01:25:32,649
Maybe he won two matches at the time

819
01:25:32,915 --> 01:25:35,386
and 25 or 30 times won the KO.

820
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:37,954
It should be clear:

821
01:25:38,046 --> 01:25:41,667
Klitschko is a walking corpse.

822
01:26:07,635 --> 01:26:11,802
Vitali and all the team was really scared.

823
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:17,350
 No one wants this game except for Vladimir.

824
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:23,823
Vladimir said, Peter is best, there is no better return than this.

825
01:26:25,995 --> 01:26:29,604
I think of this match up I have gray hair

826
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:34,575
It was something incredible.


827
01:26:35,575 --> 01:26:36,432


828
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:04,173
Vitali likes of Vladimir will always be his older brother.

829
01:27:04,173 --> 01:27:08,672
When Vladimir nevidar? anything, including Vitali is rozhoden?

830
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:12,173
He will always protect his little brother.

831
01:27:37,421 --> 01:27:41,203
Peter was incredibly strong

832
01:27:41,582 --> 01:27:45,346
I'm hitting it from all power

833
01:27:45,346 --> 01:27:48,754
but I could not pass him.

834
01:27:51,034 --> 01:27:55,473
He was also very fast and I got bangs, so I had to be careful

835
01:28:19,324 --> 01:28:23,410
The match was back and forth in small time periods.

836
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:26,263
Vladimir was on the ground three times,

837
01:28:26,263 --> 01:28:29,858
twice for illegal blows to the tail head

838
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:56,003
a third time after a strong blow that really shook him,

839
01:28:56,285 --> 01:29:02,134
although in the opinion of experts was not written for losses

840
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:07,082
even if Vladimir has hardly stood on his feet.

841
01:29:14,222 --> 01:29:20,723
This was the most dramatic 12-round TE in my 56 year career.

842
01:29:20,963 --> 01:29:28,130
Vitali looked at me and says Emanuel handle it?

843
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:34,852
Still, we think that has a point prevalence

844
01:29:34,852 --> 01:29:39,323
So we prayed to pass through the 12-th round.

845
01:30:09,235 --> 01:30:12,702
I hit him left hook and was seen to have enough

846
01:30:19,798 --> 01:30:23,972
I wonder to this day that he did not go down.

847
01:30:24,579 --> 01:30:27,109
It was like a toy that

848
01:30:27,109 --> 01:30:30,764
is varied to the right and left.

849
01:30:30,764 --> 01:30:33,907


850
01:31:01,885 --> 01:31:04,171
Ladies and gentlemen we have a winner

851
01:31:04,256 --> 01:31:08,358
All three judges decided the same

852
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:22,514
114 to 111 for Stealhammer Vladimir Klitschko!

853
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:32,227
Highly respected Vladimir

854
01:31:32,227 --> 01:31:34,899
They are both true champions.

855
01:31:34,899 --> 01:31:37,806
Both experienced the bad part, but admits returned.

856
01:31:37,806 --> 01:31:41,912
These are the real champions.

857
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:53,488
It was very important to win this battle in the IBF and WBO

858
01:31:53,488 --> 01:31:58,472
My goal now is to match the title.

859
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:17,869
I am a fatalist, I believe in fate

860
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:22,913
I prepared the camp and I suffered a slipped disc.

861
01:32:25,742 --> 01:32:29,841
Then I had another injury, after other ...

862
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:32,654
I did not quite match a long time

863
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:38,011
and my opponent was this time my body.

863
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:36,011


864
01:32:55,037 --> 01:32:59,051
Then he had problems with knees, with shoulders.

865
01:32:59,051 --> 01:33:02,115
It all started with kickboxing, then had their first challenges

866
01:33:02,115 --> 01:33:05,211
which showed him at a later time.

867
01:33:05,726 --> 01:33:09,582
Everything that had accumulated in the preparation of Rasim Rahman

868
01:33:12,582 --> 01:33:17,630
That was my most expensive day in his career - $ 10 million.

869
01:33:18,013 --> 01:33:22,540
In the last training session the weekend before the game

870
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:25,211
you picked cross ligaments in the knee.

871
01:33:25,211 --> 01:33:28,152
Vitlali still wanted to wrestle,

872
01:33:28,152 --> 01:33:31,867
wanted to deploy a bandage but I told him that it will not work

873
01:33:32,368 --> 01:33:37,368
I told him, let him present,

874
01:33:37,368 --> 01:33:41,185
the game ends for knee without being hit.

875
01:33:41,386 --> 01:33:44,778
Everyone would think that a cheat or something worse ...

876
01:33:44,778 --> 01:33:48,385
They said that they took the money and cheated them.

877
01:33:55,398 --> 01:34:00,063
If you can not change anything, you begin to relax

878
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:03,356
So I said, Okay.

879
01:34:16,139 --> 01:34:20,263
Vitali parents and also I have advised him

880
01:34:20,889 --> 01:34:25,329
to try something other than politics.

881
01:34:25,723 --> 01:34:28,795
Politics is a very thankless matter

882
01:34:28,795 --> 01:34:32,611
But he said: I've decided.

883
01:34:38,192 --> 01:34:42,093
Ukraine has great potential, but development is not in the right direction

884
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,142
Corruption destroys the country again and again.

885
01:34:45,142 --> 01:34:47,894


886
01:34:45,648 --> 01:34:53,738
It is embarrassing to read ?tatisktiky that Ukraine is the most corrupt country in the world.

887
01:34:55,474 --> 01:34:59,283
MEPs have immunity

888
01:34:59,585 --> 01:35:04,175
and not afraid to persecute innocent people.

889
01:35:04,848 --> 01:35:08,427
There are many exemplary cases.

890
01:35:10,114 --> 01:35:13,260
Democracy is not able to change everything

891
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:16,508
and is unable to unite order

892
01:35:16,508 --> 01:35:19,161
make reforms

893
01:35:20,449 --> 01:35:23,754
I think that is why Vitali

894
01:35:23,996 --> 01:35:26,401
built his own party

895
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:31,914
on Western principles.

896
01:35:40,055 --> 01:35:44,744
The party has only 15 people in parliament, which is not much

897
01:35:44,744 --> 01:35:49,682
because Parliament has a total of 120 people.

898
01:35:49,682 --> 01:35:53,744
Although this is the third largest party.

899
01:35:54,871 --> 01:35:59,714
The mayor of Kiev Czernowiecki

900
01:35:59,714 --> 01:36:03,709
and his party earns money from their policy decisions

901
01:36:03,709 --> 01:36:07,982
often make decisions that are against the law.

902
01:36:08,434 --> 01:36:13,966
Privatized public goods

903
01:36:13,966 --> 01:36:17,186
for almost no money.

904
01:36:22,511 --> 01:36:26,147
So therefore, we blocked the lectern

905
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:31,728
Czernowieckeho because people tried to remove Vitalij

906
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:43,712
Then I said: Listen, once you touch me

907
01:36:45,306 --> 01:36:48,141
may expect the same response.

908
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:52,964
Keep from me the distance.

909
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:59,627
In our country people go into politics to make money

910
01:36:59,627 --> 01:37:02,232
This is their main goal.

911
01:37:02,558 --> 01:37:07,434
With Vital is different

912
01:37:09,124 --> 01:37:11,405
Vitali has not been active for 100 percent, but at 130

913
01:37:11,669 --> 01:37:14,155
Two times in major elections ended in second place.

914
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:18,380
So my hat made from his courage,

915
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:21,237
but sometimes it seems to me, as if

916
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:25,452
Don Quixote fighting windmills.


917
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:37,989
Politics is big and physical stress psychyck?

918
01:37:37,989 --> 01:37:40,614
The reason why we do it

919
01:37:41,161 --> 01:37:44,275
gives me the motivation for further work.

920
01:37:54,775 --> 01:37:57,586
After the match with Sam Peter

921
01:37:58,367 --> 01:38:01,732
I became number one candidate for fight

922
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,455
but I could not get a match for world championship

923
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:09,289
because I do not condone. I spent a lot of money

924
01:38:09,353 --> 01:38:14,509
since I sued the IBF organization also Don King

925
01:38:14,775 --> 01:38:18,121
Emanuel has not trained to fight with Byrd and it went perfectly.

926
01:38:19,105 --> 01:38:23,090
One of the most important things of our training is not pugilism

927
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:26,199
it's just talking about anything

928
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:29,199
I've never not train

929
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:33,199
their ward and psychologically as Vladimir

930
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:36,199
We are like two murderers waiting for his victim

931
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:40,199
We know that our victim thinks the breakfast, just everything.

932
01:38:45,134 --> 01:38:49,073
Boxing is for me a very logical thing.

933
01:38:49,073 --> 01:38:54,534
I do not think more: Can I knock out!

934
01:38:54,534 --> 01:38:58,434
It's all about tactics and strategy.

935
01:38:58,768 --> 01:39:03,954
Since 2005, it is not a box for me is to chess.


936
01:39:15,806 --> 01:39:19,488
Match of the IBF IBO heavyweight Champion.

937
01:39:21,777 --> 01:39:24,152
Emanuel Steward, Vladimir actually changed.

938
01:39:24,152 --> 01:39:27,107
It is more upright and uses more of his weight.

939
01:39:27,435 --> 01:39:29,843
It is aggressive and finishing to KO.

940
01:39:29,843 --> 01:39:33,605
Now you will systematically

941
01:39:33,923 --> 01:39:37,534
with the front shock.

942
01:39:41,196 --> 01:39:43,884
It has more weight on his hind leg

943
01:39:43,884 --> 01:39:49,775
so it is difficult to achieve.

944
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:54,497
I was surprised that of a vyt??alo me.

945
01:39:54,497 --> 01:39:58,020
I stopped sticking to your plan, which was obviously nonsense.

946
01:39:58,716 --> 01:40:02,534
At the same time I watch it and tell you

947
01:40:02,553 --> 01:40:05,422
this is more difficult than our first fight.

948
01:40:05,876 --> 01:40:08,141
Have systematically slaughtered the entire battle.

949
01:40:12,876 --> 01:40:17,141
We have destroyed his plan and rhythm, we forced him to play our game

950
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:19,795
and still keep it at distance.

951
01:40:19,795 --> 01:40:25,764
When the time came, Vladimir get tough

952
01:40:26,078 --> 01:40:27,503
and launched a cannonade.

953
01:40:50,492 --> 01:40:53,337
It was about him a lot of questions

954
01:40:53,337 --> 01:41:00,258
and has the inner strength to cope with its weaknesses inside the ring.

955
01:41:00,524 --> 01:41:08,624
It took some time until we saw that really wants to return

956
01:41:11,624 --> 01:41:15,924
We must realize that after his defeat,

957
01:41:16,047 --> 01:41:19,059
Vitali always clean up the mess which remained

958
01:41:19,652 --> 01:41:27,360
This time, however, Vladimir had to do it yourself.

959
01:41:27,802 --> 01:41:30,361
And he did it, trusting you.

960
01:41:41,507 --> 01:41:45,881
My son screamed: Keep the belt.

961
01:41:46,468 --> 01:41:49,553
He was surprised when I came to him,

962
01:41:49,754 --> 01:41:52,132
expected that angry since I beat my father.

963
01:41:52,437 --> 01:41:57,096
I thought that my dad is the best in the world and no one can beat

964
01:41:55,645 --> 01:41:58,054


965
01:41:57,095 --> 01:42:00,054
Vladimir I brought the error.

966
01:42:00,645 --> 01:42:04,054
Father, you have to put both belts Vladimir?

967
01:42:04,095 --> 01:42:08,654
Yes, but do not be ashamed because he is a true champion.

968
01:42:08,645 --> 01:42:14,054
I was sad, because who likes to see his father play

969
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:19,788
It was a groundbreaking game in USA

970
01:42:19,788 --> 01:42:23,603
Vladimir and since then did not lose.

971
01:42:24,603 --> 01:42:30,055
Can he stood like a phoenix from the ashes.

972
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:34,900
Needed to prove to his brother that he can prove it.

973
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:38,434
Then Vladimir changed

974
01:42:38,434 --> 01:42:41,580
the little brother of peers to Vitaliy.

975
01:42:50,185 --> 01:42:56,669
The Vitalio Vladimir is a natural rivalry, which is normal.

976
01:42:56,937 --> 01:43:04,295
In one paper was a survey of who is the better boxer

977
01:43:04,295 --> 01:43:10,457
The result was 52% to 48% for Vladimir Vitali, which is almost the same

978
01:43:14,657 --> 01:43:18,672
It is still far from victory.

979
01:43:20,885 --> 01:43:24,972
I was hoping that Vitali wants to return but I did not know when.

980
01:43:24,972 --> 01:43:27,267
He had too many injuries and operations ...

981
01:43:27,587 --> 01:43:31,909
His will power is great and also resistance to pain.

982
01:43:32,127 --> 01:43:37,739
So he came to me and says Fritz I need to do something for me.

983
01:43:37,807 --> 01:43:42,301
You can test me? I want to box again.

984
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:57,475
The family was in shock.

985
01:43:57,853 --> 01:44:03,729
We asked why?

986
01:44:03,729 --> 01:44:06,789
But I understood backwards

987
01:44:06,993 --> 01:44:09,851
that wants to end career in this way.

988
01:44:11,449 --> 01:44:15,246
career complete game like no injuries.

989
01:44:20,918 --> 01:44:24,658
Fritz is more to me as a coach, my close friend

990
01:44:25,575 --> 01:44:30,328
I talk to him about everything.

991
01:44:32,379 --> 01:44:36,779
He knows my body better than my wife.

992
01:44:37,685 --> 01:44:42,752
The question is healthy living? Did not take too many hits?

993
01:44:42,769 --> 01:44:45,210
But Vitali did not get them too

994
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:48,633
This is in contrast to other boxers.

995
01:44:48,633 --> 01:44:51,359
Other boxers take a lot of hits

996
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:54,831
and their health does not allow them to continue to struggle.

997
01:45:46,997 --> 01:45:51,015
I always wanted to be world champions at one time

998
01:45:51,577 --> 01:45:55,579
It did not happen when I was their manager,

999
01:45:55,877 --> 01:46:00,316
but it was great to see how their dream fulfilled.

1000
01:46:00,316 --> 01:46:04,692
It was also my dream and it was great that it became a reality.

1001
01:46:07,206 --> 01:46:10,926
It was unreal,
1002
01:46:10,926 --> 01:46:14,677
I never smoke cigars so as not use that time.

1003
01:46:14,909 --> 01:46:17,786
Cigars victory. It was like a dream.

1004
01:46:17,786 --> 01:46:22,770
We remembered where we were two years ago and where we are now.

1005
01:46:44,516 --> 01:46:50,001
I will not forget it when Vitali called Bernd, you will not believe it

1006
01:46:50,001 --> 01:46:52,983
They want me to grant the German Federal Cross of Merit.

1007
01:46:53,184 --> 01:46:55,250
I just said: Wow!

1008
01:46:55,918 --> 01:46:59,503
Vitali told me that they feel that they deserved it

1009
01:47:00,068 --> 01:47:05,191
All things as social projects to promote democracy in Ukraine

1010
01:47:05,392 --> 01:47:09,407
He did from the heart.

1011
01:47:11,283 --> 01:47:14,254
I am very proud of my children.

1012
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:19,628
I want to thank the German President and all

1013
01:47:19,585 --> 01:47:23,894
Vitali who was nominated for the Honorary Cross.

1014
01:47:24,173 --> 01:47:30,144
But my biggest thanks goes to the German people for their understanding

1015
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:46,846
Klitschkovci are unique as a team.

1016
01:47:47,079 --> 01:47:51,520
something like this is never so heavyweight happened.

1017
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,881
What makes them special is their Soviet past,

1018
01:47:57,149 --> 01:48:01,239
their family and also got the talent.

1019
01:48:08,677 --> 01:48:11,583
For me Klitschkovci

1020
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:15,069
most intelligent boxers in heavyweight history.

1021
01:48:15,069 --> 01:48:18,131
Combining power and culture,

1022
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:21,849
killer instinct and intelligence.

1023
01:48:22,179 --> 01:48:27,725
All these components make them special.

1024
01:48:28,853 --> 01:48:32,495
People still complain about the quality of opponents for Klitschkovcov,

1025
01:48:32,842 --> 01:48:35,919
but not yet for their produce rivals.

1026
01:48:36,019 --> 01:48:41,863
They can box against Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier because they are not all here.

1027
01:48:41,863 --> 01:48:45,610
They spar with those who are and those are definitely defeated.

1028
01:48:46,073 --> 01:48:49,433
So I do not know what they should do more ...


1029
01:48:56,329 --> 01:49:00,253
The box can only be one champion, one king

1030
01:49:00,253 --> 01:49:03,923
Only one can be at the top.

1031
01:49:03,923 --> 01:49:09,720
Now we have two boxers who want to be champions.

1032
01:49:11,131 --> 01:49:16,865
There are four bands, so they can be divided between Klitschkovcov,

1033
01:49:17,332 --> 01:49:21,167
However, it destroys some of their value

1034
01:49:21,167 --> 01:49:25,278
because people want a video of a champion.

1035
01:49:26,022 --> 01:49:30,303
So someone might say, maybe I was too,

1036
01:49:30,022 --> 01:49:34,303
brothers that they should fight each other.
 
1037
01:49:39,872 --> 01:49:44,769
I told my son that their veins flows the blood of one.

1038
01:49:45,701 --> 01:49:48,862
Let not fight each other, even for fun.

1039
01:49:54,303 --> 01:49:56,832
I have one suggestion for you

1040
01:49:57,597 --> 01:49:59,259
Draw?

1041
01:50:00,643 --> 01:50:03,958
Okay, but just because you are my brother.

1042
01:50:21,056 --> 01:50:26,103
Only with their help we can endure, that the boxers

1043
01:50:26,103 --> 01:50:31,280
They told me Mama you're our center and we are your satellites

1044
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:36,106
Only if all of you right then and for us.

1045
01:50:42,793 --> 01:50:46,372
And to ensure that everything is okay and feel no sorrow

1046
01:50:46,435 --> 01:50:50,075
I promise that will never fight each other.

1047
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:58,075
Still keeping that promise. So it was.

1045
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:20,793
translated feriop

1049
01:51:23,485 --> 01:51:27,470
You understand, you dream, you must do your dreams bigger.

1050
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:31,815
This is the way to evolve.

1051
01:51:31,815 --> 01:51:34,426
Not enough to have a mountain of muscle.

1052
01:51:39,883 --> 01:51:44,927
You can train just as mozok train biceps.

1053
01:51:48,928 --> 01:51:51,835
I have always mentioned as a model of Lenin,

1054
01:51:52,723 --> 01:51:55,492
Defend yourself with words unless the words are not enough

1055
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:57,665
You can hit someone.

1056
01:51:59,539 --> 01:52:02,724
One day my coach said:

1057
01:52:03,193 --> 01:52:08,839
One will hang a poster of Vladimir next Mike Tyson.

1058
01:52:09,337 --> 01:52:13,975
I was wondering what the hell is this guy talking about?

1059
01:52:12,617 --> 01:52:14,119


1060
01:52:23,011 --> 01:52:27,995
The most common injuries: a broken nose,

1061
01:52:27,995 --> 01:52:30,541
 orbital bone, jaw

1062
01:52:36,964 --> 01:52:40,175


1063
01:52:40,175 --> 01:52:42,249


1064
01:52:48,466 --> 01:52:53,016
If you eat the cake and then go into the ring ... it turns out.

1065
01:52:55,423 --> 01:52:58,097
So here is a great cheesecake.

1066
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,675
Cameraman stuck in front of the camera eye

1067
01:53:04,675 --> 01:53:10,363
There was much blood and it looked really bad.

1068
01:53:12,147 --> 01:53:18,111
If you do not see the punch coming, it hits you full force, you can lose your neck

1069
01:53:16,111 --> 01:53:18,799
 
1070
01:53:31,807 --> 01:53:34,069
We saved 10 or 15 euros.

1071
01:53:37,169 --> 01:53:39,541
I have one suggestion for you.

1072
01:53:40,508 --> 01:53:42,570
Draw?

1073
01:53:42,508 --> 01:53:46,570
In any case!
