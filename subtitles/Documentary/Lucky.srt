1
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,700
Think you'll win?

2
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:41,702
Why do you think I walked up
here in the snow?

3
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:44,600
- Cold as hell out there, right?
- Yeah, I can take it.

4
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,104
Oh, um, I need an ID for the wine cooler.

5
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:53,105
I'm clearly over 21...

6
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:58,406
- Cute picture.
- How much do I owe you?

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,407
Oh, ah, $11.36.

8
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,408
Here.

9
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,000
Good luck Wednesday! Root'n for ya.

10
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,810
Oh, hey! Wait up! Hey!

11
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,500
Hey, hey, gorgeous!

12
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,812
Leslie!

13
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:41,813
Leslie!

14
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:29,000
OK, I'm up... I'm up!

15
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:40,010
What time did he leave Kurt?
Hmm? Was it 4 or 5?

16
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,010
He is a big jerk and naughty
boy, Kurt. Yes he is!

17
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,410
Say hello to Momma, Kurt! "Hi Momma!"

18
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,218
"Hello Momma!"

19
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,010
Kurt, that man said you were gonna talk
and it has been almost a year.

20
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,420
No pressure! No pressure! I love you!

21
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,520
Excuse me!... Yeah, you. Sorry. Thanks.
Excuse me. Sorry. Yeah.

22
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,924
Whoops, sorry Mrs. Brands. "Koogler &
Brown," please hold.

23
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:16,625
"Koogler & Brown", please hold. "Koogler
& Brown", please hold.

24
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:19,926
"Koogler & Brown", can I help you?
- Hi, I'm trying to reach Steve Mason.

25
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,927
- Who's calling, please?
-"Wendy."

26
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,928
Do you know what this
is regarding, Wendy?

27
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:25,328
"Ah yeah, I would hope so."

28
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,020
One moment.

29
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,830
I am, so sorry, Wendy. He's not in the
office yet. Would you like his voice mail?

30
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,031
"Yes, fine."

31
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,630
I'll see you at 3 o'clock then.
Make sure Davidson isn't late.

32
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,030
You got it!

33
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,030
Ah, Mr. Mason!

34
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,030
Ms. St. Martin?

35
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,636
I got you a present.

36
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:57,937
You snuck out last night.

37
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,038
Oh, thanks.

38
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,130
So, if you can make sure all my calls
come directly to me...

39
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,140
...unless I'm away from my
desk. In which case...

40
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,540
Steve?...  Hang on!

41
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,041
- "Koogler & Brown", Can I help you?
-You're busy. You shouldn't...

42
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:14,342
- Lucy...
- Koogler...

43
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,042
I should be going.

44
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:19,343
Mr. Mason... "Koogler & Brown",
can I help you?

45
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:23,344
Who are you calling for? One moment
please, one moment please.

46
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,145
- Lucy.
- "Koogler & Brown", please hold... What?

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,546
Ah... ah... don't get upset, the
copy machine is busted.

48
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:33,340
-Mannn!!!
- It's ah...

49
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:34,940
...it's bad.

50
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,550
Ben, you cannot put stapled documents
into the sorter.

51
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,950
I didn't.

52
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,252
What's this?
(Phone ringing) Can you get that?

53
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,950
Oh, I don't know how to do that.

54
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,050
You just say "Koogler & Brown,
please hold..."

55
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,454
- ...and just hum a song.
- Oh, OK.

56
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:06,455
"Koogler & Brown, please hold."

57
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:17,356
And, I'll just do this from now on, it's
my job anyway.

58
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,850
Oh, no. I don't mind...

59
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:24,358
Who are you holding for? 
Yeah, he's new...

60
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:26,950
Well then be more careful with it, OK?

61
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,060
Mrs. Brand doesn't need to know
you're doing my job.

62
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,060
She already thinks I'm an idiot.

63
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,060
Whooo...

64
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,761
Whoa... my lord it's cold!

65
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,262
Not that bad.

66
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:51,863
Umm, you smell good. Is that the
cologne I bought you?

67
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,560
Ummm...

68
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,460
What's the matter?

69
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,460
You sure you don't have
another tuna sandwich?

70
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,060
They go fast.

71
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,666
Tomorrow, I'll bring you two. I'll 
set them aside, I promise.

72
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,460
You always say that.

73
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,000
Stop it!... STOP IT!

74
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,859
Lucy, I'm not going to let you
make me the bad guy.

75
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,069
It's not fair!

76
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,670
You don't fit in, Lucy!

77
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,071
Honey, it's 20 degrees and look
at what you're wearing!

78
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,370
You probably don't see it now...

79
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,072
but this is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

80
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,372
Aaaahhhh!!!

81
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:41,172
That's good. That's a good reaction.
Good for you.

82
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:44,073
- That's it!
- You'll thank me, really!

83
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:52,070
Jerk.

84
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,170
Ben?

85
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:08,076
There's only one tuna today. Do
you want to split it?

86
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,077
Lucy...

87
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:33,078
I love you, Bo.
I love you, Daisy Duke.

88
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,079
Lucy...

89
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,380
- What Ben?
- I love you.

90
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:39,581
What?

91
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:41,582
Eeewww!

92
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:45,583
Mom!

93
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:54,584
What, Ben?

94
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:59,085
Thanks for your help with
the copy machine.

95
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:09,986
- Are you OK?
- Every thing's fine, Ben, now leave...

96
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:12,087
Ben, it's your mother. She 
says it's urgent.

97
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:16,088
I suggest you get that... At your desk!

98
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,089
It's me. What's up?

99
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,090
What?

100
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:31,591
Mom... mom, you're talking too fast.

101
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,992
Thank you, Tom, for taking care of those
contingency plans for us...

102
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:38,393
Now, let's move on to the
numbers we have...

103
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:42,094
I would like to continue looking into
that for next week's meeting...

104
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,595
and see where we are on those
totals and then we can look...

105
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,096
at projected numbers for next quarter...

106
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,900
Hi. We're in the middle of
something here...

107
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,098
- Hi, I just want to let everybody know...
- Yes?

108
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,099
That... one night after Steve fucked
me, he went into the bathroom...

109
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,900
...and when I woke up the next
morning, there was shit on the seat.

110
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:09,001
But I overlooked it, because I loved
him, and I thought he loved me.

111
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:11,602
Thank you. Have a great day.

112
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:40,703
Ow!

113
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:45,703
Oww.

114
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:59,703
(Car stalling)

115
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:22,003
Wait... Wait!

116
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:26,004
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, ah.. my Mom is in trouble...

117
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:32,005
And, my car is not working. It's
probably nothing, but I have to...

118
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,106
Can I...?

119
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,406
You're home.

120
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,007
- Thank you.
- Sure.

121
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:17,008
Mom!

122
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:21,409
OK, what's going on? Why
is the door locked?

123
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,710
Ben! Ben! Right here, right here...

124
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,711
Ben, what's the first thing
your gonna buy?

125
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:26,811
Where did you get that lottery ticket?

126
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,812
Mom?

127
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:32,313
Ben! Oh my God! Benjamin!
Oh my baby!

128
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:40,314
Oh honey, you know your
ticket? The lottery ticket?...

129
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:41,915
Well, I turned it around, and I called...

130
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:44,315
and then these people were
calling and calling.

131
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:49,816
And that TV producer over there? He
made me lie to you to get you home.

132
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:54,317
Oh, I'm so nervous. Oh, my God...
Oh, my heart!

133
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:57,618
- I'm gonna have...
- We're set for you, Ben.

134
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:00,619
Where? What? Mom...

135
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Mrs. Keller, it was you who found it?

136
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:10,721
Yes, yes, yes. My son always takes me
Wednesday and Friday to the...

137
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:16,622
physical therapist, and uh, his car

140
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:51,725
Well, I hate to say this... but if it weren't
for good ole Mom, ha, ha, ha...

141
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:54,826

142

-Ben!</i>

157
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,140
Uncle Barry is on the telephone!

158
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,691
<i>"In other news, police are for your help...</i>

159

<i>"in the disappearance of a young
woman named Leslie Singer. </i>

163
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:11,444
<i>Ben! What are you doing?</i>

164
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,245
<i>Don't you want to talk to Uncle Barry?</i>

165
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,346
<i>Uh, I'll talk to him later, alright? I'm
going to take a shower!</i>

166
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,747
<i>He said "congratulations" and that we
should get a lawyer.</i>

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,348
Yeah, OK!

168
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,149
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

169
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,450
I'll be up in 15 minutes!

170
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,751
<i>Okay, okay...</i>

171
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:48,252
I think you won the lottery...

172
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:53,053
Try it now!

173
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,054
There you go...

174
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,355
It's fixed?

175
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:01,456
Yeah, just a loose battery connection.
You should be fine.

176
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:04,257
- Thank you!
- No problem.

177
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:28,458
Oh, Hi! What happened? Was your
mom, Pauline, okay?

178
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,359
Oh... She fine.

179
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,660
It just turned out to be, ah...

180
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,261
- ah... nothing. Did you...?
- Good, I was really worried.

181
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,862
I was going to try to call you, but I
don't have your number.

182
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:44,363
Plus, I wanted to say I'm sorry for
being rude in the car...

183
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:48,064
- They gave me my notice yesterday...
- You got fired?

184
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,165
You have every right to be mad at me.

185
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:53,005
You were trying to be nice, and
I was being all "grrr!!!"

186
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,366
So, I'll just say it now... Sorry.

187
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,167
- Thank God it's Friday, huh?
- Yeah.

188
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,868
Oh, my God, did you get a promotion?

189
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:08,869
Ah, no. I...

190
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,270
Thanks...

191
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,271
<i>Oh, my!</i>

192
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:28,672
Ben, you won the lottery! This is
so amazing!

193
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:36,073
- Ow!
- Oh, my God! Are you OK?

194
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:40,074
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.

195
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,275
Yeeaahh!

196
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:54,776
Hey! OK, OK, OK! You've got to come
back office Monday, and see me.

197
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:55,876
For seriously now..

198
00:17:56,177 --> 00:18:00,377
...do not try to handle that money
yourself. I can help you.

199
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,078
Excuse me! Sorry! Can I ah...

200
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:06,079
Can I um, just get right in, yeah...

201
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,880
if you just...

202
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:08,881
Thank you.

203
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,682
Excuse me. Sorry.

204
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,883
- Lucy, you're on my foot.
- Sorry.

205
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:18,084
So, what did you do when you found out?
Did you just freak?

206
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:21,285
Well yeah, I had never bought
a ticket before.

207
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:24,586
Luck! I'm buying those dam
things every week.

208
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:27,987
Well, don't give up.

209
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,888
Oh, yeah. Two people from our
office is going to win

210
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,888
Yeah, really...

211
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:39,189
Kurt, I've gotta go. I need you
in your cage now.

212
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:40,590
(Door buzzes)

213
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,890
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm sorry to bother you...

214
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,691
I'm Detective Harold Waylon, and I'm
working on the Leslie Singer case.

215
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,092
- OK, the what?
- Leslie Singer...

216
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:52,293
Kurt!

217
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:57,094
- No, that's fine...
- Kurt, what are you thinking? C'mon

218
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,395
I'm so sorry, are you OK?

219
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:03,496
- That's fine. Besides, birds and I...
- He's usually a good bird. Usually.

220
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:06,797
- OK, she did what?
- She didn't do anything...

221
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,698
She disappeared and ah... she lives
kinda close to here.

222
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:12,000
Sorry. Yeah, I've never seen her
before. Sorry about that.

224
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,000
OK...

225
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,599
Well, you keep that picture, the
card is attached. And...

226
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,699
...you call me if you hear of anything...

227
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,400
- Should I be nervous?
- No. Stick with your attack bird there.

228
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:23,401
You're gonna... you're gonna be great.

229
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,802
OK. Bye!

230
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:38,803
Mom! C'mon, we can't be late for this!

231
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:42,104
Ben, I told you I need... Wait.

232
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,105
Mom...

233
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:46,606
Okay.

234
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,706
Do I look alright? I looked so bad on TV.

235
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:56,207
- I don't want to do it if I look that bad.
- You look great.

236
00:19:57,308 --> 00:20:01,908
- Oh, I forgot my blusher.
- Mom, you can do that in the car...

237
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:04,909
Alright.

238
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,910
Thank you.

239
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:10,311
Did you take out the garbage?

240
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,112
Oh, I missed it.

241
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,613
Shit.

242
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,614
Lucy!

243
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:00,615
Hi!

244
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:03,616
Mrs. Keller, hi!

245
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:06,617
How are you? Hi, Ben!

246
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,918
Look who's here.

247
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:12,919
Hi.

248
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,420
How are you doing?

249
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:18,121
What are you doing?

250
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:21,022
Oh man... just been doing a little jogging.

251
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:25,922
On the weekends I jog. You 
know, here and there....

252
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:28,923
Then here...

253
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,924
- Say something.
- What?

254
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:40,025
Well, enjoy. Keep up the ole
pace before I freeze to death.

255
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:43,126
Talk to you later!

256
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,127
Okay.

257
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:47,128
What?

258
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:49,029
Or...?

259
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,030
...how long?... You...? What
are you doing?

260
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:56,231
This is the newsroom. OK? Right.

261
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,232
- Hi Betsy.
- Hi Jeff.

262
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,833
Alright, and right in here is where we
do the show.

263
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:03,834
Yeah... OK.

264
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:09,035
Now your interview comes after the
weather, and before sports.

265
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,836
So let's get you both into make-up.

266
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,837
And then we're going to mic
you with microphones.

267
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:17,037
OK? And guys, let me tell you, this is
gonna be so much fun for you guys.

268
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,138
Are you ready?

269
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,139
Cause she's on the watch now.
Is she OK?

270
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,740
She's just really excited for the make-up.

271
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:27,041
City officials reiterate that there is
no hard evidence...

272
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:29,042
to relate the 3 disappearances.

273
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:30,842
Meanwhile the Singer family continues...

274
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:33,543
to hope their daughter
will return unharmed.

275
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,643
Awful, awful, awful story, Lance.

276
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:41,444
Coming up: Can a trip to the Doctor
be hazardous to your health?

277
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:44,445
And Josh Kincaid with the weather.

278
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:46,346
Where is she? Chip is freaking out.

279
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:50,047
- She's not doing it , Ben. She threw up.
- What?

280
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:53,748
Mom, we have to. Chip is gonna kill us.

281
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,049
Benjamin Keller, look at your mother.

282
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,150
Just do it without her, Ben.

283
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:02,751
I'm not doing it if she's not. I don't want
to do it either...

284
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:04,052
... but we told Chip we would.

286
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:07,052
- Fuck Chip!
- I'm with her.

287
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,053
But we said...

288
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,554
Hey, do you always do what other
people tell you to do?

289
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:13,854
That's no way for a millionaire
to behave.

290
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:14,655
Yeah!

291
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,655
Benjamin!

292
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,556
Don't you think I'm trying?

293
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:32,457
Shh!!!

294
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:35,057
Guys?

295
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:39,058
- They're ready for you.
- Bye, Chip!

296
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,059
You guys are crazy...

297
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,860
We should have gone out to dinner
tonight, and taken Lucy with us.

298
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:02,861
She's got better things to do, I'm sure.

299
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:05,162
It's just so funny seeing her again.

300
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:09,163
Do you remember how close you two
were when you were kids?

301
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:12,163
You were inseparable.

302
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,664
So cute.

303
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:17,265
It was a 100 years ago.

304
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:23,566
She did not have it easy, you know. I
would feel so bad...

305
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:27,867
You growing up without a father, and I
would look at her's.

306
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,268
Well...

307
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:36,368
And when her mother died, and
then to see you two together...

308
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:39,369
- I just...
- What are you saying?

309
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,370
Look, I don't want you to be afraid, OK?

310
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:47,071
Now that you have, you know...

311
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:49,772
What?

312
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,773
I don't know, I don't know. I don't know...

313
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:58,774
I just... a mommy gets tired.

314
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:02,175
I feel like I'm going to the loony bin.

315
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:09,176
My son, the millionaire.

316
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,177
No, I'm not.

317
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:18,278
It's all a dream.

318
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:20,279
Yeap...

319
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,080
Big changes are coming...
Are you ready?

320
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,381
No.

321
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:46,082
Yes, you are.

322
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:02,283
<i>"Hello?"</i>

323
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:03,384
You about ready?

324
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:05,385
<i>"Ready and waiting. Where are you?"</i>

325
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:07,786
- Greenleaf.
<i>-"Did you make reservations?"</i>

326
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:09,687
Yes, I did, I'll be there in a minute.

327
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:10,688
<i>"You told them it's your birthday, right?</i>

328
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:12,788
<i>"Because they have that special cake
that they only give to you...</i>

329
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,989
<i>- "...if you tell them."</i>
- I told them, I told them.

330
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,990
<i>- "What time?"</i>
- I told them about 6.

331
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:19,091
<i>- "Ben, that's too early!"</i>
- But that's all they had.

332
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:20,992
<i>- "Did you tell them who you are?</i>
- No.

333
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:24,593
<i>"Ben, we've been together for 2 months
now.? Haven't I taught you anything?"</i>

334
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:27,594
Oh... don't start now, OK.
I'm already here.

335
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:41,895
- Handsome man.
- Beautiful woman.

336
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:49,596
- Upper body, today?
- No, I skipped.

337
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:51,897
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- I put you on a schedule for a reason.

338
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:54,998
You can't skip, you'll screw it all up.

339
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,999
Perfection! Let's go shopping!

340
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,500
Let's go, Ben!

341
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,400
- Which one do you like?
- Is it me, or are they all just ugly?

342
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:13,401
Ben...

343
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:16,602
Ah, man, this is what Pauline wants.
She told me.

344
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,003
Well, last year, I got her a Whitman
sampler and she loved it.

345
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,304
That was last year.

346
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:23,105
It had a little map to find
all the chocolates.

347
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:25,505
I'm sure it did.

348
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:30,106
- Hey, listen to me a minute...
- Would you like to look at one?

349
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:33,007
Yes, the lady with the harp.

350
00:27:36,608 --> 00:27:41,008
Alright then. How about the
mother and child?

351
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,409
Forgive me, but are you
Benjamin Keller?

352
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,310
- Ah...
- Yes he is.

353
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,311
Ohhh... my goodness!

354
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:51,211
- How exciting.
- Can you hold this for a second?

355
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:52,812
How about the mother and child?

356
00:27:52,913 --> 00:27:56,813
You went to high school with my son,
Charlie Baton. I'm Sue Baton.

357
00:27:56,914 --> 00:27:58,214
Nice to met you.

358
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:00,015
But I need your help. Ben, which one
do you like.

359
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:03,815
Any one of these is fine. Let's just make
a decision and go.

360
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:07,116
Do you remember Charlie? Because, he
remembers you quite well.

361
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:10,817
- Who?
- How about a unicorn?

362
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:14,518
This one's nice too, depending
on the occasion.

363
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,819
Oh, my God!

364
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
Oh my God!

365
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:21,021
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Ah...

366
00:28:21,722 --> 00:28:26,022
Oh my God! We'll go... and we'll just
pay for it, and just go.

367
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:29,723
- Ben, relax.
- Here, do you take Mastercard?

368
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,124
That's fine, don't worry.
You can certainly...

369
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:36,125
It was an accident. We have another
one like it right here.

370
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,226
Would you... would you...?

371
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:38,426
No, no, just ah...

372
00:28:38,826 --> 00:28:40,927
Alright, alright, I'll just
bring this back out.

373
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:43,527
No problem.

374
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:45,528
- I told you!
- What?

375
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:46,800
We should go. Let's just go.

376
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,030
Hey, Ben, she has your card.
Just hang on.

377
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,430
- What's wrong with you?
- Let's just get out of here.

378
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,931
Alright, we should go!

379
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,031
Hey Ben, you may not know who
you are, OK, but I do.

380
00:28:57,332 --> 00:29:01,332
So you dropped a... a lady with
the harp. Who cares?

381
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:05,733
Hey!

382
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:15,033
You are Benjamin Keller, and you can
do whatever you want.

383
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:20,434
Do it.

384
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:25,285
Aaaahhh!!!

385
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:27,535
What are doing?

386
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:29,536
You see?

387
00:29:53,536 --> 00:30:05,737
"BEAUTIFUL WORLD" by

400
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,537
What do you think?

401
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:01,738
I've never seen anything like it.

402
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:08,039
- Your mom was so cute today.
- She's your mom too, now.

403
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,040
Yes, and now, it's just us...

404
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:14,041
I love you.

405
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:17,542
- I know.
- I mean, you've changed everything...

406
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,943
You know that, right?

407
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:29,944
Well...

408
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:35,345
Now, what do we do?

409
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:39,946
Ben... you know what comes next.

410
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:42,347
I do?

411
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:47,348
Wait here.

412
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:49,349
OK.

No, you are going to have to carry me.

Let's just get the hell out of here and go
back to the hotel.

00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:49,352
OK, I'll just go grab the waiter.

437
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:51,953
Can you just go get the bill?

438
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:55,754
- Yes. Of course.
- Hurry.

439
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:07,955
- They didn't?
- No? Fantastic.

- Ah... Lucy...?
- Let's go.

441
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:22,756
- Do you have any cash?
- No.

442
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:24,757
Okay... um...

443
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:30,058
- Our credit card was declined.
- That's alright, we'll use our other card.

444
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,659
No, that's been dead for days.

445
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,760
No it's not, it comes right
out of your account.

446
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,961
I know...

447
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:39,561
- It's empty.
- No, Ben...

448
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:41,562
That's impossible.

449
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,663
Because it's "36 million". I mean, hello!

450
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:49,764
You know I don't get it all
at one time, right?

451
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:52,965
I mean, it comes... it's not important.

452
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,466
- The point is that...
- We don't have any money?

453
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:59,167
That's why I was asking you
if we had any cash.

454
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,268
At all?

455
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:03,069
Well... ah...

456
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:07,869
The wedding, the cars, this honeymoon,
remodeling mom's house...

457
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:09,070
...our new house. It adds up.

458
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,070
Our new house?

459
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:14,171
I bought us a house. It was
suppose to be a surprise.

460
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:15,872
How much?

461
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:16,673
The house?

462
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,374
How much money have you spent, total?

463
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:28,274
Uh... eight... ty... hund...

464
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,674
Speak up!

465
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,275
Eight hundred thousand.

466
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:36,776
- In 3 months?
- Don't get mad, alright?

467
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:40,577
Look, we have our plane tickets for
tomorrow, the hotel is taken care of...

468
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:45,078
And they'll mail me a new check in a
week or two. Everything will be fine.

469
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,279
- Trust me.
- Great.

470
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,580
How are we gonna get out of here?

471
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,381
14 dollars and 36 cents.

472
00:36:13,582 --> 00:36:15,582
Well, that will be enough to get
us to the airport.

473
00:36:15,682 --> 00:36:17,583
Okay, great. I don't have to eat.

474
00:36:17,683 --> 00:36:21,583
Ohh, look! A black banana!

475
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:24,184
- Lucy...
- I cannot believe it.

476
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:28,185
Do you have any idea how
embarrassing that was?

477
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,786
I'll get you another bracelet.

478
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:32,287
No. From now on, I'm
handling the money.

479
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:34,887
When it feels good to actually do
something for yourself.

480
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:37,088
Why do I have to do everything 
around here?

481
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:38,808
Could you please not yell at me?

482
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:41,089
You have been tipping people
a 100 bucks a pop.

483
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:45,589
What happens tomorrow when "Mr. Big
Man" can't give anybody, anything?

484
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,190
Please don't yell at me.

485
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,191
You threw away almost a million dollars!

486
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:53,091
Oh, so you married me for the money?
Is that it?

487
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:04,592
Dammit.

488
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:56,593
I'm sorry.

489
00:37:57,994 --> 00:37:59,394
You are?

490
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:07,095
Is there a problem, Mr. Keller?

491
00:38:07,696 --> 00:38:11,096
No, I'm not awake...

492
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:14,997
Allison.

493
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,098
Allison.

494
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:23,098
Oh... thank you.

495
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,099
Bet you want a tip now.

496
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,100
Mr. Keller?...

497
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,101
Ugh!

498
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,401
Ben! Ben!

499
00:39:05,002 --> 00:39:07,002
Ben, I'm sorry...

500
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:24,603
<i>"Help!"</i>

501
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,900
<i>"Help me!"</i>

502
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
<i>"Stop it!"</i>

503
00:39:45,804 --> 00:39:47,204
Hello?

504
00:39:57,805 --> 00:39:59,205
Hello?

505
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,900
<i> - "Whoo hoo...
- argh!" </i>

506
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,900
Sorry about that.

507
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,900
Argh... argh... argh...

508
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,900
Gargh... argh... argh...

509
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:50,206
Shit!

510
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:31,107
Hello?

511
00:43:20,008 --> 00:43:21,108
Lucy?

512
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:23,609
Can I come in?

513
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,210
Lucy?

514
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,912
Things to do in Hawaii... What!

515
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:09,212
Volcanoes.

516
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:00,313
We should pack.

517
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:15,214
Just tell me you don't hate me.

518
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:17,215
Please.

519
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:22,116
It will never happen again.

520
00:45:24,817 --> 00:45:28,917
I just can't handle the idea of you
being mad at me, alright?...

521
00:45:30,218 --> 00:45:33,008
You're right, you should
handle the money.

522
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,819
It's.. it's.. it's our first fight. 
It's our first, and last.

523
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,820
OK?

524
00:45:58,521 --> 00:46:01,521
You really... hurt me back there, Ben.

525
00:46:03,022 --> 00:46:06,522
Oh, no, no, please, please,
don't say that.

526
00:46:07,323 --> 00:46:09,523
You did, Ben.

527
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:14,124
Maybe, we rushed into all this.

528
00:46:14,325 --> 00:46:19,225
No... I'll do anything. Anything.
Just please...

529
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:23,426
...Just give me a chance. Tell
me what to do.

530
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:27,727
I just need to know that you'll never...

531
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:33,728
...hurt me... like that... again.

532
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:37,729
Never.

533
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,130
Say it.

534
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:45,231
I will never hurt you. Never.
No matter what.

535
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:47,332
I would rather die.

536
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:56,333
How long have we know each other?
Hmm?

537
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:11,334
OK, Ben.

538
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:13,335
Really?

539
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:21,036
Thank you. Thank you...

540
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:24,037
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

541
00:47:29,538 --> 00:47:31,338
I love you.

542
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:34,339
That's OK.

543
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,241
Heyyy!!!

544
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,340
Wow!

545
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:52,341
Welcome home. My goodness.

546
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:55,342
So good to see you!

547
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:59,843
How was it? Was it really great?
Oh.. I'm so happy to see you.

548
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,844
Lucy?

549
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,845
You look exhausted...

550
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:07,946
- Where's your cane?
- Carl tossed it. I don't need it any more.

551
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:11,547
- What? That is fantastic!
- Who's Carl?

552
00:48:11,648 --> 00:48:14,748
Carl's my trainer. You know I'm really
worried about her.

553
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:18,049
- Oh, she is just tired. Honey, you OK?

554
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,050
I'm fine... I'm fine...

555
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,751
Where are we?

556
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:44,152
Well...

557
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:48,152
I know you're mad that I did this.

558
00:48:48,353 --> 00:48:51,453
And we don't have to live here, it's
not definite, but...

559
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:54,854
I thought you might want to see it.

560
00:48:55,455 --> 00:48:58,855
- Are you going to get the bags?
- No, leave it, leave it.

561
00:49:24,756 --> 00:49:27,756
- Kurt!
- Oh, he missed you terribly.

562
00:49:28,557 --> 00:49:30,757
We have to talk.

563
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:04,758
- Who are all these people?
- Mom, I told you...

564
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:07,759
I know, I know, but it was too late to
cancel the caterers.

565
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,160
and I thought what a wonderful way
to met you neighbors....

566
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:13,261
That's OK.

567
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:16,262
Hi!

568
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:17,963
Crowd: "Hi!"

569
00:50:22,963 --> 00:50:25,763
I'm Lucy.
How are you all?

570
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:30,764
Your mother has been telling us about
all your adventures.

571
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:33,765
Grace and Jonathan live right next door.

572
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:37,766
I'm just so glad that somebody
bought this terrific house.

573
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,967
Gracie helped me with the guest list. 
They know everybody in town.

574
00:50:41,268 --> 00:50:44,968
- Now ask John about the country club.
- Yeah, do you play golf?

575
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:49,069
He would love that. And Lucy could
swim or play tennis.

576
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,070
Okay.

577
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:54,570
Girl, you look so cute, my goodness
we miss you. We really do.

578
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:56,322
Oh, well...

579
00:50:56,372 --> 00:50:59,372
- Are you ever gonna come back?
- What do you think?

580
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:03,073
- Will you excuse me for a minute?
- Thanks for inviting us!

581
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:07,574
Hi.

582
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:09,575
Hello.

583
00:51:11,876 --> 00:51:15,676
Want my drink? You can throw it in my
face. That won't be necessary.

584
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:23,977
That's strong, though.

585
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:28,978
- Great house.
- Thank you.

586
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,579
You know, I really have you to thank for
it. Because when we were together

587
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,280
...and you said that whole thing about
about holding each other back.

588
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,981
You know you were right.

589
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:38,281
OK...

590
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:42,282
No, really, because I have Ben,
and this house, and...

591
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:47,083
- You, are you partner yet?
- No, not yet.

592
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:52,084
- You didn't introduce us.
- I would like to know who did.

593
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:56,385
She grew up next door. She didn't need
to be introduced. She was just there.

594
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:57,880
Oh, stop it.

595
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,080
- Well, where is Lucy? Let's met her.
- Yeah, enough of the mystery.

596
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,788
Oh... I saw her around here,
somewhere. She's ah...

597
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:09,280
Well, she's talking to
somebody right now.

598
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,000
So, how's Hawaii?

599
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,500
Ah... uh... oh... uh... ah...

600
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,291
Ben?

601
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,892
Yeah... uh... No, I'm fine.

602
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:44,893
I'm fine.

603
00:52:46,294 --> 00:52:47,894
Just... uh?

604
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,895
Honey?

605
00:52:55,496 --> 00:52:59,196
- Ben? What's wrong?
- I don't know...

606
00:53:01,397 --> 00:53:03,197
I thought... I'm fine. I'm fine.

607
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,598
Met our neighbors. These 
are our neighbors.

608
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,599
This is Lucy.

609
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,600
-Thank you so much!
-You're welcome!

610
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,600
Everything was delicious!

611
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:17,301
Honey, I'm going to get going.

612
00:53:17,401 --> 00:53:19,902
Oh, Oh, don't wanna come in for 
a cup of coffee?

613
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:23,102
No, no, no. I am so exhausted.

614
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:24,103
I'm fine...

615
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:27,204
Well, if you're so tired, maybe you
should spend the night.

616
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:29,005
Welcome home.

617
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:43,206
That was fun.

618
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:47,707
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

619
00:53:52,008 --> 00:53:56,008
You scared me though... You
almost fainted.

620
00:53:56,709 --> 00:53:58,009
Yeah?

621
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,610
Yeah, I should get some sleep.

622
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:10,411
Saw you talking to "Steve Mason".

623
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:14,412
- Yeah, he was here...
- He's an asshole.

624
00:54:15,613 --> 00:54:19,013
I am well aware of that.

625
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:31,314
You're not jealous, are you, Ben?

626
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:40,115
- It's just he's sooo...
- Ben, shut up!

627
00:54:40,216 --> 00:54:44,116
If anyone's gonna be jealous here,
it's gonna be me! OK?

628
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:48,717
I saw you talking to that neighbor! In
fact, get out of here!

629
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,218
Go sleep on the coach!

630
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:57,319
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

I was here three months ago, I

658

- I don't think it was me.
- No?

back. I haven't...

I'm sorry to bother you on a 
Sunday, Mr. Keller.

667
01:00:27,347 --> 01:00:28,648
I'm Det. Waylon, and I'm working on...

... the Leslie Singer case.

669
01:00:31,649 --> 01:00:33,649
- What?
- Leslie Singer.

670
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,150
She's the... well you may not 
know. She's the young...

Whoa, Kurt!

672
01:00:39,752 --> 01:00:43,152
- I'm sorry! Are you OK?
- I'm Fine.

673
01:00:44,453 --> 01:00:48,153
- I know this bird.
- Oh!

674
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:57,454
We're gonna go for a ride, ladies. 
Won't that be fun?

675
01:01:01,555 --> 01:01:06,155
Sorry, but I had to dig you up
before the new owners did.

676
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,956
I'll come back for you guys.

677
01:01:11,457 --> 01:01:14,957
Well, tons of people bought lottery 
tickets that day.

678
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,358
- I bet even Leslie bought one.
- Why do you say that?

679

Oh... Oh, well...

680
01:01:22,059 --> 01:01:25,359
Everybody wants to win the 
lottery, don't they?

682
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:30,960
You know what you should do?

683
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:34,262
You should find all the people that
bought lottery tickets that day...

684
01:01:34,363 --> 01:01:38,363
- And ask if they saw her.
- That's a good idea.

685
01:01:38,664 --> 01:01:40,560
Except, I can't do that.

686
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,765
People, for the most part, use
cash to buy tickets.

687
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:49,166
The only person I know who bought
a ticket that day, was you.

688
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:51,167
Why?

689
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:55,168
Because you won.

690
01:01:56,269 --> 01:01:59,169
That's right.

691
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,170
Well... I'm sorry I couldn't 
be of more help.

have any questions.

- What's it like?

786
01:09:15,354 --> 01:09:19,054
- I don't know.
- They say communication is the key.

787
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,750
And honesty.

- Right, that will happen...

789
01:09:29,257 --> 01:09:30,757
I am!

790
01:09:31,158 --> 01:09:33,758
It's not that easy.

791
01:09:34,459 --> 01:09:38,259
He can't hurt me. It's all about me.

792
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,260
- What are you doing?
- What?

793
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:49,961
You shouldn't be out here, 
you need your rest.

794
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:55,162
I just wanted to try the pool.

795
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:57,163
Here.

796
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:04,460
It's fine...

797
01:10:08,465 --> 01:10:11,465
You should come inside. I don't 
want you to catch a cold.

798
01:10:11,565 --> 01:10:13,466
I'm fine, every thing's fine.

799
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,160
Come to bed.

800
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,467
Let me swim some more. 

801
01:10:23,967 --> 01:10:25,068
I'll be in soon.

802
01:10:26,368 --> 01:10:27,268
OK.

803
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:54,269
Just when I thought I made 
some new friends.

804
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,170
I'm sorry you guys.

805
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:12,171
I really I'm.

806
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:19,172
I just... I know what I'm doing.

807
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:52,873
Well, you're up early.

808
01:11:54,874 --> 01:11:57,470
- Gardening.
- Ah. I hope you're feeling better...

809
01:11:57,775 --> 01:12:00,275
... you scared us to death.

810
01:12:00,376 --> 01:12:04,276
Yeah. Very dramatic, I am.

811
01:12:05,377 --> 01:12:08,070
This thing has everyone spooked. 
You're not alone. 

812
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:11,070
We just all have to keep a close 
eye on each other.

813
01:12:11,378 --> 01:12:13,378
You're right!

814
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:17,479
So, how are these famous Azaleas?

815
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,480
The what?

816
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:23,481
The... From the Garden Center?

817
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,480
Hey!

818
01:13:13,282 --> 01:13:14,482
Hi.

819
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:17,483
Let's eat.

820
01:13:36,384 --> 01:13:38,500
- Is it there?
- No.

821
01:13:40,885 --> 01:13:42,485
Well, it will get here.

822
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:58,186
- Well?
- No.

823
01:13:58,687 --> 01:14:02,687
- Is there someone we can call?
- I did, and it's a recording.

824
01:14:28,388 --> 01:14:29,880
We're out of eggs. 

825
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,880
Sorry.

826
01:14:32,489 --> 01:14:34,089
That's OK.

827
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,790
You know that this will never 
happen again...

828
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,391
now that you and I are... you know...

829
01:14:40,491 --> 01:14:43,591
...really a team. I mean, together, 
we'll make sure this never...

830
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:47,092
- I think I'm pregnant.
- What?

831
01:14:47,193 --> 01:14:50,293
Maybe, I'm not... I don't... 
I'm not really sure.

832
01:14:51,094 --> 01:14:55,594
I guess it happened in Hawaii, if I 
even am, I don't know...

833
01:14:55,695 --> 01:14:56,895
Oh, God...

834
01:14:59,296 --> 01:15:01,896
OK, well ah...

835
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:05,997
We gotta get one of those ah... 
one of those test. Or... 

836
01:15:06,097 --> 01:15:07,398
Mom will know what to do.

837
01:15:07,498 --> 01:15:09,298
No, Ben, hang on.

838
01:15:09,799 --> 01:15:13,199
This is fantastic. This is great.

839
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,200
Ben, it's too early to...

840
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,401
Mom, guess what?...

841
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:19,002
You're just gonna get all worked... 
It's probably nothing!

842
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:22,002
- Lucy's pregnant.
- Oh, God, no...

843
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:26,003
But we don't have any money for one 
of those test. What should we...?

844
01:15:27,104 --> 01:15:28,004
OK.

845
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:31,305
OK, OK.

846
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:32,506
Ben...

847
01:15:32,606 --> 01:15:34,307
So mom is gonna go and buy 
one of those test.

848
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:37,307
and you're gonna go over her house 
and you're gonna take it...

849
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:38,908
I'm just asking you to calm down, OK? 

850
01:15:39,008 --> 01:15:41,009
We don't have to deal with 
this right now.

851
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:43,109
Oh, my God! Where's the fucking check? 

852
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:47,010
I mean you're eating for two now, and 
all you have to eat is eggs?

853
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:50,010
Jesus Christ... That's it.

854
01:15:50,211 --> 01:15:53,911
You're going to mom's, and I'm 
going to call the lottery.

855
01:15:54,012 --> 01:15:56,012
And I swear, where ever that check is, 

856
01:15:56,112 --> 01:15:59,413
I promise you, it will be here 
when you get home. OK?

857
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,313
Now go.

858
01:16:02,114 --> 01:16:07,314
- I gotta go get dressed...
- No, no, no, no, just go, OK? Go.

859
01:16:29,215 --> 01:16:33,315
Now, Two lines, you're pregnant. 
One line, you're not.

860
01:16:34,016 --> 01:16:35,016
OK.

861
01:16:36,817 --> 01:16:39,917
Are you OK? You look exhausted.

862
01:16:40,518 --> 01:16:44,818
It's just been a rough week. How long 
is this thing gonna take?

863
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:45,710
Oh...

864
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:48,919
I remember while I was waiting 
to hear about Ben.

865
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:52,420
I just thought I was going crazy.

866
01:16:53,721 --> 01:16:57,420
- Hear what about Ben?
- If I was pregnant.

867
01:16:59,322 --> 01:17:04,522
You know, he loves you so much. 
You just mean so, so, much to him.

868
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:10,223
At the wedding, you both 
looked so beautiful.

869
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:14,820
And you! You looked like an angel 
sent from heaven.

870
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,020
- Oh, well...
- You did!

871
01:17:18,026 --> 01:17:21,526
Well then, I knew I could stop 
worrying about Ben...

872
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:24,927
See, I'm his mother, and I worry.

873
01:17:27,528 --> 01:17:33,028
I know, that you will give him a good 
life. You've helped him so much already.

874
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:41,029
You know.

875
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:45,030
I know that... that you are the best 
thing that ever happened to him.

876
01:17:45,131 --> 01:17:46,631
You know what he does.

877
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:49,632
I know that he loves you, 
and he needs you.

878
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,432
Why didn't you tell anyone?

879
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:57,633
There's nothing to tell. What 
are you talking about?

880
01:18:07,034 --> 01:18:10,634
Lucy, it's one line.

881
01:18:16,035 --> 01:18:19,535
It's OK. Oh, honey you've got time...

882
01:18:20,736 --> 01:18:23,736
Look, it will happen when 
you least expect it.

883
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:27,737
I promise you!

884
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:31,730
Oh, honey...

885
01:18:37,938 --> 01:18:38,938
Yes!

886
01:18:39,539 --> 01:18:42,539
Rosemary is not having a baby!

887
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,840
Oh, my God! Finally a little luck!

888
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:53,141
- I don't understand.
- Nobody is buying that anymore.

889
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:57,042
The first year of marriage is the hardest. 
I mean, that is what they always say...

890
01:18:57,143 --> 01:18:58,540
Fuck you!

891
01:19:03,044 --> 01:19:05,044
Oh, my God!

892
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:09,545
I'm so sorry. I can't believe I 
just said that to you.

893
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:14,046
- No, it's my fault.
- No, it's not.

894
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:18,547
I try very hard, but you know, 
when they grow up, and... 

895
01:19:18,657 --> 01:19:21,048
however, whatever, whatever you did...

896
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:25,348
Pauline, come with me. I have the car.

897
01:19:25,749 --> 01:19:28,849
Let's just go. Don't pack, let's just go.

898
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:31,650
- Go where?
- So I don't get the money, right?...

899
01:19:31,751 --> 01:19:34,651
- Who cares?
- What money?

900
01:19:34,952 --> 01:19:37,652
Come on. Pauline...

901
01:19:38,053 --> 01:19:41,053
- No, no, no, he's my boy. I can't...
- Pauline...

902
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:43,350
No.

903
01:19:52,755 --> 01:19:55,055
I love you.

904
01:20:15,956 --> 01:20:18,456
Benjamin. How are you 
doing sweetheart?

905
01:20:19,657 --> 01:20:21,657
No, she isn't.

906
01:20:22,358 --> 01:20:26,358
Honey, I want you to listen 
to mommy now.

907
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:38,350
(Cell phone ringing)

908
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:39,359
Hello?

909
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,460
<i>"Hi."</i>

910
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:41,461
Hi.

911
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:44,662
<i>"Sorry, mom told me about the test."</i>

912
01:20:44,863 --> 01:20:46,963
Yeah, I'm not gonna have a baby.

913
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:47,964
<i>"Yeah."</i>

914
01:20:48,365 --> 01:20:51,365
Ben, I'm really sorry, but I 
can't do this anymore.

915
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:53,366
<i>"I've got the check."</i>

916
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:56,367
What?

917
01:20:56,468 --> 01:20:59,000
<i>"It came right after you left."</i>

918
01:21:01,469 --> 01:21:02,469
Oh?

919
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,270
<i>"See you at home."</i>

920
01:21:09,371 --> 01:21:12,071
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

921
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:15,072
- You're a busy guy.
- Yeah.

922
01:21:27,073 --> 01:21:31,073
OK, Leslie... guy who bought condoms...

923
01:21:31,874 --> 01:21:35,674
Mom with scouts... a dumb kid...

924
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:40,375
Guy buying cigarettes...

925
01:21:42,376 --> 01:21:45,376
A mother and child...

926
01:22:03,177 --> 01:22:05,377
Ben, I'm home!

927
01:22:07,478 --> 01:22:08,378
Hello?

928
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:11,379
Ben?

929
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,980
Don't look at me like that, I wasn't 
going to leave without you.

930
01:22:17,181 --> 01:22:18,181
Ben!

931
01:22:26,182 --> 01:22:27,182
Ben!

932
01:22:38,983 --> 01:22:40,183
Hello?

933
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,380
Come on, Kurt.

934
01:23:28,185 --> 01:23:31,285
There you go. I know it smells 
like dead bodies in here. 

935
01:23:31,385 --> 01:23:33,786
But you'll get use to it, Kurt. OK?

936
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,386
I did it, Kurt.

937
01:23:46,787 --> 01:23:48,387
I did it.

938
01:23:49,088 --> 01:23:54,088
It's not like I planned it. But 
nobody can say I didn't do it.

939
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:59,189
I got my bird, and I got my check.

940
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:03,090
Your really gonna like Canada, 
Kurt, they have...

941
01:24:03,691 --> 01:24:05,991
Well, I actually don't know what 
they have there but...

942
01:24:06,091 --> 01:24:08,092
I just know that we're gonna love it.

943
01:24:08,492 --> 01:24:11,092
I'm mad at you.

944
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:19,093
I don't know how to begin. I'm in shock.

945
01:24:19,194 --> 01:24:21,994
- Ben, stop it!
- You know, I didn't believe her.

946
01:24:22,095 --> 01:24:25,095
I said you were just upset because 
you weren't pregnant.

947
01:24:25,196 --> 01:24:27,196
Now that we are a team.

948
01:24:27,297 --> 01:24:29,297
Do you have any idea how 
disappointed I am?

949
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,690
I'm not gonna sit here and listen 
to a lecture from you.

950
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,090
Yes, you will!

951
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:37,090
Ben, Ben, Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben... 

952
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,100
You can't hurt me. Remember... 
remember our little talk...OK?

953
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,301
So, let's just calm down.

954
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:51,502
I'm not gonna hurt you.

955
01:24:53,103 --> 01:24:57,103
I'm realistic. Now, I know that 
marriage isn't easy and that...

956
01:24:58,804 --> 01:25:03,104
I may not be experienced in the ways 
of amore. But I know that.

957
01:25:03,305 --> 01:25:05,105
Ben, listen...

958
01:25:07,006 --> 01:25:11,606
I ah... might have married you 
under false pretenses...

959
01:25:12,007 --> 01:25:16,807
But, after spending time with 
you, I came to really...

960
01:25:17,008 --> 01:25:19,808
... you know, to really, really...

961
01:25:19,909 --> 01:25:24,909
And then you started killing people, 
Ben! And it's just too much!

962
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:28,610
Marriages take work.

963
01:25:28,911 --> 01:25:32,611
This has been our biggest mistake. We 
have just been sitting back...

964
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:37,612
Hoping for a miracle. Well, I've done 
a lot of the work already.

965
01:25:37,913 --> 01:25:41,913
Now, the first thing I did, was to 
eliminate all distraction.

966
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,910
BEN!!!

967
01:25:52,114 --> 01:25:53,914
That hurts!!

968
01:25:54,715 --> 01:25:57,215
This hurts. Your...

969
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:03,116
When you kill people, you are hurting 
me, and you can not hurt me!

970
01:26:03,817 --> 01:26:06,410
OK, now you're just getting 
me on a technicality.

971
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:09,018
Alright, come with me. I want to 
show you something.

972
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:10,019
Help!

973
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,020
Lucy!

974
01:26:11,221 --> 01:26:14,221
I really need you to be coherent.

975
01:26:14,322 --> 01:26:16,820
I went to a lot of trouble here.

976
01:26:18,323 --> 01:26:19,323
Ben!

977
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:24,024
Now, Grace here, is gonna help us get 
through the rough spots.

978
01:26:25,525 --> 01:26:27,425
I can't do this, I can't do this...


979
01:26:27,826 --> 01:26:29,520
Leave, and she dies.

980
01:26:34,327 --> 01:26:38,827
Lucy, honey, please sit down. Let's 
try and act like adults.

981
01:26:50,528 --> 01:26:51,828
OK.

982
01:26:52,329 --> 01:26:56,429
Grace, scream, and I cut you.

983
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,330
OK, Grace... when you have gotten 
yourself together. 

984
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:06,431
I'd like for you to tell me and Lucy...

985
01:27:07,331 --> 01:27:10,331
What it is we are doing wrong.

986
01:27:10,732 --> 01:27:15,232
I  told you... I'm a family planner, 
not a marriage counselor.

987
01:27:15,533 --> 01:27:18,633
- I don't even have a degree.
- It's the same ballpark.

988
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,230
Ben, let her go!

989
01:27:22,135 --> 01:27:25,135
Just say... something.

990
01:27:29,636 --> 01:27:34,136
Is your marriage based on honesty, 
and mutual respect?

991
01:27:34,237 --> 01:27:35,237
Yes!

992
01:27:35,638 --> 01:27:39,830
No, it is not, Ben. I married you for the 
money, and you like to kill people.

993
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:42,639
No... like to kill people? What?

994
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,840
- They're burned in the yard?
- I don't put them there!

995
01:27:45,941 --> 01:27:48,841
That was all you. I thought you 
were trying to help me there!

996
01:27:48,942 --> 01:27:52,042
Garden Center? Wink... wink. Here I 
thought we were a team.

997
01:27:52,143 --> 01:27:55,043
- A team?
- Who did you kill?

998
01:27:55,344 --> 01:27:59,044
Grace, have you ever wanted 
something, so much...

999
01:28:00,245 --> 01:28:04,245
And when you couldn't have it
you had to argh...

1000
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:06,246
- ...but you couldn't.
- You're insane!

1001
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:10,747
- I'm not saying I'm proud of myself.
- You seemed like such nice people.

1002
01:28:10,948 --> 01:28:13,448
- Stop talking!
- Such nice people!

1003
01:28:13,549 --> 01:28:16,549
We are still nice people, but 
we're also in love...

1004
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:19,650
And love is scary, I'm starting 
to realize that now.

1005
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:21,651
I don't love you.

1006
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,952
- Yes, you do..
- I want to go home.

1007
01:28:25,453 --> 01:28:27,253
Well, that depends on my partner here.

1008
01:28:27,353 --> 01:28:29,254
Ben, You have a long ways 
ahead of you, OK?

1009
01:28:29,454 --> 01:28:33,454
Don't live it like this. I'm not worth 
it. Not by a long shot.

1010
01:28:33,555 --> 01:28:36,355
- I love you.
- I don't love you.

1011
01:28:38,356 --> 01:28:39,356
I love you.

1012
01:28:39,457 --> 01:28:42,357
- Let me go!!
- Let me go too!

1013
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:46,258
All I want is to be able to kiss, you...

1014
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:50,659
 and have you kiss me... And to feel 
you mean it. That's all I want.

1015
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,960
Ben, I don't know. Maybe if...

1016
01:28:56,261 --> 01:28:59,961
- ...I hadn't been so...
- Greedy.

1017
01:29:00,062 --> 01:29:03,562
- And you hadn't...
- Killed all those people?

1018
01:29:03,763 --> 01:29:07,563
- ...killed all those people.
- Maybe things...

1019
01:29:08,464 --> 01:29:11,564
- Would have been different?
- I  wish they were.

1020
01:29:11,665 --> 01:29:14,565
I really do.

1021
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:19,566
Suddenly, the money doesn't seem 
to matter much, does it?

1022
01:29:22,767 --> 01:29:23,767
Grace...

1023
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,868
Lucy!

1024
01:29:32,269 --> 01:29:35,269
Lucy, we're not done talking!

1025
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:40,270
Get back here!

1026
01:29:42,771 --> 01:29:44,271
Lucy!

1027
01:29:51,772 --> 01:29:55,272
Please, don't leave me, Lucy!

1028
01:29:57,173 --> 01:29:59,273
Look at what you did!

1029
01:29:59,474 --> 01:30:00,474
Lucy...

1030
01:30:01,275 --> 01:30:04,275
I can't take it anymore. I can't take it...

1031
01:30:04,376 --> 01:30:08,576
Just take something sharp, and stab 
me with it, and kill me with it...

1032
01:30:08,777 --> 01:30:12,177
Bury me under the hedges with
 the rest of them...

1033
01:30:12,278 --> 01:30:13,678
Excuse me.

1034
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:18,679
No one answered at the front 
door. Is everything OK?

1035
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:19,780
Detective!

1036
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:24,881
Mr. Keller, I need to ask you a few more 
questions. Do you mind if we go inside?

1037
01:30:25,082 --> 01:30:29,082
- I ah, don't mean to be rude, but...
- But what?

1038
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:34,083
Well, we're swimming here. So if you 
could maybe come back, tomorrow?

1039
01:30:34,484 --> 01:30:37,484
Mr. Keller, I reviewed the surveillance 
tape from the... 

1040
01:30:37,584 --> 01:30:39,485
convenience store where you 
bought the ticket.

1041
01:30:40,285 --> 01:30:41,485
Yeah?

1042
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,000
You're not on them.

1043
01:30:47,287 --> 01:30:50,287
Excuse the mess. I'm still unpacking.

1044
01:30:50,388 --> 01:30:52,188
Fine. I understand.

1045
01:30:52,389 --> 01:30:58,189
So ah, you're asking me how I could 
have bought my lottery ticket...

1046
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:01,890
and still not be on the tape?

1047
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:04,491
- On point.
- Well, you're obviously on the tape...

1048
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,392
...he just looks different. He's been 
working out. He's bigger.

1049
01:31:07,993 --> 01:31:09,593
Not that much bigger.

1050
01:31:10,094 --> 01:31:11,694
You're on the tape, don't be 
stupid, you're drunk. 

1051
01:31:11,794 --> 01:31:14,095
He's drunk, he's been swimming.

1052
01:31:17,395 --> 01:31:19,895
I know why I'm not on the tape.

1053
01:31:20,696 --> 01:31:23,500
You're on the tape! Detective, are 
you accusing him of something? 

1054
01:31:23,606 --> 01:31:24,597
Because if you are...

1055
01:31:24,697 --> 01:31:27,597
I snapped her neck in the parking lot.

1056
01:31:27,698 --> 01:31:30,298
I never even stepped foot in the store.

1057
01:31:31,799 --> 01:31:35,199
That's how I'm not on that tape.

1058
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,000
Marriage is based on honesty. That 
is what Grace said.

1059
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,801
Sometimes the truth hurts. I'm sorry.

1060
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:45,002
You couldn't hurt me even if 
you wanted too.

1061
01:31:45,102 --> 01:31:47,002
Alright, I want you two to sit down. 

1062
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:50,003
We're gonna take this as 
calmly as possible.

1063
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:53,603
The more calmly we do this, 
the better off we'll be.

1064
01:32:01,504 --> 01:32:05,504
- I want... the check.
- Well, you don't get anything.

1065
01:32:05,905 --> 01:32:09,505
- Unless, it's me.
- Nobody wants you.

1066
01:32:10,806 --> 01:32:12,406
You can have me.

1067
01:32:12,507 --> 01:32:15,507
Mr. Keller, tell your wife to 
give me the gun.

1068
01:32:15,608 --> 01:32:19,608
- You don't win. I won't let you.
- Gimme the gun.

1069
01:32:19,709 --> 01:32:21,709
- It's not fair!
- Put that gun down, Mrs. Keller.

1070
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,810
- Just admit it, Lucy.
- What?

1071
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,811
- You love me.
- Shut up!

1072
01:32:26,012 --> 01:32:29,712
- Mrs. Keller, give me that gun.
- Just admit it, you love me.

1073
01:32:29,813 --> 01:32:32,813
- I don't want too!
- Give me the gun, Mrs. Keller.

1074
01:32:42,914 --> 01:32:46,114
Add it to the pile.

1075
01:33:03,115 --> 01:33:05,510
Can you turn that up, please?

1076
01:33:10,116 --> 01:33:12,616
<i>"They were as nice as can be."</i>

1077
01:33:13,017 --> 01:33:16,017
<i>"He invited us to lunch, just 
the week before."</i>

1078
01:33:16,518 --> 01:33:21,118
<i>"Looking back... looking back, she 
doesn't remember that night at all."</i>

1079
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:26,119
<i>"No, I hit my head, very hard..."</i>

1080
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,120
<i>"What happened afterwards?"</i>

1081
01:33:30,621 --> 01:33:34,121
<i>"Well, after she was home 
safe, everyone..."</i>

1082
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:42,822
Is this really "The Sunny Mart"?

1083
01:33:43,923 --> 01:33:46,823
Why would I lie?

1084
01:34:30,225 --> 01:34:33,220
- Kurt says "hello".
- What are you doing here?

1085
01:34:35,226 --> 01:34:39,526
- No, no, I mean he actually says "Hello"
- What do you want?

1086
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,520
I ah...

1087
01:34:44,627 --> 01:34:48,000
I wanted to make that sure you're OK.

1088
01:34:50,628 --> 01:34:54,128
Lucy, I didn't think it was 
gonna end this way.

1089
01:34:54,729 --> 01:34:56,129
You didn't?

1090
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,730
I told them that it was me!

1091
01:34:58,831 --> 01:35:00,631
Those women under the hedge...

1092
01:35:00,731 --> 01:35:04,632
they had your DNA, or your 
fibers, or whatever...

1093
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:08,132
...all over them. I mean, you 
shot Detective Waylon!

1094
01:35:08,233 --> 01:35:13,133
I know what I did. What about, 
what you did?

1095
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:18,234
Well... I think, we should just put the 
past behind us...

1096
01:35:18,435 --> 01:35:21,030
I asked you a question.

1097
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:27,936
How much does a jury cost nowadays? 

1098
01:35:28,037 --> 01:35:32,037
Is it expensive? Jonathan and Grace, 
they cost a lot of money,

1099
01:35:32,138 --> 01:35:34,738
...is there any money left? At all?

1100
01:35:34,839 --> 01:35:35,899
Mom says hello.

1101
01:35:35,999 --> 01:35:39,000
I'm gonna get out of here, and I'm 
gonna set you on fire.

1102
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:44,640
- Did you get any of my letters?
- I mean it... fire!

1103
01:35:44,741 --> 01:35:46,541
OK, OK, ah...

1104
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:51,142
I love you anyway.

1105
01:35:51,843 --> 01:35:53,840
Wait, wait!

1106
01:35:57,844 --> 01:36:00,000

I know you, Ben.

1107
01:36:03,145 --> 01:36:05,145
And ah, pretty soon...

1108
01:36:05,846 --> 01:36:07,640
Tonight even...

1109
01:36:08,447 --> 01:36:12,447
You're gonna go home, and you're gonna 
get to thinking about me...

1110
01:36:14,248 --> 01:36:18,448
How much you love me. How 
we belong together, and...

1111
01:36:18,649 --> 01:36:22,649
How you still, don't really have me...

1112
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:29,750
And when some 27 year old blond 
woman, about 5'6", 125 lbs...

1113
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:32,351
doesn't come back from 
her aerobics class...

1114
01:36:33,151 --> 01:36:36,751
Everybody's gonna know, what's, what.

1115
01:36:37,752 --> 01:36:40,752
I don't expect to be here much longer.

1116
01:36:41,153 --> 01:36:43,753
Not long at all.

1117
01:36:48,154 --> 01:36:51,650
- I don't think that's gonna happen.
- And then I gonna set you on fire!

1118
01:36:52,255 --> 01:36:55,755
You may be right...ah you 
normally are, but ah...

1119
01:36:58,756 --> 01:37:01,756
Since you've been here, I just...

1120
01:37:05,057 --> 01:37:07,000
...I haven't had that urge.

1121
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:10,250
It's not that I like the idea of you 
rotting away in here, I don't...

1122
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:11,659
Get out.

1123
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,060
- Get out! Get out...
- It just makes me feel.

1124
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,461
...and don't ever come 
back here! Ever! Guard!

1125
01:37:15,861 --> 01:37:19,261
Guard! Hello, I'm ready to go back. 
Take me back!

1126
01:37:19,362 --> 01:37:21,362
- I love you, Lucy!
- I'm ready to go. Take me away!

1127
01:37:21,363 --> 01:37:23,863
- I love you!
- Screw you! Fuck you!

1128
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,564
Goodbye, Lucy!

1129
01:37:25,665 --> 01:37:28,965
Ben, wait, wait! I have time, 
I still have time left...

1130
01:37:29,066 --> 01:37:30,966
Ben. Ben!

1131
01:37:35,167 --> 01:37:36,967
Yes?

1132
01:37:41,968 --> 01:37:45,000
It's almost been a year now...

1133
01:37:45,869 --> 01:37:47,069
I know.

1134
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:59,000
Would you like me to come back?

1135
01:38:10,971 --> 01:38:12,871
Yes.

1136
01:38:13,272 --> 01:38:14,872
Would you?

1137
01:38:16,373 --> 01:38:17,873
Of course.

1138
01:38:19,174 --> 01:38:20,674
Tomorrow?

1139
01:38:23,175 --> 01:38:25,000
I'll be here.

1140
01:38:47,676 --> 01:38:51,676
- Kurt spoke?
- Yeah, I was at the house...

1141
01:38:52,377 --> 01:38:54,477
...maybe Wednesday, or Thursday, 
and ah...

1142
01:38:54,577 --> 01:38:56,178
What did he say?

1143
01:38:56,278 --> 01:38:57,278
"Hello"

1144
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:01,679
"Hello", that's what he says. Just 
"hello", all the time.

1145
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,680
Around... around the clock.

1146
01:39:06,281 --> 01:39:08,480
Have you been working out?

1147
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,182
Aaahhh....

1148
01:39:11,282 --> 01:39:14,982
Ben, no skipping. You're screw it all 
up and turn puny again!

1149
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:17,183
I know, it's just...

1150
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:20,684
I really need someone to motivate 
me. It's so boring.

1151
01:39:21,085 --> 01:39:23,585
Ben, what do you want? Somebody 
to hold your hand? 

1152
01:39:23,685 --> 01:39:25,286
You just have to get in there and do it!

1153
01:39:25,486 --> 01:39:27,286
OK...

1154
01:39:27,787 --> 01:39:31,287
Hey, just don't say "OK". Just do it!

1155
01:39:31,388 --> 01:39:33,388
- OK.
- Promise me.

1156
01:39:34,189 --> 01:39:35,389
I promise.

1157
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:38,000
You gonna work that chest tomorrow?

1158
01:39:40,991 --> 01:39:46,990

1159
