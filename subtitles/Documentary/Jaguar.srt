1
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,200
That's nice.

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,310
I got him!
- Good!

3
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,420
Berlin has always been one of Europe's
most important cities... A center.

4
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,060
And right here in these rooms you're in
the center of the center so to speak.

5
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,330
Government buildings are so close you
might meet the Chancellor for breakfast.

6
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,140
The radiance of the next millennium
streams through these very windows.

7
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,670
This way please.

8
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,430
The wallpaper will be removed
and the walls will be plastered.

9
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,270
Rudi take your hands off that!

10
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,600
Rudi where are you?

11
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,450
The photos and the chair are mine.
You can burn the rest.

12
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,160
You've got all my things?
- Yes don't worry Mrs. Wust.

13
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,220
I'll be with you in a sec.

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,350
There you are.

15
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,770
Lovely skirt.

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,360
One last look?

17
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,170
You'll get used to it Mrs. Wust.
Just get yourself settled...

18
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,200
...and then come down and meet the others.
Do you like to play rummy?

19
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,130
Mrs. Wust?
Where is she? Mrs. Wust?

20
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,280
Where are you going Mrs. Wust?
Be sensible.

21
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,110
Stay here! - I gotta leave.
- Where are you going?

22
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,320
No no no! - Stay here! Be sensible!
Where are you going?

23
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,120
Where are you going Mrs. Wust?

24
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,860
Ilse?

25
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,870
Yes well I'm Ilse.

26
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,890
In November 1943 my girlfriend Felice
and I went to hear Beethoven's Ninth.

27
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,430
The Berlin air battle was in its 3rd week
but life's full of contradictions.

28
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,210
War didn't interest me at all
that evening.

29
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,380
All I had on my mind
were Felice and her elegant perfume.

30
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,390
Something wrong?

31
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,460
Ilse?

32
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,760
I said I couldn't babysit tonight...

33
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,730
...because I had to look after
my sick father.

34
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,460
So that's Mr. And Mrs. Wust.
- No. - No?

35
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,700
Not Mr. Wust.

36
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,170
Pretty.

37
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,170
Very pretty.

38
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,280
Not in the middle of a movement!
Nobody leaves the stage!

39
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,680
Where are my glasses?
- We won't find them now.

40
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,950
I won't leave without them!
- Women!

41
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,450
Once the alarm went off
Felice took a close look at Mrs. Wust...

42
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,940
...who I was working for during
my domestic year. She was irresistible.

43
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,790
Are these yours? - Yes thank you.

44
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,460
Ernst! Ernst! Here!
I almost never wear them but...

45
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,980
Just the same.
- Thank you. - Thank you. Come on.

46
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,790
Please use the side exits...

47
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,430
Don't get your hopes up.
She tries it with everyone...

48
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,360
...but she always stays with her husband.

49
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,630
Lovely eyes. - Especially
when the Hitler Youth marches by.

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,700
Felice Schragenheim? Miss Schragenheim?

51
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,300
Your father was a good doctor.

52
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,810
Watch out for yourself.

53
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,320
Good heavens.

54
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,700
Faster! Faster!

55
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,410
Here.

56
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,340
Come on.

57
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,320
The 50 best photographers were sent to
photograph the most beautiful buildings.

58
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,930
They'll destroy everything.

59
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,320
Here you are. For our English friends.

60
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,890
Are you crazy? What is this?

61
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,060
The latest transport lists from Hungary.
Have Schmidty photograph them.

62
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,820
Till tomorrow. - Felice.

63
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,070
You've lost all sense of danger.
That's not good...

64
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,390
...for any of us.

65
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,360
No one could disguise herself
as well as Felice.

66
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,560
She worked for a Nazi newspaper
wrote countless poems...

67
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,960
...and never let anyone with shiny
long hair like myself slip away.

68
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,810
I sometimes thought
Felice was lots of people.

69
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,900
The moment I got hold of one
I was betrayed by another.

70
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,270
She was hard to hold onto
and only with her grandmother...

71
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,440
...was she gentle as a lamb.

72
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,350
Aaron your lips are blue.
Drink this. It'll do you good.

73
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
I don't believe it.

74
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,380
Grandma! - Why won't she listen to me?
I've told her at least ten times...

75
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,580
"Stay in the house. Don't go out
on the streets. Don't come here. "

76
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,080
Grandma!

77
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,750
Half of Berlin is burning.
Don't tell me you weren't in the cellar!

78
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,890
Sit down!
- Were you in bed?

79
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,410
Were you at a concert?
- What does that have to do with it?

80
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,090
Then don't talk about danger!
- No. Ilse and I...

81
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,990
And not with your mouth full!

82
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,890
Sorry Ilse. I know.
Grandmothers are always a problem.

83
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,730
When she was a child she wanted to ride
her sled backwards over a cliff.

84
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,300
Right Felice? - Only once.
Anyway it was my sister's idea.

85
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,400
She's in England now! And where are you?
- On the moon! Nothing'll harm me there.

86
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,300
Ilse why are some people crazy
and others not? - I don't know.

87
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,310
What about her fiancé? - Who?

88
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,540
Her fiancé. She's engaged.

89
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,810
What's he like? Who is he?

90
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,860
Can he support her?
What does he look like?

91
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,670
Handsome tall black hair...

92
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,020
When will he take her away?

93
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,840
Soon Grandma. Very soon.

94
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,040
Madam...

95
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,490
...could we possibly have the rest
of the potatoes?

96
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,420
Ilse take care of her won't you?

97
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,690
I had such beautiful dreams about you
this morning. I would give anything...

98
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,860
...to kiss...

99
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,890
...your gentle hands...

100
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,960
...and perhaps above your neck.

101
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,470
Above your neck... Even a little more.

102
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,660
Well Mrs. Schrader? Still in one piece?

103
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,740
We shot down 41 planes
but my toilet is gone.

104
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,850
How's my editorial coming along?
- On the desk in front of you.

105
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,670
My little Mrs. Schrader
what would I do without you?

106
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,740
Around 5000 apartments in one night.

107
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,750
Total chaos at Party Headquarters.
Everyone's nerves are worn raw.

108
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,060
If people knew what was going on
out there. It's dog eat dog.

109
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,920
Like some?
- No thanks.

110
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,050
But Goebbels is a genius.

111
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,880
Last night he said
that great people leave their mark.

112
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,630
And when they're gone the mark remains.
What do you say?

113
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,060
Brilliant.

114
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,160
Keep your eye on it.
- I will.

115
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,410
You're so beautiful.

116
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,400
I had such beautiful dreams about you
this morning and I would give...

117
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,640
"... Anything to kiss your gentle hands
and perhaps above your neck...

118
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,370
As deeply as a rose. "
Not too bad is it Ilse?

119
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,370
"I only want to be alone with you
embrace you and tell you again... "

120
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,750
Bernd! Eberhard!

121
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,880
It wasn't the mountains dummy!
It was at the zoo zoo zoo!

122
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,710
Then I won't play anymore.
And I'll wreck your castle!

123
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,740
That's enough! If I hear one
more word from you...

124
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,780
I'll send you to the maneaters...

125
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,920
...in Bavaria!

126
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,890
Got it?
- Mommy who is the General?

127
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,480
Quiet!

128
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,730
"I want to find stars
for you and for me.

129
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,390
Shall I tell you why?

130
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,920
I love you.

131
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,400
You are so beautiful. Jaguar. "

132
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,120
No one has ever... I mean...

133
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,890
No one has ever written me like this.

134
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,800
Who could it be?

135
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,430
Ernst?

136
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,870
What's wrong?

137
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,870
Should I see if I can get any semolina?

138
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,110
Semolina? Now? - Yes.

139
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,630
Now!

140
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,840
Want to see something?
Here have a look.

141
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,870
How can you write such letters?

142
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,480
I only wrote one.
How did she react?

143
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,020
Anything dramatic?
Come on tell me!

144
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,420
Ilse it was just for fun.
Nothing but good fun. Nothing else.

145
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,980
Is it "fun" that she can smell Jews?

146
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,120
Is it "fun" that Jews are to blame
for every bomb that falls?

147
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,490
Did she really say that?
- This morning.

148
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,460
What a coincidence.
- Why?

149
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,530
I have a date with her.
- You what?

150
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,450
Maybe she really can.
- What? - Smell Jews.

151
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,890
Felice could anything ever stop you?

152
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,200
Oh yes. A lot.

153
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,930
What have you got there?

154
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,960
Oh no!

155
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,540
Thüringer? My beloved Thüringer sausage.
Is it real?

156
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,670
Yes from the newspaper office.

157
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,010
This is for you.

158
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,740
The rest is for Grandma
and your parents.

159
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,650
See you later.

160
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,320
God! Ilse. He'll be here in 5 minutes.
Where are my glasses? - There.

161
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,560
Where?
- Over there.

162
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,050
I'm so nervous. My God! I'm so nervous!

163
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,320
Ilse how do I look? Good?
- Sure. As always.

164
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,060
Hm?
- Attractive as always.

165
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,090
Bernd! Eberhard! Are you crazy?

166
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,100
I cleaned this room 10 minutes ago!

167
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,660
Take your soldiers! Where are your shoes?
- I have them on.

168
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,000
Off the sofa! Get out of here!
Eberhard put your shoes on!

169
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,600
We were playing. - Out!

170
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,340
Get out of there. Ilse! - Yes?

171
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:14,070
No! No! Who did that?
- Not me. - Me neither.

172
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,080
It was a present from Günther.
He's going to kill us all of us!

173
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,580
Doesn't matter.
Get your coats on and go!

174
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:27,110
But not to the zoo again!
- Yes come on...

175
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,670
Stop! Who does this belong to?

176
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,040
Me.

177
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,850
Here. Put it on outside.
See you later my little pet.

178
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,420
Have fun dear. Give me a kiss.
You too. Bye bye.

179
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,490
When her beaus came
Mrs. Wust behaved like a teenager.

180
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,410
She cleaned and scrubbed all day
so that nothing...

181
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,850
...would interrupt her tender rendezvous.

182
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,790
Romantic to the bone she thought
that Felice's letter was from him.

183
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,860
She feverishly awaited the moment
when she could throw...

184
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,830
...her hungry heart at his feet.

185
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,560
Incomprehensible!
So much trouble for a man.

186
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,530
I tell you something.
They just don't get it.

187
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,640
All anyone ever talks about is food.
We don't have this...

188
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,070
Hello.
- Or we don't have that.

189
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,840
How's it going boy? Heil Hitler!

190
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,140
Do you love me?
Tell me do you love me?

191
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,640
Look at this. Come on look at it.

192
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,510
Isn't that a tree? Huh? Isn't that a tree?

193
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,650
Princess isn't that a tree?

194
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,660
Heavens! Is it your husband?

195
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,880
Lilly!
- It's my father!

196
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,520
And my mother!

197
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,860
What?

198
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,360
Where to? Don't you have a balcony?
- No! No! In there!

199
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,100
What's wrong? Are you ill?
- III?

200
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,660
Yes... I mean no.
I was just on my way out.

201
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,410
Where are the children?
- At the zoo. - Again?

202
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,500
They were there last week.
- And the week before.

203
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,070
Is Günther here?
- No he left his things here.

204
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,470
I didn't know he came.
- I didn't either.

205
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,970
And good riddance! Let him talk about
wonder weapons and final victories...

206
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,850
...when he's on the front where
nobody knows what's going on.

207
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,440
Oh cut it out. You're the one
who keeps babbling about politics.

208
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,900
8500 tons of explosives in two weeks!

209
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,780
And it's going to go on like that
until that scum is finally gone.

210
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,080
Are you talking about German soldiers?

211
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,920
Who is that? - Yes well...
it's Captain Ernst Biermösl.

212
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,750
Did you hear that Lilly?
Those of us on the front have no idea...

213
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,980
...what's going on.

214
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,780
And the answers are all right here.

215
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,720
You and your drinking buddies
you know what's going on right?

216
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,690
Regardless I'd like to know what
you're doing in my daughter's bedroom.

217
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,060
Dancing Bavarian jig.

218
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,830
I'm reporting you.

219
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,100
What do you say now?

220
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,730
Nothing.

221
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,630
Now you can smell death
like your son-in-law.

222
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,630
Where's the door?

223
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,210
That was a bit too much wasn't it?
- Why?

224
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,710
You... You weren't serious in there?

225
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,900
People like you and your kind won't
be around much longer.

226
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,910
But...

227
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,610
You...

228
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,110
You...

229
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,110
Go!

230
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,160
Go! Go!

231
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,420
Lilly!
- Why don't you shut up for once!

232
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:59,130
Lilly where are you going?
- To the zoo to get my children!

233
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,130
At least then I'll know what I'm good for.
Heil Hitler.

234
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,710
Not even Hitler and his bloodsuckers
could keep Felice from her old habits.

235
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,470
Her favorite meeting place
was the "Hotel at the Zoo"

236
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,080
...where there were so many uniforms that
the race question did not even come up.

237
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,210
That was the real Berlin:
Outside people were dying...

238
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,840
...and inside they were playing
the proper tune.

239
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,500
On behalf of First Lieutenant von Deeken
I'd like you to join us for some wine.

240
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,170
Wine? How did you manage that?

241
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,660
Did you sell your castle?

242
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
There are ways and means.

243
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:29,570
May we? There are no strings attached.
- What a shame.

244
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,040
Just kidding.

245
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,100
Most of us are going back tonight.

246
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,700
In two hours.

247
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,280
May I... May I go back with a "yes. "

248
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,910
But only if you stay at your own table.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

249
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,250
It's alright sweetheart.
It's only your nerves.

250
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,950
It won't be long.

251
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,280
I'm certain.

252
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,050
Perhaps you'd like to freshen up
alright?

253
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,290
Go with her Klara.

254
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,060
Are you crazy?
What if somebody comes in here?

255
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,500
I sleep on sofas chairs everywhere.
Wherever you like.

256
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,640
But I don't want to smell bad
understand? I need something clean.

257
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,840
Do you have to scare us like that?
- Here. Where is Felice damn it!

258
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,700
What's up?
- All this is for Schmidt. Stamps...

259
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
...five passports...

260
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,270
...blank Red Cross passports.
- For when? - Immediately.

261
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,070
Did they notice anything?

262
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,640
Hey!

263
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,740
Good evening.

264
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,010
You'll be okay in a minute. I'm sure.

265
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,620
What's wrong with her? Hungry?

266
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,300
I suppose you didn't have any breakfast
did you girl?

267
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,190
I don't understand what you mean.

268
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,990
She looks like a girl who should buy
some food stamps.

269
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,730
We don't understand.

270
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,230
How much?

271
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,230
Ah we can be friendly too.

272
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,020
What are you? Jews?

273
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,170
She's a Jew and so are you.

274
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,240
Would you please sell us some?

275
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,240
You little phony!

276
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,700
How much?
- 200.

277
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,570
That's... Too much.
- Make it fast.

278
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,610
Heil Hitler.

279
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,110
Exciting times aren't they?

280
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,550
Ilse is in the hotel.

281
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,510
Mommy I made lots of boats.

282
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,230
Nice of you to come so soon.
- Shut up!

283
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,590
Here's to the Germans...

284
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,230
...the most honest people in the world.

285
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,500
You'll all destroy yourselves.

286
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,760
Ilse come on. Sit down.

287
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,660
Come on.

288
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,640
To the girls.

289
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,140
Oh no. It's time to go.

290
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,810
Why? If we aren't allowed to go
to the theater let's enjoy Mrs. Wust.

291
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,810
Sorry Mrs. Wust. We were at the zoo
and I met some girlfriends.

292
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,740
I wasn't aware you knew each other.
- Ilse has told us so much about you.

293
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,190
About me? What's there to tell?

294
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,850
For example that you have
a Mother's Cross in silver.

295
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,120
Bronze.

296
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,660
Oh! - And that your children
love to go to the zoo.

297
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,220
And that you have
a superb sense of smell.

298
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,760
Mrs. Wust
could you tell me what I smell like?

299
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,750
It's nice. It smells somehow...
Is it French?

300
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,620
Bravo!

301
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,770
I'd better go. Sorry to have bothered
you. I'll take the children.

302
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,370
We'll come along.

303
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,810
To my place?
- Yes.

304
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,660
Everyone?
- Mrs. Wust.

305
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,300
We won't bother you at all. Ilse has
told us such wonderful things and...

306
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,810
Klara dear tell her.
Don't be ashamed in front of Mrs. Wust.

307
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,500
My girlfriend had a terrible mishap
and she needs a bath urgently.

308
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,120
That's not so bad.
It can happen to any of us. - Yes.

309
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,610
You see?

310
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,260
Waiter! The check please.

311
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,750
I don't know why
we met that day at the hotel...

312
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,250
...or why Mrs. Wust was looking
for her kids that day.

313
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,560
But who really knows
why two people are drawn together?

314
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,630
Thank you.

315
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,700
Three times I was told
to send them away but I just can't.

316
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,890
Where's your husband?
- On the Eastern front.

317
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,470
Do you think about him often?
- Oh yes all the time actually.

318
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,400
All the good men are gone.
If you have one hold onto him.

319
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,430
That's what Günther says too.
- Pure jealousy.

320
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,600
He just wants to keep you from picking
up a young guy with disability papers.

321
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,570
You know all about it don't you?

322
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,170
Felice! Mrs. Wust!

323
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,780
Over here! He'll give us a lift.

324
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:41,150
You have to live your life now Felice.
It's very important.

325
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,520
Now.

326
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,650
Let's go. You're freezing.

327
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,290
Hi Grandpa.
- Hi Grandma.

328
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,470
I'm glad you're still here. This is...
- Lotte.

329
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,230
Klara. How do you do.

330
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,400
That night I realized
Felice's letter wasn't "just for fun"

331
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,830
...and amusement.

332
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,210
Old man Wust invited a few neighbors
and played the piano.

333
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,800
After a while he and Felice
got Lilly to sing us a song.

334
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,680
She stood and sang.

335
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,440
But in reality something else happened.
She took Felice away from me.

336
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,470
With every moment more and more.

337
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:49,380
"Oh your world is so beautiful...

338
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:57,380
Father when it shines so golden...

339
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:12,650
...when your radiance falls upon the earth...

340
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:21,620
...and paints the dust until it glistens.

341
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,270
When the redness that flickers in the clouds...

342
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,840
...sets upon my silent window. "

343
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,780
You can't be serious.
- What?

344
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,270
To flirt with her.

345
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:01,640
Flirting is always serious.
It's love which sometimes... - What?

346
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,480
...looks funny.

347
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,720
Well that's it.

348
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,020
That was highly dramatic! Impressive!
"We were stupid not you!"

349
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,620
Ilse we're in the street.
- I am. You are. Don't say "we!"

350
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,300
You're celebrating New Year's Eve with
her. Should I make the bed for you two?

351
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,360
I'm good at it. It's my domestic year.
- I didn't want to hurt you Ilse.

352
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,400
You don't have to apologize.
She's good for you Felice.

353
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,570
She can do what we can't.

354
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,300
I hide you.
But with her you talk about love.

355
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,300
The main thing is you feel good. I hate you.

356
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,050
What does she have that I don't have?

357
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,030
Nothing absolutely nothing. She isn't
better or worse than any of us.

358
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,600
How can you say that? How?

359
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,550
Has she risked her life? Would she lie
and steal and fight for you?

360
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,280
Do you think she'd take the risks
my father takes?

361
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,910
She has no idea what it's like listening
to every idiot who comes up the stairs.

362
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,320
But you know how it is Felice.
Your behavior just makes me sick!

363
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,340
So send me a bill.

364
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:47,320
I'm sorry.
- What for? You're right.

365
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,630
"God created the world Felice.
You didn't. "

366
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,860
That's what my father always said to me.

367
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:06,470
My sister my mother... They all agreed
"Felice is crazy. "

368
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,930
And do you know why?

369
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,740
Because for me
nothing can be taken for granted.

370
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,300
No God.

371
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,970
No car that picks me up
no Ilse to help me...

372
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,640
...and no "thank you"
I have to tell her every day.

373
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,080
You want something special and I'm not.

374
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,470
I am ungrateful
and desperate for admiration.

375
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,710
Say whatever you like.

376
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,350
But don't make me a victim...

377
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:54,020
...because it's my goddamned mediocre
little right to be free.

378
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,860
As long as I can. - It's alright.

379
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,690
No it isn't.

380
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,090
You condemn Wust because
she has no cause. Is that a crime?

381
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,450
Did she ever harm you?
Married at twenty?

382
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,960
Four children? Is that the problem?
Or is it the lovers?

383
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,800
He fools around and she should suffer?
No Ilse!

384
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,960
You don't know anything about her.

385
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,590
Maybe she knows more than you think
about people and death and life!

386
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,700
I gave you my friendship Ilse
and my love. That's all I have.

387
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,370
Who loves whom? - What?

388
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,610
My father was really a communist
and a helpful person.

389
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,800
But when Felice asked him politely...

390
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,470
...if he'd heard of Sappho he looked at her
with all the Kremlin's wrath...

391
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,570
...and threw her out.

392
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,610
Well look at you.
- My father threw her out. - Bravo.

393
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,880
She's moving in with Mrs. Wust.
- Shut up!

394
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,580
Why? No one would suspect you if you
were with a conformist! - Jealous?

395
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,080
Why jealous?
She's constantly nibbling on you.

396
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,950
I'm the one who should be jealous.
- Are you? - No.

397
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,390
You see? She doesn't care.
Whatever you do she doesn't care.

398
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,750
You're early aren't you?
- Sorry.

399
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,090
My lover always says goodbye
as if it were the last time.

400
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,090
Lotte and her men!
- Don't start that again!

401
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,860
Hey Schmidty!
How can we get in the mood...

402
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,340
...with music like that?
- It was never a problem for you before.

403
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,930
Here I don't want anything
to do with it. Get dressed.

404
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,030
But why? Everything's gone perfectly up to now.
- I'm giving you 3 minutes.

405
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,700
Stefan I have 5 people
who have to get away.

406
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,870
I've always said steal them wherever
you like but not from official places!

407
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:55,930
The Red Cross!
- Stefan please!

408
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,450
4 weeks.

409
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,480
We could all be dead in 4 weeks.
- That's very possible.

410
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,810
I want to see more of the fat one. Our soldiers...

411
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,390
...want something to hold onto.
- Who's fat here? - Dumb question.

412
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,350
What does he mean by "hold onto?"
- "Hold onto" means...

413
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,430
"hold onto it. "

414
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,430
What do you think the soldiers do with the pictures?
- They look at them.

415
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,130
Very good. And then?
- They pin them on the wall.

416
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,960
And then?

417
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:59,140
They look again. - Is she joking?
- No she really is that stupid.

418
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,610
Yes.

419
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,780
I have to go to the editorial office.
What's keeping you? - We're ready.

420
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,080
Lotte!
- Yeah go ahead.

421
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,560
Next week? Promise?
- Slut!

422
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,820
Why? The cellar of the newspaper office
is excellent.

423
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,820
There are cots bed sheets
and sometimes even milk.

424
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,020
I'll just say my house was bombed.

425
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,900
And then I bent down...

426
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,400
...very close to her stupid face and said...

427
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:14,490
"If you want to buy a dress
for 400 marks...

428
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,600
...that's your business. " Half her villa
burned down in the middle of Dahlem!

429
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,330
My father said she could bathe
at our house whenever she liked.

430
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,340
Madam? - Yes.

431
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,460
Could we see your identification?

432
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,710
What are they doing? What?
- Talking.

433
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,480
I'm sure I have it...
- Where are you coming from?

434
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,640
I had it in my pocket.

435
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,720
Alright what's your name?

436
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm going back.
- Keep going! Don't turn around!

437
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,680
What's your name?

438
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,830
Stop!

439
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,090
Ilse get her away! Fast!

440
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,650
Fast!

441
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,530
Now that the Jewish mania for
destruction has shown its hideous face...

442
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,420
...in the deeds of those aerial pirates...

443
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,360
...even the weak and cowardly elements
among us have realized...

444
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:52,110
...that National Socialism is our people's
greatest and only hope.

445
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,840
The world can mock us
but it will tremble when it realizes...

446
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,140
...what tremendous feats
this people is capable of.

447
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,110
Lower Rhineland... Yes that's it.

448
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,590
Your head... I've always wondered
where you come from.

449
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,780
Here you are.

450
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,150
Drink it.

451
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,560
No thanks.

452
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,160
Go on.

453
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,580
Drink...

454
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,660
You're safe here.

455
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,500
Listen Mrs. Schrader.
We'll make a deal.

456
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,200
Forget your bombed-out apartment...

457
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,660
...and I won't tell a soul that you have
the most beautiful smile in the world.

458
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,530
I've often wondered
what goes on in your mind?

459
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,900
I haven't found an answer yet.

460
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:07,430
But I'm sure that one of these days
you'll give it to me.

461
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,850
Hello Mrs. Wust speaking.

462
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,460
Hello? Who is there?

463
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,640
Günther?

464
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,540
Günther?

465
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,480
I'm a bad boy Lilly.
It isn't easy I know.

466
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,880
But it's my apartment my pipe
my wife...

467
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,520
...my children. I'm home you see?

468
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,720
I'm home!

469
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,790
I want you and your hands
on the arch of night...

470
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,860
...to send you all the love
I've ever felt inside.

471
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,760
Whoever I may have liked before...

472
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,090
I feel...

473
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,270
...since I met you.

474
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,000
Perhaps...
Perhaps in all the others...

475
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,570
...it's only you I've always loved.

476
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,530
Only you.

477
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,940
Now the night comes to an end...

478
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:02,200
Alone alone alone.

479
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,720
But I think of your hands...

480
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,120
...and tenderly I fall asleep.

481
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:41,260
We found that among her things:
No name no clues nothing.

482
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,710
Have it analyzed by Department 4c.
Something always turns up.

483
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:02,110
Berlin was at its end.
Death and destruction were everywhere.

484
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,580
Still we wanted to celebrate
New Year's Eve like everyone else.

485
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,880
Felice managed to get herself
and Erika's beauty parlor invited...

486
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,760
...to Mrs. Wust's.

487
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,980
Imagine that disgusting sweaty
little lieutenant...

488
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,840
...chewing on our pretty Marlene
as if she were a sausage.

489
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,150
At least better than the actor Rühmann!
- Rühmann!

490
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,560
"I break the hearts
of the vainest women...

491
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,180
...because I'm so tiny and so greedy
and so passionate. "

492
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,150
Felice!

493
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,050
Just what I expected.

494
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,330
You don't miss any opportunity do you?

495
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:52,320
Did they really shock you?
- Oh no. They were very...

496
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,220
Very what?

497
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,060
I'd like to go.

498
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,100
Your tickets please.

499
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,200
Did I disappoint you?

500
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,140
Would you rather I call off the party?
- No.

501
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,080
I'm looking forward to it. Really.

502
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:43,310
Keep going onwards onwards my ladies.
This is neither French nor Scottish...

503
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,050
...nor Italian.
It's my good old German rosehips...

504
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,150
...home-brewed and extremely effective.

505
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:57,050
If Churchill thinks he's done us in he's wrong.
Not while we're dancing.

506
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,310
Stop jabbering and sit down.
- Boy Hilde. You're really drunk.

507
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,990
Things are really hopping here!

508
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,100
Who... who are these people?

509
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,930
Girlfriends...
They are all girlfriends.

510
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,900
Look at that brave soldier!
- Happy New Year.

511
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:40,180
Look at that.
Say Sweetie. Is that your spouse?

512
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,350
Happy New Year darling.

513
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,810
Jesus Lilly.
This is what I call New Year's Eve!

514
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,320
Happy New Year!
I'm what you might call the host.

515
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,950
May I Mrs. Jäger?

516
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,990
Nice to see you.

517
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,210
Your life is wonderful Felice.

518
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,050
You're free.

519
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,290
Where are your parents?

520
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,000
Dead.
- I'm sorry.

521
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:54,390
My God! Excuse me. I'm really sorry.

522
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:01,300
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

523
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,140
Want to see someone
who always does the wrong thing?

524
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:09,830
Here I am.

525
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,210
Felice?

526
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,980
Yes?

527
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,160
Why do you mean so much to me?

528
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:37,240
Ilse and Günther are kissing.
Isn't that funny?

529
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,170
Ilse and Günther!

530
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,040
What kind of game are you all playing?
What kind of game?

531
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,890
Felice...

532
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,910
Do you want to see me?

533
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,720
He wants to steal those kids!
The first second and third...

534
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:21,520
...try to escape but they aren't able to.

535
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,520
Where were you?
- Out walking.

536
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:29,790
Alright stop!
Attention! Eyes straight ahead!

537
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,250
Forward march! And get dressed!
The first to finish...

538
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,320
...gets to see photos of my unit.

539
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,730
Good morning.

540
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,950
Come into the kitchen.

541
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,070
Real coffee! Just for us.

542
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,270
That Ilse!

543
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,730
Happy New Year.

544
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:16,070
Know what I don't understand?
Why men are so susceptible.

545
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,880
You have a wife and kids. Everything's great.

546
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,270
Suddenly an Ilse or a Käthe...

547
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,010
...or whatever she's called
comes and looks at you.

548
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:30,390
She just looks at you. And you think
"Damn! Hands off! Taboo!"

549
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:34,970
But she's still there.
You women don't know what it's like.

550
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,550
You need a man to guide you...

551
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,880
...a man with a sense of responsibility.

552
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,920
But you have no idea what it costs Lilly.

553
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,750
Dammit! You know
it doesn't mean anything to me...

554
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,850
...but I have a hard time saying "no. "

555
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,100
It has nothing to do with you.

556
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,950
What? Nothing to do with me?

557
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:06,120
You're not even jealous?
Not even angry?

558
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,940
Lilly do you know
why I came back yesterday?

559
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:18,400
I wanted to tell you on New Year's
that you're a wonderful woman...

560
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,430
...and that I'd do everything not to lose you.

561
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,370
Here this is my unit.

562
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,290
Since all hell's broken loose out there
I know what I'm capable of.

563
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,100
What?

564
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,310
I'm the kind of guy who comes back.

565
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,980
I look at my comrades
and I know who won't make it.

566
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,920
Just before I left one guy got
half his skull blown away.

567
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:01,150
He looked at me and said "Oh man Wust.
It was all too short huh?"

568
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,920
You have to duck fast Lilly.
That's the secret.

569
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:08,730
Send the older kids to the country.

570
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,130
Who knows what'll happen.
- Daddy!

571
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,860
Now now. Don't cry. Not my big boy.

572
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,400
When I'm not here
you're the boss okay?

573
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,900
Come on. Lie down. It'll be okay.

574
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,230
Go to sleep.

575
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,220
Sleep tight.

576
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,830
The Russians sing all night long.

577
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,510
We're going to win Lilly.

578
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,040
We'll win!

579
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:03,380
...Germans are capable of overcoming
mental and physical obstacles.

580
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,980
The German people have demonstrated
their strength in the past years.

581
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,180
Without a doubt they will emerge
from this tremendous war...

582
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,890
...as the most glorious people
of all time.

583
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:22,360
Of course our victories in the early
war years were even more glorious.

584
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,810
But this year
we have to prove ourselves.

585
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,520
We have to prove to ourselves
and to history...

586
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:37,760
...that we have the strength
to overcome the biggest obstacles...

587
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,160
...and we won't fail.

588
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:45,020
Our courage and our stamina
will be strengthened.

589
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,370
And this we have done.

590
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,140
May I come in?

591
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,330
Felice...

592
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:41,150
Please don't hurt me.

593
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,330
I'd better go.
- I'd die if you did.

594
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,950
You are Aimée...

595
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,060
...and I am Jaguar.

596
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,880
My sweet sweet girl.

597
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,270
Calm down.

598
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,280
How beautiful you are.

599
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:57,010
So beautiful.

600
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,450
It's all my fault.

601
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,900
Do you feel safe?

602
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,330
Should I stop?

603
01:03:55,010 --> 01:04:01,910
It's too much Felice.
It's too much.

604
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,500
I can't stop trembling.

605
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,240
I can't either.

606
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,150
We're both trembling...

607
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,980
It's a trembling contest.

608
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,610
Schragenheim!

609
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,940
Watch out!

610
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:28,140
Get in the back Grandma!
- Hands off! I can do it alone.

611
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,050
Mrs. Schragenheim...
back there on the right.

612
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:43,410
Miss Felice Schragenheim was here
3 days ago. What does she call herself?

613
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,530
I don't know.
- What does she look like?

614
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:53,510
Dyed hair... Dyed blond hair.

615
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,590
Where does that door lead to?

616
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,930
The house next door.
- Go next door!

617
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:24,360
Calm down calm down.

618
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:29,200
Everything's alright. Come to me.

619
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,530
It will be morning soon.

620
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,960
You're here.

621
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,430
You're here.

622
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:51,010
Say it again.

623
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,440
I love you.

624
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:07,750
Okay my little bear.
We'll take care of it.

625
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,180
Alright... That's it.

626
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:15,110
Oh my goodness. Take over here.

627
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,380
Just stir right?
Not too slow not too fast. I know.

628
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:25,020
I'm so proud. - Of what?
- Of you the kids myself.

629
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:30,150
I don't know why Felice but since
you're here everything makes sense.

630
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,280
Don't say that too often or I'll run away.

631
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,590
I know you'd come back again.

632
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,630
Oh yes? Why?

633
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:41,570
Because I watch you all night long.

634
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,490
You keep tossing and turning
until I take your hand and calm you.

635
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,090
I'd rather you sleep.
- Why?

636
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:54,030
Before I never slept
because I was alone.

637
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,340
And now because you're here.

638
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:01,340
Hold it with both hands
and look through here. - Yeah.

639
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,030
See anything? - Yes.

640
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,700
Now take the picture... Good.
- Me too.

641
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,270
Can you see anything?
- Yes.

642
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,140
Your mom?
- Yes.

643
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:15,110
Smile! Take the picture... Good.

644
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,180
My beloved Felice...

645
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:21,340
...my beloved kitten
even if you keep slipping away...

646
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:27,710
...and I worry greatly I must tell you how
much I love you. Ever since you started...

647
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:31,240
...padding around our apartment
with your fat paws I've been so happy.

648
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,180
My beloved girl my whole life I've thought...

649
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,450
I was wrong a good-for-nothing.
But now I know that everything was wrong...

650
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,450
...so I could meet you.

651
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:45,450
I waited and you came.
I thank you for that.

652
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:49,790
My intelligent dark-haired girl.
Do you know how beautiful you've become?

653
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:08,500
We'll be together for a long time.
Our happiness has just begun.

654
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,060
It looks good on you.

655
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:23,300
It's okay it's okay.

656
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,750
12 o'clock Felice.

657
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:44,250
Stop nibbling on everyone.
Our birthday girl is waiting.

658
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,410
Lilly! Lilly!

659
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,120
Happy birthday my sweet.

660
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,830
To Berlin's sweetest housewife.

661
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,860
All the best Lilly!

662
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:20,830
Congratulations Lilly.

663
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,460
To Lilly! To Lilly!

664
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:01,340
Don't be afraid my little girl.
I'm by your side.

665
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:04,740
There are no enemies here... Only us.

666
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:33,120
Do you love me?

667
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:37,390
Very much.

668
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,840
More than your life?

669
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:54,230
At this moment? Now? At this moment?

670
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:00,270
Yes.

671
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:18,540
Lilly!

672
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:23,210
No!

673
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:29,810
No!

674
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:59,750
The Wehrmacht's Supreme Command
reports that last night...

675
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:07,970
...the enemy began their long-awaited
invasion of Europe.

676
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:13,540
It was initiated by invasions
of our coastline...

677
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,950
I came back for your birthday
in the middle of war.

678
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,050
What are you doing to me?

679
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,790
My wife is queer.

680
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,060
I'm out in that filth. Everything is
falling apart. You don't know nothing!

681
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,850
You can't take everything away from me
you perverse piece of shit.

682
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:12,630
What do you think we're fighting for?

683
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,960
What's on our mind?

684
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:20,360
You and the kids are all I have.

685
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:25,100
Nobody's going to take it away from me.
Not even you.

686
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:32,200
A person can get used to anything:
Death and everything.

687
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:35,230
But what I saw upstairs
in the apartment is...

688
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,580
...the worst!

689
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:44,380
Go up there and show them
what a wife and a mother is.

690
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,240
Go up there!
And I'll forget I ever saw it.

691
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,140
Günther I've never loved you.

692
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,180
That's news to me.

693
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,220
I want a divorce.

694
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:02,710
You don't know what you're saying.
You never knew what you wanted.

695
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,110
You were always searching
and I guided you.

696
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,620
Now you can prove who you really are.

697
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:16,020
Günther... Let's talk about this.

698
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:22,650
I need a wife with character.
Or a lawyer.

699
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:27,730
Maybe you can destroy my home
but not my children understand?

700
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,000
I told him I want a divorce.

701
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,350
What? You did what?

702
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,660
Are you crazy Lilly?
You're a woman with 4 kids. - So what?

703
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,730
I feel like I've been born again.

704
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,270
He told me to decide and I did.

705
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,000
I'm one of you now.

706
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,840
It's what you wanted isn't it?

707
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:06,040
If he goes to court
we're all in for it.

708
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,840
I... I thought you'd be happy.

709
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:20,710
What about the kids?
- He wants everything...

710
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:24,750
...the children the apartment
a confession but he's just saying that.

711
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,680
Are you sure?

712
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:35,120
What did I tell you?
We have to get away. You know that.

713
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,720
Look what I made Felice! - How nice.

714
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,670
Should I make you one too?
- Oh yes. - Okay.

715
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,830
You don't regret it do you?

716
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,130
Answer me. Do you regret it?

717
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:12,010
What exactly?
- That... That you...

718
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,640
That we are now one.

719
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:20,970
Are you happy?

720
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,170
Very.

721
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:26,000
Then everything's alright.

722
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:31,750
Don't worry. I'll learn to type.

723
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,750
To type? You? What for?

724
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,840
For you for the children for our family.

725
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,280
It's so nice when you laugh.

726
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,820
I'll be gone for a few days.

727
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,860
Why?
- Business.

728
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:07,890
Okay.

729
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,930
That dumb cow. - Leave her alone.

730
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:15,260
I was tired of life once. Now you are.

731
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,790
Let's try Switzerland.
Anything you want but only together.

732
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:22,670
Heil Hitler.

733
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:27,030
You've been here often. Tell Mrs. Wust
to report to the authorities.

734
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:30,040
Her children have to be sent away.
- Excuse me.

735
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:41,680
Have you heard that General Paulus
and his staff joined the Russians?

736
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:46,140
They're getting closer and closer
under German leadership.

737
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,070
They all deserve an injection.

738
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,070
Have a nice day.

739
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,810
Attention!

740
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:01,120
Felice where are you?

741
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,890
This is Berlin's 1st Flak Division.

742
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:04,950
Where?

743
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:11,220
The reported bombers are in the area
around Hanover and Braunschweig.

744
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,450
We'll return.

745
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,440
She said her husband had died in action
and she'd do everything but think.

746
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:57,950
Gentlemen the sunshine of my office.
Five times she declined...

747
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:01,510
...but when Siemens and the Deutsche Bank
show up she comes at once.

748
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,580
Come on in.

749
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:15,090
We've heard a lot about you Miss.

750
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:18,080
A lot believe me.

751
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,790
Good or bad?
- Only the best. - Then it's true.

752
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,760
Most Berlin women are lazy. They only
care about promenading nothing else.

753
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:33,100
As long as there are men
waiting for them things won't change.

754
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,990
What would you like to drink?

755
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:57,570
Come with me.

756
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,270
What's happened?
- The Führer is dead.

757
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,110
Miss Schrader!

758
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:18,210
That's all we know.

759
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,690
Out of the way!

760
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,610
The National News should be able
to find out what happened.

761
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,180
The German people expect it of us.

762
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:38,560
No connection? This is Keller
from the National News.

763
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:42,260
At least one line must be free
at the Ministry of Propaganda.

764
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,260
A news blackout? Who gave the orders?

765
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:50,620
The Wehrmacht... A state of emergency.
Yes I'll wait.

766
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,660
Of course I'll wait.

767
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:08,540
Field Marshal von Witzleben
has taken over power.

768
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:12,100
The Head of State is
General Beck.

769
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:17,510
The SS SA and the Gestapo are under
the immediate command of the army.

770
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:20,740
And not a word from Goebbels. Nothing.

771
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:07,160
An assassination attempt on my life...

772
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,860
...has been carried out.

773
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:16,030
I'm speaking to you today...

774
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,270
He's alive.

775
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:25,870
...so that you'll know I wasn't
injured. I'm still alive.

776
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:30,270
Secondly I'd like you to know
what happened.

777
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,970
It was the worst crime
that Germany has ever seen.

778
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:37,670
A very small group of officers...

779
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,280
So many days...

780
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:47,570
Where were you?

781
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,120
Where were you?

782
01:24:56,290 --> 01:25:00,780
The bomb which was planted
by Colonel von Stauffenberg...

783
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:05,710
...detonated 2 meters to my right.

784
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:10,290
Who are you?

785
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:12,950
Felice?

786
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,930
What are you doing to me?

787
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:05,580
When will we get there Mommy?
- I don't know.

788
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:10,940
What kept you? The train can't wait.
Put the child in the back.

789
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,610
It's better for you and your children.
- Mommy!

790
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:29,120
Two IDs from the Ministry of Arms.
You'll travel in separate train cars.

791
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:32,950
If one of you gets caught the others have a chance.

792
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,220
You're a future pediatrician.

793
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,290
What's wrong Felice?

794
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:43,190
Felice. - If they send us back it's over.

795
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:49,360
And here? They're turning Berlin upside
down searching every crack. - I know.

796
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,260
Why don't you take her with you?

797
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:02,410
Could you shut up just once!

798
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,310
Führer's headquarters:

799
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:12,070
German planes successfully attacked
the enemy attempt to cross the Seine.

800
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:14,770
Several pontoon bridges
and packed barges were destroyed.

801
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:24,110
In the area north of Le Havre
several ships were sunk.

802
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:30,520
On the island offshore from St. Malo
a naval unit continued its resistance...

803
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:34,720
...against the attack of a group of enemy destroyers.

804
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,030
You're here.

805
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,520
She's here. My kitten is here.

806
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,000
You're so cold.

807
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:26,100
There's some tea left. Just a moment.

808
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:33,450
Why weren't you in the cellar?
- I couldn't. I was paralyzed somehow.

809
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:37,500
You were what?... Paralyzed?

810
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:47,450
And the children?
- The little ones are in the cellar.

811
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,790
And the older ones are gone...

812
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,810
...evacuated.

813
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,740
I'm the only one here.

814
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:57,640
I'm always here.

815
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:13,030
How are Ilse and Klara?

816
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,020
I don't know.

817
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,660
Sit down Felice.

818
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,390
Yesterday someone in the cellar said...

819
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:35,030
"Life is just. First the bombers
and then real coffee. "

820
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,970
Typical for Berlin isn't it?

821
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:47,840
Where have you been?

822
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:51,870
With friends.

823
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,710
Do I know them? - No.

824
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:11,990
Who the hell do you think you are? I've
waited every day every second for you!

825
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:15,780
I didn't even know
if you were still alive!

826
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,710
But now you're here.

827
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,520
Don't look at me like that.

828
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:37,050
I've asked myself thousands of questions.

829
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:39,720
Now I understand.

830
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,560
I understand that there will always be
something I'm not allowed to know!

831
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,200
Felice how stupid do you think I am?

832
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:06,470
A little trophy here
a little adventure there.

833
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:11,130
Do you think
I didn't see how you all looked at me?

834
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:18,870
This scornful look at my bookshelf!

835
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:25,520
I know very well who I am.

836
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,210
And I'd be glad if I could tell you
I didn't love you.

837
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:39,880
And now you go.
Sowing the seeds of despair...

838
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:42,230
...and then disappear?

839
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:50,220
I'd do anything for you my girl.
But I won't let you laugh at me!

840
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,570
I'm so stupid Felice.

841
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:04,030
Just like with Günther
and Ernst and everyone else.

842
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:08,790
I always thought that if I believed
strongly enough in it...

843
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:13,210
...and fought for it it would come true.

844
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:19,000
My efforts should have to pay off.

845
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:26,730
But I don't feel him inside
just like the others.

846
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:30,670
I always thought he'd succeed...

847
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:38,540
...and everything would make sense.

848
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:44,540
I'd be able to look at him and say...

849
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,810
"That's what love is for. "

850
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:53,960
But nothing happened.

851
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:57,640
Nothing.

852
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:08,660
And then you came along Felice.
My answer the answer.

853
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:13,890
I'm sorry Felice. I didn't want it to happen.

854
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,060
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

855
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,900
Forgive me.

856
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:36,230
I'm Jewish Lilly.

857
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:44,700
You're what?

858
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,580
The worst was when my mother died.

859
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,590
A long time ago.

860
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:08,780
But since then I've never felt safe.
Only with you.

861
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,290
How can you love me?

862
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:29,090
I've tried not to.

863
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,860
Felice.

864
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:41,290
Don't leave me.

865
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:09,270
She isn't coming. She isn't coming.

866
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,840
She never was on time.

867
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:15,520
But today she has to be right?
- She once missed an entire ship.

868
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,250
But not mine. And not my train either!

869
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:26,720
Oh God! Are you traveling like that?

870
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:30,960
I was just at the office.
It'll all be over in 5 weeks.

871
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,320
You damned idiot! Why? Why?

872
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,530
Take her to the train station. Go now!

873
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:55,120
Klara! Fritz! Your train!
You have to leave! - Come on.

874
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,160
We have to go.

875
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:10,330
It was all in vain Felice.
All in vain.

876
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,640
Hurry up. You have to hurry.

877
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:32,840
In the name of all gods
saints and mascots...

878
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:36,170
I pledge myself to the following 10 points...

879
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:42,280
...and hope that all of those gods saints
and mascots will have mercy on me...

880
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:50,580
I will love you boundlessly.

881
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:53,310
Jewish. - And lesbian.

882
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:00,850
Well that's... It really is...

883
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,860
Felice Schragenheim huh?
Your husband is a Nazi.

884
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:09,790
And your lover is a Jewish woman.

885
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,690
That is really...

886
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,890
A catastrophe.

887
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:21,860
I'll never leave you alone.

888
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:24,630
I will be faithful to you always.

889
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:32,960
How do you intend to support yourselves?
How will you make a living?

890
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:39,700
With shorthand and typing.
- Shorthand and typing?

891
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:43,240
And you?
- Me...

892
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:48,890
First I'll become a journalist.
Then I'll become a photographer...

893
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:51,830
...an actress and in the end I'll write books.

894
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:57,370
Books? That's good.
Quite a lot at one time isn't it?

895
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:04,800
I'll never stare at other girls.

896
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:09,610
Lesbian...

897
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,380
I never knew there was such a thing.
Come here.

898
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,650
You have to get away Felice.
Without me. You have to get away.

899
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,790
Without you?

900
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,420
How stupid you are my girl.

901
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:34,120
How stupid.

902
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,330
How are things in Normandy?
- The Americans have taken Rennes.

903
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,400
How do you know that?

904
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:47,960
Because I read it this morning.
- Not only this morning.

905
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:51,300
Every morning before you come. Why?

906
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:57,420
Because it interests me.
- Why?

907
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:07,940
Because I want it to stop.

908
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:12,810
Don't you?

909
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:19,180
What would I do without you
Mrs. Schrader?

910
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:48,450
No Mr. Lause. Not so snappy!

911
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,390
Smooth and easy... Like this.

912
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,290
Easy with your hips like Mrs. Jäger.

913
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:07,820
Nothing to eat but the rumba.
That's culture.

914
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:17,000
Good. In a few more days you'll have
a special show at the Adlon:

915
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:19,740
"The Ballerina from Schmargendorf. "

916
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:25,060
Ladies Mrs. Jäger and I have invited
you here today because...

917
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:28,240
How should I say it? As a boy
I wanted to join the Kaiser's army.

918
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:30,240
Get to the point.

919
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:33,410
In short we may be a bit too old but...

920
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:38,410
...considering the military situation...
- Where love may fall let it flourish.

921
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,810
We've become engaged.

922
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:47,120
And only you dear Lilly and you
dear Felice know about it.

923
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:51,020
Don't you think we're silly?
Funny isn't it?

924
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:58,280
"Now sleep sweetly. May heaven give
that until your life is over...

925
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:00,220
...love will live. " Cheers.

926
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:29,770
Come on!

927
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,120
Not my legs Felice! Not my legs! - Why not?

928
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,280
I don't like it!

929
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:27,150
No Felice! Don't! - What's wrong?
My silly little Aimée. They're lovely.

930
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:30,890
It's just that your bottom is too flat.
- You!

931
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,360
But I love it! I love it!

932
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:39,430
Attention.

933
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,960
Wait.

934
01:43:45,570 --> 01:43:46,900
Wait.

935
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:51,500
Felice!

936
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:55,980
Okay I'm ready.

937
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,740
Don't look so serious Miss.

938
01:43:59,110 --> 01:44:01,400
Be casual and smile.
- It doesn't look good on me.

939
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:03,240
Come on smile Felice.

940
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:05,430
I can't.

941
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:12,480
Why not think about my beautiful
flat ass in your black underwear?

942
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:23,210
My God Lilly. I don't know
if I'm strong enough. - For what?

943
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,940
Happiness.

944
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:28,120
Oh no!

945
01:44:28,990 --> 01:44:31,220
Our Tristan broadcast begins at 8 p. M.

946
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:37,250
Are we having apple pie and English tea?
- Sorry dearest madam. I forgot.

947
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:41,020
Shame on you slut!
- Know what the divorce judge said?

948
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:44,850
"Arent you ashamed? We're at war and
you ruined your husband's happiness!"

949
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:48,160
So I got up all my courage and said
"Your Honor...

950
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:51,860
...all I'm ashamed of
is that I could never give him one. "

951
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,250
"You're crazy" he yelled.

952
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:57,490
And I said "Maybe
but I'm about to improve myself. "

953
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:03,960
You think you're allowed to see me
after what you said? To see my ass?

954
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:07,400
Definitely.
- No never! You're not worthy of it!

955
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:10,300
Then I'll take you... By force.

956
01:45:10,830 --> 01:45:15,170
Tristan! What about our Tristan?
- We're too late.

957
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:20,810
Keep going. Another kiss...

958
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:23,270
Just one the last one.

959
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:29,130
Schragenheim.

960
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,840
Who is that?

961
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:38,820
Not blonde after all.
Pack up your things!

962
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,320
You knew that she was a Jew.

963
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:52,110
How many children do you have? - Four.

964
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,470
Where is she?

965
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:19,730
Get up!

966
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:36,100
Stop it! Stop it please!

967
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:39,440
You knew she was a Jew!
Did you know?

968
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:43,370
Were you friends with her?

969
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:53,280
Get up! Come on!

970
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,310
No!

971
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:07,500
Terezin.

972
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:48,400
Are the children back home?

973
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:55,060
Günther is dead.

974
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,470
Sorry Lilly.

975
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:15,100
As long as she's in Terezin
we can still hope.

976
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,240
She'll be transferred.

977
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:28,440
How do you know that?
- I was there. I visited her.

978
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:31,420
You what?

979
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,280
You visited her there?

980
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:45,360
You visited her
in the concentration camp?

981
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:51,380
The captain screamed like an animal.

982
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:56,290
She didn't even know I was there.

983
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,990
They'll send her away.

984
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:12,220
Do you know what you've done Lilly?
Do you?

985
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:21,600
Lilly!

986
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:30,300
She and I belong together more than you two.

987
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,400
She loves me.

988
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:42,150
No!

989
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:48,280
You have to tell me. Please!

990
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:54,490
Did she sleep with you again?

991
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:16,620
Lilly!

992
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:45,470
What's wrong with your leg?
- Broken twice. I have steel pins in it.

993
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,940
The doctor said it was a brilliant job.

994
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:54,300
Do you think it's a coincidence?
- Our meeting here?

995
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:57,130
That we have to go through it all again.

996
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:02,680
Don't worry about it.
All we have left are two meals a day.

997
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:09,420
Do you wear the scarf because it's pretty
or to cover your wrinkly neck?

998
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:13,620
How did things go for you?

999
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:20,990
All I thought about was her.
- What? No love affairs? No adventures?

1000
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,650
Nothing at all?

1001
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:29,650
And you? - At first lots.
Then fewer and now even fewer.

1002
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,190
You know I think fate betrayed me.

1003
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,020
Oh well it used to be the Führer.
Now it's fate.

1004
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:42,390
Always some excuse.
And if possible something big.

1005
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:45,930
Sorry Lilly. I'm too old for that joke.

1006
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:50,590
You betrayed yourself.
You and no one else.

1007
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:54,670
I loved her so much Ilse.

1008
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:59,900
I did too.
- But not like I did.

1009
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:04,430
If it makes you happy...

1010
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:12,710
Were you really together with that many?
- Oh yes. I liked quite a few.

1011
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:18,380
People are so different Lilly.
With luck something might remain.

1012
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:21,110
It was surely more platonic.
- Oh no.

1013
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,340
I'm definitely a little pig.

1014
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:27,180
But that doesn't matter.

1015
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:44,080
50 years Ilse.

1016
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,450
50 years.

1017
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:53,460
And one thought.

1018
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,320
One face.

1019
01:54:00,130 --> 01:54:00,990
One name.

1020
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:05,990
Sweetheart one is a stupid number.
It's never enough. That's the problem.

1021
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:10,600
Come back to the house! Lunch is ready!

1022
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:14,690
Was it my fault Ilse?

1023
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:22,370
I don't know Lilly.
I was always certain. Too certain.

1024
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,640
Felice stayed because she loved you.

1025
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:29,640
And you went to see her because you loved her.

1026
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:33,370
I can't tell you anything more.

1027
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:36,670
Hello ladies. We're waiting for you.

1028
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:43,680
Sure dearie. You haven't got
the slightest idea. Come on Lilly.

1029
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:52,340
"A love that lasts forever. "
Know what Felice said?

1030
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,550
"That greedy Mrs. Wust
just can't get enough.

1031
01:54:56,090 --> 01:55:01,580
She made me sign a contract:
'Forever. ' Sounds like a gravestone. "

1032
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:06,620
No she didn't say "like a gravestone. "
- Yes she did.

1033
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,490
Come on Lilly.

1034
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:42,990
This moves the film
and this is how you focus.

1035
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:49,270
Lovely cards. Who are they from?
- Capt. Ernst Biermösl. God bless him.

1036
01:56:02,350 --> 01:56:06,650
Did you notice I changed the key?
- I didn't notice you'd even found one.

1037
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:12,720
Isn't that awful?... "Forever and ever"
sounds like an epitaph.

1038
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:16,550
I thought it was nice.
- What about you mouse? What d'you say?

1039
01:56:17,090 --> 01:56:21,080
About what?
- The one and only true ideal love.

1040
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:26,120
You can look for it. - Horrible.
One love and you have to look for it!

1041
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,460
Leave her alone now.

1042
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:31,460
Life is not like that.
It scratches and scrapes...

1043
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:34,730
...and all at once you clean the windows.
- Not me.

1044
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,390
Listen to that. Real romantic.

1045
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:42,360
"Falling in love again
never wanted to.

1046
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,130
What is she to do?"

1047
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:47,370
And you?
- "She can't help it. "

1048
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:52,500
What do you want Felice?
- Me?... You all of you everyone.

1049
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,660
Everything! But I'd be satisfied
with one single moment...

1050
01:56:57,210 --> 01:57:00,470
...so perfect it would last a lifetime.
- That's easy.

1051
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:05,080
Where do you find something like that?
- For example this one here is great.

1052
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,000
I don't want "forever. " I want "now!"

1053
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:12,240
Now! Now! Now!

1054
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:16,710
I want loads of "nows!" And I want them
till I turn old and gray.

1055
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:20,180
And besides I want more cake.

1056
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,580
Again.

1057
01:57:29,690 --> 01:57:32,590
After the war Lilly waited in vain
for Felice for many years.

1058
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:35,650
The exact circumstances
of Felice's death are unknown.

1059
01:57:36,190 --> 01:57:38,660
She probably died during
one of the notorius death marches.

1060
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:48,620
Today in the spring of 1999
84-year-old Lilly Wust lives in Berlin.
