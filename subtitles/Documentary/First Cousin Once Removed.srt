167
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,494
Excuse me,

168
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,871
(MISPRONOUNCES)
Mr. Krzyszkowski?

169
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,957
It's "Krzyszkowski."

170
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,584
Everyone calls me "K."

171
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,586
Mr. K, I am Sheriff Swan.

172
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,088
I'm hoping to look
at the birth certificates

173
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,506
of Ava and Nicholas Zimmer.

174
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,302
All right, just fill out this form

175
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,846
in triplicate.

176
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,727
Okay.

177
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,941
I'm so sorry.

178
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,444
Those documents
have been recently removed.

179
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,778
By who?

180
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,406
Don't worry, Ms. Swan, you can relax.

181
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,451
I've contacted Social Services.

182
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,828
It turns out these kids
are on their own.

183
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,455
They need help.

184
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,541
Which is exactly what I'm trying to
do. I'm trying to find their father.

185
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,501
Well,

186
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,504
he doesn't exist.

187
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,340
He has to.

188
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,178
Of course, biologically, he exists
but there is no record of him.

189
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,597
Which means we have no choice.

190
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,642
These children need a home. So they
will be put into the foster system.

191
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,519
Storybrooke has a foster system?

192
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,897
No. But I've contacted the state.

193
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,609
Maine's group homes,
unfortunately, are filled,

194
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,487
but they put us in touch
with two homes in Boston.

195
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,322
A boys' home and a girls'.

196
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,908
They're separating them?

197
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,659
I don't like it either.

198
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,245
But we've got no choice.

199
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,164
You need to have them
in Boston tonight.

200
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,332
Me?

201
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,918
Well, you wanted to be sheriff.

202
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,670
This is what sheriffs do.

203
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,922
Yes, you're taking them.

204
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,549
No. I promised them
they wouldn't be separated.

205
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,677
Well, then perhaps you should stop
making promises you can't keep.

206
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,891
These children need a home.

207
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,227
I'm just trying to find the best one.

208
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,814
What is that?

209
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,401
My father's compass.
He gave it to me so I could find him.

210
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,486
But now it's broken.

211
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,448
When are you gonna tell us
where we're going?

212
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,909
This is close enough.

213
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,411
Close enough to what?

214
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,914
The home of the Blind Witch.

215
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,209
That doesn't sound good.

216
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,922
She has something of mine.
And I need you to get it back.

217
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,048
What is it?

218
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,218
Something I need to defeat a very
wicked and powerful enemy.

219
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,974
It's kept in a black leather satchel
inside her house.

220
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,644
Why don't you get it yourself?
How come you need us?

221
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,272
Because the house
is protected by magic.

222
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,398
I can't enter.

223
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,278
But luckily the spell
doesn't work on children.

224
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,156
You'll have to wait here
until nightfall.

225
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,492
And then, once the witch is asleep,

226
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,662
you can sneak in.

227
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,585
And if we do this,
you promise you'll find our father?

228
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,670
Oh, indeed I will.

229
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,673
But there's one more thing.

230
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,341
The witch's house is

231
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,511
unique.

232
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,807
And because of this, you have to take
special precaution once you're inside.

233
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,601
Like what?

234
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:35,272
No matter what you do,
no matter how you're tempted,

235
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,194
don't eat anything.

236
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,972
Any luck?

237
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,349
No.

238
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,017
I know who they are.

239
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,187
A brother and sister. Lost.

240
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,523
No parents.

241
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,901
Hansel and Gretel.

242
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,653
Anything in there about the dad?

243
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,655
Just that he abandoned them.

244
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,490
- Great.
- (CLOSES BOOK)

245
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,200
Sounds like a familiar story.

246
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,744
Whoever this guy is,
he could be in Laos by now.

247
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,496
No, he's here.

248
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,915
(SCOFFS) And just
how do you know that?

249
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,042
'Cause no one leaves Storybrooke.

250
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,585
No one comes here.

251
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,421
No one goes. It's just the way it is.

252
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,506
I came here.

253
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,341
Because you're special.

254
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,052
You're the first stranger here, ever.

255
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,845
Right. I forgot.

256
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,723
Well, if he's around here anywhere,
I'm gonna find him.

257
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,438
Can you tell me about him?

258
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,607
I don't know anything yet.

259
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,110
Not their father. Mine.

260
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,949
I told you about your parents,
now you're even living with your mom.

261
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,617
Mary Margaret isn't...

262
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,119
She's...

263
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,789
Never mind.

264
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,208
Please.

265
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,756
I was pretty young.

266
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,551
I had just gotten out
of the foster system.

267
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:32,222
And the only job I could get was at
this 24-hour diner just off the interstate.

268
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,728
And your dad
was training to be a fireman.

269
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,104
He always got the worst shifts.

270
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,857
So he'd come in
and order coffee and pie,

271
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,233
and sit at the counter,

272
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,819
and always complain
that we didn't sell pumpkin pie.

273
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,907
But he always came back
the next night anyway.

274
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,618
Did you get married?

275
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,037
(CHUCKLES) Oh, no, nothing like that.

276
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,166
We just... We hung out a few times
outside of work.

277
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,377
And life happened.

278
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,921
His got better and mine got worse,

279
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,299
and I got in some trouble.

280
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,510
When you went to jail?

281
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,472
(INHALES) Yeah.

282
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:19,019
Before I went, I found out
I was pregnant with you.

283
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,690
And I tried to contact him.

284
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,862
And I found out

285
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,284
that he died saving a family
from a burning apartment building.

286
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,499
So, you think I'm a savior, Henry?

287
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,250
He was.

288
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,712
Your father was a real hero.

289
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:51,468
Do you have anything of his?
Something you can remember him by?

290
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,513
Something I could see?

291
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,972
I...

292
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,643
I don't.

293
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,981
Henry. I'm sorry. I gotta go.

294
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,402
I may know how to find this guy.

295
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,497
I want to show you guys something.

296
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,958
What's that?

297
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,668
It's my baby blanket.

298
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,337
It's something
I've held on to my whole life.

299
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,675
It's the only thing that I have
from my parents.

300
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,847
I spent a lot of time with
a lot of kids in your situation,

301
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,391
and all of them,

302
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,435
all of us,

303
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,687
we held on to stuff.

304
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:48,942
I want to find your father,
but I need your help.

305
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,196
Is there anything of his
you've held on to?

306
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,323
I might have something.

307
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,617
But if I give it to you,

308
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,620
you'll make sure
we stay together, right?

309
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,748
Right.

310
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,465
A compass?

311
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,633
Our mom kept it.

312
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,470
She said it was our dad's.

313
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,055
Thank you.

314
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,976
Did you find them?

315
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,060
Who?

316
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,771
Your parents.

317
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,775
Not yet. But I'm gonna find yours.

318
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,499
(MOUTHING) No.

319
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,356
Shh.

320
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,274
(WHISPERING) How can you
be sure she's sleeping?

321
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,442
I can't.

322
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,819
And remember what the Queen said.

323
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,947
Not even a lick.

324
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,035
(SNORING)

325
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,039
You were right. Look.

326
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,625
And there's the satchel.

327
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,503
What do you think is inside it?

328
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,004
Doesn't matter.

329
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,216
All that matters is getting it to

It's the mayor's son.

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,757
Yes, Your Majesty. Though we were
almost made into dinner.

Trust me, dear boy,
this is not just an apple.

504

It's a weapon.

we did what you asked.

What's that?

660
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,306
Just an old file. What's up?

661
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,352
Pumpkin pie.
I thought you'd like some.

662
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,729
It was pumpkin, right?

663
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,397
Right.

(SIGHS) Henry, about your father...

665
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,616
Yeah?

666
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,329
I'm glad I told you.

667
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,413
Me too.

What you did, with Ava and Nicholas.

Hey.

Is this Storybrooke?

00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,256
Yeah.

676
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,924
Any place to get a room around here?

00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,093
You're staying?

That's the plan.
Just looking for a bed.

679
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:02,644
Granny's Bed & Breakfast is just
up the road. Another two blocks.

680
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:03,854
Thank you.

681
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,901
Hey, I didn't catch your name.

682
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,611
That's cause I didn't give it.

I thought you said strangers
don't come to Storybrooke.

685
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,956
They don't.
