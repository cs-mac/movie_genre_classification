1
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,497
No.

2
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:41,779
No means no.

3
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,090
Bonjour.

4
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,693
<i>Carl, I know it's you.</i>

5
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,557
Hey, man.

6
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:59,232
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,698
Had your number dialled,
was about to press "send."

8
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,063
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:06,570
<i>Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don't.</i>

10
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:09,298
<i>So, what are you doing?</i>

11
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:11,741
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

12
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>- You did get my text, right?</i>
- What? Text? What?</i>

13
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:15,981
<i>We're all going out tonight.</i>

14
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,744
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:19,943
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,986
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,418
<i>No, I don't at all.</i>

18
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,754
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:29,657
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,058
<i>Thing? What thing?</i>

21
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:32,722
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,835
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:38,233
...but I know there's a thing.
<i>- A thing.</i>

24
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:41,499
<i>I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.</i>

25
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,267
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:46,538
<i>Specific things.
Like "get in line at the video store"?</i>

27
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:48,841
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:51,507
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:55,121
<i>I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.</i>

30
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,088
- That's not me.
<i>- It's not?</i>

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,957
Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,189
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:06,958
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:08,158
<i>That's amazing...</i>

35
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,270
<i>...because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.</i>

36
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,964
<i>Carl, I know you're not saying anything.</i>

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,408
<i>Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.</i>

38
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,241
- What? All right.
<i>- Carl!</i>

39
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:27,144
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,779
Hi.

41
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,152
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:35,762
Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,728
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,833
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

45
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:44,596
...some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:46,330
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:48,975
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:51,577
...because we have
an announcement to make.

49
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:53,645
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:56,377
There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,847
We're engaged.

52
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:00,418
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:04,149
- Big step?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,190
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,725
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,726
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:12,365
Oh, yeah.
That's about right, then.

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,136
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21st. Open bar.

59
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:19,363
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,565
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,978
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,739
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:29,508
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:32,743
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,980
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,085
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,061
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,929
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,197
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,671
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:57,037
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,839
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,039
Carl. Peter.

74
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:03,581
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:05,013
Hey.

76
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:07,278
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:10,446
- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.

78
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,221
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:15,919
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,688
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,426
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:24,628
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

83
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,706
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,538
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,481
That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well...

86
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:48,890
See you, guys.

87
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,612
- Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

88
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:14,117
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

89
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:16,415
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

90
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,491
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

91
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,252
How about some toast?

92
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:24,693
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

93
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:27,129
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

94
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,726
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

95
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,463
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

96
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,972
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

97
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,107
Yeah, bye.

98
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:43,242
Persianwifefinder.com.
No, thank you.

99
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:47,481
Costume party. Yeah, no.

100
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:50,447
Oh, boy.

101
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,521
Here we go.

102
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:58,631
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,900
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

104
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,794
Norman. Line one.

105
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:08,341
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

106
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,569
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

107
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:13,702
You're with Norman.

108
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:19,542
Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,051
Okay.

110
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,416
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

111
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:26,991
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

112
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,254
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

113
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,955
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

114
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:35,033
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

115
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:38,603
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

116
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:41,866
Look at it this way:
At least you didn't get shit-canned.

117
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,840
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

118
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:48,610
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

119
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:50,682
No, it's a pretty common expression.

120
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:55,584
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

121
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:58,816
This'll cheer you up.
I'm having a little get-together at my place.

122
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:02,928
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

123
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,521
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

124
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,090
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

125
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:09,428
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

126
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:11,971
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

127
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,767
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

128
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:15,860
...regardless of what I was gonna say.

129
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,213
I admit, business has been slow.

130
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,316
I mean, there's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

131
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,544
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

132
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:30,154
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

133
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:34,226
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

134
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,554
- None.
- And your credit...

135
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,254
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

136
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:41,458
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

137
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:55,142
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

138
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:58,148
Nick Lane? Hey.

139
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:01,287
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

140
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:05,585
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

141
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,784
You must be running this place by now.

142
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:11,453
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

143
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:13,031
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,861
God.

145
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,994
She's good.
What have you been doing?

146
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,334
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

147
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:25,035
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

148
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:26,770
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

149
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:29,939
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

150
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:33,348
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

151
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm a yes man.

152
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,622
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

153
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,521
No, thanks. I'm fine.

154
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,457
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine."

155
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,290
Okay.

156
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:48,958
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

157
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,964
No, you don't.

158
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:53,829
Why don't you take this rock...

159
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:57,135
...throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

160
00:08:57,311 --> 00:09:00,303
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,074
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

162
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,215
Oh, my God.

163
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,581
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

164
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:10,080
Stay right there.

165
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,088
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

166
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:20,593
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

167
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:23,046
Hey, stop. Stop!

168
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,945
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

169
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,574
Sorry.

170
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,248
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Stephanie?

171
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:43,753
- Carl.
<i>- Yeah, it's me.</i>

172
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:48,054
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird?

173
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:49,985
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

174
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:53,360
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

175
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,558
Good for you. Good for you.

176
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:10,472
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

177
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:20,586
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

178
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:32,271
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

179
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:36,808
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

180
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,342
You're so full of shit.

181
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:43,147
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

182
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:46,114
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

183
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:49,853
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

184
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:53,254
I'm so sorry, man.
I totally gapped it.

185
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,987
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

186
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:59,030
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

187
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,565
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

188
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:05,762
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

189
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,931
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

190
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:11,509
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

191
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:15,842
And I know that you have issues because
of it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

192
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:19,543
When's the last time you did anything fun?
You always make excuses.

193
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,154
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down."

194
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:24,517
I mean, do you even know
my fiancée’s last name?

195
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,660
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

196
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:32,060
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

197
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:35,463
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

198
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,125
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

199
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,666
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

200
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,536
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

201
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:46,204
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

202
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,244
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

203
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:51,509
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

204
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:55,018
I'm telling you, you don't change your life,
you're gonna end up lonely.

205
00:11:55,188 --> 00:12:00,558
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

206
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,093
Hey, Carl.

207
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,872
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

208
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:20,212
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

209
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,943
Nope. No more than usual.

210
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:27,917
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

211
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,626
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

212
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,556
Yeah, that's true.

213
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:37,890
He never did much.

214
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:39,395
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

215
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,033
Wasn't a good anything.

216
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:46,195
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

217
00:12:46,873 --> 00:12:48,204
Now, that's upsetting.

218
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,014
What was that?

219
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:42,993
<i>Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.</i>

220
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:45,857
<i>Please, find a seat.</i>

221
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,309
Carl? Hey, Carl!

222
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,060
Carl, man, hey.

223
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,331
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

224
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,705
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

225
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,037
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

226
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:02,045
I saw it in your eyes, man.
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.

227
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:06,242
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

228
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,887
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

229
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:10,249
That's why you're here.

230
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:14,291
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

231
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,289
It's starting.

232
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,821
<i>Life.</i>

233
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:22,726
<i>We are all living it. Or are we?</i>

234
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,268
Heavy...

235
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:30,842
<i>Change is generated from consciousness,
but where is consciousness generated from?</i>

236
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:33,138
<i>From the external.</i>

237
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:37,374
<i>And how do we control the external?
With one word.</i>

238
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,482
<i>And what is that word?</i>

239
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,046
- Yes!
- Jeez.

240
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,217
Yes.

241
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,884
Yes.

242
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:52,596
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

243
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:58,939
Yes!

244
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:02,705
The word is "yes."

245
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,743
Yes, yes, yes.

246
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,175
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

247
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,043
Say it a million more times.

248
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:14,516
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

249
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,815
Yes!

250
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,855
Yes.

251
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:30,034
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

252
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:35,038
...because it will RSVP "yes."

253
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:41,104
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

254
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:47,709
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

255
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:54,660
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

256
00:15:57,063 --> 00:16:02,000
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

257
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,295
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

258
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:10,740
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

259
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:18,309
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

260
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:24,117
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

261
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:29,958
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

262
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,525
Thank you.

263
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,759
Back up just a little bit more.

264
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:38,699
- No.
- No man. No man.

265
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,931
No man. No man. No man.

266
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,301
No man. No man.

267
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:43,874
Okay.

268
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:48,547
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

269
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:52,940
...Terrence will come to the molehill.

270
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:02,152
What's your name?

271
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:05,396
Carl.

272
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:07,197
Let me guess, Carl.

273
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:10,029
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

274
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,628
- Yes.
- Yes!

275
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:17,538
And you're not sure about this, are you?

276
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:19,168
No.

277
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:23,406
No man. No man.
No man. No man.

278
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,210
You're dead, Carl.

279
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:29,318
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

280
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:32,486
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

281
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,024
...and to yourself.

282
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:38,088
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

283
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:42,496
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

284
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,534
And you lost the love of your life...

285
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:47,696
...because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

286
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:55,510
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

287
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:59,846
...you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

288
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:02,980
Am I right, Carl?

289
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:10,854
I have had some trouble.

290
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:20,895
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

291
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,978
Do you want to make a covenant?

292
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,503
The word is "yes," Carl.

293
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,908
- Yes!
- Yes.

294
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,106
- Yes!
- Yes.

295
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,773
Yes!

296
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:34,812
Once you leave this building...

297
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:38,980
...every time an opportunity
presents itself...

298
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:41,956
...no matter what it is...

299
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,187
...you will say yes.

300
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:45,456
- Yes.
- Yes!

301
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:46,929
- Yes.
- Yes!

302
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,193
- Yes.
- Yes.

303
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:52,400
What if I...

304
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,301
...say...

305
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,266
...the other word?

306
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:01,012
You'll be making a promise to yourself.

307
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,208
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

308
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:08,684
...things can get a little dicey.

309
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,415
What do you say, Carl?

310
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:15,055
Are you ready to make a covenant?

311
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:16,989
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

312
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:18,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

313
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,758
- Yes.
- Again.

314
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,367
- Yes.
- Yes.

315
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,366
- Say it again.
- Yes!

316
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:30,140
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

317
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:35,005
Yes!

318
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,734
Hey, there he is.

319
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,674
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

320
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:08,211
Pretty powerful stuff?

321
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,679
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

322
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,308
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

323
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:18,685
That's weird. I didn't realize we just
stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

324
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,057
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

325
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:27,594
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

326
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:31,868
Yes!

327
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:36,300
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

328
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:40,878
Yeah, why not?

329
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:45,410
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

330
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:55,453
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

331
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,953
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

332
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:30,322
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

333
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,091
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

334
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,996
Go ahead.

335
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,827
And what did you say?

336
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:45,404
Oh, I'm just right over here.
Okay. Yeah.

337
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,240
What? Hello? Hello?

338
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:51,116
Oh, shit, man.
Your battery's dead.

339
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:52,945
Oh, great.

340
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:58,146
- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.

341
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:01,782
I mean, it's real nice of you to give me a ride.
Most people just say no.

342
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:05,627
Course, I have been having a lot of luck
lately outside of that hotel.

343
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:08,465
No problem. Have a good night.

344
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:11,269
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

345
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:14,663
Okay.

346
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:17,867
I've come this far.

347
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:21,473
Yes, you can.

348
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:24,377
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

349
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:33,524
Sure. It's all yours.

350
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:38,896
God bless you, man.

351
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,753
Oh, come on.

352
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:04,720
Come on, come on.

353
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:10,390
Perfect.

354
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:14,931
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give all your
money away to a homeless guy?

355
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,591
Yes, yes, I do.

356
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,293
Letting him burn out
your phone...

357
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:20,735
...so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

358
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:23,398
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

359
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:26,407
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

360
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,946
...and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

361
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,097
Come on, man.

362
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:55,062
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

363
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:15,050
Would you like to carry a 20-pound
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

364
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:18,322
Oh, could I?
Could I really?

365
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:21,222
That's a good look.

366
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:26,662
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

367
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:29,968
Did you just run out of gas?

368
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:31,740
Maybe.

369
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:37,405
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

370
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,414
When you were driving
out of your way...

371
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:43,351
...to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

372
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,321
No. I take it that's what
happened to you.

373
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,892
No. Why would you assume that?

374
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:52,093
He used up your phone?

375
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:56,201
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

376
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,963
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

377
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:02,130
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

378
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:04,936
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

379
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:07,602
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

380
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:09,976
Well, do you need a ride?

381
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,608
On that thing?

382
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:25,490
Am I going too fast for you?

383
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:28,532
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

384
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,465
That way if we crash, at least I'll die.

385
00:25:31,637 --> 00:25:34,367
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

386
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:48,550
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

387
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:53,645
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great?

388
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:10,967
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

389
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:15,444
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

390
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,846
Hopefully the colour will return
to your face sometime soon.

391
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:22,010
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

392
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:25,680
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

393
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,427
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

394
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:32,757
Yeah.

395
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:36,097
Thanks.

396
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:38,396
So you okay?

397
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:41,768
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

398
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:44,466
- What?
- What did you say?

399
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:49,705
Hey, I...

400
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:57,046
Have a good night.

401
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,248
Yes.

402
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:35,126
"Yes always leads
to something good."

403
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:41,360
"Never avoid opportunities."

404
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,627
"They may come in any form."

405
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,371
- Hello?
<i>- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.</i>

406
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,479
Well, and your boss, but more your buddy
than your boss, right?

407
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:56,376
I guess.

408
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,517
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

409
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:02,347
Is there any way you could come in?

410
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:04,583
Sure.

411
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:08,215
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

412
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:12,626
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

413
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:20,728
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

414
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:22,966
Right.

415
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,203
Like I need that.

416
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:34,451
- Persian wifefinder.
<i>- Hi there. I am Faranoush.</i>

417
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,111
<i>Would you be the man for me?</i>

418
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:39,319
I guess so.

419
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:43,691
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

420
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:45,160
And what's your business?

421
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:48,562
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

422
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:52,927
- Oh, Mickey Rourke.
- No!? It's Bono.

423
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,997
Yeah, right.

424
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:58,541
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

425
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:01,243
So, what do you think?

426
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,141
I think yes.

427
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,948
Inta-maresting.

428
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:14,766
Cakes?

429
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,156
Yeah, I just kind of went with
my gut on it, Norm.

430
00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:21,996
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

431
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:25,695
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

432
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:30,706
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

433
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,775
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

434
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:35,140
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

435
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:37,179
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

436
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,373
What?

437
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:43,113
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

438
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,884
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko..."

439
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,493
"...whichever, or I walk."

440
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,926
Really? What did they say?

441
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:55,828
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

442
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:58,333
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

443
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:01,962
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

444
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,765
And?

445
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,307
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

446
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,240
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

447
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:09,142
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

448
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:11,180
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

449
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,648
...to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

450
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,014
- No.
- How did you know that?

451
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:17,212
He's not here.

452
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:19,755
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

453
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:22,917
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

454
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:26,594
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

455
00:30:26,765 --> 00:30:30,792
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

456
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,803
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

457
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:36,840
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

458
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:39,768
See what I did there?

459
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:43,945
I joined "bro" with "Joseph." Broseph.
Pretty cool?

460
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:47,241
Very cool, Norm.

461
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:54,315
I have been such a dick and a douche.

462
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,126
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

463
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,094
...but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

464
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:04,928
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

465
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:07,629
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

466
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:11,572
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

467
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,771
...and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

468
00:31:15,948 --> 00:31:18,917
All right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

469
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:21,348
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

470
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,385
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

471
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:26,524
...and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

472
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:32,823
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

473
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:34,363
Okay.

474
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:42,704
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

475
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:46,072
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

476
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:51,573
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

477
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,692
Okay, okay.

478
00:32:21,947 --> 00:32:23,107
He did it.

479
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,423
Drinks on me.

480
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:36,488
Crazy, man.

481
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:39,261
Carl, that was so awesome.

482
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:41,899
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...

483
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,898
Absolutely.

484
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:48,267
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

485
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,211
Was I chewing gum before?

486
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,904
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

487
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:58,743
Easy, easy.
It was a little misunderstanding, okay?

488
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:04,116
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

489
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:07,452
I made a sacred "conevant."

490
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,587
That sounded naughty.

491
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:13,027
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

492
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:16,531
Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.

493
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:19,529
Okay. But if I win...

494
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:23,573
...I get to take that pretty girl
of yours to a ball...

495
00:33:23,742 --> 00:33:26,074
...because she deserves that.

496
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:29,703
Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.

497
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:32,440
That is so nice.

498
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:37,346
Oh, shit.

499
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:44,089
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

500
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,891
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

501
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,761
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

502
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:51,664
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

503
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:53,771
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

504
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:57,500
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

505
00:33:57,676 --> 00:33:59,940
You want some, more?

506
00:34:00,112 --> 00:34:03,479
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

507
00:34:04,116 --> 00:34:05,708
Oh, where'd I go?

508
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:07,977
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

509
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:12,587
Did you see The Legend of Billy Jack?

510
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:15,391
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

511
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:19,327
...and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

512
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:22,092
...and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

513
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,402
Just don't break my teeth
off on the curb, okay?

514
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:30,440
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

515
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:31,633
What?

516
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:36,611
First, we have to establish
the ground rules.

517
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:40,149
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

518
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:47,423
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

519
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:50,354
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

520
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:52,053
That's why you got punched out...

521
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:55,792
...because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

522
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,367
I'm over here, dickhole.

523
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:01,498
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

524
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:03,798
You're a complete...

525
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:06,101
You all right?

526
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,371
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

527
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:10,276
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

528
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:12,440
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

529
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:14,483
I'm glad we had this experience.

530
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,053
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

531
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:26,895
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

532
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:32,536
She's never gonna go to a ball.

533
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:35,502
No. No, she's not.

534
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:11,233
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

535
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,809
What can I do for you?

536
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:16,311
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

537
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:18,908
Oh, really?

538
00:36:25,157 --> 00:36:31,255
Okay. That should just about do it.

539
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,831
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

540
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:38,565
Oh, not so fast.

541
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:40,570
What are you doing?

542
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,376
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

543
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:48,104
I'm getting so forgetful.

544
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,340
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

545
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:54,314
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

546
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:58,582
Oh, just doing a favour for a neighbour
is good enough for me.

547
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:02,316
You are so handsome.

548
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:07,025
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

549
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,865
Well, I'm just... I'm not in a serious thing,
but I am dating.

550
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:15,700
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

551
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:18,707
You know, a sexual release?

552
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,479
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

553
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:29,314
You just lay back and I will
take care of everything.

554
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:32,855
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

555
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:36,085
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

556
00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:39,526
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

557
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:44,658
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'll be seeing you.

558
00:37:45,904 --> 00:37:48,964
In my nightmares.

559
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,606
Oh, come on, give me a break.

560
00:37:53,612 --> 00:37:56,809
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

561
00:37:56,982 --> 00:38:01,715
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

562
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:16,825
Nice dog.

563
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:32,882
Just relax. I'll handle this.

564
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,148
Oh, God!

565
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:44,922
Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...

566
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:48,900
That...

567
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:52,369
That is a...

568
00:38:52,537 --> 00:38:54,200
How are you doing that?

569
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:04,573
"Costume party. Come as your favourite
Harry Potter character."

570
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,774
You got it, Norm.

571
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:54,823
Hi.

572
00:39:57,002 --> 00:40:00,494
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

573
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:03,539
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a.m. and 5:30?

574
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,844
Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

575
00:40:07,012 --> 00:40:09,879
...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

576
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:14,246
- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

577
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,752
Yeah. All right.

578
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:23,045
Hey. It's really working.

579
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:32,370
It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

580
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:36,098
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

581
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:37,935
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

582
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:45,106
<i>I would understand</i>

583
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:48,775
All right, now I got it.

584
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:09,767
What did he call me?

585
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,404
Homeless.

586
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:19,413
Come and get it.

587
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:21,586
There you are. You want some?

588
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,117
He never listens.

589
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:25,480
Yeah.

590
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:29,591
I wanna start an organic-fertilizer
distribution business.

591
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:34,790
Next.

592
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:39,435
- Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

593
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:41,299
Way to stick in there.

594
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:01,956
There you go.

595
00:42:02,193 --> 00:42:04,559
Hey. I came.

596
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,825
Great.

597
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,461
Yeah.

598
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:12,964
Rolling Rock, please.

599
00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:18,707
<i>- From the dawn of time...
- In the netherworld.</i>

600
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:22,173
<i>There was a band.</i>

601
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:24,372
<i>Oh, yes, there was.</i>

602
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:26,415
<i>And we were that band.</i>

603
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,382
<i>Yes, we were.</i>

604
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,316
<i>And that band made rock 'n' roll.</i>

605
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,046
<i>Oh, yes, they did.</i>

606
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:37,317
<i>And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.</i>

607
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:38,928
<i>Yeah.</i>

608
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:42,157
<i>And that band was rad.</i>

609

Hello, Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

610
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:53,275
- We are Munchausen by Proxy.

You said, "Who are you?"</i>

617
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:14,922
<i>~ Who are you?</i>

618
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,867
<i>~ I'd shrug my shoulders, and I'd say whatevs
You said, "Who are you?"</i>

619
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:22,529
<i>~ Who are you?</i>

620
00:43:22,707 --> 00:43:27,144
Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?
He's a computer hacker.

621
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:30,770
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

622
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:35,318
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

623
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,387
Happy networking, asshole.

624
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:58,234
<i>~ Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again</i>

625
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,275
<i>~ Happened once, it happened twice</i>

626
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:04,108
<i>~ It happened three times,
Maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe</i>

627
00:44:04,282 --> 00:44:06,755
<i>~ Maybe it happened six times
But it won't happen a seventh time</i>

628
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:08,907
<i>~ No, no, no, no</i>

629
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:12,890
<i>~ Whore, whore, whore</i>

630
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:16,918
<i>~ I'm not your late night booty call</i>

631
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:21,288
<i>~ Whore no more</i>

632
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:26,369
<i>~ Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again</i>

633
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:28,700
<i>~ You can call me at 10:59</i>

634
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:33,401
<i>~ But don't call me at 11
'Cause that's my rule now</i>

635
00:44:43,788 --> 00:44:46,279
Can I get a water?

636
00:44:50,962 --> 00:44:54,125
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

637
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:57,700
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

638
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,633
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

639
00:45:00,805 --> 00:45:02,773
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

640
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:05,501
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

641
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:08,646
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

642
00:45:10,014 --> 00:45:14,678
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

643
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:18,220
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

644
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:21,222
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

645
00:45:21,392 --> 00:45:22,689
You want a drink?

646
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:26,057
Oh, I can't.
I have to wake up early.

647
00:45:26,231 --> 00:45:29,394
- So I have to go, but...
- Oh, really?

648
00:45:31,669 --> 00:45:34,229
But you can walk me to my scooter.

649
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,040
I teach a jogging photo group...

650
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:42,612
...for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

651
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,181
Oh, yeah, that's getting
very popular now.

652
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,343
It's in Griffith Park and we do a loop.
It's about five miles.

653
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:51,819
It's at 6 a.m.

654
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,256
I haven't been up at 6 a.m. in, like...
Never!

655
00:45:56,427 --> 00:46:00,557
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

656
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,366
Okay, so you're in a band...

657
00:46:03,535 --> 00:46:06,629
...you do the jogging photography,
what else?

658
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:08,931
Whatever I want.

659
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:12,474
I volunteer at a shelter.
I paint a little bit.

660
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,078
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

661
00:46:15,246 --> 00:46:17,510
And some nude modelling, FYI.

662
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,877
Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...

663
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:27,656
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

664
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,919
I didn't ask you out.

665
00:46:30,094 --> 00:46:32,289
Could have fooled me
with that modelling comment.

666
00:46:32,463 --> 00:46:33,862
You said that.

667
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:36,660
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

668
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:41,562
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

669
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:45,800
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

670
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:47,171
Yeah, I'd love to.

671
00:46:48,746 --> 00:46:52,648
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...

672
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:56,082
- Carl.
- Allison.

673
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:13,928
Yeah, Rooney?

674
00:47:14,105 --> 00:47:15,834
<i>Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.</i>

675
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:19,568
<i>Got a case of Red Bull.
Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?</i>

676
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:21,302
Yeah.

677
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,321
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

678
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:32,751
- Allison?
- Yeah?

679
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:34,789
Do we need to use a flash?

680
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:36,790
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

681
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:48,467
Beautiful night, guys.
You take it to the limit, and I respect that.

682
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,438
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

683
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:55,670
Carl, if somebody asked me to describe tonight,
I would just go, "Shlaaoow!"

684
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:58,907
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

685
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:03,019
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

686
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:05,813
Allison, I'm here.

687
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:08,652
Allison.

688
00:48:10,028 --> 00:48:13,020
Hey. Who were those guys?

689
00:48:13,197 --> 00:48:16,496
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a male nurse. I was making fun of him.

690
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:19,569
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

691
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:22,035
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

692
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:25,937
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

693
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,975
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

694
00:48:28,146 --> 00:48:30,512
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

695
00:48:30,682 --> 00:48:34,118
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

696
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:37,015
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

697
00:48:37,188 --> 00:48:40,180
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

698
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:42,758
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

699
00:48:42,927 --> 00:48:44,519
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

700
00:48:44,696 --> 00:48:45,822
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

701
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,224
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

702
00:48:47,398 --> 00:48:49,696
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

703
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,960
Red Bull.

704
00:48:52,537 --> 00:48:57,201
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

705
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,775
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

706
00:49:00,578 --> 00:49:04,139
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

707
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:12,714
Oh, it's a good one.

708
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,815
Hold that.

709
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:18,287
Got it.

710
00:49:28,406 --> 00:49:30,465
Hey, Carl, you okay?

711
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:35,202
Hold it right there.

712
00:49:50,528 --> 00:49:52,018
That's good.

713
00:49:53,264 --> 00:49:58,258
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

714
00:49:58,636 --> 00:50:00,570
Kind of mysterious.

715
00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:01,864
You know, listen.

716
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,476
I like to keep it fresh. I like to live it up.
I like to mix it up.

717
00:50:05,643 --> 00:50:07,975
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this, right now.

718
00:50:08,146 --> 00:50:10,011
I love that.

719
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:13,378
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine every day.

720
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:15,610
- I mean... Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

721
00:50:15,787 --> 00:50:19,223
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

722
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,052
...just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

723
00:50:22,226 --> 00:50:25,889
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

724
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,795
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life."

725
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:31,696
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

726
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,630
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

727
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:39,072
It just didn't work out. It's a long story.

728
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:42,644
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

729
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:45,073
Might be.

730
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:48,952
Closed-off-little-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

731
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,385
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

732
00:50:52,557 --> 00:50:55,549
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

733
00:50:55,726 --> 00:50:59,355
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

734
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,895
Gone, never saw him again.

735
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,463
That's rough. I'm sorry.

736
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,997
Next time you should warn me about
the length of the story, though.

737
00:51:09,173 --> 00:51:10,265
Kind of dragged on.

738
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:12,773
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

739
00:51:13,555 --> 00:51:17,477
Jeez! That was very healthy.

740
00:51:28,726 --> 00:51:31,194
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

741
00:51:31,362 --> 00:51:33,830
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

742
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:35,488
She's the complete opposite of me.

743
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,964
Carl, could you
please pass the Cholula?

744
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,104
Sure, Faranoush.

745
00:51:41,038 --> 00:51:42,471
How did you two meet again?

746
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,303
Persianwifefinder.com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

747
00:51:46,477 --> 00:51:48,877
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

748
00:51:49,046 --> 00:51:51,446
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

749
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:54,483
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

750
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:58,486
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

751
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:00,055
Sorry, Faranoush.

752
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:04,458
Anyway, I never would've met Allison if
I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

753
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:06,790
You wouldn't be on a blind date
with a strange Iranian woman.

754
00:52:06,964 --> 00:52:09,364
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

755
00:52:09,534 --> 00:52:12,628
I didn't realize I was dealing
with a no man.

756
00:52:12,803 --> 00:52:16,330
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

757
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,708
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

758
00:52:23,581 --> 00:52:27,813
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

759
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:31,718
So my friends are being really lame...

760
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:35,052
...and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

761
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:37,592
Hey, I have an idea.

762
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:40,830
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

763
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,100
Yeah. Sure.

764
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:46,498
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

765
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:48,229
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

766
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

767
00:52:56,314 --> 00:52:59,340
Well, thanks, Carl.

768
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:03,778
Thanks, that's really sweet.

769
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,087
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

770
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:08,248
Thanks, Faranoush.

771
00:53:08,526 --> 00:53:11,290
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up costumes
for me and Allison.

772
00:53:11,462 --> 00:53:12,724
Costumes for what?

773
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,826
Expelliarmus! Just kidding.

774
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:19,094
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

775
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:23,070
Cool costume, my man.

776
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,801
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

777
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:29,242
This is Allison and her wand
made from a sequoia.

778
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:31,509
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

779
00:53:31,682 --> 00:53:35,846
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

780
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,849
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

781
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,651
...chips, dips...

782
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:45,159
...and good people, just like you two.

783
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:47,294
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

784
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:49,194
It's gonna be a crazy night.

785
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:57,601
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

786
00:53:57,775 --> 00:53:58,830
Good dip, H.P.?

787
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:04,642
Got tons of it at Costco. You see,
I've got an exclusive membership card.

788
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:07,784
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

789
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:11,547
I can buy large quantities of anything
at discount prices.

790
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:14,083
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

791
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:18,221
No, don't think so.
But I can talk to someone, if you'd like.

792
00:54:18,996 --> 00:54:21,590
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

793
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:26,236
<i>Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?</i>

794
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:30,097
"I'm not going home, not really."

795
00:54:32,943 --> 00:54:34,740
Oh, bye.

796
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,708
Alrighty, gang.
Who wants to watch Chamber of Secrets?

797
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,389
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

798
00:54:54,565 --> 00:54:57,090
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

799
00:54:57,268 --> 00:55:00,499
That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

800
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:04,471
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

801
00:55:04,642 --> 00:55:07,975
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

802
00:55:08,145 --> 00:55:09,942
- That's all right.
- Bye.

803
00:55:10,114 --> 00:55:13,208
Okay, guys, all aboard
the Hogwarts Express.

804
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:15,443
Next stop, Azkaban.

805
00:55:23,894 --> 00:55:25,156
Hey.

806
00:55:25,563 --> 00:55:27,724
Do you wanna drive?

807
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:37,111
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad?

808
00:55:38,743 --> 00:55:40,663
Yep, I got it.

809
00:55:46,817 --> 00:55:49,115
I got an idea.

810
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:59,092
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

811
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:06,535
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

812
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,343
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

813
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:42,897
This is unreal.

814
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,267
I couldn't agree more.

815
00:56:52,259 --> 00:56:55,485
<i>~ Say you don't need those diamond rings...</i>

816
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:56,817
<i>~ Ooh</i>

817
00:56:57,238 --> 00:56:59,078
<i>~ And I'll be satisfied</i>

818
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:00,067
<i>~ Ooh</i>

819
00:57:00,908 --> 00:57:06,276
<i>~ Tell me that you want those kind of thing,
That money just can't buy</i>

820
00:57:06,363 --> 00:57:07,408
<i>~ Ooh</i>

821
00:57:07,577 --> 00:57:14,457
<i>~ I don't care too much for money,
'Cause money can't buy me love</i>

822
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:26,947
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

823
00:57:27,585 --> 00:57:31,282
I've never let anyone kiss me on the stage
of the Hollywood Bowl before.

824
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:57,772
Good evening, Los Angeles.

825
00:57:57,948 --> 00:58:01,145
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

826
00:58:02,786 --> 00:58:04,447
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

827
00:58:04,622 --> 00:58:05,816
I killed her.

828
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:08,586
I'm a somebody.

829
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:11,988
I don't know about that.

830
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:14,756
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

831
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:18,129
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

832
00:58:18,302 --> 00:58:21,032
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

833
00:58:21,205 --> 00:58:26,199
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

834
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:30,541
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 17,000.

835
00:58:30,714 --> 00:58:35,583
So each one of us invites 1800
of our closest friends.

836
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:38,688
No need.
I know our music isn't that mainstream.

837
00:58:38,856 --> 00:58:40,687
- What?
- I love doing it.

838
00:58:41,191 --> 00:58:42,658
It's like my photography.

839
00:58:42,826 --> 00:58:45,294
I know there isn't that much demand
for blurry photographs...

840
00:58:45,462 --> 00:58:47,054
...taken while running, but...

841
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:49,358
I wasn't gonna say anything.

842
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:53,060
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

843
00:58:53,237 --> 00:58:54,829
You know that when you're a kid...

844
00:58:55,005 --> 00:58:57,633
...but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

845
00:58:58,442 --> 00:59:00,376
I love your music.

846
00:59:00,644 --> 00:59:03,477
Anybody can take a photo standing still.

847
00:59:04,448 --> 00:59:08,043
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

848
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:09,879
- Stop.
- Stopping.

849
00:59:10,054 --> 00:59:12,352
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

850
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:13,922
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

851
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:15,854
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

852
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:20,463
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

853
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:24,862
Run!

854
00:59:25,135 --> 00:59:26,830
Hello, everybody.

855
00:59:27,004 --> 00:59:32,442
A little vitamin C. Keep your strength up.
I will be right with you.

856
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,771
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

857
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:41,879
- Lee?
- Hey.

858
00:59:42,052 --> 00:59:44,520
What up, my brizzo?

859
00:59:45,856 --> 00:59:48,950
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

860
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,426
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

861
00:59:53,864 --> 00:59:55,923
What's going on, Norm?

862
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,931
Something's going down on a big scale.

863
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:02,061
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

864
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:05,402
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

865
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:08,807
Well, we had a nice run.

866
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:11,243
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

867
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:14,574
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

868
01:00:14,752 --> 01:00:16,879
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

869
01:00:17,054 --> 01:00:19,488
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

870
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,285
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

871
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:23,721
- I was.
- I was watching you.

872
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:25,122
Yeah, you were.

873
01:00:25,295 --> 01:00:28,822
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

874
01:00:28,999 --> 01:00:32,162
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

875
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:35,305
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

876
01:00:35,472 --> 01:00:37,303
You may be my last loan.

877
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:41,038
It's a Ducati.

878
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:44,703
I'm thinking it'll get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

879
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:49,542
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

880
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:54,184
See you on the other side, Lee.

881
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,655
Carl.

882
01:01:01,031 --> 01:01:04,228
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

883
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:06,301
Pleasure to meet you.

884
01:01:13,477 --> 01:01:18,141
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 loans.

885
01:01:18,315 --> 01:01:20,340
You have given out...

886
01:01:21,118 --> 01:01:23,086
...561.

887
01:01:23,787 --> 01:01:25,311
A little more than average, then.

888
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,855
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

889
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:35,264
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

890
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:37,366
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

891
01:01:37,534 --> 01:01:40,526
Carl, this bank traditionally has never
given out small loans.

892
01:01:40,704 --> 01:01:42,831
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down, Norman.

893
01:01:43,006 --> 01:01:45,474
At first I thought you might
be raiding our coffers.

894
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:48,668
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

895
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:56,476
But...

896
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:00,053
But then I looked closer.

897
01:02:00,824 --> 01:02:03,520
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

898
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:06,822
...more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

899
01:02:06,997 --> 01:02:09,090
And because you've given out
so many of them...

900
01:02:09,266 --> 01:02:13,532
...we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-loans, not bad.

901
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:15,963
See, Car, you worrywart.

902
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,701
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

903
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,922
Corporate?

904
01:02:22,379 --> 01:02:24,472
That's great. I would have to say...

905
01:02:24,648 --> 01:02:27,481
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

906
01:02:27,651 --> 01:02:29,812
...let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

907
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:33,889
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

908
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:35,756
Got it. Yep.

909
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:38,895
We'll have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

910
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:41,587
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

911
01:02:41,765 --> 01:02:46,259
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

912
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,841
This one is nice.

913
01:02:55,012 --> 01:02:57,412
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

914
01:02:57,581 --> 01:02:58,605
- I love it.
- Yeah?

915
01:02:58,782 --> 01:03:00,147
Yeah.

916
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:03,878
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

917
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:05,783
It's the same as regular bingo...

918
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:09,585
...but you just yell embarrassing facts
about the bride, okay?

919
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:11,685
Yeah.

920
01:03:11,862 --> 01:03:13,762
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

921
01:03:13,931 --> 01:03:15,523
I don't want anything complicated.

922
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:18,497
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

923
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,103
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

924
01:03:21,271 --> 01:03:24,866
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

925
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:32,238
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

926
01:04:21,131 --> 01:04:22,155
Okay.

927
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,371
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

928
01:04:28,538 --> 01:04:31,974
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

929
01:04:38,582 --> 01:04:39,844
What's going on?

930
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:43,644
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

931
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,514
Jump.

932
01:04:47,124 --> 01:04:49,615
What the hell are you looking at?

933
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:54,188
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

934
01:04:54,364 --> 01:04:56,264
Hey, lady, move that dog.

935
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:59,427
Buddy, can you move over a little bit,
like two feet?

936
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:01,070
Has somebody called the police?

937
01:05:01,238 --> 01:05:04,696
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

938
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:08,208
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

939
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:28,454
Don't do it.

940
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:32,467
It can't be that bad.

941
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:36,270
Hey, buddy.

942
01:05:36,907 --> 01:05:38,397
Who are you, man?

943
01:05:38,575 --> 01:05:42,272
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

944
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:45,381
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

945
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:49,076
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

946
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:51,780
I should say something to you here.

947
01:05:53,457 --> 01:05:55,015
I don't really know what it is.

948
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:57,285
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

949
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:59,429
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

950
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:05,267
Wait. I've got it.

951
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:09,832
Where you going, man?

952
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,771
- I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

953
01:06:12,943 --> 01:06:14,501
Oh, man.

954
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,750
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

955
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,480
Patience is a virtue.

956
01:06:29,426 --> 01:06:32,361
What the hell you doing in there?

957
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:39,195
<i>~ I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend</i>

958
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:45,873
<i>~ You could cut ties with all the lies

962
01:07:04,761 --> 01:07:05,887
What is it?

963
01:07:06,763 --> 01:07:09,391
<i>~ The angry boy a bit too insane</i>

964

977
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:11,952
I got blisters on my fingers.

978
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,862
Carl.

979
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:24,865
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

980
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:27,134
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

981
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:31,076
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

982
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:35,548
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

983
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:40,545
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

984
01:08:40,724 --> 01:08:43,818
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

985
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,462
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

986
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:48,564
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

987
01:08:48,732 --> 01:08:52,293
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

988
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:55,768
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

989
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,034
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

990
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:01,905
No.

991
01:09:13,523 --> 01:09:15,252
So I have some carry-on here.

992
01:09:15,425 --> 01:09:19,828
I'd like two tickets on the first plane
out of here, please.

993
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:21,588
We've never done this before.

994
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:28,794
The next flight available for boarding...

995
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:30,805
...is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

996
01:09:32,776 --> 01:09:33,800
Okay.

997
01:09:33,977 --> 01:09:35,001
- Okay.
- Okay.

998
01:09:35,178 --> 01:09:36,338
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

999
01:09:36,513 --> 01:09:37,673
Here we come.

1000
01:09:41,618 --> 01:09:43,813
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1001
01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:47,013
Well, clearly we should go there.

1002
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:55,024
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets..."

1003
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:57,462
"...weighed over 10 and a half pounds."

1004
01:09:57,634 --> 01:10:00,432
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

1005
01:10:01,938 --> 01:10:04,406
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1006
01:10:04,574 --> 01:10:06,269
Check out the phone.

1007
01:10:06,443 --> 01:10:09,970
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1008
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:12,046
Hello?

1009
01:10:16,386 --> 01:10:17,853
Nice shot.

1010
01:10:19,956 --> 01:10:23,551
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1011
01:10:24,461 --> 01:10:26,361
So, what do I do? I just...

1012
01:10:28,064 --> 01:10:30,464
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1013
01:10:32,302 --> 01:10:34,327
- Okay.
- You got it.

1014
01:10:34,504 --> 01:10:35,528
Pull?

1015
01:10:37,407 --> 01:10:39,466
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1016
01:10:39,643 --> 01:10:42,544
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1017
01:10:48,551 --> 01:10:50,485
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it...</i>

1018
01:10:50,654 --> 01:10:54,920
<i>...for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.</i>

1019
01:11:02,966 --> 01:11:04,934
Twenty bucks says
Oklahoma kills them.

1020
01:11:05,101 --> 01:11:07,661
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1021
01:11:07,837 --> 01:11:09,429
What, do you live here now?

1022
01:11:09,606 --> 01:11:13,235
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

1023
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:16,072
Hey. Is that Carl?

1024
01:11:16,246 --> 01:11:18,373
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1025
01:11:19,749 --> 01:11:24,554
<i>The energy is palpable here, Chris.
I can't even hear myself think.</i>

1026
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:27,467
I guess they're in Nebraska.

1027
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:33,888
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

1028
01:11:34,064 --> 01:11:36,555
...then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1029
01:11:36,733 --> 01:11:39,725
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1030
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:42,667
...and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

1031
01:11:43,973 --> 01:11:46,168
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

1032
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,843
I can't believe
I tripped like that.

1033
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:58,746
- It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

1034
01:11:58,922 --> 01:12:02,517
- Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1035
01:12:02,692 --> 01:12:04,557
Don't, please.

1036
01:12:06,329 --> 01:12:08,661
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1037
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:12,365
Here. I have to protect you.

1038
01:12:12,635 --> 01:12:14,125
Come on.

1039
01:12:14,304 --> 01:12:18,172
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1040
01:12:18,341 --> 01:12:20,036
Come on.

1041
01:12:21,478 --> 01:12:25,073
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

1042
01:12:25,248 --> 01:12:27,978
Allison, are you okay?

1043
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:31,950
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?
You're okay?

1044
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:39,792
What?

1045
01:12:40,897 --> 01:12:43,422
I don't know. I think I love you.

1046
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:46,301
Really?

1047
01:12:46,469 --> 01:12:51,065
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1048
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:54,540
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1049
01:12:54,711 --> 01:12:56,440
I love you like...

1050
01:12:56,946 --> 01:13:00,245
...I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1051
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,517
I've been thinking...

1052
01:13:02,685 --> 01:13:05,176
...and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1053
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:10,224
...but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1054
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:14,894
Really? You've been thinking that?

1055
01:13:15,398 --> 01:13:17,025
What do you think?

1056
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,637
- What do I think? Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1057
01:13:21,805 --> 01:13:23,272
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1058
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,408
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1059
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:28,203
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1060
01:13:28,378 --> 01:13:32,280
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

1061
01:13:33,149 --> 01:13:34,480
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

1062
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:39,145
Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...

1063
01:13:53,937 --> 01:13:57,566
- Where are you travelling today?
- Los Angeles.

1064
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:03,208
I'll just be one minute.

1065
01:14:03,379 --> 01:14:06,871
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1066
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,881
I'm in.

1067
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:11,882
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1068
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:16,223
Sir?

1069
01:14:17,594 --> 01:14:20,563
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1070
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:23,563
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

1071
01:14:26,202 --> 01:14:28,932
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

1072
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:31,903
Oh, beautiful.
Are you in on this too?

1073
01:14:32,075 --> 01:14:34,236
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1074
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:37,243
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

1075
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:41,013
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1076
01:14:41,184 --> 01:14:42,776
Come on, lady.

1077
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:47,786
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1078
01:14:47,957 --> 01:14:52,121
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1079
01:14:52,295 --> 01:14:54,263
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

1080
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,421
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1081
01:14:56,599 --> 01:14:58,430
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1082
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,762
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1083
01:15:00,937 --> 01:15:04,498
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1084
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:07,507
Why did you purchase these plane tickets
at the last minute?

1085
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:09,770
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1086
01:15:09,946 --> 01:15:11,880
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1087
01:15:12,048 --> 01:15:15,313
...how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1088
01:15:15,485 --> 01:15:19,615
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder.com?

1089
01:15:19,822 --> 01:15:22,848
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1090
01:15:23,026 --> 01:15:26,154
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

1091
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:30,095
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan Officer
at Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

1092
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:32,791
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1093
01:15:32,969 --> 01:15:34,459
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1094
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:36,832
Have you recently started
taking flying lessons?

1095
01:15:37,006 --> 01:15:39,531
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1096
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:42,109
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1097
01:15:42,278 --> 01:15:44,838
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1098
01:15:45,014 --> 01:15:47,141
- You were married?
- Yes.

1099
01:15:48,151 --> 01:15:50,312
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1100
01:15:50,486 --> 01:15:53,114
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

1101
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:56,224
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1102
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,387
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1103
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:04,564
His name was Marx.

1104
01:16:08,271 --> 01:16:10,501
I need to speak to my attorney.

1105
01:16:15,211 --> 01:16:18,339
Several months ago, my client attended
a self-empowerment seminar...

1106
01:16:18,514 --> 01:16:23,349
...that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1107
01:16:23,519 --> 01:16:25,612
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1108
01:16:25,788 --> 01:16:28,882
...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1109
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:31,788
...it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

1110
01:16:33,029 --> 01:16:35,293
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1111
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,365
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1112
01:16:37,533 --> 01:16:39,125
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1113
01:16:39,302 --> 01:16:42,362
I'm wondering if there's a better setting
for this back and forth.

1114
01:16:42,538 --> 01:16:45,507
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1115
01:16:49,277 --> 01:16:51,474
- That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1116
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,616
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1117
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:56,650
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1118
01:16:57,186 --> 01:16:59,211
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1119
01:16:59,389 --> 01:17:03,120
I thought you lied all the time, but it's
just sometimes. That's really excellent.

1120
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:05,021
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1121
01:17:05,194 --> 01:17:08,561
...you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1122
01:17:08,731 --> 01:17:10,562
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1123
01:17:10,733 --> 01:17:12,724
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1124
01:17:12,902 --> 01:17:15,336
...that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1125
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:18,133
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1126
01:17:18,307 --> 01:17:20,639
...like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1127
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,004
You paused.

1128
01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:24,840
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

1129
01:17:25,014 --> 01:17:29,144
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1130
01:17:29,318 --> 01:17:33,482
...was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1131
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,392
Allison.

1132
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,567
Bye, Carl.

1133
01:17:59,816 --> 01:18:03,377
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1134
01:18:04,153 --> 01:18:05,745
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1135
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:09,119
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1136
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:11,283
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1137
01:18:11,461 --> 01:18:14,430
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1138
01:18:14,597 --> 01:18:16,224
Ever think things got screwed up...

1139
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:20,267
...because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1140
01:18:20,436 --> 01:18:22,404
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1141
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:25,040
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1142
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:28,769
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1143
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:30,412
...a.k.a. what normal people do.

1144
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,344
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1145
01:18:33,516 --> 01:18:34,642
Or not.

1146
01:18:34,817 --> 01:18:36,717
Allison, please, can't we talk for a sec?

1147
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:38,376
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1148
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:40,519
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1149
01:18:42,492 --> 01:18:43,891
Carl.

1150
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:49,231
Bye, Carl.

1151
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:52,933
<i>- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.</i>

1152
01:18:53,102 --> 01:18:54,177
<i>Do you?</i>

1153
01:18:55,104 --> 01:18:57,038
<i>You know you and I are a lot alike?</i>

1154
01:18:58,274 --> 01:19:00,606
<i>My mother likes good food.</i>

1155
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:04,105
<i>She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food..."</i>

1156
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,214
<i>"...than bad food any old day
of the week."</i>

1157
01:19:06,382 --> 01:19:07,940
Hey.

1158
01:19:08,251 --> 01:19:10,116
It's me again.

1159
01:19:10,286 --> 01:19:12,754
Specifically I'm talking about 15
to 20 percent.

1160
01:19:12,922 --> 01:19:15,891
The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...

1161
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:34,606
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1162
01:19:35,478 --> 01:19:38,140
You're officially flying by yourself.

1163
01:19:39,715 --> 01:19:41,205
Cool.

1164
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:44,677
There's no greater feeling in the world,
is there?

1165
01:19:47,924 --> 01:19:53,385
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1166
01:19:53,563 --> 01:19:55,394
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

1167
01:19:55,565 --> 01:19:58,693
...for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1168
01:19:58,868 --> 01:20:02,531
In an unrelated note,
everyone else can go jump off a bridge.

1169
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,130
Allison?

1170
01:20:35,304 --> 01:20:39,434
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1171
01:20:39,609 --> 01:20:44,672
- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
<i>- Okay, okay. Just checking in.</i>

1172
01:20:44,847 --> 01:20:46,678
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

1173
01:20:46,849 --> 01:20:49,039
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons?

1174
01:20:49,418 --> 01:20:53,149
<i>- I never really thought of them as...</i>
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, just a second.

1175
01:20:55,558 --> 01:20:58,652
Wes? Can you hear me?

1176
01:20:58,828 --> 01:21:00,090
<i>Go get the ball!</i>

1177
01:21:00,263 --> 01:21:03,699
<i>So listen, I got a job for you.</i>
We're shutting down a bunch of branches...

1178
01:21:03,866 --> 01:21:07,768
- ...and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1179
01:21:08,204 --> 01:21:09,671
Which ones?

1180
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,968
We are Sparta!

1181
01:21:17,713 --> 01:21:19,146
Hi, Norm.

1182
01:21:42,371 --> 01:21:44,669
<i>You have three messages.</i>

1183
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,570
<i>Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.</i>

1184
01:21:47,743 --> 01:21:50,610
<i>No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.</i>

1185
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:53,840
<i>I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.</i>

1186
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,048
<i>Carl, it's Roons.
Thanks for letting me use your car.</i>

1187
01:21:57,219 --> 01:21:59,779
<i>You might notice the front bumper missing.
Not to worry.</i>

1188
01:21:59,956 --> 01:22:02,720
<i>I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.</i>

1189
01:22:02,892 --> 01:22:07,261
<i>And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don't forget, no starch. Love you.</i>

1190
01:22:07,863 --> 01:22:10,889
<i>It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...</i>

1191
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:14,833
<i>...but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.</i>

1192
01:22:15,004 --> 01:22:18,132
<i>Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you. At all.</i>

1193
01:22:18,307 --> 01:22:20,969
- Shower. Shit.
<i>- It's on?</i>

1194
01:22:21,143 --> 01:22:23,111
<i>Right? Call me.</i>

1195
01:22:35,624 --> 01:22:36,648
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1196
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:39,386
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1197
01:22:39,562 --> 01:22:40,824
What?

1198
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:43,659
Come on inside. I'll explain everything.

1199
01:22:48,904 --> 01:22:51,168
Surprise!

1200
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,934
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1201
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:55,577
How did you pull this off?

1202
01:22:55,745 --> 01:22:58,407
I just called in a few favours,
kept throwing money at it.

1203
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:01,446
I like it, I like it.

1204
01:23:01,617 --> 01:23:03,050
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1205
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:05,312
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1206
01:23:05,488 --> 01:23:07,649
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1207
01:23:08,124 --> 01:23:10,957
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1208
01:23:11,127 --> 01:23:13,618
On him, on him.

1209
01:23:16,632 --> 01:23:17,656
Cake?

1210
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:18,857
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1211
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:23,438
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1212
01:23:25,007 --> 01:23:27,999
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1213
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:38,443
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1214
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:41,454
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1215
01:23:41,624 --> 01:23:44,491
You know, taking her day by day.

1216
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:47,493
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1217
01:23:53,436 --> 01:23:57,873
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1218
01:23:59,742 --> 01:24:04,111
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1219
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,304
Do you dance?

1220
01:24:05,881 --> 01:24:08,372
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1221
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:12,112
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1222
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:44,012
- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...

1223
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,189
Oh, jeez.

1224
01:24:50,793 --> 01:24:54,092
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

1225
01:24:54,263 --> 01:24:56,231
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1226
01:24:56,398 --> 01:24:59,492
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1227
01:24:59,668 --> 01:25:02,193
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1228
01:25:02,371 --> 01:25:06,432
I guess I'll just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

1229
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:08,201
I know it sounds silly but...

1230
01:25:08,377 --> 01:25:10,937
...maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1231
01:25:11,113 --> 01:25:15,413
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1232
01:25:16,018 --> 01:25:17,713
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

1233
01:25:17,887 --> 01:25:20,879
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1234
01:25:21,056 --> 01:25:23,684
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1235
01:25:24,627 --> 01:25:27,357
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1236
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:29,998
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1237
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,134
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1238
01:25:37,606 --> 01:25:39,506
Hi there.

1239
01:25:40,442 --> 01:25:42,069
Hello there.

1240
01:25:42,845 --> 01:25:45,814
You must be Tillie.

1241
01:25:46,849 --> 01:25:51,843
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1242
01:25:55,357 --> 01:26:01,455
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1243
01:26:02,865 --> 01:26:04,594
Come on, let's go.

1244
01:26:14,443 --> 01:26:17,003
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1245
01:26:17,646 --> 01:26:23,516
- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
<i>- Can you come over?</i>

1246
01:26:23,686 --> 01:26:26,553
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1247
01:26:26,722 --> 01:26:30,590
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1248
01:26:30,759 --> 01:26:32,488
I don't know.

1249
01:26:33,395 --> 01:26:37,388
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1250
01:26:38,734 --> 01:26:41,202
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1251
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:45,636
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1252
01:26:45,808 --> 01:26:50,142
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1253
01:26:50,312 --> 01:26:56,581
Yeah. I'm gonna assume at this point,
it's, well...

1254
01:26:56,752 --> 01:26:59,721
- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...

1255
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,289
Steph...

1256
01:27:06,962 --> 01:27:08,793
...I can't.

1257
01:27:09,431 --> 01:27:11,126
I'm sorry.

1258
01:27:13,636 --> 01:27:15,570
What are you saying?

1259
01:27:17,206 --> 01:27:19,401
I'm saying no.

1260
01:27:35,891 --> 01:27:37,358
Are you serious?

1261
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:52,900
Oh, Jesus.

1262
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:02,907
Oh, please.

1263
01:28:03,419 --> 01:28:07,048
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1264
01:28:07,222 --> 01:28:11,283
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

1265
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:15,294
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1266
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:19,662
<i>- No man, no man, no man...</i>
- Not possible!

1267
01:28:21,904 --> 01:28:24,031
Jackoff.

1268
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:30,636
<i>Chapter 26,
"Words That Rhyme With Yes."</i>

1269
01:28:30,813 --> 01:28:33,441
<i>Guess, mess...</i>

1270
01:28:33,615 --> 01:28:39,645
<i>Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.</i>

1271
01:28:39,822 --> 01:28:41,790
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1272
01:29:06,448 --> 01:29:09,212
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1273
01:29:10,619 --> 01:29:14,316
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman."

1274
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:18,051
Again, I'm pretty sure she was
just here checking on Carl.

1275
01:29:18,327 --> 01:29:20,261
Peter.

1276
01:29:20,996 --> 01:29:22,657
A covenant.

1277
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:25,129
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1278
01:29:25,734 --> 01:29:28,703
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1279
01:29:29,571 --> 01:29:32,404
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1280
01:29:32,574 --> 01:29:34,041
It is nonsense.

1281
01:29:35,778 --> 01:29:37,370
It's him.

1282
01:29:38,914 --> 01:29:43,180
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1283
01:29:43,352 --> 01:29:46,150
First of all, what were
you doing in my car?

1284
01:29:46,321 --> 01:29:48,755
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1285
01:29:48,924 --> 01:29:52,758
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

1286
01:29:53,796 --> 01:29:56,026
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1287
01:29:56,198 --> 01:29:59,861
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1288
01:30:00,035 --> 01:30:03,004
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1289
01:30:03,172 --> 01:30:05,265
You just don't know how to use it,
that's all.

1290
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:08,342
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1291
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:10,478
No, that's not the point.

1292
01:30:10,646 --> 01:30:14,446
Well, maybe at first it is,
but that's just to open you up to it...

1293
01:30:14,616 --> 01:30:16,243
...to get you started.

1294
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:19,046
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1295
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:21,655
...not because a covenant tells you to...

1296
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:24,759
...but because you know in your heart
that you want to.

1297
01:30:26,028 --> 01:30:27,689
Yeah.

1298
01:30:28,263 --> 01:30:29,992
You're right.

1299
01:30:30,732 --> 01:30:33,633
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1300
01:30:33,802 --> 01:30:35,201
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1301
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:37,930
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1302
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:42,601
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

1303
01:30:43,412 --> 01:30:47,280
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1304
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:48,711
Perfect.

1305
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,283
I said that.

1306
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:55,116
Whatever.

1307
01:30:56,959 --> 01:31:00,520
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1308
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,268
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1309
01:31:07,436 --> 01:31:09,768
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1310
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:16,300
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1311
01:31:16,478 --> 01:31:20,847
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1312
01:31:21,016 --> 01:31:25,453
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1313
01:31:26,088 --> 01:31:28,215
Ducati.

1314
01:31:33,161 --> 01:31:36,597
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

1315
01:31:36,765 --> 01:31:39,962
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1316
01:31:40,135 --> 01:31:42,467
No, Carl,
this is not the same.

1317
01:31:42,638 --> 01:31:45,630
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1318
01:31:46,642 --> 01:31:48,610
Holy Jesus.

1319
01:31:48,777 --> 01:31:50,039
...torque.

1320
01:32:02,457 --> 01:32:04,516
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1321
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:09,961
You might wanna get out of the way.

1322
01:32:21,243 --> 01:32:23,643
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1323
01:33:17,499 --> 01:33:19,262
What an asshole.

1324
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:37,042
Carl, what are you doing here?

1325
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:41,121
I just wanted to tell you that
I don't wanna live with you.

1326
01:33:41,961 --> 01:33:44,383
Thanks...
My knight in shining armour.

1327
01:33:44,559 --> 01:33:47,050
Okay, people, let's go.

1328
01:33:50,599 --> 01:33:51,691
But I wanna be with you.

1329
01:33:51,867 --> 01:33:54,062
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't even know who you are.

1330
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:56,796
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1331
01:33:56,972 --> 01:33:59,304
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's a big decision.

1332
01:33:59,474 --> 01:34:02,068
We shouldn't just jump into that
without thinking about it.

1333
01:34:02,244 --> 01:34:06,203
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

1334
01:34:06,381 --> 01:34:09,350
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1335
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:12,043
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

1336
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,211
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1337
01:34:14,389 --> 01:34:18,155
You think? Seems pretty airtight to me.

1338
01:34:18,326 --> 01:34:21,295
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1339
01:34:21,463 --> 01:34:24,557
Because the old Carl didn't think
he was enough for anybody.

1340
01:34:24,733 --> 01:34:27,759
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1341
01:34:27,936 --> 01:34:30,268
...sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1342
01:34:30,806 --> 01:34:33,274
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1343
01:34:33,442 --> 01:34:36,707
But now I know that what I have to share is
pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1344
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:40,173
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1345
01:34:40,348 --> 01:34:42,373
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1346
01:34:42,984 --> 01:34:45,452
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1347
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:48,953
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1348
01:34:49,124 --> 01:34:52,184
...and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1349
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,294
You weren't scared of anything.

1350
01:34:54,463 --> 01:34:57,125
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

1351
01:34:57,299 --> 01:35:00,462
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1352
01:35:01,069 --> 01:35:03,060
And I'm scared too.

1353
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:05,297
So let's be scared together.

1354
01:35:07,242 --> 01:35:09,233
I don't know what you want me to say.

1355
01:35:09,878 --> 01:35:11,345
So just say yes...

1356
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:14,314
...but only if you really want to.

1357
01:35:14,549 --> 01:35:17,677
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1358
01:35:18,987 --> 01:35:20,818
Yeah, I noticed that.

1359
01:35:21,356 --> 01:35:22,721
Well?

1360
01:35:29,531 --> 01:35:31,761
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1361
01:35:32,634 --> 01:35:36,229
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1362
01:35:43,211 --> 01:35:44,872
I like maybe.

1363
01:35:45,046 --> 01:35:46,240
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1364
01:36:13,175 --> 01:36:16,633
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

1365
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:18,973
You got anything with a flat front?

1366
01:36:19,147 --> 01:36:21,081
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1367
01:36:23,718 --> 01:36:25,151
Thanks, guys.

1368
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,914
This is the single biggest donation
that we've ever had.

1369
01:36:28,089 --> 01:36:30,649
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1370
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:32,191
You're a good man, Carl.

1371
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:36,888
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1372
01:36:38,366 --> 01:36:43,702
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1373
01:36:43,872 --> 01:36:48,309
And the word you will have
said 2 million times is:

1374
01:36:48,476 --> 01:36:50,808
Yes!

1375
01:36:56,284 --> 01:36:58,445
Good God.

1376
01:38:32,547 --> 01:38:34,674
So anything else
we need to know?

1377
01:38:34,849 --> 01:38:39,115
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1378
01:38:39,287 --> 01:38:40,845
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1379
01:38:41,022 --> 01:38:42,387
Right.

1380
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:44,989
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1381
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,856
I never could have finished
the suits without it.

1382
01:38:49,564 --> 01:38:53,091
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

1383
01:38:53,268 --> 01:38:54,292
What?

1384
01:38:54,469 --> 01:38:57,404
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

1385
01:38:57,572 --> 01:38:59,233
What if I'm
one of those chickens...

1386
01:38:59,407 --> 01:39:02,706
...whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1387
01:39:02,877 --> 01:39:05,812
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1388
01:39:06,548 --> 01:39:09,540
I told you,
my foot caught a nail.

1389
01:39:57,799 --> 01:39:59,323
I love this.
