Loving You a Thousand Times 

3
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:08,348
Episode 54

4
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:14,736
Kang Ho, did anything happen?
Why are you in such a hurry?

5
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:19,821
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, where is Eun Nim?

6
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,910
Why are you like this?

7
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:36,432
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, our
Eun Nim is sick, please save her.

8
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:40,104
What do you mean?

9
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:47,094
You said our Eun Nim is sick,
why did you ask to save her?

10
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,601
What's wrong with our Eun Nim?

11
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:55,906
You... really make people wonder.
Why are you not speaking out?

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,639
How is our Eun Nim sick?

13
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,706
She was talking about writing her resume
and looking for job just yesterday.

14
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:07,789
Eun Nim... Eun Nim...

15
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,502
Father-in-law, it's...

16
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:16,377
Speak out quickly, this fella.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,475
Father-in-law...

18
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:23,700
Eun Nim has gastric cancer!

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,710
Gastric cancer... gastric cancer!

20
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:35,449
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:44,666
Eun Nim should go to the hospital, get treatment
from the hospital, but she disappeared.

22
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:52,571
You... what are you talking about right now?

23
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:57,665
Father-in-law, please help me find Eun Nim.

24
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:10,348
Once I find Eun Nim, we need to take her
to the hospital. She needs the treatment now.

25
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:25,234
Honey, you need to eat
some even if you don't feel like it.

26
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:33,550
Only after you regain your strength
will you be able to look for Eun Nim.

27
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:37,687
All right.

28
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,996
Why are you sitting like that, sit more comfortably.

29
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:52,783
Aigoo, my God, we have to find her.

30
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:57,729
She is so good,
why did she get such an illness?

31
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:04,506
All right, why not tell us the details?

32
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,810
After we understand the details then
we should find the solution.

33
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,443
You went to the hospital with Eun Nim, didn't you?

34
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,018
What did the hospital say?

35
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:21,252
I'm all right, this is a matter of life and death.

36
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:24,850
I'm not a weakling, tell us now.

37
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:27,784
Yes, tell us the truth.

38
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:34,739
The hospital said she had one year at most.

39
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:47,810
What!? They said she could only live for one year?

40
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:51,340
Are they saying our Eun Nim only has one year?

41
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:58,312
Oh my goodness...
honey, what should we do?

42
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:00,236
First, Son-in-law Baek...

43
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:07,922
I would like to know, is there any
alternative for our Eun Nim?

44
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,871
Is there any way to keep her alive?

45
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:16,043
Tell me! I will do anything.

46
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:21,345
That... even if it takes my life,
as long as it'll save Eun Nim's...

47
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,919
Right now, the only choice is operation.

48
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,958
Yes, right, let her be operated then.

49
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:39,312
She must have the operation, the operation.

50
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,700
Will she really be fine after an operation?

51
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:47,642
Although we will only find out afterward, Father-in-law...
Eun Nim will survive.

52
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:53,841
That's right. One of my friends had the operation
for his gastric cancer five years ago.

53
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:56,460
He is still alive right now.

54
00:04:56,495 --> 00:05:01,441
Even if the hospital said only one year to live,
one could survive three, five years or longer once after the operation.

55
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:07,879
Dear. Let's find Eun Nim quickly
and bring her to the hospital.

56
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:10,152
All right.

57
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:28,890
Eun Nim... This is Dad. I heard
everything from Son-in-law Baek.

58
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:36,243
Um... once you receive this message,
please come home quickly. Do you hear?

59
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:45,642
Eun Nim! Do as he says.

60
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:54,588
Although I might be a mother that is nothing to you,
you must take treatment when you are sick.

61
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:59,615
If you still consider me as your mother,
please come back home soon, right now.

62
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,731
Do you hear me?

63
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:26,394
You! You! What are you doing like this?

64
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:29,170
It's snowing!

65
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,954
You! This person! How can you play with food?

66
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:34,703
Who is going to clean up the mess you created?

67
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:42,346
Grandma, let her do as she likes; we can clean it later.

68
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:46,547
Mother, you do whatever you like.

69
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:51,164
Aigoo.

70
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:54,891
Aigoo, my God.

71
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,860
Leave his crazy mother like this...

72
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,820
Where did our Kang Ho travel to?
He hasn't called back home either.

73
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,655
This would work.

74
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:16,252
We have to call him and ask him to come back home.

75
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:21,641
Aigoo, I can't even have one quiet meal now.

76
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,790
About that... Grandma...

77
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,255
What's wrong?

78
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,238
Do you have something to tell me?

79
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,278
I have something I haven't told you yet.

80
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,487
What? What is it?

81
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,907
In truth...

82
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,176
Grandma! It's me.

83
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,979
Where are you right now?

84
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,929
You told me, your grandma, such a lie as you travelled.

85
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:16,330
What are you really doing over there?

86
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,304
Grandma.

87
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,772
You're even stranger after divorcing, Stranger.

88
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:27,606
Leaving your unstable mother behind and going
after your ex-wife. What were you thinking?

89
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:33,199
Grandma, I'll tell you later, I'm hanging up now.

90
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,206
Hello.

91
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,625
I'm...

92
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,862
You know who I am?

93
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:50,478
Yes.

94
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:54,256
How could such things happen in this world?

95
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:58,664
I have never heard of such things before.

96
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,402
I'm very sorry to hear that your daughter is sick.

97
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:09,582
But, how could you let her ex-husband
Kang Ho take her to the hospital?

98
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,489
This doesn't make any sense.

99
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,395
It can't be like this.

100
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,092
About that, Grandmother...

101
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:26,268
I'm sorry, it's not convenient for me to take calls now.

102
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:29,224
I'll call you back later.

103
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:33,749
Who is it?

104
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:37,196
You should go home now.

105
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,204
Your grandmother is complaining of this and that already.

106
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,508
Do we have to take such calls under this condition?

107
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:52,324
Yes, let's do this.

108
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,965
We will contact you once we find Eun Nim.

109
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:05,475
Go on now! What are we going to do
if they come over here looking for you again?

110
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:16,082
Ah! Look here, it's packed.

111
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:21,043
That's right. There are different tricks to be successful.

112
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:36,047
Over here. Please give me one sauced fried chicken and
one marinated fried chicken to go.

113
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,917
Darling! Darling, have a seat here, quick.

114
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,184
What is this?

115
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:49,224
Why did you bring fried chicken?

116
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:52,277
This is the fried chicken from that famous store.

117
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,388
Why did you bring these?

118
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,703
What do you mean why?

119
00:11:55,738 --> 00:12:01,618
We need to study carefully so we can develop
new recipes to compete with that store.

120
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:05,384
That is so, but the real trouble isn't that.

121
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:07,165
Then where is the trouble?

122
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:11,848
The problem is that my mom hasn't
answered any calls since she went to study.

123
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:13,212
What?

124
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:17,249
Are you behaving like this because you're afraid
your mom is going to meet with the PD again?

125
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:21,225
I can't just do nothing while my mother meets with guys.

126
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:26,490
Aigoo! Really! After seeing how you are,
I really hope to have a daughter than a son.

127
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,336
Others can live happily meeting with men,
why can't your mother?

128
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,404
What?

129
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,971
So you mean my mom is going over to her in-law's
house after she gets married again?

130
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:38,270
Really, how could you interpret my words like that?

131
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,232
That's not what I meant.

132
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:43,722
What I mean is... look at my parents,
they both are remarried.

133
00:12:43,757 --> 00:12:45,723
Look how well they live together
and how happy they are.

134
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:50,344
What I'm saying is, if she meets with a man
matching her, would I be this way?

135
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:55,750
Nan Jung, think about it; what if your
father-in-law was PD Bong.

136
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,966
Would you feel it's fine?

137
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:00,024
Father-in-law?

138
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:06,252
That's right! Treating PD Bong as father-in-law
doesn't sounds quite right.

139
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,342
Not just a little, but totally out of the question.

140
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,676
If she doesn't answer again...

141
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:17,554
- You worked hard.
- Yes.

142
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,209
You worked hard.

143
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:20,819
Goodbye.

144
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,179
Goodbye.

145
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,510
- Thank you.
- Yes.

146
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:24,710
- You worked hard.
- Yes.

147
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:26,843
Yes. It's me...

148
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,530
Mother, where are you?

149
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,463
Script discussion ended. We finished just now.

150
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,331
If it's donem come home soon. What are you doing there?

151
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:42,609
Mother, you should not treat PD bong like that,
do you understand what I mean?

152
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:49,454
Chul, really, how could you speak
to Mother without respect?

153
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:54,452
What did Chul say?

154
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,008
That... I'm hanging up.

155
00:13:56,922 --> 00:14:01,394
I don't know. That's why...
you shouldn't make things so complicated.

156
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:09,279
Writer Kim, there are no difficulties in
this world that could stop us.

157
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:15,282
Wild... you're still doing wild things even now.

158
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,063
Really, you really want to continue saying that?

159
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:19,952
What wild thing did I do?

160
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:23,378
You worked hard all this time, I'm leaving first.

161
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:26,795
Wait! Where are you going? Let's go together.

162
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:28,590
Where are we going?

163
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,739
Outside.

164
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:32,332
I'm tired, I want to take a rest at home.

165
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:36,212
If you keep on doing this then
I'm going to take some action.

166
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,404
Right here?

167
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,590
So what? Bet I won't do it?

168
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,301
I got it. Let's go. Let's go.

169
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,945
Didn't I say...

170
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:53,943
Why are we here at a coffee shop?

171
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,029
Over here, here...

172
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,659
Who is he?

173
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,171
Let's go over there first.

174
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,269
You are here.

175
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:09,015
Gosh, you bring the mother-in-law.

176
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:16,520
How are you? I'm PD Bong's mother.

177
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,584
What?

178
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:27,285
Why is only the mother here, where is the daughter?

179
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:30,877
Aigoo. Aigoo.

180
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:33,853
That... that... Mother.

181
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:36,472
She is the one I am dating.

182
00:15:37,784 --> 00:15:39,128
What?

183
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,011
Mother. Mother.

184
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:55,771
Mother, it's going to burn your mouth.

185
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:05,752
My gosh, because he said
it's the writer of my favorite TV show,

186
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:07,665
I was very excited.

187
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:11,302
This is the writer?
It won't work even if Grandpa knelt down in front of me.

188
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:13,375
Won Seo, let's go.

189
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,688
Mother.

190
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,010
I said let's go.

191
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:20,109
That... Mother, please listen to me first.

192
00:16:58,397 --> 00:16:59,619
Thank you.

193
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:02,256
You're welcome.

194
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:41,342
My poor child, my poor child.

195
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,147
Her heart must be so hurt.

196
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:51,630
Don't cry! Nothing will happen to our Eun Nim.

197
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,242
Why are you crying so hard?!

198
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:01,936
Our Eun Nim... our Eun Nim will be fine.

199
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:09,425
Of course, our Eun Nim hasn't had a good life yet.

200
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:14,311
But nothing bad will happen to her.

201
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:19,023
So stop crying, do you understand?

202
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:31,172
Hello? Yes, Eun Nim... it's Dad. Eun Nim...

203
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:35,551
Father, I'm sorry.

204
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,253
I made you worried.

205
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:43,977
No, don't worry, you will come back home, right?

206
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:49,089
Yes, Father, I'm coming back home.

207
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:53,056
So Father, don't worry.

208
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:57,539
I understand.
I won't worry, and you should come home now.

209
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,571
Yes, come home soon.

210
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,995
Eun Nim says she is coming back?

211
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,791
Yes, she is coming back.

212
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,697
Turn on the heater in Eun Nim's room.

213
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,504
I already turned on the heater in her room a while back.

214
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,951
I should make some cabbage soup for Eun Nim.

215
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,501
Where were you?

216
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:56,784
Why are you hurting my feelings like this?

217
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:59,017
You didn't read my letter?

218
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,934
I read it.

219
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:03,011
Then why are you like this?

220
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:06,098
If you read it then you should not be like this.

221
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,910
Why aren't you listening?

222
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,061
I'm really all right with it.

223
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:20,642
If you feel sorry for me, all you
need to do is take the treatment at the hospital.

224
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:23,404
You heard what the doctor said and you're still like this?

225
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:29,890
I... only need some quiet...

226
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:31,062
Quiet for what?

227
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:35,338
Quiet to die?

228
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,219
I'll take care of my own business.

229
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:41,165
You can survive.

230
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:47,598
Did you read through the books I gave you?

231
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:55,185
There are many survivors in a later term of cancer than you.

232
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,506
Why are you giving up before ever trying?

233
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,369
Eun Nim! Eun Nim!

234
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:08,157
You haven't left yet?

235
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,819
Eun Nim, let's go inside.

236
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:19,150
Father, Mother, please ask Kang Ho to leave.

237
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:23,359
All right, why don't you leave first?

238
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:48,820
Quick, have a seat, it's very cold outside.

239
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:56,864
How were you raised? You have parents.

240
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:03,234
So, are you thinking of dying outside by yourself?

241
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,853
Why aren't you considering your parents?

242
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,015
That's enough.

243
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,602
Why are you saying nothing? Talk to her.

244
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:30,167
Eun Nim, we heard everything from Kang Ho today.

245
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:37,294
But it's strange, your father...
I never thought that you would have any problems.

246
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:45,406
Eun Nim, first of all, you need to take it easy.

247
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,853
Everything is dependent on how you think of it.

248
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:53,901
There are many incredible things in this world.

249
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:57,992
Besides, the doctor never said it's impossible.

250
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:00,114
Is that so?

251
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:09,969
So... you should think about your father and your mother.

252
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:17,150
If something happened to you,
more than one or two people will be hurt.

253
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,739
So you should never think of bad things.

254
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,312
Do you understand?

255
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:30,253
Good, that is enough.

256
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,965
That's enough.

257
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,081
It's me. Father!

258
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:58,768
Where are you? Come back home right now.

259
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,448
All right, I understand.

260
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:19,050
Aigoo.

261
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:29,221
Oh, you came home so soon?

262
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,976
Come over here, have a seat here.

263
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:37,642
Mother, I'm home.

264
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,900
Mother, what are you doing?

265
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:47,457
Aigoo.

266
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,782
I told you to sit quickly.

267
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:03,979
You told your elders at home that you're going for a trip?

268
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:06,499
What's really going on?

269
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,746
Grandmother, I already said, he went there to...

270
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:12,413
But this matter is a little bit difficult...

271
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:15,501
Sae Hun, don't say anything for now.

272
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:20,932
If it's hard to speak out, why are you still doing it? Huh?

273
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:26,573
Who asked you to take care of your ex-wife?

274
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:29,988
You didn't go to work, you have that much time?

275
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:36,338
We also feel sorry for Youngest Daughter-in-law's condition.

276
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:41,193
But she is no longer related to us.

277
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,708
That's right.

278
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:54,353
If you feel pity for her, we can check the hospital
and also pay for her medical bills.

279
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,905
But Kang Ho, you should not get involved directly.

280
00:26:01,855 --> 00:26:06,284
I did not stay by Eun Nim's side out of pity for her.

281
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,312
If it wasn't pity for her, then what?

282
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:19,443
I... I couldn't stay beside my maternal
mother when she passed away.

283
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:31,186
This will be a great stone in my heart
that presses on me until I die.

284
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:42,136
But you should know that I did not divorce
Eun Nim out of dislike for her.

285
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,621
I'm going to stay by Eun Nim's side.

286
00:26:52,172 --> 00:27:06,295
And I must save her, I will never
separate from her again.

287
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,178
You are not separating from her-
then are you going to marry her after you save her?

288
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,161
It's so noisy!

289
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,498
Do as Kang Ho Oppa wants, don't interfere with it.

290
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,864
It's me.

291
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:11,445
It's me. Eun Nim.

292
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:16,973
Why are you not talking? Hello?

293
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:32,592
Mother-in-law! I am very sorry to call so late

294
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,911
Something isn't right with Eun Nim.

295
00:29:35,154 --> 00:29:36,412
Eun Nim?

296
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:39,285
What's wrong with Eun Nim?

297
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,649
Kang Ho says we should go check out Eun Nim's room.

298
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:42,811
What?

299
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:46,299
Yes, we understand.

300
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,715
If something happens we will call you, don't worry.

301
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:58,064
Eun Nim! Eun Nim! Eun Nim!

302
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:00,279
Wake up, Eun Nim!

303
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:00,973
Eun Nim!

304
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,151
Eun Nim!

305
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:07,097
My God, what happened to Eun Nim?

306
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:10,627
What are you doing? Call 119!

307
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:11,796
Call for the ambulance, hurry up!

308
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:12,605
Eun Nim! Wake up! Eun Nim!

309
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:15,612
Eun Nim! Eun Nim!

310
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,109
It's me, Mother-in-law.

311
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:34,733
I understand, I'll head directly to the hospital.

312
00:30:45,063 --> 00:30:51,890
Does this mean she fainted due to so much pain?
So much pain?

313
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:58,826
How could it be? How could it be?

314
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:02,287
It would be extremely painful to make a person faint.

315
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:06,764
Even though I had pain before, suffered before...

316
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:11,089
Doctor, please gives her some pain killer.

317
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:16,235
Please don't let my child suffer the pain.

318
00:31:21,174 --> 00:31:24,115
It would be better for me to bear the pain.

319
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:27,338
How can I let my Eun Nim, who is as
beautiful as flowers, bear the pain?

320
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:29,448
Eun Nim.

321
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,518
Aigoo! Eun Nim!

322
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:38,929
You told me not to cry, how could you cry like this?

323
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,303
We agreed not cry in front of Eun Nim!

324
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:27,511
Grandma, what is it?

325
00:32:27,817 --> 00:32:29,933
Kang Ho isn't here! Kang Ho...

326
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:32,188
Looks like last night he went out again.

327
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,389
He probably went to her house again.

328
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,743
What should we do about him?

329
00:32:37,244 --> 00:32:42,750
If in fact Sister-in-law is not doing well,
he probably went there for that.

330
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,273
Her illness is her business.

331
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:48,081
They are strangers now, why is he going over there?

332
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,260
This won't do, I need to visit their family.

333
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:52,919
Grandma.

334
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:56,502
If you go there under your current mood,
you are going to hurt each other's feeling.

335
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:59,322
I'll stop by there on my way to work and take a look

336
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,681
and ask Kang Ho what's going on with him too.

337
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:04,105
Would you?

338
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,569
I think it's better that way.

339
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,279
Then you better hurry up and take a look there.
Give me a call after that.

340
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:12,650
Yes.

341
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,479
Father?

342
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,304
Oh, he went to work.

343
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:39,942
You go eat something before coming back.

344
00:33:40,158 --> 00:33:41,700
It's all right, I'm doing fine.

345
00:33:41,735 --> 00:33:45,699
How can it be all right?
I won't run away with Eun Nim.

346
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:48,580
So hurry up and go eat something, hurry up.

347
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,800
In that case, call me if Eun Nim
wakes up or needs anything.

348
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:55,596
I understand, go ahead.

349
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,456
Eun Nim!

350
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:11,919
Mother.

351
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:12,840
Yes.

352
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:21,215
Son-in-law Baek went to get something to eat.
You better not scold him anymore when he returns.

353
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:23,406
It's not right.

354
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:28,657
Although you're like this,
it's not Son-in-law Baek's fault.

355
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:30,638
Do you understand?

356
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,406
What's your plan for the future?

357
00:34:47,264 --> 00:34:51,843
Hyung, I must save her life.

358
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:59,280
Hyung, please help me.
Help me persuade Father and Grandma.

359
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:07,044
I understand, but would it be possible?

360
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:15,309
We could create the possibility.
I'll do everything that can be done.

361
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:18,915
Have her take the treatment and the operation.

362
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:22,819
Where are planning to stay during the treatment?

363
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:25,534
Her family house is a little bit inconvenient.

364
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,913
I'm not too sure about that,
I'm still thinking.

365
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:33,807
Hyung, I'll head back in first.

366
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:35,468
That's fine.

367
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:57,525
Such youth, such blooming age.

368
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,812
I think of all the neglect I did.

369
00:36:06,793 --> 00:36:19,617
I didn't take care of you,
that's why you are like this now.

370
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:26,508
Mother, what are you doing?
Why do you think of such useless matters?

371
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:36,885
You should blame Mother, there is
one or two more people you should blame.

372
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:43,682
Mother didn't do anything wrong,
it's my own illness.

373
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,505
But Mother, I really want to live.

374
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:00,036
I really want to live.

375
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:01,911
Eun Nim...

376
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:18,432
I'm not scared of death, but I'm worried about what
to do about Kang Ho and Father if I die.

377
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:24,431
So I really want to live, Mother, I really want to.

378
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:36,634
If I ended like this, what would
my Kang Ho do? Mother!

379
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,882
If you want to live, then live well.

380
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,317
Why are you having such weak thoughts?

381
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:45,975
Didn't your father say before,

382
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:52,679
"As long as you have faith,
you will make it work?"

383
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:54,973
Would it? Mother.

384
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,297
Would it really work?

385
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:05,651
Mother, I really want to live.
I really want to live with Kang Ho, Mother.

386
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:10,460
Yes, you two should live together.

387
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:15,200
Eun Nim, live on, Eun Nim, Eun Nim.

388
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:19,273
Why are you so pitiful? Eun Nim, Eun Nim.

389
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:20,691
Mom!

390
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,704
Who is there?

391
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:53,494
I'm PD Bong's mother.

392
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,620
Is this the house of Writer Kim Chung Ja?

393
00:38:57,227 --> 00:38:58,227
Yes.

394
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,381
Who is it?

395
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:05,946
Unni, Unni, PD Bong's mother is here.

396
00:39:15,462 --> 00:39:18,393
How are you?

397
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:21,732
Yes, why did you come here?

398
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:26,169
I have something to say.
Are you not going to ask me to sit?

399
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:30,837
Yes, please have a seat.
So Weol. Tea, please.

400
00:39:31,198 --> 00:39:33,575
Yes, Unni.

401
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:45,709
PD Bong's mother looks like a tough person.

402
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:50,228
But what has she come here for?

403
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:55,355
Please have some tea.

404
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:09,110
I'm... really thinking of drinking
myself into the sea.

405
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:12,892
But I need to take care of
this one matter before I die.

406
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,673
I withheld my death thought and came here.

407
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:18,989
Why is that?

408
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:26,087
My son wants to marry you, Writer.
Are you going to marry?

409
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,898
What? Marry?

410
00:40:30,537 --> 00:40:36,010
Ah, I suffered a lot to raise him,
selling rice cakes in the market.

411
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:44,976
How do I describe with just words
the hardship we suffered?

412
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:52,072
But the son I raised with such hardship wants
to marry a woman that is twelve years older.

413
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:54,244
What kind of feeling is that?

414
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:59,263
That... that... there might be
some misunderstanding.

415
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:04,993
To you, the writer: if your son wanted
to marry some woman twelve years older,

416
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:06,376
would you agree?

417
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:08,263
My son is married.

418
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,790
But what if?!

419
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:12,134
Of course, not allowed.

420
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:18,933
That's why... I think
I can communicate with you.

421
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:34,576
This is very expensive sesame seed oil.
I'm asking you a favor.

422
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,679
Have a safe trip.

423
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:56,367
What is this? What...

424
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:09,345
Unni, do you really like PD Bong?

425
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:15,744
I don't know. I don't know, what is this?

426
00:42:16,707 --> 00:42:17,725
Unni.

427
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,683
Is that so? Thank you.

428
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:30,296
Let's meet again when we have time, all right?

429
00:42:37,606 --> 00:42:40,934
This just arrived by express delivery.

430
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,290
Did it?

431
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:43,419
Yes.

432
00:43:00,762 --> 00:43:02,389
What is this?

433
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:06,599
My friend's vacation house,
I borrowed it for you.

434
00:43:06,848 --> 00:43:09,954
You and Eun Nim can stay there together.

435
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:11,546
Hyung...

436
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:17,533
Cancer treatment might take longer than we imagine.
The environment is important too.

437
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,093
Take Eun Nim and stay there comfortably.

438
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:24,661
There is the address, it's very easy to find.

439
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:28,522
Hyung...

440
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:52,293
I packed it myself.
I'm not sure if everything needed is in there.

441
00:43:52,884 --> 00:43:56,437
There are stores nearby, so it should be
very convenient. Don't worry.

442
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:03,284
I worry most about food.
There is no one to prepare the meals.

443
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:07,030
I can handle most things.

444
00:44:07,316 --> 00:44:10,948
If I can't do something, I can
always ask Eun Nim. Don't worry.

445
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:16,666
Mother, don't worry.
I'll eat a lot of good things.

446
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:23,623
Hey, what's going on? Huh?

447
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:28,077
Unni, your tummy is getting big.

448
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:30,282
Is it time to talk about that right now?

449
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:33,354
That's enough, don't yell.

450
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,345
When I see you I feel sorry and pitiful.

451
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,657
Nan Jung...

452
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:45,344
Eun Nim, I plan to tell Eun Jung later.

453
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:48,798
All right, Mother, it's nothing good anyway.

454
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:51,622
She is still studying,
don't disrupt her concentration.

455
00:44:51,837 --> 00:44:53,912
I'll call her later to tell her myself.

456
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,065
All right.

457
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,072
Grandma...

458
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:11,543
Eun Nim... I need to use the bathroom.

459
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:18,626
Don't worry, I'll go check.

460
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:28,375
Why did you check out so soon?

461
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,500
Shouldn't she stay in hospital for shots or such?

462
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:36,220
There is no need to stay in the hospital
until she starts the chemical treatments.

463
00:45:36,827 --> 00:45:40,585
I would like to take Eun Nim to someplace
nice with fresh air for some rest.

464
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:44,316
Would you like that?

465
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:59,557
Grandma, I'll get well,
so don't worry and don't cry.

466
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,360
We are leaving.

467
00:46:05,624 --> 00:46:08,215
Be careful driving.

468
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:13,272
Eun Nim, I'm sorry.

469
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,407
This girl, is it the time to say that kind of thing?

470
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:20,485
You should leave first.
Son-in-law Lee, please take her away.

471
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:26,116
Yes, fighting. Nan Jung, let's go.

472
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:32,048
Eun Nim, I'm sorry. Sorry.

473
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,800
Hurry up. Go.

474
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:37,712
I'm leaving. Mother, I'm leaving.

475
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:40,834
All right, go ahead.

476
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:49,272
Father...

477
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:00,621
Go.

478
00:47:09,722 --> 00:47:12,482
Please take care of her, go.

479
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:38,532
Aigoo. Aigoo, my precious...

480
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:46,680
Why is Eun Nim's life so hard?
I can't bear to live for Eun Nim's sake.

481
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:52,394
Mother-in-law, please take care of yourself.

482
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,049
Eun Nim...

483
00:47:56,982 --> 00:47:59,030
Eun Nim.

484
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:46,242
Is this it?

485
00:48:46,832 --> 00:48:50,892
Yes, looks like this is it. It is.

486
00:48:51,939 --> 00:48:58,643
It's so pretty, is it okay to stay here?

487
00:48:59,296 --> 00:49:02,775
Of course, otherwise why are we here?

488
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:12,045
Kang Ho, I can walk by myself.

489
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:17,307
I'm not carrying you because you can't walk.

490
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:24,323
My dear, did you lose weight? Why are you so light?

491
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:26,164
That won't do.

492
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:32,624
During this time, I will let you eat
good food and take good care of you.

493
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:48,747
Oh, you're home, have a seat over here.

494
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,748
Where is Mother?

495
00:49:56,231 --> 00:50:01,538
Probably she got tired playing with
Yoo Bin all day and has fallen asleep by now.

496
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:08,104
So... did you meet Kang Ho?
What did you two talk about?

497
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:11,549
Kang Ho... it's better to leave him alone.

498
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:15,934
No, ridiculous, it's such an important matter.

499
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:18,612
They're together... nothing else can be done right now.

500
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:23,293
What else can't be done?
Can't they live without each other?

501
00:50:23,526 --> 00:50:25,314
What's wrong with starting anew?

502
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:25,903
Really...

503
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:32,531
Children's Father, it can't be.
Send Kang Ho to an American subsidiary quickly.

504
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:38,561
That method won't work for Kang Ho.

505
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:46,580
True, there's not much time left anyway.
We just need to bear with it till then.

506
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:49,372
Mother...

507
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:54,442
What? Am I wrong? Only one year left.

508
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:59,226
If the child is like that, she won't recover.

509
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:04,688
Nothing would help now, useless is useless.

510
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:09,218
<i>If you love me, please come out wearing this dress.</i>

511
00:53:10,411 --> 00:53:15,052
<i>No, you must love me, come out quick.</i>

512
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:18,736
<i>You understand, right?</i>

513
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:14,890
So pretty, Eun Nim is beautiful any time.

514
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:20,330
But, dressed like this, are we going somewhere?

515
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,033
Driving around, having a date.

516
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:25,766
Let's go.

517
00:54:27,371 --> 00:54:28,539
That's right,

518
00:54:28,574 --> 00:54:33,276
since we're already dressed up so nice like this,
why not make up a little bit too.

519
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,073
Should we?

520
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:25,316
This is a church!

521
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:09,278
Oh, it's all right.

522
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:55,356
Let's pray together.

523
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,655
<i>Both of us are your children.</i>

524
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:36,487
<i>If it's good, please bless us.</i>

525
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:31,460
What is this?

526
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:33,702
Just stay still.

527
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:02,591
Kang Ho...

528
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:07,881
We just married, in front of God.

529
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:09,378
Kang Ho.

530
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:16,612
Even if you don't want it, please bear with it.
We can't argue in front of the God.

531
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:01,770
Let's take some photos.

532
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:03,827
Photos?

533
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:09,565
Yes, today is our wedding day.
We should take some pictures.

534
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:24,032
One, two, three.

535
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:29,757
All done, both facial expressions were great.

536
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:33,429
Please take care of it.

537
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:35,667
Let's go.

538
01:00:36,919 --> 01:00:43,896
Ahjussi, may I take some pictures alone?

539
01:00:44,335 --> 01:00:46,394
Yes, come here.

540
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:48,906
Okay.

541
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,913
Why? More photos?

542
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:56,255
Yes.

543
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,070
Kang Ho, you go out first.

544
01:01:06,224 --> 01:01:08,677
Could it be...

545
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:13,196
You are taking memorial photos now!
