1
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:25,636
(Aning)

2
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:28,605
yeah, we should go down there. they got him.

3
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:30,941
No, we should go down there. They got him.

4
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:33,577
They've got him. Third time's the charm.

5
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:37,014
please, stay in the boat!
A new shipment's arriving today.

6
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,650
Ah, just what we need..
more cocky imperialist doctors.

7
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:41,685
No, what we need is new blood.

8
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:44,404
I'm sick of looking at the two of you.

9
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,024
Baby docs are all the same.
They don't give a crap about the work. 

10
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:49,326
They're just padding their resume with a little third-world do-gooding

11
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:52,279

let 'em. I just need one good one.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,698
help me! get in the boat!

13
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,455
They're gonna drown his ass.
Okay, so maybe they don't got him.

14
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:04,007
I'll open up the clinic.

15
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,132
Why's he gotta be such a show-off?

16
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,551
<i>There are worse places to
practice medicine, papito.</i>

17
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:16,736
Don't I know it.

18
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>*</i>

19
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:31,618
This is it.

20
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:39,293
SeÃ±orita, when you're ready
to go back to the airport,

21
00:01:39,294 --> 00:01:40,711
You call me, okay?

22
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,796
Oh, thank you, but that won't be necessary.

23
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,665
This is a one-way trip.

24
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,718
You're here to work at the clinic?
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

25
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,303
Take the card.

26
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:52,022
He's right. You should
definitely take the card.

27
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:54,224
<i>Al aeropuerto, por favor.</i>

28
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:12,859
<i>okay, hijo, now this might
hurt just a little.</i>

29
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,913
Hi. Um, I'm supposed to
check in with a doctor...

30
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,982
Zee-tah-le-har...

31
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:23,153
Ah, goody, another american.
Saved by the great white hope.

32
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,988
I'm sorry?

33
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,723
Dr. Zitajalehrena alvarez.

34
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,692
Zee. Oh!

35
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:32,328
Why don't you drop those bags and
go see if you can help? Okay.

36
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:36,266
please, stop!

37
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:39,069
Aah! Aah!

38
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,738
Whoa! Is that a-- one ugly-ass fish.

39
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,558
That is not just a fish.
That's a stingray. No! No! No!

40
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,777
Their venom is particularly potent.

41
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:49,713
What, are you a vet or something?
Infectious disease.

42
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:51,698
I- I'm mina minard.

43
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,784
Lily brenner, emergency med.

44
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,203
Tommy fuller, plastics.
I need you to stay still, buddy.

45
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:58,572
Try staying still with a
fish inside your body!

46
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:01,458
I need drugs, man! Sorry.
I don't have drugs for you.

47
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:02,893
What kind of crazy-ass witch doctor

48
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:04,961
Doesn't have drugs?!
The kind that survives on donations.

49
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:06,747
Now there's a box on your way out.

50
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:09,900
Hi. We're the new doctors. What can we do?

51
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:14,638
Hold his shoulders. Brace his legs. no,
no, get-- get the hell away from me! Uhh!

52
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,706
Sit down. Grab his foot.

53
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:19,259
Okay, on the count of three. One, two--

54
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,978
Uhh! No! No! No!

55
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,880
No. No.

56
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,216
All right, hey, hey, hey, hey.

57
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:27,684
Look at that.

58
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:29,352
Aah! Aah!

59
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,054
Uhh!

60
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:36,326
Welcome, doctors.

61
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:40,730
Off the Map s01e01 : Saved by the Great White Hope

62
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:43,699
Okay, we're the only medical
center with 200 miles.

63
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,552
We're slammed all the time.

64
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:48,171
do you have a surgical suite? On the patio.

65
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:51,925
how do you keep it sterile? When you got
a guy bitten by a 10-foot crocodile,

66
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,394
You get the teeth out.
You worry about infection later.

67
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:56,379
Forget what you saw in residency.

68
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,881
Practicing tropical medicine
in a third-world country

69
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:00,550
Is a different game.

70
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,185
Here, it's 1952.

71
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:04,354
You don't have high tech.
You don't have big pharma.

72
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:07,941
You have your brain.
You have your instincts.

73
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:10,777
You use them well,
you'll learn more here in a week

74
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:13,263
Than doctors learn in a year of residency.

75
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:15,198
And you're standing in the middle

76
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,934
Of the greatest medical resource on earth.

77
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,903
This is the tropical rain forest.

78
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:22,205
Here, we have plants to cure viruses,

79
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:24,240
Tree sap to heal wounds,
insects that stop gangrene.

80
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:27,177
And this is where medicine was born.
You up for it?

81
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,012
Great,

82
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,631
'cause out of hundreds of doctors,
I picked you three.

83
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:33,716
So don't screw it up,
is what he's trying to say.

84
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:36,986
Dr. Otis cole.
His bark's worse than is bite.

85
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:41,757
Okay, um, they're both pretty bad.

86
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:44,861
When in doubt, hand out ibuprofen.

87
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,647
Dr. C-cole?

88
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:50,433
I-- we've been traveling for days.

89
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:53,403
Before we get started,
is it cool if we hit the beach?

90
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:56,606
You know, get our swim on.

91
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:02,545
Hey, ladies, dr. Otis cole
just personally asked me

92
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:06,132
To look after one of his patients.

93
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:09,819
You realize we're objectifying

94
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,957
One of the greatest
humanitarians of our time?

95
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,509
Just admiring his credentials.

96
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,895
This place is awesome.
Not only are there no malpractice suits,

97
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,313
But there's surfing.

98
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,565
And you know how many days
a year it's sunny here?

99
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:25,685
All of them. Oh, oh, oh. Sunblock.

100
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:28,804
I got you guys some samples from the office.
Aw, that's really nice.

101
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:32,609
thank you. Yeah, I think there's,
like, three topless beaches

102
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,411
Right around here, and you do
not want those to shrivel up

103
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:38,531
Before their time. I've seen it happen.
It's... It's tragic.

104
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:41,217
Ugh. All right. I'll see you guys later.

105
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:45,805
Going on a house call.
This is gonna be so cool.

106
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,192
You brought your own trauma kit?

107
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:52,061
Well, I figured for the jungle,
you need flares, tourniquets,

108
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:54,464
Field splints. Girl scout.

109
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:56,332
So guilty.

110
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:01,604
Hey, you lost?

111
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:04,440
Ah, english. Hey.

112
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,943
Uh, do you have any idea
where this village is?

113
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,862
They said it's near a river,

114
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:11,214
But there's, like, 80 rivers on this thing.

115
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:13,533
Really, you getting stuck on a
house call on your first day?

116
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,952
You must have pissed off cole.
Oh, no, no, no.

117
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:18,905
It's not like that.
He's trusting me with one-- mm-hmm.

118
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:22,025
Who are you? I'm charlie.
I'm the translator for the clinic.

119
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:23,793
<i>How old are you? Trece.</i>

120
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:26,229
I... If you don't know what that means,

121
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,231
I think you might need my help.

122
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:30,300
Dr. Cole said the patient has t.B.

123
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:33,386
I'm not gonna expose a kid to that.
You're right. I'm sure you'll find your way

124
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,972
Over a treacherous mountain range

125
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:39,676
To a very remote village just fine.

126
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,644
Uh, hey, wait, wait.

127
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:44,013
You might wanna bring
some water. It's a walk.

128
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:45,682
I can handle a walk.

129
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:48,117
Wrong way.

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,721
Come on, gringo.

131
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:54,290
"gringo"? What's gringo?
It means "white person."

132
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,193
Ladies, I have 40 patients
waiting to be seen.

133
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,279
Not to mention, I'm down another doctor.

134
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,130
Oh, is that the woman I saw leaving today?

135
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,749
She seemed really upset.
Radio distress call just came in.

136
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,767
We got an injury in the jungle.

137
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:06,970
I could use another hand out there

138
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:09,339
If you don't mind being
short a doctor. I could go.

139
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,374
I'm ready. Why not?

140
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,410
They seem to be dropping like flies today
anyway. I'm trained in triage protocol.

141
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,413
Oh. Me, too, and I've got a trauma
kit already packed. Okay, well,

142
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:20,383
You just got yourself your
first field trip. Come on.

143
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,593
So this is how you, uh, get around?

144
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:33,363
It's better for jungle roads...

145
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:35,748
If you can call 'em that.

146
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:41,871
Okay, let's do this.

147
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:45,074
Doctor, you hang on like that,
you're roadkill.

148
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:56,319
aah!

149
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:05,028
Dr. Minard, what, um,
what-- what are you doing?

150
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,897
Patient presented with limb
stiffness and numbness.

151
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:10,650
I did a full body check for lesions.

152
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:13,569
And I don't wanna alarm you,
but I haven't been able

153
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,439
<i>To rule out hemorrhagic fever.
Â¿es el brazo izquierdo otra vez?</i>

154
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,574
<i>Igual que antes.</i>

155
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:19,642
Mm.

156
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:20,777
<i>Tenga.</i>

157
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,795
<i>Gracias, doctor.</i>

158
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,250
It's, uh... Very thorough, doctor,

159
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:29,552
But, uh, sometimes it's
not hemorrhagic fever.

160
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:32,021
It's just good old-fashioned tennis elbow.

161
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,090
We're in one of the biggest hot zones

162
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,493
For infectious disease.
How does someone get... Tennis elbow?

163
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,463
Oh, from using a machete?

164
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:43,232
Or from playing tennis.

165
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,943
oh, please, stop! I told you it's a walk.

166
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:57,146
No, this isn't a walk. It's an ironman.

167
00:08:57,147 --> 00:09:00,199
I'm-- I'm being punished, aren't I?

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,685
This is the reason why
americans are fat and lazy.

169
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,186
They only drive.

170
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,956
You know why? 'cause we
invented streets for ourselves.

171
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:09,492
It's called civilization.
You should really try it.

172
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:13,413
Wait. Did you just call me fat?

173
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:25,475
The patient dr. Cole was
treating lives over there.

174
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,478
Great. The doctor is in.

175
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:39,222
<i>Buenos dÃ­as.</i>

176
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,723
<i>buenos dÃ­as.</i>

177
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:44,226
<i>Es el dr. Fuller de la clÃ­nica.</i>

178
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,965
They're all sick.
Which one was dr. Cole treating?

179
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,567
<i>Â¿a quiÃ©n estaba atentiendo el dr. Cole?</i>

180
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:54,737
<i>AllÃ¡... A mi esposa. </i>

181
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:55,838
His wife.

182
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:12,288
She's dead.

183
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:24,901
Keeton, thank god! This guy
just slammed right into a tree.

184
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:26,536
There's blood everywhere.

185
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:28,955
There's gonna be internal injuries then.

186
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:30,773
Where's the patient?

187
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:32,875
<i>AllÃ¡arriba!</i>

188
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:46,168
<i>por favor, escucha al doctor.</i>

189
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:48,170
<i>No! No! No! No quiero mÃ¡s medicinas!</i>

190
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:50,706
Tell him that his family
has advanced tuberculosis.

191
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:53,325
It's a bacterial infection.
It needs to be treated.

192
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:55,711
<i>El dr. Fuller que dice que es
una infecciÃ³n bacterial</i>

193
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:57,729
<i>Y puede curar, se necisitan esas medicinas.</i>

194
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,849
<i>SÃ­, los doctores nos trajeron esa-- </i>

195
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,036
<i>Esto es lo que las medicinas le
han hecho a mi familia.</i>

196
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,305
he says he doesn't want medicine,

197
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,941
Not for him or the children.

198
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:11,043
<i>These children are dying of a
totally curable disease.</i>

199
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:14,346
I- I can save their lives
if he'll just let me.

200
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:17,115
<i>El dr. Fuller dice que sus
niÃ±os estÃ¡n muy enfermos</i>

201
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:20,869
<i>Y para salvarlos necesitan esa medicina.
Mi esposa tomÃ³ esa medicina,</i>

202
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,021
<i>Y entonces no podÃ­a respirar.</i>

203
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:26,875
He said the medicine from dr. Cole

204
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:30,712
Is what killed his wife.
That doesn't make any sense!

205
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:33,198
The antibiotics--
they take time to start working.

206
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,435
he says they made his wife worse,

207
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:40,639
So he made her stop taking the
medicine. Well, then it's his
damn fault that his wife is dead!

208
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,641
I'm not gonna say that.

209
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:46,211
well, then I've done
everything I can do here.

210
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,898
Okay, we'll go out on the same line.

211
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,435
That way, we can both reach him. Uh, no.
One line won't hold three people.

212
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,737
Maybe not even two.

213
00:11:57,824 --> 00:12:01,226
Hold that there. Can you lift your shirt?
What are you doing?

214
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:02,611
Okay, you're lighter than me.

215
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,613
You're gonna have to go out on your own.

216
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:07,833
I'll get as close as I can and
talk you through it, okay?

217
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,251
Okay?

218
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:14,706
hold with the right, brake with the left.

219
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:17,926
These things are safe, right?

220
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:20,878
Hold with the right, brake with the left.

221
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,767
Whoa.

222
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,700
okay, brake.

223
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,935
brake! Use the brake!

224
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:46,405
I'm trying! It's stuck!

225
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:48,040
Aah!

226
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,818
Sir?

227
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,920
Sir, can you hear me?

228
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:05,974
Sir?

229
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:08,426
Sir?

230
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:15,017
His arm's caught in the roller.
I think he's in...

231
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:18,537
I think he's in shock. Well, then we
need to move fast. You're gonna have to

232
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,689
Tourniquet the extremity
and cut the flesh free.

233
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,276
Cut his arm out? We need to get him
down before he bleeds to death.

234
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:27,162
You got a better idea?

235
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:34,453
Oh! Aah!

236
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:44,329
<i>You have un frio.</i>

237
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,497
A cold.

238
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:47,349
Very common.

239
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,851
Uh, make certain to...

240
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,904
<i>Reloj... "to watch"</i>

241
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,240
<i>If make fiebre...</i>

242
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:59,511
<i>Return aquÃ­ for visita.</i>

243
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,980
<i>Look alive, doctora.</i>

244
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,515
Our ebola rush starts around noon.

245
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,986
That's hilarious. Go to hell.

246
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,491
Calm him down, brenner! I'm trying! Sir--

247
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:15,293
The more he moves, the more he bleeds!
You gotta try harder!

248
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:19,164
I gotta get down! I gotta--
I can't die up here! Hey! Hey!

249
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:23,000
You stop that right now!

250
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:28,406
What's your name?

251
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:32,177
Ed. Ed greenman.

252
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,112
Okay, ed greenman, you listen to me.

253
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:35,247
Yeah?

254
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:38,316
You are not going to die. You're gonna live.

255
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:40,485
Okay?

256
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:46,858
Now...

257
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:49,661
I'm gonna have to cut your arm.

258
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm gonna try not to cut too deep,
but it's gonna hurt.

259
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,666
And then I'm gonna tie you to my harness,

260
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,536
And we're gonna get the hell off this thing.

261
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:07,796
Stay superficial so you don't
sever the radial artery.

262
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:10,582
right.

263
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,420
Don't watch it.

264
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:18,356
Ed. Look at me. Look at me. Aah!

265
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:20,559
Look at me.

266
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,661
Talk to me. Ed, talk to me.

267
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:25,030
So, ed, what--
what brings you to the jungle?

268
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,332
I came here when I was 25 on my honeymoon.

269
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,767
that was the best trip we ever had.

270
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:32,487
we even did the zip line,

271
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,372
But somehow

272
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:37,742
It didn't seem quite so high 40 years ago.

273
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:40,962
I probably shouldn't even be up here.
You and me both, ed.

274
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:43,748
Aah! You and me both.

275
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,989
The bleeding's under control,
but we're gonna take you back

276
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,808
To the clinic and check for
internal injuries, okay?

277
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,430
Not bad,

278
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:00,765
For your first day back.

279
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,234
What?

280
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:05,737
I spoke to your chief
resident back in the states.

281
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:08,990
You took a pretty long leave of absence.

282
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,714
Well, I lost somebody,

283
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,683
So I took some time,

284
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:20,585
But I-I'm good now.

285
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:22,554
I'm a doctor, right? So...

286
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,173
That doesn't make it any easier.

287
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,994
Well, we should go. It's a long ride back.

288
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:33,098
Mm. Yeah.

289
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:44,943
Uh-oh. I hear bad words in spanish.

290
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:47,012
<i>Wh-what's wrong, loca?</i>

291
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,546
What's wrong?

292
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:49,981
I am slammed,

293
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:52,984
And I haven't figured
out how to clone myself.

294
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,519
And...

295
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,925
She left. Again. They all leave,
so I don't know why

296
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:04,162
<i>I waste my time training these
useless americanos</i>

297
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,131
Who don't even bother to learn spanish.

298
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:09,334
Because you're a great teacher,
and, uh, you know, you have

299
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:13,071
The patience of a saint. 100 pesos says
they're all gone by the end of the week!

300
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:15,106
Maybe not so much the patience,

301
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:18,710
But deep down is a heart
of gold in there, woman.

302
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,895
Heart of gold.

303
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:23,098
<i>Only for you, cariÃ±o. MuÃ©vete.</i>

304
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:38,630
Ed, your arm's gonna be fine,
but it looks like

305
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:42,100
You're starting to bleed internally.
And how do you fix that?

306
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:45,203
Well, with a small rupture,
the spleen can heal itself,

307
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:48,206
But if it doesn't, we operate.

308
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:53,111
Surgery in the jungle.

309
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:55,347
I thought zip-lining was scary.

310
00:17:57,016 --> 00:18:00,452
There any family we should contact?
Your wife, maybe?

311
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:03,221
She passed away a few months ago.

312
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:05,690
Oh, I'm sorry.

313
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:07,726
Been promising her for 30 years

314
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:10,261
We'd come back here.

315
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:12,664
But you get busy.

316
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:14,666
Had a mortgage to pay.

317
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,167
I finally retired

318
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:18,803
And booked this trip.

319
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:23,408
And I guess I waited a little too long.

320
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:28,780
Can't we airlift him out and
get him to a city hospital?

321
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:30,281
They have a c.T.

322
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:32,250
The airlift can't land till tomorrow.

323
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:35,720
Just get him on packed cells.
He's weak from blood loss.

324
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,928
You're still here?

325
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,064
I- I told you, it's--

326
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:48,500
It's just chest congestion.

327
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,769
You can go home.

328
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,671
Home.

329
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:58,126
Or not.

330
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:05,417
How was your field trip, plastics?

331
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:07,919
Your patient's dead.

332
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,372
No, I-I had her on a triple drug regimen

333
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:12,690
For over two weeks. She was improving.

334
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,009
Yeah, and then her husband stopped the meds.

335
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,011
The whole family's got t.B. Now,

336
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,197
And he doesn't want anyone treated.

337
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:21,199
I- I don't know the exact procedure here

338
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,302
In terms of a.M.A.S and stuff,
so I had the guy sign that.

339
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:27,439
"I am refusing treatment

340
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,941
Against medical advice."

341
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:33,845
This-- this is a joke, right?

342
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:37,248
<i>It's a little makeshift,
but I think it'll work. I mean you.</i>

343
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:39,868
You're a joke. You don't
know anything about me.

344
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:42,087
Oh, I did my homework on you, plastics.

345
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:44,205
You drank your way through medical school,

346
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:46,324
Barely made it through residency, but, hey,

347
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:49,394
It's no big deal. I mean,
you were never really trying

348
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,362
To be the best doctor, right?

349
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:54,666
Just good enough so you could
do surgery in a strip mall.

350
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,635
I mean, that's the real tragedy here,
man. You're not stupid.

351
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:00,572
You're lazy. What was I
supposed to do, force--

352
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,841
You are supposed to be a doctor!

353
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:05,877
First light, you will haul
your ass back up there,

354
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:09,681
And you will treat those people,
every last one of 'em,

355
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:12,984
Or don't bother coming back.

356
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:24,997
It's 3:00 a.M.

357
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,066
how is it this hot out,

358
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,035
And it's 3:00 a.M.?

359
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:30,536
Hi.

360
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:33,038
Oh.

361
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,540
Oh, god.

362
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,975
Right?

363
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:38,845
They've got a cage match going out there--

364
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:42,314
Scorpion versus tarantula.
I just lost 50 pesos.

365
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:46,752
What are you doing?

366
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:48,905
Oh, my god. I just had an orgasm.

367
00:20:48,906 --> 00:20:50,823
See? It's not that bad.

368
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:52,825
Ohh. We have a fan.

369
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:55,862
I got to save a guy's
life on a zip line today.

370
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:58,497
You-- you got to save a guy's life...

371
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:00,199
you...

372
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,834
You win.

373
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:06,005
You know, on the web site for this place,

374
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:09,041
They promised us a perfect beach.
Oh, there's a beach.

375
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,410
You just have to kill yourself to get to it.

376
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,413
I wanna live, but I want the beach.

377
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:18,084
I can't go anyway. I gotta go check
on my patient. Yeah, at least
you have a patient to check on.

378
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:21,787
I handed out band-aids today,
like a school nurse.

379
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:24,257
I traveled 5,000 miles, and for what?

380
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:27,276
They know everything about us.
What's he talking about?

381
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:29,729
They did their homework on us.

382
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,431
Whatever.

383
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:34,400
So much for a clean slate.

384
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,903
Just follow the fan.

385
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:49,014
♪

386
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,389
You must think I'm a real nut job.

387
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,357
I lose someone I love

388
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,760
And hop on a plane to the jungle.

389
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:03,362
Not at all.

390
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,299
I didn't come for a vacation.

391
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,968
My wife cora--

392
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:10,987
I brought her with me.

393
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:13,072
I'm sorry?

394
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:15,341
She's in my duffel.

395
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:17,777
Her ashes.

396
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,178
Got it.

397
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,048
Figured I'd take her to the
place she loved the most.

398
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:26,786
You heard of lago de luz?

399
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:28,521
No.

400
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:31,657
Cora called it the firefly lake.

401
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:36,379
At night, the algae lights up.

402
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,397
It looks like millions of fireflies

403
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,001
Trapped just underneath the water,

404
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:44,136
Flapping their wings,

405
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:46,906
Trying to break free.

406
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,109
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

407
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,179
It's beautiful.

408
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,681
And that's where you're gonna say good-bye?

409
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:58,884
That was the plan.

410
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,889
Life sure has a way

411
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,226
Of changing your plans, though.

412
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,796
Yeah.

413
00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:13,032
It does.

414
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:41,160
Ed?

415
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:43,379
Ed?

416
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:01,881
So what's your plan?

417
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:04,450
My plan is to express the dangers

418
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:05,968
Of refusing treatment.

419
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:07,353
Hmm.

420
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:10,389
And how is that any different
from what you did yesterday?

421
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,892
Well, this time I'm gonna turn on the charm.

422
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:14,977
So what's your plan for tomorrow?

423
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:17,530
You're a little bully, you know that?

424
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:25,237
I'm cutting through the peritoneum.

425
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,328
Man, it is ugly in there.

426
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,082
Yeah, it looks like more
than just the spleen.

427
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,984
Oh, we've got multiple trauma sites--

428
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:41,804
Liver, mesenteric artery, hepatic vein.

429
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:43,789
It's way worse than I thought.

430
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,926
he's bleeding out. Get a vascular clamp

431
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:49,512
On the spleen. Oh, we don't have enough
ab-neg to handle this much blood loss.

432
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:51,847
Okay, switch to o-neg. Only one unit left.

433
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:54,683
what? We never have
enough of the rare types.

434
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:56,702
we don't have enough blood?

435
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,138
Okay, pour in the fluids.
Mobilize the spleen.

436
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:02,624
Tie off the liver. You, come with me.

437
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:13,252
Oh, for the love of god.

438
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:18,257
You're back? I told you, it's a virus.
I can't do anything.

439
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:22,962
Oh.

440
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:30,269
Crap. She's not breathing.
Get me epinephrine.

441
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:43,276
You're gonna put coconut in his veins?!

442
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:46,329
The water from green coconuts
has the same electrolyte balance

443
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,780
As blood plasma.

444
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,800
They used in world war ii
when they ran out of fluids.

445
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,453
But there's gotta be another
way to get him stable.

446
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:57,340
I mean, this is-- yeah, we could go
door-to-door asking for blood donations,

447
00:25:57,341 --> 00:26:00,309
But that could take a while. Don't worry.

448
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,312
I've done this more times than any other guy
down here. Oh, you have? How many times?

449
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,881
Once. Great.

450
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,257
okay.

451
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:17,093
Now when I cut, you catch.

452
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:19,061
I hope you played little league.

453
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:20,930
What? No. I- I never played anything.

454
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:24,200
I was on the debate team. Okay.
Are you ready? You can't miss.

455
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:27,703
I know. If it breaks, it's unsterile.
No, if it hits you

456
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:30,740
On the head from up here,
you're pretty much dead. Right.

457
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:32,041
On one...

458
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,243
Two...

459
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,462
Three!

460
00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:38,581
oh, my god! I did it.

461
00:26:38,582 --> 00:26:41,834
All right. Let's go for another.

462
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:44,754
Come on. Breathe!

463
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:47,790
<i>Es lo Ãºnico que tenemos.
Es una dosis bien--</i>

464
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:51,527
I have no idea what you're saying.
Just give it to me.

465
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:57,233
come on, lady! Breathe!

466
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:59,268
Breathe already!

467
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:02,939
Breathe. Ohh. Oh.

468
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:14,517
scalpel.

469
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:17,453
He's bleeding out.

470
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:20,673
Okay. Open the net.

471
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:22,258
Okay. Needle.

472
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,798
Okay. Tubing.

473
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,351
Hang it.

474
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,910
<i>no quiero mÃ¡s medicinas y mÃ¡s inventos</i>

475
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,745
<i>Que no funcionan. </i>

476
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:46,115
Fever's spiking. Okay,
tell him she doesn't have much time.

477
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:48,517
<i>A couple days at most. A su hija
no le queda mucho tiempo.</i>

478
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:51,320
<i>No quiero mÃ¡s medicinas, dije. He says no.</i>

479
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,790
<i>And him? Tell him I can barely feel his
son's pulse anymore. Dije que no mÃ¡s!</i>

480
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,792
Stop saying no, damn it!

481
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,401
I get it, okay?

482
00:28:05,402 --> 00:28:08,404
I don't speak the language.
I'm just a dumb american.

483
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:11,474
I- if you came to chicago
and barged into my place,

484
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:13,542
I would call the cops on you.

485
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:16,812
I don't get to come in here
and tell you how to take care

486
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:19,282
Of your family,
all right? You're a proud man.

487
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,817
I- I respect that. I'm a proud man, too.

488
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:25,288
I don't listen to anyone.
My parents told me to go

489
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:28,257
To college and study hard,
and I just partied. They told me,

490
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:31,694
"go to med school.
Learn how to take care of people."

491
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:35,031
And I learned how to put
boobs in-into strippers.

492
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:37,950
They told me, you know,
"stop screwing around. Be a man.

493
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:40,970
Be someone-- a son that we can be proud of."

494
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,923
And I tell them to get out of my life.
I-I can't go home now.

495
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:47,176
It's been a year, and I can't go home.

496
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:52,081
I lost my family,

497
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:55,351
Because I was proud.

498
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:58,587
I don't want you to do the same thing.

499
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:03,692
Come on, man. Let me help you.

500
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:11,534
<i>Es un buen doctor.</i>

501
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:14,303
<i>Puede ayudar a su familia.</i>

502
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:27,249
I'm just talking to myself now.

503
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,015
<i>EstÃ¡bien.</i>

504
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:45,801
<i>EstÃ¡bien.</i>

505
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:47,436
<i>Por favor.</i>

506
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:49,905
<i>AyÃºdelos.</i>

507
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:52,141
He says okay.

508
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:55,077
He wants to shake your hand.

509
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,151
<i>AyÃºdela mi familia,</i>

510
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:04,753
<i>Por favor.</i>

511
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:37,653
Spleen's out.

512
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:39,521
Sponge stick.

513
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:41,490
Lily, give me a hand.

514
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:44,493
I want you to hold this
bleeder while I tie it off.

515
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:46,412
I'm not a surgeon.

516
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,464
<i>Here, you are a surgeon.</i>

517
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:50,499
Here, you're a surgeon. You're a paramedic.

518
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,967
You're search and rescue.

519
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:55,337
If I need you to run labs to the city,
you're the mailman.

520
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:57,973
You're anything I need you to be.

521
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:00,926
Now don't pinch off the vessel.
Just keep steady. Squeeze.

522
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,679
I got it. B.P.'s coming up.

523
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,482
Nice work, dr. Brenner.

524
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:13,522
You'll never believe

525
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:15,224
What we just did.

526
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,326
A coconut transfusion!

527
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:18,828
And-- and actually,

528
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:21,580
It saved the guy's life.

529
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:24,233
that's great. Very happy for you.

530
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:25,835
Are you okay?

531
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:28,270
If I could find a damn steroid.

532
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:32,091
All they have is, uh,
ecuadorean tree sap, so...

533
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:35,377
Oh!

534
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:44,436
I was looking for rare,
complicated diseases,

535
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:47,890
And I almost lost a woman to asthma.

536
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:49,992
They say when you hear hoofbeats,

537
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,827
You gotta think horses,

538
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,929
Not zebras.

539
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,233
Really? it's that simple?

540
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:59,468
God, you really are a girl scout.

541
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:01,937
Look, I'm trying to be your friend here,

542
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:04,706
But you're making it really hard.

543
00:32:07,077 --> 00:32:10,446
At my hospital...

544
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,948
They liked to, uh, weed out the weak.

545
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:15,885
You had to fight to get on cases.

546
00:32:15,886 --> 00:32:19,338
Made it pretty much
impossible to learn anything,

547
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:23,292
So I started moonlighting at county,
picking up shifts.

548
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:26,662
I was doing 8 hours at county
and 12 hours in my residency,

549
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:30,165
And 1 day after 72 hours without sleep,

550
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,735
This kid came into the-- into the e.R.

551
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:34,537
With a fever,

552
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:37,072
And I thought it was the flu.

553
00:32:37,073 --> 00:32:40,109
I mean, 20 kids a day came into that e.R.

554
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,144
It was always the flu.

555
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:45,648
So I sent him home...

556
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:49,151
And he died...

557
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,755
Three hours later.

558
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:55,291
I got kicked right out of residency.

559
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,059
The...

560
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,762
It was bacterial meningitis.

561
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,468
All it would've taken was, uh, a spinal tap,

562
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:08,404
But...

563
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:12,157
I was too exhausted to do it.

564
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:17,512
<i>So sometimes it is zebras.</i>

565
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:31,994
You have untreated asthma.

566
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:33,913
You had a severe attack.

567
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,765
I didn't-- I didn't see it before,
because I...

568
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,034
I didn't see it.

569
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:41,170
This is an inhaler.

570
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:43,606
It'll help you breathe.

571
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,375
I only have a few,

572
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:49,395
Because I brought them from home.

573
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:53,882
See?

574
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:07,413
Uh...

575
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,900
It's no big deal.

576
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,538
It's...

577
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:19,508
status-- post-splenectomy
and liver laceration repair.

578
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:22,544
Bled down to a crit of 22.
he needs 5 liters of o2

579
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:24,913
And two more units of blood when you land.

580
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:27,516
Dr. Brenner. They're taking
you to a city hospital now.

581
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,468
You're gonna be fine. The fireflies.

582
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:32,688
He's been talking about the damn fireflies

583
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:35,307
Since he came out of surgery. Can't leave.
I-- the fireflies. I promised her.

584
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:38,861
<i>Okay. RÃ¡pido, vÃ¡monos. No, no. Wait! Wait.
They can't take him away yet.</i>

585
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:41,563
There's something he's
gotta do before he leave.

586
00:34:41,564 --> 00:34:45,000
What are you talking about? The-- the lake.
The one with, um, the algae that lights up.

587
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:48,303
Lago de luz. We have to take
him there. He needs to go.

588
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:51,440
It's a half-hour by boat.
Medevac's gotta get back to the hospital.

589
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:54,109
<i>Well, they'll wait for us, right? Por favor.</i>

590
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,279
There's no time for sightseeing right now.
Come on, fellas. It's not about that!

591
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,382
It's-- he has his wife's ashes.
He came all the way--

592
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:03,218
<i>Listen, brenner,
we can't-- you listen to me!</i>

593
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:06,305
He came down here to do one thing,

594
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:08,691
To say good-bye, and he got so close.

595
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,593
We can help him finish
what he came here to do.

596
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:14,129
we can help him say good-bye.

597
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,366
He needs to say good-bye.

598
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,735
we saved his life today,

599
00:35:19,736 --> 00:35:23,505
And now we can give him a
chance to move on with it.

600
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,465
What if we had been lost in the
jungle for, like, 20 years?

601
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,017
No. But it's just you and me, naked,

602
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:38,287
Braiding each other's hair,
'cause it'd be long.

603
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:40,306
No.

604
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:43,809
Okay, but I'm super buff now
from hunting and gathering,

605
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,228
And there's no other dudes on earth,

606
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:49,431
And it's up to you and me to
carry on the human race. No.

607
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:51,450
Well...

608
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,436
You're not a humanitarian.

609
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:08,817
Are you the one that treated my grandmother?

610
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:12,555
I'm sorry that she had to almost die

611
00:36:12,556 --> 00:36:14,690
To get my attention.

612
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:16,692
My grandmother is 80 years old,

613
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:20,095
And today she took her first real breath.

614
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,364
She said that because of you,

615
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:25,367
She finally knows what
it feels like to breathe.

616
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:35,027
ohh.

617
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,112
no, no, no, no.

618
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:39,532
No, no. Don't. No. So kind. So kind.

619
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,516
so un-- not necessary.

620
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:43,018
<i>Gracias, doctora.</i>

621
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:44,537
okay.

622
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,038
Mm.

623
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,575
Mm. Mm. Mm.

624
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:51,794
Well, thank you.

625
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,035
well, this is it--

626
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:03,805
Lago de luz.

627
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,842
It's just a pond.

628
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:21,356
A microscopic organism.

629
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:22,824
When it's disturbed,

630
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,893
The chemical reaction causes the phosph--

631
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,128
Fireflies.

632
00:37:29,098 --> 00:37:31,700
Ed.

633
