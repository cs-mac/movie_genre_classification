1
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:31,540
He's in a meeting, Madam Secretary.

2
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,758
If you could just wait...

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,003
I'll let him know you're here.

4
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:35,171
We need to talk.

5
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:36,139
In private.

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,107
Now!

7
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,375
All right, we'll pick this up later.

8
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:44,814
What the hell are you doing?

9
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:47,517
My sentiments exactly.

10
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:49,118
The NSA reactivated Henry.

11
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,286
That's hardly my concern.

12
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:51,521
I know that you know.

13
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:53,790
The directive came from this office.

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,726
Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't
be bringing this to you.

15
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:57,927
I'm the Secretary of State.

16
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:00,029
How long did you think you
could keep this from me?

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,030
You didn't need to know.

18
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:02,265
Says who?

19
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,332
The president.

20
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,067
POTUS signed off on this?

21
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:07,203
Henry said you'd be okay with this.

22
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:09,372
My husband is a public figure.

23
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:12,308
Yes, I heard about the
Arm Candy Top Ten list.

24
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,676
It's impressive.

25
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:15,077
I'm sorry they slighted you, Russell.

26
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:16,078
But here's the problem.

27
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,747
If it leaks...

28
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:20,483
there isn't a diplomat in
the world who will trust me.

29
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,885
I raised the same point with the president.

30
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:24,253
- And?
- What do you want me to say?

31
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:26,688
He decided it was worth the risk.

32
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,692
If it's any consolation,

33
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,294
we're expecting it to be a short-term op.

34
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:34,729
Just... one and done.

35
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:37,567
If I'm not mistaken, you have

36
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:41,404
an appointment with the, uh,
Prime Minister of Macedonia?

37
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,772
Moldova.

38
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:46,775
This isn't finished.

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,586
Klaus?

40
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:58,754
Is that you?

41
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:00,156
McCord.

42
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:02,124
It's been far too long.

43
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,894
It has. What, it's been...
what, since, uh, Jerusalem.

44
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:08,064
Yes, I was literally
on the road to Damascus,

45
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:10,499
and you, uh, presented a very fine paper

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,968
on the Council of Lyon.

47
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,369
Oh, you're too kind. Thank you.

48
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,971
I heard you took an appointment at GW.

49
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:16,105
Yes.

50
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,707
I heard that your wife

51
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,876
took an appointment as Secretary of State.

52
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:20,977
Yes, she did.

53
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:22,411
It's a big change.

54
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:23,713
I'm sure she's thriving.

55
00:02:23,714 --> 00:02:24,947
Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:26,849
You know what I remember

57
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,051
is that chess set that you bought

58
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:31,721
in Jerusalem in the souk in the old city?

59
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,256
Yes, the-the-the Nishapur set.

60
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:35,925
Yes! It was so beautiful.

61
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:36,964
Tell me something.

62
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:38,761
Do you still have my first edition copy

63
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:40,696
of The Book on Adler?

64
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:42,365
Uh... I'm not sure.

65
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,466
Uh, well, listen...

66
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,467
if you can't find it,

67
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:46,335
you at least owe me a game of chess.

68
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:48,838
Care for an appetizer?

69
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:49,872
Okay.

70
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:51,140
Frankly, I'm surprised to see you

71
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:53,576
at an-an archaeology event.

72
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:54,977
I thought you were much more at home

73
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,479
in the realm of, uh, pure theology.

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,414
It's for a book I'm writing on St. Francis.

75
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,482
It's, uh, giving me a deeper context.

76
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,085
If you'll excuse me, Henry,

77
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,621
but I have to speak with the dean.

78
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:08,791
Au revoir!

79
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,226
Auf wiedersehen.

80
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,200
Blake, have you seen Daisy's ring?

81
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,669
Ooh, yes, and judging by the size,

82
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,937
so did a few astronauts.

83
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,371
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

84
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:23,973
All right, Daisy, let me see.

85
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:25,274
Wow!

86
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:28,311
That is some serious carbon!

87
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:29,312
Congratulations, really.

88
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:31,213
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

89
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:32,281
Prime Minister Diacov ready?

90
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:34,083
- In the conference room.
- Okay.

91
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:36,619
Here's the latest digest on Moldova.

92
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,787
The separatists have launched

93
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,355
a new offensive against Diacov

94
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:40,623
and his government.

95
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:42,658
Another day, another democracy in peril.

96
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,160
What's the situation on the ground?

97
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,227
Not good.

98
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:47,029
The separatist leader, General Kolba,

99
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,731
is particularly ruthless.

100
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,547
He's the one with the
tweets, if you'll remember...

101
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:51,267
I'm aware.

102
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:52,535
He's also the one killing

103
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,971
innocent Moldovians in the name of...

104
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,639
restoring the Russian Empire.

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,740
- Oh...
- That, too.

106
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,308
Listen, is our other guest ready?

107
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:00,543
What other guest?

108
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,112
Good man.

109
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,014
My people have fought like heroes,

110
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,216
Madam Secretary, but...

111
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,752
Kolba's men have the latest equipment

112
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,454
from Moscow, including

113
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,990
MI-24 attack helicopters.

114
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:16,959
We need American support
to level the playing field.

115
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,563
We believe in the rule of law, Mr. Diacov.

116
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:23,265
That's why we oppose any act of aggression

117
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:25,167
against a legitimate government.

118
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:27,403
That is very kind, Madam Secretary.

119
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:31,073
But when I say "support," I mean weapons.

120
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:32,241
We're working on that.

121
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:34,477
The Foreign Relations
Committee meets next week.

122
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,713
Forgive me, but I have
no faith in committees.

123
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:39,782
One of the many reasons I fought to free

124
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,451
my country from the Soviet Union.

125
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,520
I understand your frustration there.

126
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,621
But these things do take time.

127
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:50,459
That's why I'd like
for you to meet someone.

128
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,393
This is Jim.

129
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:55,464
- He's an old colleague of mine.
- Prime Minister.

130
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:56,832
How do you do?

131
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,300
You are CIA?

132
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,136
Not anymore. The secretary saw fit

133
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,170
to bring me over to State.

134
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,571
We ran a number

135
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:03,939
of operations together.

136
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,641
Including carpools.

137
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:07,476
Plenty of those.

138
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,079
Jim specializes in
counterinsurgency tactics.

139
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,881
He's gonna help you build

140
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:14,817
- a strategy to contain Kolba.
- And you can start

141
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:17,258
by securing your own government
against enemy subversion.

142
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,256
With your permission, I'd like to
send him back to Moldova with you.

143
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:21,957
Is that wise?

144
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,726
Kolba has spies everywhere.

145
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,928
If your man is discovered,
he may be in danger.

146
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:28,597
I assure you no one will
know my real identity.

147
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:29,799
Not even your own staff.

148
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,967
_

149
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,296
_

150
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,406
I forgot to mention

151
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,632
Jim's also an ethnic Moldovan.

152
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:44,113
So, what do you say, Prime Minister?

153
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:46,148
I say...

154
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,516
welcome aboard.

155
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:18,212
Shirt, please.

156
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:26,054
I think you should buy me dinner first.

157
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,959
You must get that all the time.

158
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,559
Yup.

159
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:34,663
Have you worn a wire before?

160
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:35,765
First time.

161
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,686
I thought you were gonna
tape something to my chest.

162
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,969
We haven't done that since the '80s.

163
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,137
It's wet.

164
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:44,240
I was sweating.

165
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,973
Shouldn't be a problem.

166
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,378
We'll be in touch.

167
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:54,316
And finally, I want to give a shout out

168
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,152
to Sergei Kolba.

169
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:59,054
This rouge general, double thumbs-up guy

170
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:00,789
and prostitute employer

171
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,825
took a break from his military campaign

172
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:05,361
to tweet about how much
he lusts after the legs

173
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:06,595
of Secretary of State

174
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:08,664
Elizabeth McCord. What was the occasion?

175
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:11,433
Well, apparently Secretary
McCord recently visited

176
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,602
Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Diacov

177
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:16,405
and separatist leader Kolba got jealous.

178
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:19,341
So, he retaliated the way
all visionary leaders do.

179
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:21,710
By throwing a sexist
tantrum on the Internet.

180
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:24,109
- I like your walking sticks, lady...
- Hi, baby.

181
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,549
Off, please?

182
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,683
I'm making stir-fry.

183
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:29,652
It's oily vegetables.

184
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:31,620
Meatless Mondays. I'm giving it a try.

185
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:32,688
Well, good.

186
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:33,903
Whoo...

187
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:36,544
We ordered a double sausage
pizza, if you want to wait.

188
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:38,994
Yes, please.

189
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,930
Hi.

190
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:42,097
How was your day?

191
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:43,933
Oh, you know,

192
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:46,569
just shaping the minds
of tomorrow's leaders.

193
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:48,904
Are you wearing cologne?

194
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:49,972
No.

195
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,240
What's her name?

196
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,208
Mom...!

197
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,742
Madison.

198
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:55,811
He's going to ask her to
go to the mall with him.

199
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,379
You hate shopping.

200
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,747
The National Mall.

201
00:07:58,748 --> 00:07:59,815
There's a concert.

202
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,250
You hate concerts.

203
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,785
Yeah, but I like her.

204
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,253
Does she like you back?

205
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:05,354
I-I don't, I don't know.

206
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:07,089
I think so.

207
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,824
You don't sound very confident.

208
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:11,327
Okay, well, personally, I
didn't think I'd have a shot

209
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:14,163
at anyone above, like, a
six, but all my friends think

210
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:16,832
she's at least a seven and a half.

211
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,634
We're using numerals? Really?

212
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:20,202
- What? They're efficient.
- Oh.

213
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:23,739
Well, then you might want
to ease up on the scent.

214
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,474
It's up at about 11.

215
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:29,044
- What did I tell you?
- You told me nothing.

216
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,479
You hit that so hard.

217
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,414
You stink.

218
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:33,649
You know what?

219
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,884
I don't think I like this Madison girl.

220
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,220
What? Come on, you don't
know anything about her.

221
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:41,357
I... I know that he thinks
that she's out of his league,

222
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,942
which means she's probably aloof.

223
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:46,553
A little dismissive. She's
probably just leading him on,

224
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,168
- you know, just or the atten...
- Oh, come on.

225
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,567
Oh, you know what, she is
gonna crush him like a bug.

226
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,736
Hey, stop. He can handle himself.

227
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:55,771
I think maybe I should just go talk to him.

228
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,773
Oh, no, I don't think
so. When I was his age,

229
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:00,509
I would rather die than get
romantic advice from my mother.

230
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,910
Okay, I get it.

231
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,378
I get it. I get that.

232
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,483
So...

233
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:11,987
other than shaping the minds
of tomorrow's "leaders"...

234
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,555
what really happened today?

235
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,658
I can't talk about it.

236
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:20,629
Oh.

237
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,697
Really?

238
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,304
Really.

239
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:31,206
How about you?

240
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:34,308
Same.

241
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:42,217
Can I say I'll be glad when this is over?

242
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:43,285
You can.

243
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:48,057
Sometimes I just, I miss being a professor.

244
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:50,559
You know, my biggest worry
was whether or not a...

245
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,528
a student was cutting seminar.

246
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:56,131
And now I spend my days doing
things I can't discuss with you

247
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:59,168
and... and most nights sitting up wondering

248
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,602
whether or not my predecessor,

249
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:01,904
Vincent Marsh, was killed.

250
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,373
Are you gonna bring that
up at the spy reunion?

251
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,141
I haven't really decided.
I mean, those dinners

252
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,876
are supposed to be light and fun.

253
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:11,279
Murder and conspiracy are
anything but light and fun.

254
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,849
Hey... um...

255
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,884
are you tired?

256
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:16,852
Yes.

257
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:18,187
- You are?
- No.

258
00:10:18,188 --> 00:10:19,455
No, I'm not. Why?

259
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:21,857
- Got any ideas?
- Yeah, I'm working on a few.

260
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,192
- Are you?
- Yeah.

261
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:25,593
Hey.

262
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:29,465
- Matt.
- Huh?

263
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:31,367
"Marine hypoxia

264
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:33,168
is a whale of a problem"?

265
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,870
It's just a little leavening.

266
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,972
Uh, fish are dying, it's
a depressing subject.

267
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:40,209
Uh, "It's maritime to see change"?

268
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,978
Uh... "we can't flounder on this issue..."

269
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:43,979
I'll fix it.

270
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,114
Madam Secretary,

271
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:46,215
I want to talk about Kolba.

272
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:47,985
Oh, here we go. What about him?

273
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,648
Daisy wants to release a statement

274
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,819
condemning the general.

275
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,921
Well, he said vile,
despicable things about you.

276
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,124
He's hardly the first.

277
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,725
No, but he's by far the worst.

278
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:57,760
A sample of his tweets.

279
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:59,094
"She calls me a criminal,

280
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,363
"but it's a crime to
hide those gorgeous legs.

281
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,566
#WearAMiniskirt."

282
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,913
"She's a soft woman who
loves hard positions."

283
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:09,171
"I have better ideas of how she
could interfere in my affairs."

284
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:11,740
Okay, look, you can't
engage with a guy like Kolba.

285
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:13,512
It's like throwing water on a gremlin.

286
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,333
But our silence looks like weakness.

287
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,912
We can't let him control the narrative.

288
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:17,980
I agree with Matt.

289
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,582
If I engage with Kolba, the narrative

290
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,551
is that a man accused of war crimes

291
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:24,787
forced the secretary of state
to treat him as an equal.

292
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:27,688
Keep him in the doghouse;
it's where he belongs.

293
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:33,896
Thanks for that.

294
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,664
You're welcome.

295
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:41,403
Vlad Diacov's flight went off
radar over Moldovan airspace.

296
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:42,372
What do you mean?

297
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:45,066
The prime minister's plane has disappeared.

298
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,592
Jim is missing and feared dead

299
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:49,959
along with everyone else on board.

300
00:11:53,019 --> 00:12:00,007
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

301
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:09,916
Our working theory is
the plane was shot down.

302
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,385
Do we have any evidence?

303
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:13,920
Not yet, but it was near
the border of rebel airspace.

304
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,956
And Kolba?

305
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:17,591
He denies all involvement.

306
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:18,625
Well, no surprise there.

307
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:19,960
I want hourly updates.

308
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:22,729
And will you get me a meeting
with the head of the NTSB?

309
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,297
Yes, ma'am. Um, and...

310
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:26,166
Jimmy Ionesco's wife is here.

311
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,833
She's in the SVTC room.

312
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:33,173
How much does she know?

313
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:35,207
Nothing.

314
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,811
All right.

315
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,818
Claire...

316
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:45,886
Just tell me.

317
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,386
I know it's not good.

318
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:51,724
Your husband went missing
in the line of duty.

319
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,762
So, he was on a mission.

320
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,466
Yes.

321
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:02,936
He told me he was at a
training session in Dallas.

322
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:05,005
I had a feeling he was lying,

323
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:07,441
but I thought all this
covert stuff was over

324
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,541
when he came to the State Department.

325
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,846
What else do you know?

326
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:16,049
I can tell you that the
mission is top secret

327
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,484
and of great importance.

328
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,885
It always is.

329
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,393
We're doing everything we can to find him.

330
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:27,894
Until then, I'm going to ask you

331
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:30,197
to keep this information confidential.

332
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:33,098
Yeah, I know; I know the drill.

333
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:36,136
Can I stay here until
you have more information?

334
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:38,472
Claire, I don't know
how long it's gonna be.

335
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:40,606
I don't care.

336
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,743
All right.

337
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:46,512
If you need anything, you just ask.

338
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,482
I need my husband back.

339
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:42,736
You're late.

340
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:45,272
All this cloak-and-dagger
stuff takes time.

341
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:48,275
You're the one who
refuses to meet in public.

342
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,143
That's because the last
time we met in public,

343
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:52,445
my 20-year-old daughter decided
we were having an affair.

344
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,581
That was regrettable.

345
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,483
What's more regrettable is

346
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,718
that you failed at your primary objective.

347
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,717
You didn't secure an
invitation to his house.

348
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:01,514
Couldn't push it.

349
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:03,390
He was already suspicious that I was there.

350
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,791
You let him end the conversation.

351
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,893
I took it as far as I
could. It's my call, right?

352
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:09,930
I appreciate your caution,
but this really can't wait.

353
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:14,501
That's Klaus in Aleppo,
August of this year.

354
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:16,136
The man he's with...

355
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:17,870
Abu Khinjar.

356
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:22,175
Butcher of the Euphrates.

357
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:25,545
He's personally executed over
a dozen American citizens.

358
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:26,880
Yes.

359
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:28,764
Klaus has been laundering Khinjar's money

360
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:30,565
through his conservancy for years.

361
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,210
But now that he's in the United States,

362
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,853
we think his focus may be shifting.

363
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:36,756
He's planning an attack?

364
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:37,824
When the Syrians agreed

365
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:39,659
to destroy their chemical weapons program,

366
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,728
some of that stockpile went missing.

367
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:45,599
Specifically, several
canisters of sarin gas.

368
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,400
And you think he brought it here.

369
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:48,902
His code name came up in chatter,

370
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,704
but the details are sketchy.

371
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:53,073
It's crucial to get ears
inside his residence.

372
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:57,010
The good news is... you confirmed
that he still has the chess set.

373
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:58,945
We made an exact copy based on the photos

374
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,947
you took for us in Jerusalem.

375
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:03,348
Does this look right?

376
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,355
I think so.

377
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:09,522
Good.

378
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:11,391
Let's hope you get a chance to use it.

379
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:14,860
Thousands of lives could be at stake.

380
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:18,498
The gaggle wants a statement on the plane.

381
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,532
Hold them off.

382
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:20,778
I can't. It's not every day

383
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,902
that a head of state goes
missing; they want answers.

384
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:25,071
Fine, Matt can draft something,

385
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:25,952
but be careful.

386
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:28,074
Jim's presence on the
plane is still classified.

387
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:29,776
So you want us to downplay our reaction.

388
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,978
Exactly, but not too much.

389
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,681
So we need to express concern
without seeming too concerned.

390
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:35,649
Exactly.

391
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,175
Have we ruled anything out?

392
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,052
It was obviously a missile strike.

393
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,124
What else could it be?

394
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,655
A fire could have knocked
out the electronics,

395
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:43,162
that would explain the
transponders turning off.

396
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:44,324
The MH370 theory?

397
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:47,060
- I don't buy it.
- Sometimes things just go wrong.

398
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:48,628
Doesn't mean that it's anyone's fault.

399
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,197
It's always somebody's fault.
Somewhere along the line,

400
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,833
a person makes a really bad decision.

401
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,703
I'm sorry, are we still
talking about the plane?

402
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:59,739
- Yes, we're talking about the plane.
- Enough. Please.

403
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,532
The secretary is in there right now

404
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,376
with the chairman of the NTSB,

405
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,306
so we'll probably know something soon.

406
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:06,014
Until then,

407
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,315
I'd like you all to quit speculating

408
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,315
and do your jobs.

409
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:16,356
It wasn't shot down.

410
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:19,025
NATO analysis is confirming
there were no missile launches

411
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:21,194
in the vicinity of Diacov's plane.

412
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,629
What about a midair bombing?

413
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,322
No, the baggage was screened at Andrews.

414
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:25,693
And there's no sign of wreckage.

415
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:26,766
Not yet.

416
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,836
The last transponder ping was
over extremely rugged terrain,

417
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:32,864
so it could be a while
before we spot something.

418
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,296
All right, let's get more
surveillance drones in the area.

419
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:37,110
I want to close this
grid as fast as possible.

420
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:40,580
Yes, Madam Secretary.

421
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,048
Mr. Chairman, before you go...

422
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,084
I saw the report on

423
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,086
Secretary Marsh's plane crash.

424
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:48,221
- You ruled it an accident.
- That's right.

425
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,690
The aircraft suffered
a catastrophic failure

426
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,659
of a screw, uh, controlling the rudder.

427
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,827
We call that an FSCAP...

428
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:55,862
Flight safety critical
aircraft part... I know.

429
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,630
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,432
The pilot had no chance to recover.

431
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:02,235
Was the ground crew ever polygraphed?

432
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:04,838
I'm sorry, what are you suggesting?

433
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,506
Just answer the question.

434
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:08,508
No, Madam Secretary.

435
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:09,876
That isn't protocol.

436
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:12,344
Great. Thank you.

437
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:29,829
They said I could find you here.

438
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,897
Klaus.

439
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:33,166
What brings you to my neck of the woods?

440
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:36,469
I regret to say that I could
not find your Kierkegaard,

441
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,373
so I thought that you might
accept this manuscript instead.

442
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:44,210
Ibn Sina... Avicenna,
as the Latins called him.

443
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:47,447
I love his thought
experiment "Floating Man."

444
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:49,249
Centuries ahead of Descartes.

445
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,750
Indeed.

446
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,852
I received your e-mail. I'm sorry to say

447
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:54,754
I cannot come to lunch.

448
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:56,956
Um, however, I'm having

449
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:59,025
a little gathering tonight

450
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:00,727
at my home. If you are not

451
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:03,363
otherwise engaged, perhaps
you would like to attend?

452
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,231
I would be honored.

453
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,799
Excellent.

454
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,228
How does a plane that size just disappear?

455
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:21,553
I don't know, but we're
clutching at straws here.

456
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:23,615
We could expand the search area.

457
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:26,017
Oh, that could take weeks.

458
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:30,322
Diacov said that Kolba's
got spies everywhere.

459
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,424
We need to reach out to the Moldovans,

460
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:34,860
take a hard look at
everyone who was onboard.

461
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:36,595
You really think it was an inside job?

462
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:40,131
I at least think we need to rule it out.

463
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,207
You guys shouldn't have waited.

464
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,708
We aren't hungry.

465
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:51,076
Not anymore.

466
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:52,244
You dropped a bombshell.

467
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:53,345
Yeah, I know.

468
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,280
But it's been weighing on me.

469
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,816
I think I was right to tell you.

470
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,918
Secretary Marsh was murdered.

471
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,417
I'm sorry, do you have any
idea how crazy that sounds?

472
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,289
Isabelle, I know exactly how it sounds.

473
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,799
But I think George was telling the truth

474
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,228
George was unhinged.

475
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:12,297
- He was acting out at Langley, having...
- He was struggling, Bess.

476
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,765
- Yeah, he never...
- We all saw that.

477
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:16,335
- He never adjusted to life as an analyst.
- I know.

478
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:19,371
But George's car accident doesn't add up.

479
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:21,940
George was meticulous.
He planned everything.

480
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:24,343
Do you really think that
he would kill himself

481
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:27,379
by spontaneously driving
into a telephone pole?

482
00:20:33,218 --> 00:20:34,686
I agree.

483
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,855
What? You do?

484
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,257
It never made sense,

485
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:41,271
- the way George died.
- Where's the evidence?

486
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,607
I don't know. That's why
I'm asking for your help.

487
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,374
Why didn't you go straight to Munsey?

488
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,477
Because George said Marsh's plane crash

489
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:50,180
was arranged by someone inside the company.

490
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:52,883
For all I know, it could be him.

491
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,551
So you told us instead.

492
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:57,254
You're the only ones I can trust.

493
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,324
There are only two outcomes here.

494
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,459
Either we're crazy conspiracy theorists,

495
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,195
or you're right and you
just put our lives in danger.

496
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:06,263
- It's okay.
- No,

497
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,698
it's really not. She has no idea _

498
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,899
what she's getting us into.

499
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,667
I gotta go.

500
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:12,169
I know it's a lot to ask.

501
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,171
If you're not interested,

502
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,907
this conversation never took place.

503
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,824
Your friend speaks like
a native, did you know?

504
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,207
I had a feeling.

505
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,527
Benefits of childhood in Tunis.

506
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:40,564
My parents were diplomats...

507
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,766
but Henry knows all about
living with diplomats.

508
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:43,867
Don't you?

509
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:44,906
All too well.

510
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:46,734
I admire your wife, Dr. McCord.

511
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:47,671
She speaks Arabic, too.

512
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,139
Has she taught you anything?

513
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,173
Just the curse words.

514
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,076
Klaus, can you point
me towards the restroom?

515
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,978
End of hallway, straight ahead.

516
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,579
Excuse me.

517
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:49,399
It's too heavy, he'll notice.

518
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,401
Does it look identical?

519
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:52,736
Yes.

520
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,838
Your call.

521
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:02,945
Hey.

522
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:07,517
I saw it when I was walking by, and...

523
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:08,919
I couldn't resist.

524
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,054
I don't suppose there's any way

525
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,724
that I could take this off your hands?

526
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,429
Perhaps you can play for it,

527
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,497
after the guests have gone?

528
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,303
I think we're looking at a hijacking.

529
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,862
Two months ago, the copilot of
Prime Minister Diacov's flight

530
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,363
visited the Crimea.

531
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,064
Not your typical holiday spot.

532
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:30,433
Turkish intelligence has evidence

533
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,201
that he took a meeting with General Kolba.

534
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,604
And we're just learning this now?

535
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:36,305
Our relationships with the Turks

536
00:23:36,306 --> 00:23:37,573
isn't what it used to be.

537
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:40,510
I had to practice a
little diplomacy of my own.

538
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,678
We think the copilot

539
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,913
killed the captain,
turned off the transponders

540
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,815
and then took over the plane.

541
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:46,883
That's a great theory,

542
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,052
but do you have any proof?

543
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,157
20 minutes ago, one of
our satellites found this

544
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:54,165
at an ex-Soviet air
base in rebel territory.

545
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,309
There's no doubt about it...

546
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,796
the markings are an exact match

547
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:58,806
for Diacov's plane.

548
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:59,549
Please, don't hold back on my account.

549
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,911
No, no, it's not that.

550
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:02,479
My wife expected me home an hour ago.

551
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,419
What would you say to a draw?

552
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,087
But...

553
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:11,187
...you have the advantage.

554
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,856
And you have a wicked endgame.

555
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:16,626
Honestly, I would rather save my energy

556
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,326
for the drive home.

557
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:21,497
Very well, I accept.

558
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,135
But the chess set

559
00:25:26,136 --> 00:25:27,270
belongs to you.

560
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,938
Oh, come on.

561
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:30,740
It has to be a real victory.

562
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:32,108
I insist.

563
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:34,977
Klaus, come on. Seriously.

564
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:37,013
It's a noble gesture, but I can't.

565
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:37,980
Hmm.

566
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:41,350
You Americans are a proud breed.

567
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:43,652
It's our fatal flaw.

568
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:46,122
We have confirmation.

569
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:47,415
It's the missing plane.

570
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,225
Is General Kolba at the airfield?

571
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:51,194
His base of operations is a few miles away,

572
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:52,428
but he makes regular visits.

573
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:54,397
That's a brilliant plan.

574
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:57,500
Eliminate your rival while
avoiding international scorn.

575
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:59,135
Your guy must've been
a fly in the ointment.

576
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,803
What's his cover?

577
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:02,105
He's a speechwriter,

578
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:03,306
but that's not gonna hold for long.

579
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:04,413
Kolba might already know.

580
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:05,679
But we don't know what he does know.

581
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,889
That's why we have to act fast.

582
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,678
Nadine, will you check on Claire for me?

583
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,313
What should I tell her?

584
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:12,248
As little as possible.

585
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:14,428
Shall I brief the staff?

586
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:17,253
No. I want to keep the circle tight.

587
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:19,254
Jim's life may depend on it.

588
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:28,297
Oh.

589
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:29,365
Sorry to wake you.

590
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:31,667
Is he dead?

591
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,736
Uh, well, we don't know.

592
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:36,172
We do have some more information,

593
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:38,908
but we can't verify his status yet.

594
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:40,510
Uh, I'm sorry.

595
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:43,079
I thought I'd be more prepared for this.

596
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,579
I understand.

597
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:47,850
It's one thing to believe in sacrifice;

598
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:49,851
it's another thing to live with it.

599
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:54,824
I just...

600
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:56,192
I just don't know

601
00:26:56,193 --> 00:26:57,660
how much more of this I can take.

602
00:26:57,661 --> 00:26:59,060
Oh.

603
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:04,867
You have every reason to hope.

604
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:08,371
Kolba's headquarters are a few
miles outside of the airfield,

605
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:12,008
but our HUMINT source indicates
Diacov and Jimmy Ionesco

606
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,143
are captured and being
held in the control tower

607
00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:15,678
at the north end of the base.

608
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,979
Are they still alive?

609
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,980
Unknown.

610
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:19,415
What was Kolba thinking?

611
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,617
He was thinking that he
was gonna get away with it.

612
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:22,852
He nearly did.

613
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:25,721
I assume you want to pursue some kind of...

614
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:27,824
back channel negotiation?

615
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:30,026
No. We don't have time for that.

616
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,260
I support the military option.

617
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:32,995
At this point, we still have

618
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:34,130
the element of surprise.

619
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,132
Kolba doesn't know we found the plane.

620
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:37,400
Admiral Parker?

621
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:40,069
I take your point, Madam Secretary,

622
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,137
but the situation is not optimal.

623
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:45,407
We can send a team of SEALs
in a specially equipped C-130.

624
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:47,409
If they fly low and under
the cover of darkness,

625
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,311
we can have 'em on the
ground in eight hours.

626
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:51,013
The problem is what happens next.

627
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:52,614
That control tower is heavily guarded.

628
00:27:52,615 --> 00:27:55,757
We're talking dozens of veteran
troops, gun emplacements,

629
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,890
- and the latest Russian hardware.
- What's the estimate

630
00:27:57,891 --> 00:27:58,821
on casualties?

631
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:00,890
With the element of surprise, zero to five.

632
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:01,924
But without it,

633
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:03,259
I think there's a strong chance

634
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,427
we lose more guys than we save.

635
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,965
Kolba drives a Rolls, right?

636
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:10,132
A white Phantom.

637
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:13,302
And a couple of SUVs
for his, uh, bodyguards.

638
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:15,104
I led an op, back in the '90s,

639
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:18,641
in Sarajevo, called
Operation Broken Kingdom.

640
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:19,909
It was a...

641
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,745
deception play... the Serb
commander drove a Jaguar.

642
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,680
Right, a '71 E-Type.

643
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:26,916
It was the only one
within a 100-mile radius.

644
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:29,060
The man and the car were synonymous.

645
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:30,453
Like Kolba and his Phantom.

646
00:28:30,454 --> 00:28:31,754
Exactly. C-Can you fit

647
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:34,457
a-a Rolls-Royce inside a Hercules?

648
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,858
Easily.

649
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,194
So what if we impersonate Kolba,

650
00:28:38,195 --> 00:28:40,630
drive right up to the tower?

651
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,999
We'd be inside before
they'd know what happened.

652
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,133
That's a bold idea,

653
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:47,303
but I can already think
of one obvious flaw.

654
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:48,504
Which is?

655
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,006
Kolba's routine is unpredictable,

656
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:52,608
and he visits the base frequently.

657
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,343
If he's there at the
same time as our guys...

658
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:56,712
They'll know we're coming.

659
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:59,015
I guess that settles that.

660
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:03,351
Uh, actually, Admiral, I may
have a plan for that, too.

661
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:06,322
If it doesn't work,

662
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:10,859
I can hold my nose and try and negotiate.

663
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,696
I feel like we're not in the loop.

664
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:16,699
I feel like we're at the
bottom of a deep, dark loophole.

665
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,167
Again with the puns.

666
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:20,436
Uh, it's called coping. Why
don't you try it sometime?

667
00:29:20,437 --> 00:29:21,637
We need to talk to Kolba.

668
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,839
Talk to him? Yesterday
you wanted to condemn him.

669
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,108
Well, we've searched everywhere
except in Kolba's territory.

670
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,044
We need his help finding that plane.

671
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,812
We're talking about a
guy who's up to his neck

672
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:31,681
in torture, abduction, and murder.

673
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:32,848
Well, I believe in engagement.

674
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,684
- Yeah, no kidding.
- I'm serious.

675
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,019
The whole point of
diplomacy is to negotiate.

676
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,921
We draw the line at terrorists.

677
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:40,323
Well, Blake agrees with me.

678
00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:41,857
Don't you, Blake?

679
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:43,758
Blake wishes he had earplugs.

680
00:29:45,194 --> 00:29:48,164
The bug is active.

681
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:50,866
So that's it?

682
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:53,701
As far as we're concerned.

683
00:29:56,405 --> 00:29:58,612
- You still need me.
- The White House

684
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:01,644
was very clear about the
parameters of this operation.

685
00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:03,112
It's over.

686
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:06,282
Do you know what sarin gas
does to a person's body?

687
00:30:06,283 --> 00:30:09,685
My kids go to school just
a few miles from here.

688
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:12,688
If I can help, there's no way
I'm gonna sit on the sideline.

689
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:15,758
Staying in contact puts your life at risk.

690
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,879
If he finds the bug, he'll know it was you.

691
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,028
Do you think I don't know that?

692
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:20,796
Risks change.

693
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:22,732
My commitment doesn't.

694
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:25,300
We'll see what the president says.

695
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:29,105
But if we do go forward,
I need to remind you

696
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:32,375
that the Intelligence
Identities Protection Act of 1982

697
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:35,344
forbids you from sharing
that involvement with anyone

698
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:37,313
who isn't cleared,

699
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:39,447
including your wife.

700
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,420
- Do you want my help?
- No, I'm good.

701
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:46,355
'Cause "expiration" is
not spelled like that.

702
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:48,124
Uh, any word?

703
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,959
She's on with the admiral right now.

704
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,093
What's the deal, Blake?

705
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:52,395
You know what I know.

706
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:54,096
What do you know?

707
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:56,399
I know that you are
violating my personal space.

708
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,933
- Blake?
- Yeah.

709
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,036
Can you get me General Kolba on the line?

710
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:01,504
- Yeah.
- Ma'am...

711
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,706
may I point out that the Secretary

712
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:05,775
of State is explicitly forbidden

713
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,511
from negotiating with unrecognized states?

714
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:11,447
Well, there's a first for everything.

715
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:12,481
Get me Kolba.

716
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:14,248
Let me know when we're connected.

717
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,552
Are you kidding me?

718
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:17,953
I can't believe she caved.

719
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:18,888
It's the right move.

720
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:20,189
Excuse me. I'm about to place

721
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,258
a very important phone call
to a misogynist warlord.

722
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,027
So if you two could take this
conversation somewhere else,

723
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,295
that'd be great.

724
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:28,630
Thank you.

725
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,572
I have General Kolba on video chat.

726
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,674
What, was he out of minutes on his phone?

727
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:41,236
It was the first thing that worked.
Do you want me to cancel it or...

728
00:31:41,237 --> 00:31:43,646
No, um... patch the feed

729
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,580
in here.

730
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:03,399
Madam Secretary.

731
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,367
What an unexpected pleasure.

732
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:08,070
General, it's time we had a talk.

733
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,072
By all means.

734
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:12,040
We have so much to discuss.

735
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:16,679
But where are your beautiful legs?

736
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,682
They're under the table,
where they're going to stay.

737
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:21,550
I'll cut to the chase.

738
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:24,619
I need your help to find this plane.

739
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,679
I would love to help you,

740
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,182
but your government supports
the criminals in Chisinau.

741
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:56,752
Well, that position may be open to change.

742
00:32:56,753 --> 00:33:00,256
So I'm hoping, as equal partners,

743
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:03,057
we can find a peaceful way forward.

744
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:38,260
Move! Move! Move!

745
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:40,261
Get upstairs. Bravo team.

746
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:47,670
I insist on public
recognition for my government.

747
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:49,572
That's not feasible.

748
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:51,640
I can ease travel restrictions

749
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:53,075
for you and your entourage,

750
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:55,643
but then, I want something in return.

751
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,224
He's dead.

752
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:11,093
Prime Minister Diacov's dead.

753
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:14,530
I also want immunity from the
International Criminal Court.

754
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:17,132
That's a complex process
that involves third parties.

755
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:20,501
I'm sure a minx like you can make it work.

756
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:31,212
Clear!

757
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:34,917
What's your name?

758
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,254
You certainly aren't
shy about making demands.

759
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:40,956
I am never shy around a beautiful woman.

760
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:44,827
But if you fail to comply,
little lady, you will be sorry.

761
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:49,096
I have tricks up my sleeve
like you cannot imagine.

762
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,260
_

763
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:00,109
Gosh, General, you seem
to be terribly busy.

764
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,710
I'll call back another time.

765
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:24,362
The new prime minister
was sworn in an hour ago.

766
00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:26,564
She's taking public
credit for the operation.

767
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:28,800
I hear Kolba's forces are in retreat.

768
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:30,401
More like collapsing.

769
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:31,936
After we took out his air force,

770
00:35:31,937 --> 00:35:33,438
the majority of his men deserted.

771
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,707
Yeah, our Russian friends
can't be happy about that.

772
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,509
They're fuming,

773
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,778
but they know they don't
have a leg to stand on.

774
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:41,679
Oh, please. Enough talk about legs.

775
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,383
Russell... was that a joke?

776
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:47,652
It was in the neighborhood.

777
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:49,921
What's the status on

778
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:51,523
Jimmy Ionesco?

779
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,444
His plane touches down tomorrow afternoon.

780
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,059
Good. President would like to meet him.

781
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,028
You bet.

782
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,197
Soon as he's reunited with his family.

783
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,167
That was a great play
you made with the general.

784
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:04,769
What gave you the idea?

785
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,739
I'd tell you...

786
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,407
but you don't need to know.

787
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,513
The mourners gathered by the thousands

788
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:17,618
- at the Nativity...
- They're late again.

789
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,884
Are you surprised?

790
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,352
...paying tribute to
Prime Minister Vlad Diacov.

791
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:22,453
I'm getting married.

792
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:23,688
I need you to respect that.

793
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,657
And I respect you too much to respect that.

794
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:26,925
You're too good for that guy.

795
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:27,931
You've never even met him.

796
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,594
His name is Win, for crying out loud.

797
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:30,895
You really want to be the mother

798
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,564
of Winthrop the Third?

799
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,265
The fourth, actually, and, yes, I do.

800
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:35,433
I don't believe you.

801
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:37,402
What? Let's get started.

802
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,536
Blake,

803
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:39,604
would you excuse us, please?

804
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:41,638
Oh, thank God.

805
00:36:42,874 --> 00:36:44,809
Your personal lives

806
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,680
are your own affair, but
they become my business

807
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,615
when they interfere with
the operation of this office.

808
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:55,253
I'm tempted to make you spend the rest

809
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,388
of the afternoon stamping passports,

810
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:01,025
but since I believe in
taking the high road,

811
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:03,994
I'll let you come with me.

812
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:52,356
Ah-ah! Are those soccer cleats?

813
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,245
Yeah. I just got them.

814
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:54,479
Let me rephrase.

815
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,539
Are those soccer cleats inside the house...

816
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,270
- Sorry.
- ...on the floors we just had refinished?

817
00:37:58,271 --> 00:37:59,017
Okay.

818
00:37:59,018 --> 00:37:59,884
- Hey.
- Hi.

819
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:01,152
Hey. Madison said yes.

820
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,654
- Great.
- You're kidding.

821
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,122
Who has two thumbs

822
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:06,163
- and is a total player?
- Oh, that's great.

823
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,826
Yeah, well, here's the thing:

824
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:10,228
Madison has this friend, Eve,

825
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:11,930
and I can tell she's super jealous.

826
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:14,032
Eve is like an eight
and a half, and she's...

827
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:16,794
she is super hot, so I think... I think

828
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,035
I might ask her out instead.

829
00:38:18,036 --> 00:38:20,237
- You want to take this one?
- Yeah, I got it.

830
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:22,506
Jason, give me a hand with
the garbage, would you?

831
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:23,607
- Please?
- Yeah.

832
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:25,900
- Ooh.
- This is not looking so good.

833
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:28,844
Yes, it is. It's supposed... to be black.

834
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:31,014
Ooh.

835
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:32,316
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God!

836
00:38:32,317 --> 00:38:34,017
Okay, I'm done.

837
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:35,152
Take out. Take out.

838
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:36,486
I'm ordering out.

839
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:39,823
All right, pal, we got to talk about girls.

840
00:38:39,824 --> 00:38:41,705
Again? Yeah, I know how it works, Dad.

841
00:38:41,706 --> 00:38:43,672
No, not that talk...

842
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:46,075
- We got to talk about respecting girls.
- I respect girls.

843
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,010
Dude, you're grading
them like sides of beef.

844
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,012
How would you feel if
somebody talked that way

845
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:51,514
about Alison or Stevie?

846
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:52,781
I don't know.

847
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:55,117
All right, look...

848
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:56,919
you're a savvy guy.

849
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,754
I'm not surprised Madison likes you.

850
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,625
But if you want girls to love you...

851
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:05,494
and someday, you're gonna be
in love... then, you got be

852
00:39:05,495 --> 00:39:07,429
a little more than clever;
you got to be respectful.

853
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,431
You got it?

854
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:13,102
All right, I'll, um...

855
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,603
I'll take Madison to the concert.

856
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,138
Good, and listen,

857
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:18,541
don't feel like you have
to make too many jokes.

858
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:20,509
When she talks, just listen.

859
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,810
What, does that actually work?

860
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:25,314
Ask your mother.

861
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:30,553
I'm proud of you, you know.

862
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:32,221
What for?

863
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:37,560
Well, for saving Moldova
and humiliating Kolba.

864
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:39,929
What makes you think I had
anything to do with that?

865
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,398
Oh, come on, I can read signs.

866
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:44,033
I got tradecraft.

867
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:48,470
Hey about that... is it over?

868
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,139
Is what over?

869
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,542
The NSA thing.

870
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:57,880
Yes. It's over.

871
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,482
Thank God.

872
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:03,786
I was afraid maybe you liked it.

873
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,888
No.

874
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:08,357
I was glad I could help, but...

875
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:11,592
it's not for me.

876
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:26,374
Yeah.

877
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:29,944
Yeah.

878
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,759
I haven't slept after what you told me.

879
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,661
Oh, I know the feeling.

880
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,399
All right, you're still mad at me.

881
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,334
Of course I am.

882
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:54,236
Well, Juliet believes me.

883
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:56,939
Juliet has two kids in preschool.

884
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,375
I think she wants to see them grow up.

885
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,709
You know I'm right.

886
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,311
George is dead, Bess.

887
00:41:02,312 --> 00:41:04,312
We don't want to be next.

888
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:08,584
Then I'll do it alone.

889
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:11,052
It's not that simple.

890
00:41:12,488 --> 00:41:16,157
It was postmarked the day he died.

891
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,528
George sent you this?

892
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:21,597
He owed me for a valet
a couple months back.

893
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:23,297
Look at this.

894
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:28,203
What does that mean?

895
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:30,973
I don't even know if he wrote it.

896
00:41:30,974 --> 00:41:35,244
But I think maybe he wanted me to help you.

897
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,012
What are you saying?

898
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:39,515
Juliet's out,

899
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:41,883
but I'm in.

900
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:47,755
Good.

901
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:57,900
