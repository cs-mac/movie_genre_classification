1
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,468
<i>You know this story.</i>

2
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,658
<i>The crack of lightning.</i>

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,198
<i>A mad genius.</i>

4
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,938
<i>An unholy creation.</i>

5
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:04,547
<i>The world, of course, remembers
the monster, not the man.</i>

6
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,468
<i>But sometimes, when you look closely...</i>

7
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,853
<i>there's more to a tale.</i>

8
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>Sometimes the monster is the man.</i>

9
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,934
<i>I've been with the circus
for as long as I can remember.</i>

10
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:29,105
<i>Circuses like to think
of themselves as families.</i>

11
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:33,175
<i>But, of course, each one has its clown.</i>

12
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,417
Oh!

13
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,741
<i>I didn't have a name back then.
I was just "the hunchback".</i>

14
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,193
<i>Or "freak", if you were being kind.</i>

15
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,348
<i>But the truth is,
I didn't hate them for it.</i>

16
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,467
<i>It's hard to judge cruelty
when you've never known kindness.</i>

17
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,143
<i>Besides, I always
had someone to look up to.</i>

18
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:36,223
<i>When I wasn't performing,
I served as the company's doctor.</i>

19
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,609
<i>I became fascinated
by the science of medicine.</i>

20
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,360
<i>Particularly of human anatomy.</i>

21
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,495
<i>I wanted to understand everything
about this internal universe</i>

22
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:50,070
<i>that makes us who we are.</i>

23
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>The brains, lungs, bones, muscles.</i>

24
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,994
<i>The heart.</i>

25
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,933
<i>I don't know why the science of life
captured my imagination.</i>

26
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,087
<i>I think it just helped me escape.</i>

27
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:14,928
My God! You really think
you're smart, don't you, eh? Huh?

28
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,082
A real intellectual.
What an embarrassment that must be!

29
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,303
Oi! You're on! Come on!

30
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,077
<i>Little did I know
that on a chilly London evening</i>

31
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:35,460
<i>I was about to meet the man
who would change my life forever.</i>

32
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,312
Ladies and gentlemen!

33
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,450
Witness now the death-defying feats

34
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,786
of our very own bird in the sky...

35
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:17,190
the beautiful Lorelei!

36
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,231
Lorelei!

37
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,413
Lorelei! Lorelei!

38
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,465
Oh, Lorelei!

39
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,833
Oh, God! She can't breathe!
She can't breathe.

40
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,235
Previous injuries?

41
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,005
Uh, she broke her arm a year or so ago
and her collarbone sometime before that.

42
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,909
Oh! Oh, my God.

43
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,779
Collarbone is rebroken, shoulder's
dislocated, causing pressure on the lungs.

44
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,848
- She can't breathe.
- What do we do?

45
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,884
Nothing, I'm afraid.
Don't have the tools to reset the bone.

46
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,822
Do you have a pocket watch? Give it to me.

47
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,091
- I'm not giving you...
- Do this now or she dies!

48
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,862
Come on!

49
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,984
Wait.

50
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:39,556
That dislocation is forcing the sternum
to rest at an untenable angle, yes?

51
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:43,790
- Yes. Ready?
- Set? 3, 2, 1...

52
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,964
- Yes!
- There we are.

53
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,286
- You saved me.
- Breathe.

54
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,988
Thank you.

55
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:58,225
That was incredible.
Why are you wearing that silly makeup?

56
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:01,411
- Well, I'm a clown.
- You're not a clown, you're a physician...

57
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,748
who just performed a dry surgery in less
than a minute with nothing to prepare.

58
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,717
- Well, I'm a clown physician.
- Don't panic, ladies and gentlemen!

59
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,685
All part of the act!

60
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,455
You're being wasted here.

61
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:17,594
- I'm with the circus, sir.
- You're going to leave the bloody circus.

62
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:20,096
- What?
- What's going on?

63
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:23,366
- You're a doctor, then?
- On my better days.

64
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,403
Chiswick Cross Hospital is just up the road.
I can lead your men there now.

65
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,508
Get her out of here sharpish!
Go out the back way.

66
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,528
Don't want her upsetting the clientele.

67
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,182
Where are they taking that poor creature?

68
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:43,184
Sir. Sir. Please, may I know your name?

69
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:55,665
Ladies and gentlemen!

70
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:59,359
The Human Cannonball!

71
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,112
- Please, no!
- You sneaky little rat!

72
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:13,416
Do you want to leave? I own you!
I've had enough of these books!

73
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,637
- You belong to the circus! Burn them!
- Please, Master Barnaby, it's my only thing.

74
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,957
No! No!

75
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,392
Get out of there!

76
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,862
Let that be a lesson to you!

77
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:30,018
Get in there! You are going nowhere!

78
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:35,737
Do you know what's happened to Lorelei?

79
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:43,754
Romanticizing, are we?

80
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,951
She's probably gonna die, you know that.

81
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:52,674
These city doctors
and their dirty hospitals.

82
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,409
Ow!

83
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,489
What are you doing?

84
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,058
High powered magnet. Should work.
Usually does. Come on.

85
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:30,857
Hold on, sir.
You don't know what he'll do to me.

86
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,829
- Don't I?
- No, sir, I can't just leave.

87
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,099
- Of course you can.
- No, sir, they own me!

88
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,401
You are better than this.
You can be better than this.

89
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,370
I can get you out of here, but you're going
to have to trust me, you understand?

90
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,490
Oi!

91
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,776
Choose now or remain here
for the rest of your days.

92
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,545
Get away from that cage! You hear me?

93
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:51,813
- Open it!
- Oi!

94
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:55,518
Someone get him!
He's property of the circus!

95
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,999
Now, the thing is...

96
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,991
He's robbed us!

97
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:09,385
The hunchback! He's attacked me
and robbed the circus!

98
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,267
Get him!

99
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,980
Get after him!

100
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,858
Don't touch him!

101
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,966
Go!

102
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,935
Got you.

103
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,204
What do we do? What do we do now?

104
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,527
How do we get out of here?

105
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,529
You know this place, damn it! How do we...

106
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,538
- Where are they?
- Whoa!

107
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,697
- I'm not in the circus.
- What?

108
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:26,068
Yes, very good. Come along!

109
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,091
I've never been out
of the circus before, sir.

110
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,469
Eyes open, door shut. Coat off.

111
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:54,397
Coat off.

112
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:58,230
I'm going to slip into something
a little more... comfortable.

113
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,685
What's that for?

114
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,899
Next order of business.

115
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,459
No, no. What are you gonna do to me?

116
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,667
Absolutely nothing.

117
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,002
Don't worry about it.

118
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,939
Look.

119
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,280
This is going to hurt just a little bit.

120
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:48,117
- What are you doing to me?
- Listen to me!

121
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,786
You are not...

122
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:53,155
a hunchback.

123
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,827
Not a real one, anyway. No.

124
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,562
You have an abscess...

125
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,365
causing a fluid pocket, a rather...

126
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,967
large fluid sac.

127
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,535
It hurts! It hurts!

128
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:09,905
Yes, I imagine it does. You know,
you'd be surprised how often I hear that.

129
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:21,751
Looking at the size of this beauty,
I'd say it's gone untreated for, oh...

130
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:27,254
18 years, but... the good news is,
I'm convinced that if we can drain it...

131
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,827
in 3...

132
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:32,628
2...

133
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:34,799
1. And pulling out.

134
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,330
<i>Garde a l'eau!</i>

135
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:47,093
Right.
That's the easy part done.

136
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,645
What? Easy part?

137
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,899
You're all right!

138
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:58,095
And up... we... go.

139
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,574
Now, your muscles...

140
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,978
your bones...
your entire skeletal system...

141
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,248
will be struggling to reset themselves

142
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:14,151
to return you to your former
ground-sniffing-luddite-bearing posture

143
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,589
of the last 18 years.

144
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,526
So, for the time being, my friend,
you shall have to wear this rather

145
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,529
wonderful back brace
I constructed for Gordon.

146
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,463
Who?

147
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,834
I'm standing up!

148
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,804
That's rather obvious. I haven't
overestimated your intelligence, have I?

149
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,141
No, no, it's just I'm not in the circus
and now I'm standing up.

150
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,775
Yeah, you said that.

151
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,579
Right! Library and study are over there.
Kitchen's over there.

152
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,882
My bedroom on the left,
yours is on the right.

153
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,284
There's a water heater and soap in there.

154
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,854
I suggest you use it
to do something about your...

155
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,623
hair.

156
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,076
I'll be in the basement for the rest
of the evening, as I have school...

157
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:57,196
in the morning. Make yourself at home,
don't touch anything.

158
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,767
Oh! By the way, I had... have a flatmate.

159
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,603
Goes by the name of Igor Straussman.
Man's a morphine addict.

160
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,608
Idiot. Complete liar. Thankfully for us,
he's almost never home.

161
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:13,612
So, should anyone question your presence
here, you are to say that you are he, yes?

162
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,115
- I'm Igor?
- Very good.

163
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,717
"Hello, my name is Igor."

164
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,102
Let's see.

165
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:47,440
A dangerous hunchback is detained
for the safety of the public...

166
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,309
with a determined and equally
dangerous accomplice.

167
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,180
They proceed
to the circus owner's trailer,

168
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,615
where they rob the safe of its contents.

169
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,386
They make their violent escape, culminating
in the murder of an innocent man,

170
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,020
and vanishing...

171
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,124
...into thin air.

172
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,762
A fair summing up, Alistair?

173
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:15,490
Yes, Inspector. Escape, robbery, murder.

174
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,603
Just as Mr. Barnaby said.

175
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,185
Now here's
what I think happened, Alistair.

176
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,121
A human being with a spinal deformity

177
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,970
is locked up against his will.

178
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,139
Perhaps a common feature
of his treatment here.

179
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:48,566
A stranger releases him
using a magnet and tickler...

180
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,402
as any fool can.

181
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:55,007
They make their escape urgently,
as they must...

182
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,275
for the circus is against them.

183
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,978
They flee.

184
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,147
A chase.

185
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,916
A man dies.

186
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,232
Manslaughter in self-defense
at most, I would say.

187
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,783
"Wanted for murder." Have it copied.

188
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,285
- Sir, I thought you said it wasn't...
- I did.

189
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,657
Something tells me our circus freak...

190
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,226
may be only the beginning.

191
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,536
Good morning!

192
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,116
<i>At school till 6.
Clothes in the wardrobe.</i>

193
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:14,841
<i>Money in the tin by the door
with your key. Be home for dinner. F.</i>

194
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,834
Chiswick Hospital.

195
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,629
Doctor?

196
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,498
This way, gentlemen.
We have amputation to perform.

197
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,185
You.

198
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,304
- What, me?
- Yeah.

199
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,075
She needs camphor inhalations twice a day,
uh, extract of allium,

200
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:19,245
a quarter ounce of arsenic and three of
Filcher's Oil, but more if you can get it.

201
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,547
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

202
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,350
And then when she wakes, tell her...

203
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,752
a friend will be back.

204
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:17,302
6 months ago, a man tried to
buy parts of recently deceased animals

205
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,439
at the London Zoological Gardens.
He was turned away.

206
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,343
2 weeks later, there was a forced entry.
Animal limbs amputated and stolen.

207
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,713
A month later, a similar pattern of events
at the Veterinary Academy.

208
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,890
Sounds gruesome...

209
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,784
I confiscated that from
the crime scene at the circus.

210
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,719
Open it.

211
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,392
Sir...

212
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,165
this is disgusting.

213
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,335
It belonged to a lioness
recently deceased.

214
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,506
But it was found near
our murder victim at the circus

215
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,615
and it didn't walk there
of its own accord.

216
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,312
You think there's a connection?

217
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,616
I think our other man at the circus
fits the same description as this...

218
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,884
animal thief.

219
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,987
But who would do that?

220
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,412
Huh?

221
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,326
What motive?

222
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,329
Something reeks here.

223
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,216
It reeks of an evil, sinful mischief.

224
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,252
And now that man
walks the streets of this city.

225
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,253
Back in the mud so soon?

226
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,444
Yes, I see.

227
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:51,383
Absolutely savage depiction of me,
I'm afraid.

228
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,265
Got the hair all wrong, and the nose, too.

229
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:57,369
I'm new to this criminal life, but I never
thought the authorities would attack my vanity.

230
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,205
But they think I'm a murderer!

231
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,236
I've been called
much worse things in my time.

232
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:10,149
Besides... they're not
looking for you, are they?

233
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,618
They're looking for a piteous,
nameless hunchback.

234
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,554
And Igor, I would like you
to look at yourself.

235
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,041
Igor, that creature no longer exists.

236
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,130
Dinner.

237
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,575
This is excellent.

238
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:42,514
So... what brought you
to the circus in the first place?

239
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,649
Cutlery.

240
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,718
- What?
- Use it.

241
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:50,572
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wipe your hands.

242
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,858
Animals.

243
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,361
Parts.

244
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,566
I am a student at
the Royal College of Medicine.

245
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,336
The curriculum is straightforward,
the exams easy, the professors...

246
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,472
oh! The professors are
men of limited ability

247
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:11,661
- and even more limited horizon.
- Why did you rescue me?

248
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:15,046
You, my friend, were an unexpected gift.

249
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,882
It's not every day I come across a man,

250
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,418
albeit one suffering
from such grotesque deformity

251
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,856
who is so clearly talented,
observant, and resourceful,

252
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:29,795
and in possession of the most gifted
pair of hands I have ever seen.

253
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,913
My interest in you does not stem
from charity. Follow me.

254
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:36,401
Before I met you,
I was to approach Mr. Barnaby

255
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,804
about acquiring some
of your deceased animals.

256
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,224
To what end? Study?

257
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,511
No, not as you would think of it.

258
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:49,114
I am of the strong belief that death
can be made a temporary condition.

259
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,351
- Well, that's impossible.
- Improbable, yes. Impossible, no.

260
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,854
Life is temporary.
Why should death be any different?

261
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,056
I have absolutely
no time for false modesty.

262
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,493
So it is without pride or shame
that I declare my discovery an act of...

263
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,794
genius.

264
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,806
Those eyes...
they're over 3 months old.

265
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:18,277
And the liquid is an electrically
conductive jelly of my own device.

266
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,446
Serves a double function:
To preserve and to...

267
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,483
well, just wait and see.

268
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,756
It's all a matter of conversion, you see?

269
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,989
The conversion of pure electrical energy

270
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,893
into the biological variety
that flows through the human body.

271
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,997
Hence, the construction of this device:
The Lazarus Fork.

272
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,838
I have found that by passing that current

273
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:45,737
through a specially blended variety
of sulfates and metals...

274
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,173
You've mastered the conversion?

275
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,431
- Yes.
- Well, show me.

276
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,760
Ready?

277
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:21,138
There. There. Do you see?

278
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,574
They live.

279
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,713
What do you think?

280
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:34,927
It is impressive.
But you have made a mess of the nerves.

281
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,290
I beg your pardon?

282
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,727
The oculomotor nerves.
You haven't connected them properly.

283
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,029
And that's why they don't move evenly.

284
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,698
You.

285
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:04,149
There he is! That's the man.

286
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,919
- That's the man I'm after.
- Thank you for asking.

287
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,490
You're welcome. Now, I shall
bring you your assignments piecemeal.

288
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,061
You will complete them in a timely fashion,
whereon I shall apply them to a larger...

289
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,463
whole of my own device. Questions?

290
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,401
- Uh, this larger whole...
- Is not of your concern.

291
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,636
- Well, but if I...
- Igor, I...

292
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:36,314
All this is now yours. Every book.
Every piece of reference material.

293
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:41,618
Apparatus. Desk. Room.
Your laboratory, if you like.

294
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,595
As my assistant, you shall be
at the very heart

295
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:53,798
of a scientific enterprise
that will change the world.

296
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,335
Now, will you help me?

297
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,405
- Yeah. Fix that.
- Ah. Thank you.

298
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,502
Mmm-hmm.

299
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,947
Keep working on it.

300
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,230
<i>The hospital made
arrangements for Lorelei.</i>

301
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,628
<i>She now had a benefactor.</i>

302
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,453
<i>I was pleased she had recovered
and had someone to look after her, but...</i>

303
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,156
<i>as the weeks went by, I missed her.</i>

304
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,697
<i>And I wondered if her life
had changed as much as mine.</i>

305
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,851
- Uh... Victor?
- Mmm-hmm?

306
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,687
This letter for Master Straussman.

307
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,667
- We are going out on the town.
- Oh!

308
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,394
Here we are. Now, I have
a tenured membership at the club,

309
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,131
thanks to my father's...
status as a charter member.

310
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,534
- Bought the velvet for the seats.
- Your father...

311
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,703
Is what they call a great man.

312
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:49,425
Esteemed doctor, member of the
Royal College of Physicians,

313
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,810
and pioneer in the field
of cardio-physiology.

314
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,280
- I should be honored to meet him someday.
- Uh, perhaps not. Look, here's the club!

315
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,148
Master Victor,
I'm not sure I'm suited for this.

316
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,051
Pish! All you have to do is keep
your back straight, your words clean,

317
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,360
and do your damnedest not to embarrass me.

318
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,990
Babies grown in vats!

319
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,760
Victor, do you think this is really the
appropriate place to talk about this?

320
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,804
Help me! I am just trying to inform
these two wonderful young ladies

321
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:16,434
that... fertilization needn't take place
inside the female body.

322
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:20,254
- Sperm! Sperms! Can sperm move?
- They can.

323
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:21,356
Thank you, good man.

324
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:25,443
Why can't it move independently
towards the egg in, say, a...

325
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,664
bucket?

326
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:32,217
Where does the mother fit in?

327
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,020
Exactly! You're off educating yourself!

328
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,892
By the time we need you, we're... sucking
the fertilized egg up into a funnel

329
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,644
and then we shuck it up your...

330
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,908
Igor?

331
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,066
Excuse me?

332
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,589
- Sorry, I thought I recognized you.
- Well, you might do.

333
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,761
- I don't remember your name.
- Well, I never had one.

334
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,138
- It's you.
- It's me.

335
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,508
Well, yeah, a bit different.

336
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,513
You saved my life.

337
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,911
You saved my life.

338
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,029
Boring!

339
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,493
Friend of yours?

340
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,332
That's Baron Bomine.
He recruited me to be in his cabaret...

341
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,209
and his consort in public.

342
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,494
Right.

343
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:37,245
He, uh... prefers the company of men.

344
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:38,442
Oh.

345
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,648
I have a name now.

346
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,617
I am Igor.

347
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:50,046
What?

348
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,592
It's perfect.

349
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,629
...this woman seems to think
that the human brain is pink.

350
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:00,799
- In fact, it is grey.
- That's Victor Frankenstein.

351
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:03,131
Grey like this oyster. I'm done.

352
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,670
He's the man who rescued me.
And he helped save you.

353
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,809
- Is he always like that?
- No. He's very clever, and he is kind.

354
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:15,013
- He just finds ordinary people very...
- Ordinary.

355
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,949
- Victor, how did you...
- Who are you?

356
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,153
You're... you're the fallen angel.

357
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:25,092
Plummeted from any other great
heights lately?

358
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,595
Maybe you should try this one. It's only,
all of 30 feet. You've had worse.

359
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:34,549
I'm afraid the only thing plummeting here
is my opinion of you, Mr. Frankenschteen.

360
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,701
- Frankenstein.
- All right, Victor.

361
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,070
Igor, um...

362
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,674
- Igor speaks very highly of you.
- Would you like to join us?

363
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,912
Now, of course, I can't yet tell you
everything, but suffice it to say,

364
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,415
Igor and I stand upon the cusp of...

365
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:54,519
creating life out of death.

366
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,589
- Mr. Frankenstein...
- Victor. Victor please.

367
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:01,426
I find your promise
more than a little unsettling.

368
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,960
Ooh.

369
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,096
- Superstitious, are we?
- No.

370
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,565
Are you not afraid to challenge
the natural order?

371
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,500
Igor, speak up. What do you think?

372
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,173
Once, I would have agreed with you,
Lorelei, but think about it.

373
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,009
20 years ago, electric lights
would've been thought of as magic.

374
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,129
Your injuries in the circus
would have been fatal.

375
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:25,099
Every day science and technology
changes the way we live our lives.

376
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,986
- I mean, look at me.
- Well said, that man.

377
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,321
- Life and death are different.
- "Life and death!"

378
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,621
I dream of a world
where hope replaces fear.

379
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:37,262
A world where a murdered man
can stand in court to face his murderer.

380
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:41,566
Where a crippled soldier, shrapnel
in his spine, can be killed, healed,

381
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,468
then brought back to life to walk again.

382
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,839
Don't you see? The possibilities are...

383
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,842
endless! Life is beautiful!

384
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,511
But unfortunately it is finite.

385
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,713
Now, tell me what that says.

386
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,279
- "Death."
- Thank you very much.

387
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:01,352
I cannot argue with that.

388
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,855
There it is, in black and white.

389
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,157
But with a little applied science...

390
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,396
what do I give you now?

391
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,832
"Life."

392
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,701
That's what I'm trying to do.

393
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,503
Perhaps I spoke too soon.

394
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,309
<i>I don't think
you shouldn't see that girl again.</i>

395
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,611
- What? Why?
- Well, she's very nice.

396
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,180
Uneducated, superstitious.
Distraction from our work.

397
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,283
- She's kind to me.
- Tonight was not about meaningless frivolity.

398
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,019
It was a celebration of our work together.

399
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,156
I think it is high time...
you met our monster.

400
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,865
Don't tarry! Come, come, come!

401
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,369
Come on!

402
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,781
- What is that?
- Gordon.

403
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,749
- What?
- Gordon!

404
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,589
- You made this?
- No, no, no.

405
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:48,425
We... made this.

406
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:53,597
Lungs, heart, spine,
brain... all your work.

407
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,937
All... impossible without you, in fact.

408
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,140
Victor...

409
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,841
You promised me this was all about life.

410
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,950
It's about more than that.

411
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,991
Hands off.

412
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,497
3... 2... 1.

413
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:38,275
Come on, come on, come on. Shh!

414
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,928
Look.

415
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:58,627
- It's alive.
- Yes, it's... alive.

416
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:00,832
It's alive?

417
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,467
Victor... how?

418
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,371
Can't quite move yet.
Charge lasts barely an hour,

419
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,341
and the bottom half
is predominantly a rude mockup.

420
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,244
Victor, you have created life
out of nothing!

421
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:17,714
- Do you realize how significant this is?
- Oh, I have an inkling.

422
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,752
You are to accompany me
to the college tomorrow.

423
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:24,956
I've announced that I'll be making
a presentation of my private work.

424
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,925
I'm coming to the college with you?
As your assistant?

425
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,096
Igor, try not to be quite so dim.

426
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,532
From this day forth...

427
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:38,869
you are to be my partner.

428
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,981
Letter for you, Miss Lorelei.

429
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,018
Letter? From who?

430
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,729
<i>Dear We've had a breakthrough.</i>

431
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:09,166
<i>Please come to the Royal College of
Medicine, Hall H, this evening at 8 pm.</i>

432
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,134
<i>Igor.</i>

433
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,271
Big presentation in Hall H.

434
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:17,275
Presentation in Hall H.

435
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:21,645
Big presentation, Hall H!

436
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,080
Igor, around to the right.

437
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,724
Since the beginning of modern medicine...

438
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,630
there has been an assumption

439
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,772
regarding the status of mortality...

440
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:45,368
that being that death is an unavoidable...

441
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,773
event, the inevitability
of which we should...

442
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,475
take for granted.

443
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,613
I will show...

444
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:58,782
...today that life is not some...

445
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:03,153
grace bestowed upon us by...

446
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:07,725
- some outdated notion of an all-po...
- Get on with it.

447
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,128
Yes, of course.
I'm not accustomed to public speaking.

448
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,731
Igor, would you prime
the dynamo for me, please?

449
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,132
Yes, master.

450
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:20,271
I would like to show you,
uh, show all seven of you...

451
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,306
and, of course, the young lady...

452
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:25,409
Come on, come on, come on.
I have a coach waiting.

453
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,246
Uh...

454
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,750
I give to you... life...

455
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,886
by my own... creation.

456
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,513
Cattle market.

457
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,970
I have built this homunculus
from various body parts...

458
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:55,906
I got from... the London Zoo.

459
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,927
They've had a terrible time with the upkeep
of their exotic animals, all to my benefit.

460
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:04,615
He's mainly chimpanzee, but with the aid
of my esteemed associate, Igor Straussman,

461
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,318
we've managed to interlace
multiple individuals,

462
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,621
multiple species as a matter of fact.

463
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:14,091
Igor, is it ready? They're staring at me.
Right. Thank you.

464
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:18,494
Do come to the front. Get a closer look.
Don't be shy.

465
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,098
He won't bite.

466
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:25,703
Now, by the miracle of electricity...

467
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:30,908
I give you in three, two, one...

468
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,959
life.

469
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:41,118
- God!
- I've seen enough.

470
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,805
No, no, no, no! Don't go! Don't go!

471
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:47,474
Igor, shock him again. Harder.

472
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:53,297
3, 2, 1... now!

473
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,234
Frankenstein, you've surpassed...

474
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,019
...all expectations, even by your own

475
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,372
expansive mythos of strangeness
and perversion.

476
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:04,847
This is spectacular. It's delightful!

477
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:09,013
Just an exquisite show of depraved lunacy.

478
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,967
Igor.

479
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:14,351
Full charge. Ready?

480
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,456
- Igor?
- Ready.

481
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:22,144
Now!

482
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,032
Oh, look, there she goes, Victor.

483
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,445
Bing, bang... boom.

484
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:34,004
What have you got next?

485
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,742
Perhaps a midget hidden inside
your rotting meat sculpture's stomach

486
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,895
ready to pop out with a bouquet of ro...

487
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,136
Do you see?

488
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:40,504
It's all right. Gordon... Gordon...

489
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,672
- Igor!
- Lorelei, stay back!

490
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,664
- Lorelei, are you all right?
- Igor!

491
00:46:02,764 --> 00:46:06,296
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Don't let him escape.

492
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,475
Gordon! Stop!

493
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,959
No, no! Don't go out there!

494
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:11,838
Victor!

495
00:48:11,938 --> 00:48:13,607
- Calm down, Gordon. Calm down.
- Get him off me!

496
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:16,253
- Gordon? Gordon!
- Victor! Victor!

497
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,934
- Igor, what have you done to him?
- Let go! Help me, not him!

498
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,074
Victor, we have to kill it!

499
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,682
Do it, Victor!

500
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,887
<i>It was out of control!</i>

501
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,343
- We made progress today!
- It was homicidal!

502
00:48:47,443 --> 00:48:49,694
No, no, no, I had no way
of knowing that Gordon was...

503
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,962
Am I to understand that you built that?

504
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,063
Yes!

505
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,237
I apologize.

506
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,441
I misjudged you.

507
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,644
Your flaws, though they're...

508
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:09,646
glaring and massive, are merely social...

509
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,881
not intellectual.

510
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,018
I find your work astonishing...

511
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,788
and to be perfectly frank...

512
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,758
brilliant. Brilliant!

513
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:24,461
Quite beyond my own ability to comprehend.

514
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,647
- Could you create another one?
- I could, and a whole lot more beside.

515
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:36,606
But that would take considerable resource.

516
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:39,610
As you are aware, I do come
from the third richest family in England.

517
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,514
As a result, I can provide you
with whatever it is you so require.

518
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,949
In that case, in that case, yes.

519
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,319
And when you say... "more"?

520
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,520
A man.

521
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,290
A thinking...

522
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,178
- intelligent being.
- Can we discuss this?

523
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:58,733
- I like this ambition.
- You were right, Igor. I was wrong.

524
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,465
The beast was dangerous
but now we have the opportunity

525
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,033
to show the value of our work.

526
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:07,738
You and I, Igor... we shall create
a man after our own...

527
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,939
image.

528
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,309
Think of it.

529
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:17,947
An intelligent, civilized...

530
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,317
man.

531
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,822
I'll want another demonstration.

532
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:30,209
I want to know whether you can take
direction. Follow orders, so to speak.

533
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:31,428
Is that a problem?

534
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,697
- Victor, we cannot.
- No.

535
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,098
Excellent!

536
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,419
Expect to hear from me soon.

537
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,843
You did not create this technology and yet
you presume to tell me how to use it.

538
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,712
You should know your place!

539
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,384
I cannot allow your ignorance
of the ways of the world

540
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,486
to hinder the furtherment
of my experimentation.

541
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,554
Surely you see you have no control.

542
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:02,758
Surely you have forgotten
what I did for you at the circus!

543
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:07,131
This is my destiny. It is your destiny.

544
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,402
And that man represents
our only ally on this planet.

545
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:14,738
And if he wants us to make him
an entire zoo of homunculi,

546
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,909
that is exactly what we will do if it
ensures the furtherment of our research.

547
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,712
Am I making myself clear?

548
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:25,414
- Am I making myself clear?
- Yes, Victor!

549
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,695
<i>I own you!</i>

550
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:11,025
<i>You belong to the circus!</i>

551
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,756
Good morning. Can I help you?

552
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:26,125
Detective Inspector Turpin, Scotland Yard.

553
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,381
I want to speak with a Mr. Frankenstein.

554
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,984
Well, I'm afraid that's not convenient
at the moment, sir.

555
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,786
May I know your business?

556
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:01,944
Do you miss the circus?

557
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,714
I'm not sure what you mean, sir.

558
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,484
Get me Frankenstein.

559
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,281
I've informed the college that
I would happily pay for the damage.

560
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:35,012
- Just a bit of broken glass.
- An animal was involved apparently.

561
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:36,747
There was indeed.

562
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:42,019
Mr. Straussman and I are currently
involved in the study of chimpanzees.

563
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,756
It's quite... quite fascinating, actually.

564
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:48,725
We have discovered
that by using emotional cues

565
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,328
we can actually teach them
primitive belief systems.

566
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:56,087
Of course, it's only because they are not
yet capable of higher logical thought.

567
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,002
- Where is the creature now?
- Dead.

568
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,438
Poor thing. Had to be put down, didn't it?

569
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,874
Why would the police
be interested in such a trifle?

570
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,678
There may be a connection
with a murder investigation of ours.

571
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:11,314
Murder investigation, you say?
Igor, this is a murder investigation!

572
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,068
Am I to understand we have to summon
the chimpanzee's lawyer? (CHUCKLES)

573
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:21,458
Mr. Frankenstein, I warn you that there are
consequences for obstructing police work.

574
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,329
I should like to see records of your
experiments for the past 12 months, if I may.

575
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,264
If you cannot cooperate, then, by God,

576
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,133
I'll conduct a thorough search
of these premises.

577
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,635
"By God," you say?

578
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,285
Inspector, I have to inform you
that you are currently

579
00:54:37,385 --> 00:54:39,776
in the home of rational,
free-thinking men.

580
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:43,046
To violate it or my research
would require a proper legal warrant.

581
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:47,150
- And God has no authority here.
- Tread lightly, sir.

582
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,854
You may insult me,
but you impugn the Lord at your peril.

583
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,823
I should remind you that life
is a sacred creation.

584
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,761
Are you a police officer or a theologian?

585
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,924
Let me tell you something for nothing.
Life... I'll say this very slowly...

586
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:04,602
is merely the application
and outcome of applied chemistry.

587
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:06,670
And did you or did you not
apply such chemistry

588
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,972
at the Royal College
of Medicine two days ago?

589
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,575
Igor, when was the last time
you went to confession?

590
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,978
The good friar has come to see
whether we have sinned.

591
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:16,980
"He that covereth his sin shall
not prosper." I'll ask you again.

592
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,849
And I will ask you again, sir:

593
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,852
Why are you so interested,
nay, infatuated with this case?

594
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:26,256
Surely there are more interesting
mysteries to be solved in London.

595
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:31,712
Or is it precisely because this experiment,
which you imagine took place

596
00:55:31,812 --> 00:55:34,998
may very well discredit
your own primitive belief system?

597
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,034
Yes, uncover what you will
about me, Inspector.

598
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:39,269
Men like you have always stood
in the way of progress

599
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:44,431
and they have invariably been
left in its wake. My creation...

600
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:55,152
Be careful, Mr. Frankenstein.

601
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:58,174
You toy with wrathful forces.

602
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,325
And there's no mercy in nature.

603
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,365
Good day.

604
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,037
I'll be back with a warrant.

605
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,125
That thing in the school, Igor...

606
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,229
I looked into its eyes
and there was nothing there.

607
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,828
There is a difference
between using your machines

608
00:56:46,928 --> 00:56:49,940
to restore a life wrongly lost and...

609
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,743
to create something that
was never supposed to exist.

610
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,146
- Victor must understand that.
- Look...

611
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,450
I never thought I'd leave the circus.

612
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,435
I thought I'd be in there till I died.

613
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:06,651
And Victor... has given me all this.

614
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,260
And all he asked is that I believe in him.

615
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,395
I understand that, Igor.

616
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:17,634
What I'm saying is... don't let yourself
be bullied by anyone ever again.

617
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,972
Victor says he's your friend.

618
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:27,009
But if you believe Victor is on a wrong
path, then you must make a stand.

619
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,251
I have to go.

620
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,697
Victor, if you truly
respect me as a scientist...

621
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,134
If you truly respect me as your friend...

622
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,702
you must listen to my concerns.

623
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:00,544
- Igor.
- Sir.

624
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,413
What's it been? 3 years?

625
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,681
You look slimmer.

626
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,251
I'm sorry, sir, I don't...

627
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,253
- Is Victor here?
- Yes, sir.

628
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,488
Very well.

629
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:19,196
Where have you been? Not wise to be out
on the town when there's a manhunt on.

630
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,431
Get off his heart!

631
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:26,696
Father.

632
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:28,737
Get up.

633
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:32,308
Leave.

634
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,348
Father, I'm so excited that
you've come. Your timing is impeccable.

635
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,384
- I've had such breakthroughs with my...
- I don't care.

636
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:46,189
I don't care about your poorly researched
theories or your disastrous experiments.

637
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,959
- They're not poorly researched, I've told you.
- Victor, silence.

638
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:54,231
Yesterday I received a telegram
informing me that you are to go

639
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,666
before the board of directors
at the college.

640
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,785
They say you neglect your schoolwork.

641
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,874
They intend to expel you.

642
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,594
- No, no, no, they can't!
- Can't they?

643
00:59:11,694 --> 00:59:13,022
Father, the work I'm doing here

644
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:15,508
is far more important than anything
they're conducting at that damn...

645
00:59:15,608 --> 00:59:19,422
You're a fool, Victor.
You always have been.

646
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,226
If only you could have been
more like Henry.

647
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,561
But you...

648
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,765
You just bring shame
to the name Frankenstein.

649
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:32,168
I will ensure that the name of
Frankenstein is never forgotten!

650
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,774
You've done it again, Victor.

651
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:42,637
Only this time it's your
own life you've ruined.

652
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,158
So, what's this, then?

653
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,806
Finnegan's project.

654
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,962
My man.

655
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:38,039
He was going to be the modern Prometheus.

656
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:42,054
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

657
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:49,645
- He's also not nearly big enough.
- Yes. What?

658
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:54,117
Gordon was fast and strong, sure,
but he couldn't sustain any of that.

659
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,953
And towards the end, he was having
some real trouble breathing.

660
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:00,009
Breathing? Embolisms.

661
01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:02,740
Embolisms in his lungs. Yes, of course.

662
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,594
How stupid.

663
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,297
So much raw energy
coursing around his structure.

664
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,934
His body couldn't take the charge. Wretched
creature would've been dead in 10 minutes.

665
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,504
Yes, but if we want to build something
that can live and stay alive,

666
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,007
we'll need a lot more energy,
and I mean tons more.

667
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:20,643
Just stop. What could possibly
generate that kind of...

668
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:22,345
Lightning!

669
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,317
Yes, I have... just the thing.

670
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,053
One of my early designs
for the Lazarus Fork

671
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:34,157
incorporated a structure
that actually sucked its energy...

672
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,393
from the atmosphere.

673
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:38,595
It's possible that we can
build a larger version

674
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,532
that would simulate a static burst
similar to that of lightning.

675
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,568
No, it's the same problem.

676
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:47,604
We can't just make the body
accept that charge.

677
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,760
We are incapable of simply
making larger organs.

678
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,675
What if we gave him two sets of lungs?

679
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,684
You know you're brilliant, don't you?

680
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,734
Why wouldn't we? He's our man.
We can do what we like.

681
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:07,023
Not just two sets of lungs...

682
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,458
- Two hearts.
- Yes!

683
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,679
- Pump all that blood around the larger body.
- Absolutely. He'd need it.

684
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,299
Igor...

685
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,036
- Earlier, when my father was here...
- I was reading.

686
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:23,305
I didn't hear a thing.
Did he say anything interesting?

687
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,878
No, he didn't.

688
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,480
Whiskey?

689
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,215
Yes. Yes, do that.

690
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,562
A larger chest cavity
to incorporate four lungs.

691
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:48,063
Two sets on the left and the right.

692
01:02:50,116 --> 01:02:52,773
Bigger with the arms!
Bigger with the arms! Biceps.

693
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,772
- Now what do we do?
- Tilt him.

694
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:59,875
Backwards and forwards.
Let that liquid run through the body.

695
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,582
- Cheers.
- Here's to him.

696
01:03:02,682 --> 01:03:05,163
Flat... flat head.

697
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:09,118
- Why?
- Why? Because I like it, that's why.

698
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,653
To his two hearts.

699
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,470
Mmm...

700
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,749
Is that precious?

701
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,491
They've denied us the warrant, Inspector.

702
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:54,430
As the Magistrate said, with no sign of
any foul play, nor indeed of any crime...

703
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,798
No foul play?

704
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,868
Look at the debris at the Royal College.

705
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:01,851
Acid burns, the same.
Bloody paw prints on the floor.

706
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:05,574
Something's going on. Something's
happening in that basement, I know it.

707
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:10,565
I know it. And it's my job, it's my duty.
It's my moral duty to stop it.

708
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,649
But, sir, you have no warrant.

709
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:16,719
Yes, he's insulted you. Yes, he's clever.
But we have no evidence.

710
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,087
I don't care.

711
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:23,643
I need to find out
what's in that basement.

712
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:25,762
Now we can enact my true vision.

713
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:30,310
You and I will take life's raw elements,
its base components,

714
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:34,507
and we shall assemble them to our
own specification, to our own design.

715
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:41,423
For tonight we begin
our model of Prometheus.

716
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:44,546
Um...

717
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,785
Tonight... actually, Victor, I was...

718
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,320
- I've been invited to a ball.
- A what?

719
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,624
- A ball. Lorelei's asked me.
- Lorelei?

720
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,294
- Yes.
- No, no, no, no... don't speak.

721
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,195
Lorelei...

722
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,633
I shall stay here and work.

723
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,516
- I'm sorry, Victor.
- Really no need to apologize.

724
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:10,323
You should go off and enjoy yourself.
After all you deserve it.

725
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:12,658
You've earned it.

726
01:05:12,758 --> 01:05:14,973
You can go now.

727
01:05:15,073 --> 01:05:16,993
Thank you.

728
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,099
I don't know what to do.

729
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,770
You're already doing it.

730
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,316
Frankenstein, open this door!

731
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:05,201
We'll break it down!
Open this door now! Scotland Yard!

732
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:12,498
Frankenstein! Open the door!
Scotland Yard!

733
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:19,368
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

734
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:22,284
Harder. Harder.

735
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,411
Frankenstein! Open the door!

736
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,861
Open this door now!

737
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,478
- Victor, we have to leave!
- Where the hell have you been?

738
01:07:34,578 --> 01:07:38,554
- I was with Lorelei.
- Oh, I see. Wasting your time...

739
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,623
- with pointless courtship...
- Victor!

740
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,359
...while it remains to me to take care
of the work in hand!

741
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,443
Frankenstein! Open this door!

742
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,750
Frankenstein, we're coming in!
Get it off. Get this door down.

743
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,235
I've sent for one of Finnegan's men
to provide a carriage.

744
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,004
I'm trying to overload the conductors.

745
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,206
Forget the conductors!
We have to get out of here!

746
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,824
And let them have my machines?
Not bloody likely!

747
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:06,021
Trap door to the sewers,
it's the only way out. Try and open it.

748
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:14,287
Pickaxe on the ice closet.

749
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,430
- What are you waiting for?
- What is that?

750
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:26,169
Oh. Uh... Igor Straussman,
meet Igor Straussman.

751
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,272
What? What did you do to him?

752
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,574
Found him like that
a couple months ago. Overdose.

753
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,844
A couple of months? You took his eyes!

754
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:36,245
Victor, what is wrong with you?

755
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:40,049
You want to die in prison
executed by that maniac?

756
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,931
Hunchback!

757
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,855
Do you see the truth now?

758
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,758
This is the man
who took you from the circus.

759
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,060
Who would gouge the eyes
from a dead friend.

760
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,743
Move once more and I'll kill you.

761
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:57,867
Do as you wish. I have no fear of death!

762
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,815
Really?

763
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,652
I do.

764
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,821
I lost my wife...

765
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,283
to a malign growth.

766
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,615
And in my suffering I know about death.

767
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:17,868
That it's an abyss from which
no man nor woman can be returned.

768
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:22,058
Would you not rather
have her by your side?

769
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,974
Would you not have her live again?

770
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,710
She is alive.

771
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,199
In God's house.

772
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:33,168
And when I, too, fall into that abyss...

773
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:35,504
I shall be by her side.

774
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:39,342
Don't you see? You trust in a fiction!

775
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,358
And you shall be forgotten.

776
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,760
That's right.

777
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,285
History will bury you, Frankenstein...
and no man will remember your name.

778
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,036
No, you're wrong. Igor, no!

779
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,508
You'll remember me now.

780
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,059
Victor!

781
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:24,386
Come on, Igor!

782
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,642
Pull! Pull!

783
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,448
Frankenstein, we're coming in!

784
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,751
Inspector?

785
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:51,030
Finnegan.

786
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,482
Finnegan! Where are you?

787
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:57,286
Frankenstein! Igor!
What an unexpected surprise.

788
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,990
The police have raided my home
in search of Igor Straussman.

789
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,941
We managed to avoid incarceration,
but it's just possible

790
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:07,930
we might have gravely
wounded a police officer.

791
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,167
I suppose now you'll have
no choice but to leave London.

792
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,235
- Posthaste.
- Very good.

793
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,265
My family has an estate.
The Castle Erskine in Scotland.

794
01:11:16,365 --> 01:11:18,775
It's quite... rural and secluded.

795
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:23,746
Ideally situated, you might say, for...
both your needs as scientists and, um...

796
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,448
- well, fugitives.
- Yes.

797
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,251
I'll go and prepare the coach.

798
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,867
Very good, thank you!

799
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:34,156
- How could you do that to me?
- Do what?

800
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,026
To keep from me that you had killed
a man and given me his name!

801
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,895
I've already told you, I did not kill
Straussman. You're overreacting.

802
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:44,233
- You harvested his eyes!
- Details. The man was a waste of space.

803
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,870
This fanfare from you is more
than his own family will give him.

804
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,256
- Victor...
- Gentlemen, time is of the essence.

805
01:11:50,356 --> 01:11:53,692
- Your coach is ready.
- Come, Igor.

806
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:56,311
- We'll talk about this on the way.
- No.

807
01:11:56,411 --> 01:12:00,216
- What?
- What you're doing is wrong.

808
01:12:00,707 --> 01:12:03,419
- You've gone mad. Come.
- It's gone too far.

809
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:06,322
We simply do not have the time.

810
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:09,104
I'm not leaving then.

811
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,227
Listen to me.

812
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,830
- You have the chance here to be part of...
- Of what?

813
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:19,935
Of being lied to by you? Of being hunted
by the police and chased by monsters?

814
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,404
Well, if you're going to concentrate
on the dark side.

815
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,306
I'm not leaving.

816
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:27,410
What are you going to do? Go back to the
circus? Resurrect your illustrious career...

817
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,892
It's none of your concern.

818
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:37,066
You're a fool.

819
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,406
I created you.

820
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,731
You think that just because
I put you in a back brace,

821
01:12:45,831 --> 01:12:50,813
you think because you cut your hair...
you can turn your back on me?

822
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,570
That you can walk out
into the world on your own?

823
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:59,408
See how far you get with your acrobat
and your morals and your new life.

824
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:02,424
Just come with me.

825
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:08,864
Fine.

826
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:13,469
I'm done with you.

827
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:42,765
You know... I knew Igor Straussman.

828
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,988
He was a real bore.

829
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,725
Nouveau riche. Drug addict.

830
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:52,304
So, who are you then?

831
01:13:52,404 --> 01:13:55,828
Hmm? Doesn't matter really.

832
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:59,334
Victor's been very forthcoming
with his designs.

833
01:13:59,434 --> 01:14:01,884
But I still need him for now.

834
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:06,822
You, on the other hand...

835
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:11,580
So, let's see.
Your benefactor has departed...

836
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,498
your home has been ransacked by police...

837
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:19,502
your identity revealed as a fraud...

838
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:23,629
and you know far too much
for me to let you walk away.

839
01:14:25,744 --> 01:14:28,560
What I'm getting at, old boy...

840
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:31,233
is that you won't be missed.

841
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,386
Tie him up and put him in the carriage.

842
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:41,043
<i>You know, you and Victor
aren't the only ones with vision.</i>

843
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,289
I, too, have a dream of the future.

844
01:14:43,389 --> 01:14:46,816
<i>A dream where my family
will control this new technology.</i>

845
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,865
<i>Hmm? What's that?</i>

846
01:14:50,269 --> 01:14:55,524
You don't approve. No, I imagined you
and Victor wouldn't like that much.

847
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,394
You know, for men obsessed with death,

848
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,577
you think yourselves so above violence.

849
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,980
Curious.

850
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:07,737
<i>Good-bye, Igor.</i>

851
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:02,357
- Straussman wasn't Straussman.
- What?

852
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,027
The body, the frozen creature,
that was Straussman.

853
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,462
The young man pretending to be
Straussman was in fact the hunchback

854
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:09,698
- transformed by Frankenstein.
- Inspector, this is not...

855
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,200
They escaped in the Finnegan family coach.

856
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,304
Finnegan also attends the Royal College
of Medicine. It makes sense.

857
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,873
- He's in on it, too, maybe funding them.
- Inspector Turpin, stop...

858
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:22,011
My guess is that he's fled the country by
now, more than likely alongside Finnegan...

859
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:25,910
who, a little digging shows,
has an estate, Castle Erskine in Scotland.

860
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:28,484
- That's where we'll find them.
- Stop it, Roderick, damn it!

861
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:32,988
Listen to me! Listen to me! We can
catch them. We can catch them now.

862
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,323
We can...

863
01:16:35,423 --> 01:16:37,807
and we will.

864
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,765
What do you mean?

865
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,768
You're being removed from the case, sir.

866
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,670
From the whole force, in fact.

867
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,706
Constable Alistair
will be taking your place.

868
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,070
You are on a medical and mental reprieve.

869
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:58,727
You had no warrant, Roderick.

870
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:01,116
Do you have any idea
the lengths I have been to

871
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:04,620
in order to protect you
from criminal charges?

872
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,170
- It was a necessary action.
- Really?

873
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,273
In pursuit of what?

874
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,663
High society hunchbacks?

875
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:17,680
Undead monsters?

876
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:21,370
Conspiracies involving
one of the richest families in England?

877
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,854
Yes, a conspiracy to create life in...

878
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:30,625
a direct, defiant action against God.

879
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:34,883
You were the best detective Scotland Yard
had, but now it's time for you to rest.

880
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:39,726
You must heal. And when you return,
you will see things how they really are.

881
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,381
<i>Is that precious?</i>

882
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:34,590
I took possession of this
when I was... ten.

883
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:37,646
It was a very cold winter that year.

884
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:40,549
We lived in the country back then.
It was a happy time.

885
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:45,738
We crept out of my bedroom window because
we wanted to play in the snow and so we did.

886
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,557
Until we were...

887
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,906
engulfed by a blizzard.

888
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:55,110
I almost died.

889
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:59,968
Anyway, when... when the snow cleared...

890
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,651
and dawn finally broke...

891
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,255
I was alive.

892
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,088
I looked into my hand
and I was holding this.

893
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:15,157
It serves to remind me.

894
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,001
Remind you of what?

895
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,137
That God...

896
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,976
if at all He does exist...

897
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:32,091
sent us into this world imperfect.

898
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:35,804
We're weak.

899
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,987
We're fragile.

900
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,090
And we're destined to die.

901
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,701
This reminds me that
that is not good enough.

902
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:50,985
Who were you with?

903
01:19:51,085 --> 01:19:52,988
Hmm?

904
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:55,590
You said "we". In the blizzard.

905
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,572
Did I?

906
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,313
Where in God's name
do you think you're going?

907
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:22,117
You haven't been out of bed in weeks!
You can barely walk!

908
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,686
Igor. Igor, don't go. Don't do this.

909
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:28,456
I have to go. He needs me.

910
01:20:28,556 --> 01:20:31,526
You owe him nothing. You're your own man.

911
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:35,575
No. I'm the man he made me.

912
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,378
You're wrong.

913
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:43,004
You've always been this person.
This brave, brilliant, beautiful person.

914
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,275
He gave me a life.

915
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:50,078
I'm... I'm sorry, Lorelei, but...

916
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,662
you must understand, I have to go.

917
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:56,165
He's my friend.

918
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,594
Then you will not go alone.

919
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:16,446
<i>Two hearts. Pump all that
blood around the larger body.</i>

920
01:21:19,949 --> 01:21:23,613
<i>A larger chest cavity
to incorporate four lungs.</i>

921
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:26,497
<i>Two sets on the left and the right.</i>

922
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,696
<i>You and I, Igor, we shall create a man...</i>

923
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:44,405
<i>after our own image.</i>

924
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:52,838
<i>An intelligent...</i>

925
01:21:52,938 --> 01:21:54,815
<i>civilized...</i>

926
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:56,678
<i>man.</i>

927
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,013
Stop!

928
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,816
- Stop here!
- Whoa!

929
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:28,643
Finnegan's men.

930
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,725
Wait here.

931
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:35,565
Please take care.

932
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,565
- What are you doing?
- Go.

933
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:57,973
Hello?

934
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,256
Sorry, we seem to be lost.

935
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,718
Thank you!

936
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,478
What's this?

937
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:47,889
- Hold her here. I'm going to the castle.
- Sir, there is a storm coming.

938
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:52,141
That man is in allegiance with Satan...
and must be stopped!

939
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:12,480
All stations ready!

940
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,884
Engineers! Scientists! Eyes to me!

941
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:20,036
The storm is nigh! The storm is nigh!

942
01:24:20,136 --> 01:24:23,749
Conditions are perfect!

943
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:30,565
Electrical station ready, sir!

944
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:37,572
Prometheus moving, station one!

945
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:47,065
Stoke the furnace! We need it hotter!

946
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:48,975
Mind the blood pipe!

947
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:58,841
- Prepare the blood!
- Fluid station now!

948
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:02,744
- Now. Set?
- Set!

949
01:25:02,844 --> 01:25:04,399
- Inserting.
- In!

950
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,967
In. Tapped.

951
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:17,779
Respiratory station!

952
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,489
Prepare the respiratory station!

953
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:23,952
Victor.

954
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:25,787
Igor?

955
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:30,091
- I'm so glad you've come.
- Victor, Finnegan tried to have me killed.

956
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:34,229
I believe he intends to kill you, too,
when you've given him what he wants.

957
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:37,699
Now, we can still get out of this, Victor,
but you must stop this experiment.

958
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,435
- Father has sent you, hasn't he?
- Don't be ridiculous!

959
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:44,152
He'll stop at nothing,
and you don't know what he's capable of!

960
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,575
- I don't care.
- What?

961
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,611
Finnegan's motives mean nothing to me.

962
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:53,214
I will turn the tide of human
existence here, tonight.

963
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,408
Then this world which has spurned me...

964
01:25:56,508 --> 01:25:59,054
will forever remember my name!

965
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,590
No, if you do what he asks, no one
will remember Frankenstein the man.

966
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,976
Only the monster!

967
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:09,131
I forgive you, Igor.

968
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:13,482
I forgive you this remarkable lack
of foresight. So stay here!

969
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,105
Your brother was with you!

970
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:21,356
Henry Frankenstein.
He was with you that night.

971
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:24,579
Was he older or younger than you?

972
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,247
He was older.

973
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,397
You must have looked up to him.

974
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,221
Where did you get that?

975
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:36,255
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was your idea, though. Was it?

976
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,228
To go out into the snow.
And he protected you.

977
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:43,245
And he died while you lived.

978
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:48,236
Isn't that what all this is about, Victor?

979
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:53,162
You want to stop other people from
having to endure that pain that you felt.

980
01:26:57,412 --> 01:27:00,495
- No.
- No?

981
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,866
No.

982
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:10,179
It's about so much more than that.

983
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,330
Don't you see? To my mind...

984
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:18,379
I took my brother's life that night.

985
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:24,686
I have to redress the balance.

986
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:30,558
I have to create... life now.

987
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:34,449
Victor... none of this does that.

988
01:27:34,799 --> 01:27:39,602
This only brings
more and more and more pain.

989
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:46,060
And whatever path this is that
you've gone down, this is not you.

990
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,177
You're a good man, Victor.

991
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,476
- Igor...
- Frankenstein!

992
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:04,856
Frankenstein! Hurry, man!
The storm is almost upon us!

993
01:28:07,665 --> 01:28:11,160
Victor... don't.

994
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:16,555
Victor!

995
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,698
Station one ready!

996
01:28:32,574 --> 01:28:34,423
Prometheus moving!

997
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:39,047
Electrical station!

998
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:42,497
Electrical station ready, sir!

999
01:28:55,463 --> 01:29:00,890
Who'd have thought it, eh?
You and I on the threshold of immortality.

1000
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:08,194
Prometheus moving!

1001
01:29:08,554 --> 01:29:12,180
- Lazarus station!
- Damn them all, eh?

1002
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:16,265
The naysayers... and the hypocrites.

1003
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:24,092
For tonight, Victor, we breathe life...

1004
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,408
into flesh!

1005
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:34,122
Balloons released!

1006
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:54,457
Lazarus Fork.

1007
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:04,667
I will give you life.

1008
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:07,001
I will give you...

1009
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:08,983
life!

1010
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:15,491
Prometheus ascending!

1011
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:33,829
I want full power, on my mark. Now!

1012
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:37,432
Converter B standing by.

1013
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:40,048
Full power... now!

1014
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:45,188
All positions, relays open!

1015
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:52,447
This is your moment, Victor!

1016
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:56,498
Victor! It's too much power!

1017
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:01,017
<i>You know this story.</i>

1018
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:05,994
<i>The crack of lightning.</i>

1019
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:08,577
<i>A mad genius.</i>

1020
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,588
<i>An unholy creation.</i>

1021
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:15,450
Victor...

1022
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,886
don't!

1023
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:20,974
Live!

1024
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:08,636
Well, Victor.

1025
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:14,909
Sir, I must warn you...

1026
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:19,213
we are overloading!

1027
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:38,830
No!

1028
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,104
No!

1029
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:42,430
Frankenstein!

1030
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:47,388
You will burn for what you do here.

1031
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:51,625
This isn't science.
This is the work of Satan himself.

1032
01:33:55,263 --> 01:34:00,401
There's no Satan. No God. Only humanity.

1033
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:02,250
Only me!

1034
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:37,519
May God forgive you, Frankenstein!
May God forgive you!

1035
01:35:03,564 --> 01:35:07,418
Out of the way, Victor! Out of the way!

1036
01:35:07,518 --> 01:35:09,756
Come to me.

1037
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,958
I am your brother.

1038
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:04,355
Oh, my brother Henry, forgive me.

1039
01:36:06,944 --> 01:36:09,427
I have wronged you.

1040
01:36:10,447 --> 01:36:12,697
For this is not life.

1041
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:17,486
This is not life!

1042
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,975
You are not life!

1043
01:36:22,075 --> 01:36:24,141
- Live!
- Victor!

1044
01:36:24,241 --> 01:36:27,915
- Out of the way, Frankenstein!
- Live! Live! Live!

1045
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,499
May God drive out this devil,

1046
01:36:48,599 --> 01:36:52,673
and be driven back to the pits of hell
from whence he came.

1047
01:36:55,792 --> 01:36:57,508
No!

1048
01:37:34,681 --> 01:37:37,518
- Igor, I'm sorry.
- What are we going to do, Victor?

1049
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:40,167
What are we going to do now?

1050
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:46,373
We will do the only thing we can do.

1051
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:59,020
Huh?

1052
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:12,300
Shit.

1053
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:33,587
No!

1054
01:39:10,243 --> 01:39:11,592
Igor!

1055
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,362
Victor!

1056
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:30,511
Get off.

1057
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:08,716
Igor!

1058
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:11,785
Two hearts!

1059
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:15,322
No!

1060
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:47,274
Oh, my brother, forgive me!

1061
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:58,292
Victor?

1062
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:46,260
<i>Dearest Igor:</i>

1063
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:50,330
<i>I would have waited for you, but...
there's a crowd and all that.</i>

1064
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:53,300
<i>Besides, I think you've probably
had enough of my work.</i>

1065
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,170
<i>Truth be told, you've probably
had enough of me.</i>

1066
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:58,953
<i>Our time together is done.
Our achievements are in the past,</i>

1067
01:42:59,053 --> 01:43:02,109
<i>and our discoveries
will probably never be known.</i>

1068
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:07,414
<i>But I will always think of you fondly,
and always as my friend.</i>

1069
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:11,686
<i>As for myself I have some ideas
about where we went wrong this time,</i>

1070
01:43:11,786 --> 01:43:14,888
<i>and one day I may call on you once more.</i>

1071
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:16,590
<i>Be ready.</i>

1072
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:19,626
<i>For now, your life is your own,</i>

1073
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:22,343
<i>and I wish you luck with it.</i>

1074
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:27,702
<i>You are and will remain
my greatest creation.</i>

1075
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:31,051
<i>Your friend...</i>
