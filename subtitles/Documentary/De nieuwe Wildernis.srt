00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
"The silence of nature knows many sounds"
Henriette Roland Holst(1869-1952)

2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
The light brings on a new spring.

3
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,700
Underwater, the cycle of life begins anew

4
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,600
In the land that we have conquered from the sea...

5
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,900
we forgot a small piece:
the Oostvaarderplassen (Netherlands)

6
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,500
Here only the laws of nature rule.

7
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,100
This is about the rights of the strongest,
about cooperation and vitality...

8
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,800
about living and to let live.

9
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,500
In this context we are shown the
unprecedented power of nature.

10
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,100
For four seasons we stand eye to eye
with the animals that are our neighbours.

11
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,600
This is our land as we have never seen it.

12
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,900
THE NEW WILDERNESS

13
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,900
Here in the grasslands the wild horses
reign supreme.

14
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,000
Almost a thousand Queen's horses
form hundreds of families.

15
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,000
A black mare has been born.
That seldom happens.

16
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Foals are usually white as is
her cousin.

17
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,500
The black foal is a little shy.
She is hiding behind her mother...

18
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,300
and wants to spend the whole day
drinking her warm milk.

19
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,800
Her cousin is curious and playfull.

20
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
During the winter the Queen's horses
loose a lot of weight.

21
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,000
Now that the grass is tender and nutritious
everyone must graze...

22
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
to put on weight and strength.

23
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,200
One stallion is the leader.
He protects the family...

24
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,600
while the leading mare
has the "brains".

25
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,000
She know exactly where to find
the tastiest grass.

26
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,800
The world of the Queen's horses is
a world of scents.

27
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,700
Now that it is spring
and the mares are fertile...

28
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,400
they smell stronger than normal.

29
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,000
The young stallions are becoming
terribly excited...

30
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,600
by all the seductive fragrances.

31
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,100
They want to break the
head stallion's might.

32
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,300
They have to constantly keep an
eye on their rivals.

33
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,100
In the first 20 minutes after
the birth...

34
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,500
the two foals have two huge challenges:

35
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,100
walking and drinking.

36
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,600
The herd will not wait and
there is no room for weak animals.

37
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
They will be left behind.

38
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,800
The legs are as long as those of his mother.

39
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,400
Instinct know faultlessly what has to happen...

40
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
although it is easier said than done.

41
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,100
From the moment you arrive on this world
you have to fight to survive.

42
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Your brother, already a year old,
wants to snack off mother.

43
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,100
You want to as well,
but how do you do it?

44
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,000
All you know is that you have
to be by a dark place...

45
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
somewhere about eye level.

46
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,700
In the swamp, building is in full swing.

47
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,600
The birds fly to and from their nests
with building materials

48
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,500
Design and implementation, material choices
and construction...

49
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,500
are processed with great precision.

50
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,100
But the most important question
for spring is...

51
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,800
who will be your new partner.

52
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
This choice is not random.

53
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,600
Some birds swap partners every year...

54
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,700
others live their whole lives
together.

55
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,300
The cormorants and grebes get to know each other
with their mating dance.

56
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,100
Such courtship shows the strength
and beauty of the future parents...

57
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:51,745
and is carried out with great care.

58
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:10,503
The act of mating affirms the partnership.

59
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,613
And the beginning of a new adventure.

60
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:59,584
There are thousands of grey goslings born
and they need to graze.

61
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:02,661
They want to get to the grasslands
as quickly as possible

62
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,889
That is a journey full
of danger

63
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,156
The Mute Swan doesn't appreciate those dumb geese
with their young...

64
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:48,052
barging straight through his territory.

65
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,779
Two large geese hold the swan busy
while the group escapes.

66
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:26,077
The geese play a major role in the
management of the swamp area

67
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,788
By eating the reeds the geese
give variation to the swamp.

68
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,700
which allows many other bird
species to flourish

69
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:48,896
Under the ground, spring has also started

70
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:54,925
After months of darkness
the colletes bee awakens.

71
00:13:57,242 --> 00:14:01,442
On the first warm spring day,
exactly a half day after the males...

72
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,994
the females come out of
the ground en masse...

73
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:07,274
all together as if a giant alarm clock
has sounded

74
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,508
The feast of light is once
more enhanced...

75
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:15,763
by all the males flying in joyful
anticipation of the females

76
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:25,064
All day the bees are very busy
with each other.

77
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:28,113
The eggs are laid in little
underground holes...

78
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:31,076
and need until the next spring
to grow into bees.

79
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:46,746
No where in Europe do so many Queen's horses
live together in the wild.

80
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:51,004
This makes the special social structure
of the herd easily visible.

81
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,291
The families work together...

82
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:03,031
they use a complicated language
of sounds.

83
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:05,748
Body postures, gestures and odours.

84
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:14,986
It is warm on this spring day and the
horses are seeking to cool down.

85
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:38,116
For the mares this is an ideal moment to let
the foals get used to the water.

86
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:47,334
But the water is cold and one foal has
lost its enthusiasm

87
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:57,228
It has become too cold

88
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:07,958
The breeze has picked up and it is
rapidly becoming colder.

89
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,292
The mares are beginning to worry.

90
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,302
The foal is lying down too long.
It must get moving quickly.

91
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:16,337
otherwise it will die from hypothermia.

92
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:32,075
Family council.

93
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:20,923
Only the reddy-brown, childless mare is only too happy to help.

94
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:26,285
The head stallion soon lets it be known that
unrequested help is frowned upon.

95
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:22,332
Mother's love is big,
but permits no weakness.

96
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,970
The foal is severely dealt with,
it must get up and walk to survive.

97
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:44,911
Life is demanding and
this foal is fragile...

98
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:47,929
but it looks like it might survive.

99
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,630
In a peaceful corner of the swampland
by a toppled willow tree...

100
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,413
Kingfishers.

101
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:17,648
The Kingfisher male waits patiently
until the female has finished...

102
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,858
with the inspection of the nesting hole.

103
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:23,638
The root bulb seems to him an
exquisite place to nest.

104
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,016
The question is if she also agrees
with this.

105
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:33,653
Males have a black lower beak,
females an orange one.

106
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,859
To remove her last doubt,
he has a present for her.

107
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,234
That fish was a good idea.

108
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,182
The goslings need a lot of healthy grass.

109
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,500
Preferable, for safety sake,
they should be close to the water.

110
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:36,103
But there isn't enough grass.

111
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:40,271
There is no other choice
than to take a risk.

112
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:50,751
The parents are on their utmost gaurd.

113
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:55,904
They know danger looms not far from
the water's edge

114
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:50,134
The fox has more prisoners
than he can eat today.

115
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,821
He doesn't kill for pleasure.

116
00:25:52,908 --> 00:25:57,608
What he has in excess, he buries for later.
Nothing is wasted.

117
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:06,917
It is an honorable burial.

118
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:10,006
Young foxes also need to eat.

119
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:25,711
To sharpen their reflexes and to
learn to deal out their cache fairly...

120
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:29,382
the young spend all day at loggerheads.

121
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:33,759
They must, because
the strongest hunter will survive.

122
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:13,986
They do not yet need to hunt,
that will come later.

123
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:18,665
Mother supplies the food, but they
must prepare it themselves.

124
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:27,908
Today we are eating geese, the same as yesterday
and presumably tomorrow.

125
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:32,529
Tasty, but you do get a dry mouth
from all those feathers.

126
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,326
Spring is already coming to
an end for the bees.

127
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:56,024
They are quickly gathering
the last of the food inside.

128
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:04,298
The Earth Bumblebee has
only just begun.

129
00:28:07,014 --> 00:28:09,914
The workers comb a large
area for food...

130
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,019
and find the path to the nest again...

131
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,079
by memorising many points
in the landscape.

132
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:24,116
The nest is now full of
working females.

133
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:31,024
Everything revolves around the queen.

134
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:34,793
She is elected by her hive
and thereafter heavily fed.

135
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:39,421
She gets fertilized once
and she survives just one winter.

136
00:28:41,477 --> 00:28:44,977
The queen must now live up to the task of
producing masses of eggs...

137
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:47,177
so that next year there
will be new queens...

138
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:49,911
that will supply new hive members.

139
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:14,489
The kingfisher has the beaver as
the closest neighbour.

140
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,100
In the spring they immediately begin
the repair of winter's damage...

141
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:20,193
to their nests.

142
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:30,487
The marriage that started with a fish
has in the meantime produced young birds.

143
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:42,223
The male must wait a while
with his shopping...

144
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:44,435
because there is faeces in the way.

145
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,859
That's what you get with kids!

146
00:29:56,588 --> 00:30:00,588
He know well what he has started,
he has to work his butt off.

147
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:04,556
At least 40 times a day he
flies to and fro with fish.

148
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,170
After the cleaning the female takes
a bath and makes herself pretty.

149
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:20,588
That at least shows the male
why he is doing all this.

150
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,190
Almost no-one knows that this
is a nightingale.

151
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:45,991
It sings, of course, mostly overnight.

152
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,261
Full-on spring!

153
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:25,481
In the swamp the new day is
being welcomed...

154
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:28,217
by the symphony of the cormorant...

155
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:32,377
reed bunting...

156
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,956
Bluethroat...

157
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:41,062
Sedge warbler...

158
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:49,075
and Savi's warbler.

159
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,508
and breakfast...

160
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
comes along by itself.

161
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:02,027
In the grasslands the stallions
begin a special showdown.

162
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:04,709
The horses fight with
self-control.

163
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:08,688
It is about the ritual, about the
order of the group.

164
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,970
Scents are as important to these horses
as words are to us.

165
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:23,113
The dung tells the stallions about
the position that they occupy in the herd.

166
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,306
The rank order constantly changes .

167
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,740
Ambition or the lack thereof,
strength, masculinity...

168
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:36,393
it appears to be all written
in the waste products.

169
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:43,535
Everyone profits from each other.

170
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,680
In the dung of the queen's horses
a new world is created...

171
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:48,987
That of the dung flies

172
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,998
The males fight about
the best spots.

173
00:33:56,594 --> 00:34:01,094
This dung heap is great for mating
and laying eggs.

174
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:03,742
As soon as a female comes past...

175
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:07,405
they jump en masse into the air
to grab her.

176
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,158
They are over the moon about it.

177
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:28,713
They themselves are so busy
they almost forget the females.

178
00:34:58,187 --> 00:35:02,987
All that buzzing and flying
attracts yellow wagtails

179
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:09,014
In this bursting fly-in restaurant
they enjoy a welcome snack...

180
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:12,082
on their migration to
the north.

181
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,160
When the dungfly male has
taken the female...

182
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:23,909
he protects her until she
lays the eggs.

183
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:43,224
The eggs are equipped with a sort of armband...

184
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:46,935
so that they don't sink
too deep into the dung.

185
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:56,599
Flies, horses and birds.
Three different worlds...

186
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,770
but inextricably joined to each other.

187
00:36:18,184 --> 00:36:21,484
In the cormorant colony the young
are growing like a weed.

188
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:23,987
They always want to eat more.

189
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:30,311
The coming of a strong north-westerly wind
makes it difficult for the parents

190
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:35,674
They must sometimes fly for tens of kilometers
to find the best fish.

191
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:41,611
Not only does the strong wind cost more time,
but also much more energy.

192
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,510
With this bad weather the young need
more food to keep warm.

193
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:52,255
The cormorants store their catch
in their crop.

194
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:56,161
They fly as low as possible
to take advantage of the air cushion...

195
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,950
that because of their wing beat
exist just above the water.

196
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:21,974
Just like cyclists they fly in formation
to save energy.

197
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:46,973
After a long arduous flight, landing in this
strong wind is a tricky art.

198
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:00,628
Having gone to so much trouble,
their crop is nearly empty.

199
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:03,526
The food that was intended for the young...

200
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,980
was food that the fisher itself
needed for fuel.

201
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,571
There is no other choice:

202
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:15,874
They need to immediately resume fishing
even though they are so tired.

203
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,364
Something is in the air

204
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:34,164
There is bad weather is on the way.

205
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:44,048
Cold and warm air layers collide

206
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:48,229
The recipe for a perfect
summer storm

207
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:40,951
When you experience your first thunder and
lightning storm it's very frightening.

208
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:49,008
Even Queen's horses know not to shelter
under a tree during a thunderstorm.

209
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:53,841
The whole herd escape to the safe boundaries
of the area.

210
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:42,134
Some animals are happy with the thunderstorm.

211
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:46,032
So, during the night, the lust of the
Natterjack toads awakens

212
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,190
Due to the heavy shower the pools
wherein they have propagated...

213
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:52,789
have filled with fresh rain water

214
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,248
With loud raised voices
the males roar to their females.

215
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:04,964
the vocal lure can be heard for kilometers.

216
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,380
The whole region profits from
the rainwater.

217
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,530
Now millions of tadpoles
appear.

218
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:52,146
And even more waterfleas.

219
00:43:02,307 --> 00:43:04,807
Thus, because so much food is available...

220
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:09,069
there appears a patient enemy,
the Rod bug.

221
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:19,687
With one hefty storm the whole
system has come into motion.

222
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:52,670
Seldom does he let himself be seen:
the Bittern

223
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:58,962
Here he has found a place
where he feels safe.

224
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:01,759
That doesn't count for the brown frog.

225
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,206
He's on the bittern's menu.

226
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:32,364
Because of the high water level
and temperature...

227
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:34,931
the Carp have become active.

228
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:43,824
The carp must spawn in shallow water.

229
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:08,489
The long journey makes them vulnerable,
foxes also eat fish.

230
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:42,275
The males scour their flanks along
the belly of the females...

231
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,123
to stimulate the release
of the spawn.

232
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,130
During this process the carp have not noticed
that the water has again dropped.

233
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:05,074
It is now too shallow.

234
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:37,572
The wind has dropped.

235
00:46:38,828 --> 00:46:42,228
But not in time for the cormorants.

236
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:52,144
For far too long it has blown fiercely...

237
00:46:52,204 --> 00:46:56,604
and in all that time they have
not been able provide enough fish.

238
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:06,873
The young are hungry and are begging
their distraught parents.

239
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:14,537
They try to regurgitate something,
but their crop is empty.

240
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:28,180
The youth wants to really fish himself,
but he can't fly yet.

241
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:44,074
And when mother returns from her last
fishing trip, the chick has died.

242
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:53,449
In good years, the cormorants bring
up two young per nest.

243
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:59,997
This is an exceptionally
bad year.

244
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:04,784
On average less than one young
per nest grows up to be an adult.

245
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:22,110
Nothing is for nothing. Everyone carries their burden,
fights for their kind...

246
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,760
and feels instinctively that they cannot do
without the others, in life and in death.

247
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:34,391
The carp marriage ends in a sad tone,
but the wedding feast is for the brown rat.

248
00:48:35,098 --> 00:48:38,098
The blowflies lay their eggs
in the dead fish.

249
00:48:38,263 --> 00:48:42,263
They become maggots and attract other
guests to come .

250
00:48:45,564 --> 00:48:50,264
The sadly beached carp are exactly
what this waterway needs.

251
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:55,243
With this she can give her chicks
a good start to life.

252
00:48:55,714 --> 00:48:59,014
The young get cleanly rinsed maggots.

253
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:59,016
It is high summer. The wheel of life
is turning at full speed.

254
00:49:59,138 --> 00:50:01,638
There is food in surplus.

255
00:50:02,571 --> 00:50:05,371
In the rough vegetation the
field thistles are being sucked dry...

256
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:07,458
by masses of aphids.

257
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:12,310
Their excretions is called honey dew
and that is a sweet waste.

258
00:50:12,478 --> 00:50:15,278
Ants find it delightful.

259
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:20,922
In their turn the ants
milk the aphids.

260
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:30,051
The aphid enjoy working with them,
but do want something in return.

261
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:34,899
The ant must stop his greatest enemy, the larvea
of the ladybird bug.

262
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:38,771
And that is something you don't
have to tell an ant twice.

263
00:50:50,218 --> 00:50:54,418
It is now warm enough for the green-veined
white and small cabbage white butterflies.

264
00:50:54,496 --> 00:50:56,896
Finally they can fly.

265
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,339
The caterpillars from the cabbage white
feed on the leaf...

266
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:08,549
of the exuberant yellow flowering
black mustand.

267
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:35,551
As soon as they have become butterflies,
they fly to the field thistles.

268
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:37,873
For the nectar

269
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:42,554
Having eaten, it is naturally
time for propagation.

270
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:55,148
The males don't shrink from
interrupting each other's lovemaking.

271
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:07,216
They are small and vulnerable,
but the mutual ties are strong.

272
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:11,772
Thus the strength and vitality of the whole
system is guaranteed

273
00:52:12,617 --> 00:52:16,917
Every creature knows:
Alone I will never survive.

274
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:39,266
The ladies and the gentlemen deer
live apart.

275
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:43,486
Only when it is time to mate
will they seek each other out.

276
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:52,129
The last get-together was very
productive.

277
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,635
Hundreds of deer calves have been born.

278
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:59,256
They wait while the mothers
graze elsewhere with the herd.

279
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:07,710
They are not too good on
their hooves the first few days.

280
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:15,846
The ground begins to tremble. The calf
chooses the sure from the unsure.

281
00:53:15,865 --> 00:53:19,265
and seeks a safe refuge
in the tall grass.

282
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,450
The Queen's horses are having the spring sillies...

283
00:53:28,535 --> 00:53:30,535
and they are trotting in stampede.

284
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:34,643
Why? Maybe just because it is fun.

285
00:53:57,603 --> 00:53:59,703
The horses are looking on in surprise.

286
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:02,431
They are used to their foal,who
immediately after birth...

287
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,472
Will attach themselves to the herd.

288
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:07,507
While deer and horses normally
shun each other...

289
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,810
it appears here that the mother instinct is stronger.

290
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:13,901
They try to force the deer calf
into action.

291
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,570
But the calf is keeping well down.

292
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:30,931
The young foxes are beginning to get
interested in the outside world.

293
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:37,051
Soon this will be their hunting terrain,
so the sooner they learn the better.

294
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:33,327
At the end of the day the does
come to gather their calves.

295
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:39,521
The mothers find them by calling out,
and then listening very carefully.

296
00:55:39,563 --> 00:55:44,163
The calves make unique sounds
that the mother can recognise.

297
00:55:45,644 --> 00:55:51,144
No calf is left behind. Without effort
mother and child are reunited.

298
00:56:28,332 --> 00:56:30,732
A group of spoonbills
has come together...

299
00:56:30,756 --> 00:56:33,856
to profit from the
water teeming with life.

300
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:37,999
With their long beak
they search for insects and small fish.

301
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:54,824
For the cormorant chicks
it is time to leave the nest.

302
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:06,672
They might be as large
as their parents...

303
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:09,894
They still can't do anything for themselves.

304
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,190
They must now fish by themselves.

305
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:26,305
Although this still means figuring out
what is fish and what is not

306
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:50,690
A kingfisher must be very
stress resistant.

307
00:57:50,778 --> 00:57:53,178
Everything goes fast in their world.

308
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:56,258
The chicks are not five
minutes out of the nest...

309
00:57:56,337 --> 00:57:59,937
and father expects them to fend for themselves.

310
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:23,468
Mother has already had enough of the young fry.
They have to go.

311
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:27,175
The parents want to start a new path
as soon as possible.

312
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:40,967
They show them how to fish a couple of times
and then it's up to them.

313
00:58:57,831 --> 00:59:03,831
Nicely caught, but unfortunately, not a fish.

314
00:59:07,524 --> 00:59:10,724
But still, within four days, the young kingfishers
will be independant...

315
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:13,841
and will leave the parents territory.

316
00:59:39,094 --> 00:59:42,694
Now as the summer is progressing
the nights are getting colder.

317
00:59:49,505 --> 00:59:54,105
At this time the Queen's horses come
together in one large herd.

318
00:59:57,387 --> 01:00:01,987
All the families have merged.
Including the family with the black foal.

319
01:00:03,379 --> 01:00:07,679
It is a peaceful scene,
but that is from an outward appearance.

320
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,271
But there is serious unrest.

321
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:16,082
Groups of single young stallions
live in the herd.

322
01:00:16,163 --> 01:00:19,863
There, swirling testosterone is
overflowing in their veins.

323
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:25,661
They want to be the alpha male,
they want to mate, they want power.

324
01:00:32,653 --> 01:00:36,053
The young stallions place the leaders
under severe strain.

325
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:39,507
The alpha males must protect their families
from these attacks.

326
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,439
The prize of leadership is high.

327
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:49,533
A dominant alpha stallion often
has many scars from earlier fights.

328
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:02,003
A young challenger suspects weakness
and starts the attack.

329
01:01:21,498 --> 01:01:24,098
Another light coloured stallion
appears on the scene.

330
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,381
He has a wholly different strategy.

331
01:01:26,677 --> 01:01:30,877
He doesn't attack the leader, but chases the
challenger away because he realises:

332
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:35,270
if you show a little bit of cooperation,
you can achieve a whole lot more.

333
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:39,391
The old stallion is well aware of it.

334
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:43,711
It costs him a lot less energy
to keep his family together

335
01:01:45,957 --> 01:01:49,157
The challenger is contemplating a new assault...

336
01:01:49,203 --> 01:01:52,503
but he realises that something has changed.

337
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,211
This is the deal between the
young and the old stallion:

338
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:01,956
If you help,
you can maybe be my successor.

339
01:02:04,364 --> 01:02:07,164
But the lead stallion
is a tough teacher.

340
01:02:07,426 --> 01:02:11,726
The white stallion must constantly show
that he is taking the task seriously.

341
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:43,067
The young one is now servant
and plays an important role in the family.

342
01:02:43,877 --> 01:02:48,577
That gives him respect
and a higher place in the pecking order.

343
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,230
The challenger gives up.

344
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:59,829
the assaults on the position of the
lead stallion will keep coming...

345
01:02:59,978 --> 01:03:03,178
But, for the time being, peace has returned.

346
01:03:09,783 --> 01:03:12,683
You do not achieve success
by using brute force.

347
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,180
You achieve it with carefully forged
cooperatives...

348
01:03:16,241 --> 01:03:21,241
wherein the balance between giving and taking
is continually renegotiated.

349
01:03:32,724 --> 01:03:35,324
For today the poleaxe
will be buried.

350
01:03:35,406 --> 01:03:39,106
The herd relax and enjoy
the late afternoon sun.

351
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:46,597
During these last summer days does it seem
that there is an enormous, humming...

352
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:52,718
Singing, neighing, quacking,
lowing organism has been created.

353
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:58,583
On such a day it is hard to imagine...

354
01:04:58,673 --> 01:05:01,473
that a new season is lurking ahead.

355
01:05:40,448 --> 01:05:41,648
Autumn...

356
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,771
and the air is pregnant with hormones.

357
01:05:50,299 --> 01:05:52,999
Now the animals are gorging themselves
on fruits and seeds to make themselves...

358
01:05:53,065 --> 01:05:56,765
as strong as possible to go into winter,
and the days are getting shorter...

359
01:05:56,813 --> 01:06:00,213
the thicket seems to explodes
with a ferocious roar.

360
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:03,047
It is the time for the
red deer rut.

361
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,463
But first for some sparring.

362
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:13,591
And flinging some grass in the air
also makes a good impression.

363
01:06:15,464 --> 01:06:18,864
The old deer wants to be involved
one more time.

364
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:22,970
He has to pump himself up
to tackle his rivals.

365
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:28,036
By peeing on himself, he underlines
his status and manliness.

366
01:06:28,093 --> 01:06:30,493
The smell also makes sure
that the females know...

367
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:33,332
that they have to be with him
if they want to be protected.

368
01:06:34,287 --> 01:06:36,287
It is all about the females.

369
01:06:36,473 --> 01:06:40,873
the deer must gather and fertilize
the greatest possible harem.

370
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:57,359
The luck of the draw
turns out bad for the leader.

371
01:06:57,692 --> 01:07:01,892
His first opponent is the biggest
and strongest in the herd

372
01:07:01,927 --> 01:07:04,527
They size each other up.

373
01:07:12,788 --> 01:07:15,288
The fight is short.

374
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,420
The challenger achieves a convincing
win in his first fight.

375
01:07:29,442 --> 01:07:34,442
Unfortunately the ladies are less than
impressed with this manly conduct.

376
01:07:37,423 --> 01:07:40,723
How difficult it may seem
you must not be too hasty.

377
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,710
It will be another two weeks to
the peak of the rutting season...

378
01:07:43,766 --> 01:07:46,166
when the real decisions will be made.

379
01:07:47,607 --> 01:07:49,707
Hidden between the field thistles...

380
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:52,576
the old deer keeps a eye on his opponents.

381
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:56,590
The most tropical bird in the Netherlands,
the goldfinch...

382
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:59,111
keeps him company.

383
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:16,870
It's a feast.

384
01:08:16,905 --> 01:08:21,405
A fast expanding swarm of starlings
have discovered an overladen elderberry tree.

385
01:08:21,462 --> 01:08:24,162
Dinner is in full swing.

386
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:47,214
In appreciation of the lift the sparrows leave
a track of elderberry poo behind.

387
01:08:55,567 --> 01:09:00,567
It appears the Queens don't care at all
that they are becoming like purple zebras.

388
01:09:18,848 --> 01:09:22,348
In the horse dung the starlings are
looking for insects.

389
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,829
They have developed strong beak muscles...

390
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:26,513
To make digging easier.

391
01:09:31,224 --> 01:09:32,724
The black foal is doing her best...

392
01:09:32,732 --> 01:09:35,132
To gorge herself for the coming winter.

393
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:38,349
But she does not find it really tasty.

394
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:42,476
Friends of her age have grown rapidly.

395
01:09:42,576 --> 01:09:46,776
And the young stallions are constantly
busy with mock fights.

396
01:09:56,584 --> 01:10:00,584
The mare foal likes nothing better
than to be close to her mother.

397
01:10:05,195 --> 01:10:09,795
Compared to her cousin,
she is lean and scraggy.

398
01:10:17,495 --> 01:10:19,895
This is a nasty situation.

399
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:24,311
The large grazing animals must now build up
their fat reserves for the winter.

400
01:10:24,407 --> 01:10:26,807
They become some 70 kilos heavier.

401
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:29,836
In times of scarcity you must
build up this layer of fat...

402
01:10:29,837 --> 01:10:33,637
otherwise there is a chance that
you will come short of spring.

403
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:48,804
The rut is at its peak.

404
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:07,225
The strongest deer have formed harems.

405
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:13,199
The most important issue, copulation,
is not decided by macho behaviour.

406
01:11:13,293 --> 01:11:16,293
Tenderness play a role just as important.

407
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:18,417
The deer can put on a sturdy effort...

408
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,370
but it is up to the does;
they decide by whom they are fertilized.

409
01:11:26,993 --> 01:11:29,193
The memories of his previous might and glory...

410
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,679
forces the old deer to have a go
one more time.

411
01:11:41,487 --> 01:11:47,787
He doesn't have a chance. His pride is broken
as he leaves his last defeat.

412
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:30,192
Nearby the red deer rut
things are getting harsh.

413
01:12:30,258 --> 01:12:34,958
More then by injuries, the weaker
animals are giving up due to exhaustion.

414
01:12:35,003 --> 01:12:37,003
The ongoing fights demand the utmost...

415
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:40,185
and that costs them their resistance.

416
01:12:40,974 --> 01:12:43,474
The  first to discover this are the ravens.

417
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:49,101
And thereafter the foxes.

418
01:13:22,348 --> 01:13:26,648
Death is just as important as life,
as nothing is wasted.

419
01:13:27,922 --> 01:13:30,922
Out of death, life begins again.

420
01:13:31,706 --> 01:13:34,106
After a month only the bones are left...

421
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:38,520
and has provided a tasty food
for tens of creatures.

422
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:47,029
The wilderness of the Oostvaarderplassen
clothes itself...

423
01:13:47,033 --> 01:13:50,333
deep in autumn, in a dense fog.

424
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:11,650
As pale angels the great silver herons
stand in the shallow water

425
01:14:52,263 --> 01:14:54,863
End October brings on the first
barnacle geese.

426
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,560
After a flight more than 3000 Km
from their brooding places...

427
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:01,773
on Nova Sembla and in east Russia

428
01:15:04,869 --> 01:15:09,169
More than 30,000 geese come here
to hibernate.

429
01:15:14,705 --> 01:15:18,305
When they land, the frost will soon begin.

430
01:15:52,009 --> 01:15:55,209
The foals see snow for the first time.

431
01:15:56,947 --> 01:16:00,547
Again, every member of the herd has to get
used to the hard water.

432
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:37,057
A northeasterly wind carries in cold air.
The temperature drops rapidly.

433
01:16:37,924 --> 01:16:41,024
The queens know that together
they can withstand much more.

434
01:16:41,121 --> 01:16:45,421
They stand close together and
turn their backsides into the wind.

435
01:16:50,326 --> 01:16:53,726
The youngest and weakest horses
get to stand in the warmest places...

436
01:16:53,795 --> 01:16:55,995
in the middle of the group.

437
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:04,407
But the black foal
steps out of this shelter.

438
01:17:04,444 --> 01:17:08,744
She is hungry and is looking for food.
This is a dangerous sign.

439
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:26,475
There is now almost nothing to eat.
The horses now rely on their fat reserves.

440
01:17:26,549 --> 01:17:29,949
She has eaten too little,
hence not enough reserves.

441
01:17:30,017 --> 01:17:34,117
Therefore it will become extremely difficult
to survive the winter

442
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:50,242
The hunting grounds are becoming
scarce for everyone.

443
01:17:50,308 --> 01:17:53,208
The fox and the buzzard
are forces to search longer and longer.

444
01:18:00,288 --> 01:18:04,088
There is no doubt that some field mice
are hiding under the snow.

445
01:18:04,135 --> 01:18:06,935
But they are no easy prey.

446
01:18:10,547 --> 01:18:12,347
It is freezing.

447
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:20,691
Eating is hardly possible while drinking
is now more and more dificult.

448
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:33,429
The queen's horses abandon the open plain.

449
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:37,904
Grass has become unreachable
under the layer of snow and ice.

450
01:18:38,178 --> 01:18:42,278
They now search for their preservation
under the shelter of trees and bushes.

451
01:18:55,661 --> 01:18:58,561
Death is lying in wait everywhere.

452
01:18:59,813 --> 01:19:03,413
Water is freezing rapidly and is dangerous.

453
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:11,975
The leg is frozen and nothing can be done.

454
01:19:18,009 --> 01:19:21,609
Connecting with the herd
is no longer possible

455
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:26,840
Without the protection of the group,
the chances of survival are slim.

456
01:19:33,155 --> 01:19:35,455
The winter is ruthless.

457
01:19:35,513 --> 01:19:39,313
It's freezing, it's blowing a polar wind,
it's snowing.

458
01:19:39,386 --> 01:19:42,486
Everyone is sorely tested.

459
01:19:56,988 --> 01:19:59,888
All the animals have moved away
from the plains.

460
01:20:00,147 --> 01:20:04,347
Only the mute swans won't give up their spot.

461
01:20:25,747 --> 01:20:27,947
The clouds pull away.

462
01:20:29,232 --> 01:20:32,732
The earth radiates out its last warmth.

463
01:20:35,068 --> 01:20:39,368
It is the harbinger of a period of Siberian cold.

464
01:20:40,366 --> 01:20:45,166
Some animals can't handle the hardship
of this hard winter.

465
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:52,332
With the great wisdom of
their instinct...

466
01:20:52,393 --> 01:20:54,593
they feel they may not see in
the coming spring...

467
01:20:54,611 --> 01:20:58,511
and find a place to die.

468
01:21:02,099 --> 01:21:05,099
However sad the loss of a life is...

469
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:09,634
the group, the most important unit, survives

470
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:36,141
On the spot where life is celebrated
so intensely...

471
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:38,749
is the death just as important.

472
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:55,679
Bearded reedling roam the reedbeds
in large groups.

473
01:22:57,917 --> 01:23:00,617
They've eaten insects during the whole summer.

474
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:05,081
They switch their digestive system over
and pounce on reed seeds

475
01:23:05,112 --> 01:23:08,212
Very different, but also tasty.

476
01:23:31,105 --> 01:23:34,505
The other swamp birds
are not such easy eaters.

477
01:23:34,531 --> 01:23:37,331
They want fish, and that's that.

478
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:46,117
But they swim relaxed, unreachable,
under the thick layer of ice.

479
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:55,367
The kingfisher male has decided
to spend the winter here.

480
01:23:55,455 --> 01:23:59,555
This is to make sure that next year
he will still own this territory.

481
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:04,130
His partner and all the others have already
flown south beyond the frost line.

482
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:08,296
He had not counted on such a cold winter.

483
01:24:08,902 --> 01:24:13,402
But it is too late as his last fishing
spot has frozen over.

484
01:24:13,768 --> 01:24:16,368
The kingfisher must eat every hour.

485
01:24:17,262 --> 01:24:20,462
A few hours without and he starves.

486
01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:24,453
The cold then rapidly gets him
in its deathly grip.

487
01:24:43,718 --> 01:24:47,918
A redbreast and the black foal
keep each other company.

488
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:51,680
The little foal digs the reed roots
and that brings out insects...

489
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:54,342
that the redbreast eats with gratitude.

490
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:57,559
They have become allies.

491
01:24:58,748 --> 01:25:01,448
The foal has used up all of her fat stores...

492
01:25:01,517 --> 01:25:04,317
and has no more reserves.

493
01:25:26,592 --> 01:25:30,492
The little grebes have found the last
piece of water.

494
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,057
They just beat the bittern to it.

495
01:25:55,315 --> 01:26:00,915
The hungry bittern decides to attempt
to catch one of them.

496
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:05,453
but they are on to him.

497
01:26:09,008 --> 01:26:15,208
And then it appears there is much
easier prey amongst the reeds.

498
01:26:59,495 --> 01:27:02,595
The horse with the frozen leg
didn't make it.

499
01:27:06,213 --> 01:27:10,013
That is the chance the foxes and ravens
have been waiting for.

500
01:27:10,065 --> 01:27:14,865
For them the heavy winter regularly
reserves a rich menu.

501
01:28:12,462 --> 01:28:16,662
Although You can now eat what you want,
the nutritional value is minimal...

502
01:28:16,713 --> 01:28:19,113
and you use more fat than
you produce.

503
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:25,455
What you have added on in summer,
determines what you can lose in winter.

504
01:28:26,213 --> 01:28:28,513
Mother's milk is finished.

505
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:35,189
With the coming of a clear bitterly cold night
the end is also approaching.

506
01:29:07,929 --> 01:29:11,529
The family mourns the loss of their young.

507
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:28,040
They travel further, because only the
strongest will survive.

508
01:29:46,488 --> 01:29:51,288
And a little friend brings a last greeting.

509
01:30:19,478 --> 01:30:22,078
There is always a new beginning.

510
01:30:23,026 --> 01:30:26,026
Always there is the next sunrise...

511
01:30:26,641 --> 01:30:28,841
the next spring...

512
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,457
the next generation.

513
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:46,688
The light returns and
warms the chilled earth.

514
01:30:48,745 --> 01:30:50,545
After a long, severe winter...

515
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:54,790
the circle of life begins to turn
again at full speed.

516
01:33:01,335 --> 01:33:04,535
In the land the people have
captured from the sea...

517
01:33:04,664 --> 01:33:08,364
in a time when nature is under
pressure from everywhere...

518
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:12,239
here it is displaying an unprecedented
strength and richness.

519
01:33:16,162 --> 01:33:17,862
A foal has been born.

520
01:33:17,949 --> 01:33:21,149
a foal that lives in freedom amongst
hundreds of thousands of people...

521
01:33:21,213 --> 01:33:23,613
in the densely populated land of Europe...

522
01:33:24,044 --> 01:33:28,944
In the New Wilderness.

523
01:34:12,748 --> 01:34:19,248
The see eagle is breeding again in the Netherlands
for the first time since the middle ages

524
01:34:21,714 --> 01:34:26,614
Nowhere in Europe do so many red deer live together.

525
01:34:28,489 --> 01:34:34,989
The fox hunts in The New Wilderness during the day.
That's something you almost never see anywhere else.

526
01:34:36,769 --> 01:34:40,169
In 1978 the silver heron found a brooding site here
and this has in the meantime...

527
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:44,059
grown into one of the largest
colonies in north-west Europe.

528
01:34:45,886 --> 01:34:52,786
The biggest wild horse herd in Europe
lives in the Oostvaarderplassen.
