{1}{1}29.970
{10152}{10216}{Y:i}I was born in Vienna
{10224}{10381}{Y:i}to a family that had long|established itself there.
{10413}{10576}{Y:i}They saw themselves|as Austrians, Viennese.
{10598}{10677}So, I have to say that until -
{10720}{10841}I was at Velden, near Pörtschach.
{10893}{10996}It was summer vacation,
{11006}{11129}and I was swimming happily
{11140}{11287}until Zsigo Wertheimer asked me|if I wanted to swim for Hakoah.
{11293}{11372}Back then,|I didn't know what Hakoah was.
{11413}{11499}I had no connection to Judaism,
{11509}{11670}like a little Gentile girl who, at 15,
{11704}{11815}joins a sports club|because she can swim well.
{11818}{11866}That’s all.
{11877}{11990}Later it had a much more|profound meaning.
{16983}{17135}{Y:i}I was a promising swimmer|in Hakoah,
{17139}{17198}{Y:i}but I was still young.
{17218}{17346}{Y:i}My sister Judith|was the real champion.
{17381}{17511}{Y:i}Every day at 6:00 p. m. Sharp|I visit her.
{17522}{17652}{Y:i}We drink some vermouth|and have a chat.
{17662}{17813}{Y:i}Since we both love poetry|we read some poems.
{17902}{17937}Cheers.
{18225}{18297}Let’s read a bit...
{18328}{18413}from "Poet’s Love. "
{18416}{18527}"- A boy"-|"- A boy loves a girl"-
{18533}{18594}Speak more slowly.
{18597}{18732}{Y:i}A boy loves a girl.|She has chosen another.
{18737}{18877}{Y:i}That other loves another|and it is this one he has wed.
{18919}{18963}"The girl"-
{18967}{19046}{Y:i}in anger takes|the next best fellow
{19053}{19173}{Y:i}who comes her way.|The boy takes it badly.
{19197}{19305}{Y:i}It is an old tale,|but it always stays fresh,
{19317}{19461}{Y:i}and to whom it actually happens,|it breaks his heart asunder.
{20014}{20083}What type of swimming|were you the champion of?
{20086}{20126}The crawl.
{20177}{20221}What distance?
{20270}{20373}I wasn't so great in the 100 meter,|good in the 400,
{20376}{20494}but in the 500-1,500,|I was the best.
{20535}{20703}Later, others swam faster,|but in my day, I was the best.
{21053}{21107}Is Hanni a good sister?
{21128}{21201}- I beg your pardon?|- Is Hanni a good sister?
{21207}{21248}Excellent.
{21345}{21418}Were you friends as children too?
{21437}{21499}Not always.
{21514}{21639}I remember when I decided...|it was nonsense.
{21650}{21729}I think I was 12.
{21743}{21885}We've been friends ever since.|Sisters and friends.
{21930}{22037}I saw pictures of you in Pörtschach.
{22039}{22133}Yes, at the Wörthersee.
{23708}{23818}Hakoah was formed
{23822}{23898}for the following reason:
{23937}{24021}In Austria...
{24053}{24199}an Aryan Clause was introduced.
{24208}{24257}That is,
{24298}{24439}in Vienna there were 200,000 Jews.
{24443}{24504}They had many children.
{24527}{24591}Some clubs -
{24619}{24738}soccer clubs, swimming clubs -
{24742}{24866}wouldn't accept Jews.
{24920}{25087}That’s why, in 1909,
{25090}{25179}Hakoah was formed.
{25182}{25233}It was announced:
{25236}{25345}"Here, Jewish children,
{25348}{25458}Jewish youth, can practice sports. "
{32794}{32898}That trip was very significant for me.
{32917}{32987}It changed my whole life.
{33006}{33079}I don't know how to describe it.
{33082}{33171}I simply fell in love with the country.
{33174}{33275}The freedom, the welcome,
{33278}{33379}the way Jews treated me.
{33407}{33476}I wasn't used to things like that.
{33483}{33570}I was told what it meant|to be Jewish.
{33596}{33691}Suddenly I felt that|maybe I did belong.
{33695}{33802}Maybe it was wrong|that I felt so alienated.
{33881}{34106}I was a guest|of the Biran family in Haifa,
{34151}{34251}and they were so warm|and so kind to me
{34255}{34372}that I wanted to stay,|not to leave them,
{34402}{34519}because it was a very different life|from the life I had at home.
{34538}{34659}At home there was a huge distance|between children and parents,
{34677}{34758}and there, they were together.
{34762}{34836}They respected their children.
{34851}{34935}They were interested in what I did,
{34938}{35017}what I studied,|what I wanted and didn't want.
{35050}{35106}It was a real change.
{36218}{36289}When I returned home to Vienna,
{36318}{36427}I told my parents that I had decided|to emigrate to Palestine.
{36455}{36563}My father took my hand and said:
{36566}{36646}"I am very glad to hear it. "
{36663}{36727}He was being sarcastic, of course.
{36745}{36871}"When are you going? Tomorrow?|The next day? In a month? When?"
{36908}{37065}I was so offended by his response,|because he didn't take me seriously.
{37112}{37151}Yes?
{37264}{37432}Fate had it,|that after the Anschluss, in 1938,
{37463}{37586}my parents|had to leave their home
{37589}{37664}and their coffee house,
{37680}{37759}and they were left with nothing.
{37795}{37882}Through me, and through Hakoah,
{37902}{37996}they were able|to get onto an illegal ship,
{38000}{38060}that took them to Palestine.
{38062}{38122}It saved their lives.
{38128}{38249}So that sarcasm:|"When are you going to Palestine?"
{38312}{38367}With lots of-
{38412}{38467}It wasn't just sarcasm.
{38499}{38566}It was humiliating, simply humiliating.
{38573}{38671}"That stupid girl|wants to go to Palestine. "
{38690}{38809}Later they learned that|Palestine saved their lives.
{42157}{42272}{Y:i}In Vienna I didn't look at him,|because he didn't look at me,
{42329}{42457}but when I was on the bus with him,|yes, I did look at him.
{42459}{42573}But that was it.|We didn't get involved.
{42580}{42706}Through Hakoah|and the Hakoah newsletter,
{42716}{42806}we knew all about each other.
{42813}{42936}The next time we met was a year ago.
{42942}{43055}One day I got a phone call|from this lovely lady,
{43073}{43165}whom I hadn't heard from in years,
{43168}{43338}inviting me for coffee and cake|on such and such a day.
{43342}{43471}We went to the Kapulsky Café|by the beach.
{43473}{43572}We got there at 8:45,
{43583}{43692}and the first time I checked my watch,|it was already 11:45.
{43706}{43849}We enjoyed the company so much,|talking about the memories,
{43900}{44009}and we've been together ever since.
{44023}{44102}That’s it. I got caught in the net.|What can I do?
{44132}{44217}Be careful.|You may just fall out of the net.
{44310}{44424}Can love still happen at your age?
{44434}{44494}Do you understand what he's asking?
{44497}{44621}Yes, I do, but you answer first.
{44636}{44690}Definitely.
{44694}{44730}Meaning?
{44732}{44778}With passion...
{44820}{44942}and physical attraction.
{44944}{45025}Maybe the style is different,
{45027}{45116}but yes, it’s very satisfying.
{45163}{45221}- It is, isn't it?|- Yes.
{45899}{46034}Hakoah isn't a subject|for some dry lecture.
{46038}{46084}It’s like a folk tale.
{46119}{46237}{Y:i}A Jewish boy had to study,|had to get his doctorate,
{46265}{46347}{Y:i}had to go into his father's business.
{46379}{46443}{Y:i}But to be an athlete?
{46464}{46607}The greater the success,|the more people wanted to join.
{46641}{46716}{Y:i}So they formed a swimming section,
{46743}{46799}{Y:i}a water polo section,
{46828}{46898}{Y:i}wrestling, etc.
{46919}{46976}{Y:i}Over the years,
{46979}{47120}Hakoah Vienna became|the biggest sports club in the world.
{47126}{47229}I've researched all over the world,
{47233}{47322}including the U. S. A., Germany, etc.,
{47328}{47409}and I haven't found a sports club
{47413}{47501}with so many active members -|over 3,000-
{47509}{47644}who participated in competitions|in all branches of sports.
{47658}{47792}And as I told you before, there was|not one Austrian national team...
{47798}{47875}that didn't have|at least three, four,
{47878}{47963}if not 90% Hakoah Vienna members.
{51443}{51545}You wanted to know about|the 1936 Olympics,
{51557}{51648}when Hitler was the dictator there.
{51733}{51843}We never went to Germany|once Hitler was in power,
{51858}{51970}but Judith had to represent Austria,
{51973}{52047}because she was the champion.
{52054}{52211}If I remember correctly,|she broke 12 records that year.
{52241}{52330}It was Judith and|two other Hakoah swimmers.
{52353}{52437}She went to our father and said:
{52443}{52509}"What do you think?
{52512}{52630}I don't think I should go to Hitler.
{52639}{52770}There are signs in all the parks|and the pools saying:
{52782}{52897}'Dogs and Jews are forbidden. '
{52906}{52987}Exactly that: 'Dogs and Jews. "'
{53024}{53097}So our father said:
{53100}{53180}"Judith, it’s your decision,
{53199}{53378}participating in the Olympics|for a swimmer
{53399}{53553}after devoting half your life
{53563}{53657}and not to reach this peak,
{53661}{53757}is a really tough decision,
{53763}{53847}but I can't influence you. "
{53872}{53953}Then Judith decided,
{53958}{54078}with great courage, in my opinion,
{54104}{54165}"I'm not going. "
{54518}{54586}{Y:i}The Olympic games have begun.
{54615}{54704}{Y:i}The best athletes in the world|have gathered in Berlin.
{54794}{54869}{Y:i}The best in the world|have come to Berlin.
{54890}{54996}{Y:i}Fifty-one countries|compete for victory.
{55048}{55214}I claim you were the first person|who stood up to Hitler.
{55218}{55265}True.
{58011}{58160}{Y:i}As Führer and Chancellor|of the German Nation and Reich,
{58180}{58283}{Y:i}I herewith announce|before German history...
{58288}{58403}{Y:i}the entry of my homeland|into the German Reich.!
{59636}{59704}The "Gemütlichkeit," the coziness.
{59707}{59796}Where was the "coziness"...
{59821}{59946}when they chased us,|humiliated us, insulted us?
{59950}{60020}Where was the "coziness"?
{60043}{60199}The Viennese charm.|Where did it disappear to?
{60258}{60376}I can't forget the humiliation|we experienced,
{60399}{60500}the rejection, the danger,|the fear,
{60517}{60616}and the persecution|of so many people,
{60634}{60702}friends and family.
{60767}{60819}I can never forget that.
{60845}{60973}I can never meet people -
{60977}{61062}I automatically start to calculate
{61074}{61163}how old they were in 1938.
{61186}{61333}If they are around my age,|I can't even look at them.
{61364}{61489}I was at a psychologists'|conference in London,
{61537}{61640}and I don't know how this man,
{61642}{61748}who was around my age,|found out.
{61772}{61831}He was Austrian.
{61833}{61941}I knew who he was,|because he gave a very good lecture.
{61970}{62064}He approached me,|and I turned around and left.
{62068}{62119}I just couldn't -
{62148}{62181}The memory?
{62187}{62242}Yes.
{62245}{62399}Maybe I can't forgive,|maybe I can't understand.
{62402}{62456}I just can't.
{63722}{63868}I can't find Mr. Rosenfeld.|Do you see Mr. Rosenfeld?
{63880}{64030}He and Zsigo saved|everyone from the Nazis.
{64035}{64088}It was amazing.
{64118}{64217}Mr. Rosenfeld was our President.
{64221}{64378}He escaped to London.
{64382}{64440}The Nazis were so furious that,
{64444}{64553}when they only found his dog,|they killed it.
{64557}{64653}Zsigo, our trainer, also escaped.
{64656}{64786}Together, they saved|all the Hakoah swimmers.
{64788}{64836}It was amazing.
{64844}{64941}They stole stamps|and did all kinds of things
{64945}{65010}to save all the swimmers.
{65031}{65116}I was only 17.
{65119}{65226}My sister was a year older.
{65228}{65339}Hakoah approached my parents
{65350}{65502}and offered to take us|on an illegal ship.
{65507}{65613}{Y:i}No one knew where|and if we would arrive.
{65616}{65773}We arrived a month later,
{65788}{65941}from Vienna to Israel|on an illegal ship.
{65972}{66126}That’s why this thought and memory
{66135}{66214}has stayed with me until the end.
{66217}{66337}I believe that because of Hakoah,|we were saved.
{78514}{78591}Tell me about the trip to Vienna.
{78599}{78642}How do you feel about it?
{78648}{78723}Initially, I told you that|I didn't feel like going.
{78730}{78820}To London, I'd go tomorrow.|I don't feel like going to Vienna.
{78827}{78901}When you said "Opera,"|I was a little tempted.
{78908}{79006}Or operetta.|I hear there isn't much opera now.
{79020}{79193}But you really got me when you said|I could bring my granddaughter.
{79207}{79354}To spend five days with Amiti,|just me, that’s wonderful!
{79455}{79522}It’s not easy to go back there.
{79558}{79649}There are too many painful memories.
{79683}{79757}But on the other hand,
{79762}{79841}maybe it’s good to go back.
{79847}{79953}Maybe I can mend those memories.
{80439}{80484}Judith!
{80517}{80576}So, Judith, this is it.
{80643}{80690}- Bye!|- I'm going.
{80897}{80993}- Shall I walk you home?|- Yes, please.
{81852}{81938}{Y:i}Only you, Vienna
{81941}{82005}There's a song like that.
{82178}{82341}{Y:i}You must always be|the city of my dreams
{82343}{82486}You must always be|the city of my dreams.
{82499}{82596}But they left me, those dreams.
{84801}{84893}But what did we do wrong?
{84953}{85000}Here. Here.
{85445}{85516}Things have changed a lot.
{85582}{85646}A bit. A bit.
{85648}{85702}More than a bit.
{85752}{85866}I don't know how long it’s been|since you were here, but -
{85870}{86005}My memories go back|long before you were born.
{86046}{86173}- 63 years.|- Oh, that is a long time.
{86177}{86256}Did you emigrate to America?
{86277}{86311}Pardon?
{86315}{86390}- Did you emigrate?|- Yes.
{86407}{86496}- Well, they kicked me out.|- You don't say.
{86500}{86650}But I was lucky enough|to be able to get to America.
{86934}{87040}I lived here for a year and a half|under Hitler.
{87133}{87218}- Not pleasant.|- When was that?
{87238}{87375}From Hitler's entry,|the so-called Anschluss,
{87379}{87458}in March 1938,
{87482}{87561}until August 1939.
{87615}{87735}I was on the ship|when the war broke out.
{87829}{87935}- Those were terrible times.|- Yes.
{87957}{88026}- Not for everyone.|- That’s right.
{88030}{88102}Not for everyone, but for most.
{88124}{88167}For...
{88251}{88320}non-natives, so to speak.
{88332}{88489}Well, I can't see myself|as a non-native.
{88493}{88602}My mother was born in Vienna.|I was born in Vienna.
{88605}{88703}But that’s the way it was.
{88706}{88779}You weren't German, so to speak.
{89060}{89158}{Y:i}And he said "non-native"today.
{89944}{90025}Over 65 years.
{90054}{90114}I can't believe it!
{91842}{91911}This isn't very crunchy either.
{91932}{92017}- Wonderful.|- You should take it back.
{92021}{92125}- Do you have to touch everything?|- I washed my hands.
{92445}{92540}My girl wants hot chocolate.
{92542}{92612}He was so handsome.
{92615}{92680}Yes, we were crazy about him.
{92816}{92858}That’s me.
{92861}{92927}No, that’s me. That’s Ruth.
{92931}{93005}This is the water polo team.
{93007}{93116}- That’s Arthur Körbler.|- I don't remember him.
{93120}{93218}I was madly in love with him|on the "Roma" deck.
{93222}{93366}Do you remember Pauli Steiner?|But he wasn't interested at all.
{93373}{93456}- He wasn't interested in me.|- His loss.
{93458}{93542}Judith, you, Ruth,
{93546}{93626}Lucie, and me in Pörtschach.
{93628}{93694}What a fantastic figure!
{98861}{98941}{Y:i}In 1936 they held|the Olympics in Berlin
{98949}{99127}and the Olympic torch passed through|Vienna on its way to Berlin.
{99142}{99325}They invited all the sports clubs|to a parade.
{99327}{99431}It was full of people from all sides.
{99451}{99596}The EWASK marched|and everyone cheered.
{99602}{99651}They shouted "Bravo! Bravo!"
{99655}{99757}They also shouted "Heil Hitler!"|Which was forbidden then.
{99761}{99879}Until 1938, the Nazis were outlawed.
{99908}{99982}Then we marched,
{99986}{100079}and there was silence.
{100104}{100165}It was totally silent,
{100204}{100315}a silence full of fear.
{100327}{100421}You can't imagine it.
{100430}{100553}From both sides,|we felt the hatred,
{100574}{100670}mass hatred.
{100686}{100790}I felt terrible.
{101019}{101195}It really was one of|my most horrible experiences.
{101212}{101329}It ended when we all ran quickly,
{101333}{101446}very quickly, back to our club.
{101453}{101586}We had a clubhouse.
{101611}{101683}We ran as fast as we could.
{101687}{101756}We were afraid someone|might attack us.
{101760}{101815}Really quickly.
{101817}{101895}We went in and shut the door,
{101898}{101984}and we all hugged and kissed.
{101988}{102095}It felt so good to have friends,
{102101}{102161}to belong.
{102166}{102236}Never mind what happened.|I belonged.
{102244}{102365}I thought about it years later.
{102380}{102496}When you have such hatred|from the masses,
{102508}{102662}the hatred of the masses,|the fear and danger-
{102692}{102791}That’s it.|That’s the story of this place.
{102797}{102861}It’s the first time I've heard it.
{102870}{103026}The first time you've heard it?|It stayed deep inside me.
{103246}{103289}That’s it.
{103322}{103364}Finished.
{103431}{103541}- It won't happen to me again, right?|- Right.
{103545}{103661}And it will never happen to you either|Never, never.
{105749}{105778}Good evening.
{105780}{105855}{Y:i}He followed her trail
{105862}{105940}{Y:i}Because he desired her so
{105947}{106027}{Y:i}All the way to the hunting ground
{106032}{106121}{Y:i}There he spoke to her:
{106157}{106241}{Y:i}Schnucki, oh Schnucki
{106252}{106310}{Y:i}Let’s go to Kentucky
{106315}{106368}{Y:i}At the Old Shatterhand Bar
{106371}{106421}{Y:i}Plays an Indian Band
{106427}{106477}{Y:i}Then off to the pampas
{106482}{106531}{Y:i}For a glass of champagne
{106536}{106588}{Y:i}The train leaves at 7:30
{106591}{106648}{Y:i}I have spoken. Cheers.!
{106659}{106774}{Y:i}A good drop, three times daily
{106792}{106921}{Y:i}That’s the best medicine
{106940}{107082}{Y:i}When something special happens
{107097}{107243}{Y:i}Is there reason to despair
{107260}{107429}{Y:i}Then a larger dose strengthens
{107449}{107610}{Y:i}And you'll get healthy as a bear
{107617}{107699}{Y:i}Hello
{108007}{108113}{Y:i}When the day awakes,|before the sun smiles
{108117}{108224}{Y:i}The columns are marching|to the day's toils
{108227}{108341}{Y:i}Into the breaking dawn
{108345}{108449}{Y:i}And the forest is black,|and the heaven is red
{108454}{108556}{Y:i}And in our bags we have|a piece of bread
{108560}{108685}{Y:i}And in our hearts the sorrows
{108707}{108827}{Y:i}Oh Buchenwald,|I cannot forget you
{108841}{108937}{Y:i}Because you are my fate
{108963}{109070}{Y:i}Whoever leaves you,|he alone can measure
{109074}{109171}{Y:i}How wonderful freedom is
{109196}{109314}{Y:i}Oh Buchenwald,|we don't lament and wail
{109318}{109420}{Y:i}Whatever our fate may be
{109432}{109549}{Y:i}But we want to say|yes to life
{109553}{109665}{Y:i}The day will come|when we are free
{109686}{109802}{Y:i}But we want to say|yes to life
{109807}{109908}{Y:i}The day will come|when we are free
{109945}{110013}Who woulïve thought|that Leopoldi,
{110016}{110127}an assimilated Jew,|and an Austrian patriot,
{110140}{110281}would be one of the first sent to|Buchenwald after the Anschluss in 1938.
{110283}{110431}Ironically, it was there|that he met Lehár's librettist,
{110433}{110568}the first president of Hakoah Vienna,|Fritz Löhner "Beda".
{110576}{110719}The commander of the camp|ordered them to write
{110722}{110850}the infamous "Buchenwald March. "
{110883}{110993}On a freezing night|in December 1938,
{111017}{111146}over 7,000 prisoners were lined up|in the roll call square.
{111149}{111273}There they had to practice the march,
{111277}{111403}and they couldn't go to sleep,|until the commander was satisfied.
{111427}{111605}No one who was there will ever forget|that horrifying concert.
{111659}{111774}{Y:i}Oh Buchenwald,|I cannot forget you
{111777}{111883}{Y:i}Because you are my fate
{111906}{112019}{Y:i}Whoever leaves you,|he alone can measure
{112024}{112135}{Y:i}How wonderful freedom is
{112160}{112279}{Y:i}Oh Buchenwald,|we don't lament and wail
{112286}{112389}{Y:i}Whatever our fate may be
{112416}{112539}{Y:i}But we want to say|yes to life
{112543}{112663}{Y:i}The day will come|when we are free
{112689}{112822}{Y:i}But we want to say|yes to life
{112826}{112968}{Y:i}The day will come|when we are free
{113351}{113411}He went too far.
{117575}{117704}"To the best friend,|and loyal Hakoah member,
{117707}{117786}your grateful club members. "
{120491}{120541}Don't experiment.
{120545}{120651}- I don't want to stay here.|- Not yet.
{120716}{120780}That’s how life is.
{120811}{120880}He was a -
{120884}{120961}Yes, a driving force, a character.
{120964}{121073}Someone who knew us well,
{121076}{121148}not always in the best situations,
{121150}{121235}but he was an important figure for us.
{121282}{121399}Without him we wouldn't have been|as good as we were.
