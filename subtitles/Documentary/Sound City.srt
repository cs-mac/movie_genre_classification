00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,289
Okay, you ready? Yep.

4
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,290
We're rolling.

5
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:15,924
1, 2, 3, 4.

6
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:40,252
We were just kids... with nothing
to lose and nowhere to call home.

7
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,455
But we had these songs...

8
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,759
And we had these dreams.

9
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,428
So we threw it all in the back

10
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,496
of an old van and just started driving.

11
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,038
Our destination - Sound City.

12
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:28,666
Watching the world through a
windshield, there's no looking back.

13
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:32,201
<i>We left everything behind.</i>

14
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:44,818
<i>When you're young, you're not
afraid of what comes next.</i>

15
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,319
<i>You're excited by it.</i>

16
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,735
We were driving a van that could
break down at any moment...

17
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,836
Going on tours that could be

18
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:07,939
canceled at any moment...

19
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,041
And playing music with people

20
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:14,678
who could disappear at any moment.

21
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:32,798
We had no idea that the next 16 days
were gonna change our world forever.

22
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:44,043
But I remember pulling into the
parking lot and thinking, "Really?

23
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:48,048
This is Sound City?"

24
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:54,287
You know, it's weird, like,
when you walk into Sound City,

25
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,888
you either love it or you hate it.

26
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:58,226
Looks kind of dumpy.

27
00:04:58,227 --> 00:04:59,127
It's a shit-hole.

28
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:01,695
Everything was secondhand.

29
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:05,599
It was something of a time
warp, I think, or something.

30
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:13,640
Brown shag carpet on the
wall - that's the kind of thing

31
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:15,309
that you would do to your van.

32
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:19,044
It was like, "Well, the place
is already kind of trashed, so

33
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,714
anything goes, you know?"

34
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,850
It was dirty.
Didn't really feel like I wanted

35
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,886
to sit on any of the furniture.

36
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:28,623
You could record there and
not come back for 15 years and

37
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,291
walk in, and it's the exact same

38
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,026
as the last time you were there.

39
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:33,361
The parking lot used to

40
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:34,996
flood, and it used to make a

41
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:39,031
wave that came up the hallway of
Sound City.

42
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:43,771
Sound City was like, you
know, you could put your

43
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:45,273
cigarette out on the floor.

44
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,743
A bottle of Jack Daniel's got
spilled all over the carpet.

45
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:50,612
"Who cares? It's Sound City.
Who cares?"

46
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:53,783
I always say, you could, you
know, piss in the corner and

47
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:55,184
nobody would complain.

48
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,889
It was just a little more

49
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,659
fucked-up than I thought it

50
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,860
should be.

51
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:06,829
But walking down the hallway and

52
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,397

The only reason why the
studio business survived was

113
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,730
because the building ownership

114
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,397
was Tom, and Tom would not

Somebody at Sound City came

135
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,044
up with this idea - "We could

00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:05,946
start a record company".

137
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,514
So that was my goal, to

138
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:09,516
produce some records and have a

139
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,385
hit record and make a lot of

140
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:12,019
money.

141
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:13,153
That was the whole reason we

142
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:15,422
bought it.

143
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:22,831

It was in the Valley, but we

144
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:24,432
only used the Valley to get to

145
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,165
Hollywood.

146
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,934
The Valley was just this flat

147
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,368
expanse of too many houses

148
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,069
already.

149
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:30,972

150
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:32,373
of not happening at all.

151

161
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:54,362
because of the cars that I was

00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,063
driving.

163
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,598
And I didn't have a license, you

164
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,233
know, because I was Canadian.

165
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:59,634
I wasn't even supposed to be

166

there.

167
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:03,304
About five minutes later,

168
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,609
they just got in their cars and

169
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:09,113
drove off.

170
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:13,282
I made the record in my

171
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,049
house.

172
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,185
Most of it, I did in my house.

173
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,354
And then we went to Sound City

174
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,623
with Briggs, my producer, and we

175
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,892
put down a piano song called

176
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,059
"Birds" there.

177
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,294
Then, we did the vocals, and

178
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:26,662
then they sounded so good that I

179
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,097
said, "Well, hell, let's just

180
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:28,998
sing everything".

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,200
So it's really a hybrid record.

182
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:34,009
♪ I can love

183
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,910
♪ I can really love
♪ I can really love

184
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:43,613
My dad and Joe were partners
in crime. They were very close.

185
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,248
They were thick as thieves.

186
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,917
Tom was, like, the business

187
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,485
guy and stuff like that, but Joe

188
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:50,220
was the heart of it all, really.

189
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:51,988
Sweetest guy in the universe.

190
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,423
Absolutely one of the nicest,

191
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:55,425
truest people I've ever known.

192
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:59,764
He wasn't a guy in a suit who
was counting money and just

193
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:00,665
trying to rip off as many

194
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,165
musicians as he could.

195
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,233
That wasn't his thing.

196
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,467
He loved the fact that bands

197
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:06,002
were coming in and making great

198
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:07,537
records there.

199
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:13,176
Joe was always, like, positive, more
optimistic. Always, "The next big thing's

200
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:15,578
gonna be out there".

201
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,616
Joe gave me time to learn and

202
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:20,518
to hone what I do.

203
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,523
He was quite a guy.

204
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,425
When we bought the studio, we

205
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,226
were struggling for a year or

206
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,594
two, and we could see we

207
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:32,396
couldn't just get the premier

208
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:32,997
acts.

209
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,498
You needed state-of-the-art

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,567
equipment to get the top acts

211
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,235
with the top budgets.

212
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,338
So it was my goal to do that.

213
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,347
This guy, Rupert Neve,
designed these next-generation consoles.

214
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:51,248
I had flown to England, and I

215
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,251
saw one once, and they were like

216
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,087
this, you know, built like a

217
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,322
brick shit house.

218
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:59,224
He was, you know, a genius

219
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:00,058
engineer.

220
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,027
There's only four like this in

221
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:04,029
the world, and this is the only

222
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:06,064
one that was custom-ordered from

223
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:09,303
the factory by Keith.

224
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:14,275
There is something about
the Neve sound

225
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,376
that my ear has always been attuned to.

226
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:18,210
They're mathematically crisp

227
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:19,378
and very, very good.

228
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,313
They're just very solid.

229
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:24,318
It's like a tank or something.

230
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:27,119
The Neve thing is - there
just weren't that many made,

231
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,420
because they're so handmade.

232
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,723
This Neve board that you talk about,

233
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:32,058
you know, this is not my world.

234
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:35,259
Engineers have to spend, like,
hours on the

235
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,629
kick-drum sound.

236
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,532
Please, I would rather have a

237
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,633
blood transfusion.

238
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,468
But I do remember that there was

239
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,203
something different about the

240
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:45,138
sound of this board.

241
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,406
And then of course, everybody -

242
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:47,707
"Oh, my god, it's a Neve board,"

243
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,012
I'll never forget them saying.

244
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:55,148
A recording console is like

245
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,583
the center of the spaceship.

246
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:58,718
If you're gonna fly to Mars, you

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,819
got to have something with all

248
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,121
the master controls.

249
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:04,458
It looks like, you know, the

250
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,794
<i>Enterprise on steroids, from a</i>

251
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,963
long time ago.

252
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:11,398
A desk that's like a giant
stereo, except instead of doing

253
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,100
bass, middle, and treble, it's,

254
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:14,568
like, you can do that on each

255
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,270
drum, you know, each mike, each

256
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:17,171
thing.

257
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,706
All the microphones in the

258
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,342
studio are routed into that

259
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,377
console.

260
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,712
From there, you can change E.Q.,

261
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:28,182
add effects, change the levels.

262
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,250
And that goes into the tape

263
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:33,620
machine, where it's recorded.

264
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:41,329
This board, if you put a
fader up and turn the mike pre

265
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,765
up, and somebody hits a tom-tom

266
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:46,101
or a snare drum, it sounds

267
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,270
great.

268
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:53,308
It sounds wide-open. It sounds huge.
If you turn the mike pre up too

269
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,312
loud and it distorts, it still

270
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:59,647
sounds great.

271
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,815
That's analog.

272
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,250
It's how it sounds.

273
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:10,592
Especially Neve's, you know.
I mean, everything is just better.

274
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,360
The human voice sounds better.

275
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:13,862
When you got harmonies going

276
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:15,464
together, they kind of meld

277
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:16,866
together.

278
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:21,337
♪ You come on with a come-on ♪
♪ You don't fight fair

279
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:22,671
The Neve console really

280
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,173
embellishes things in the

281
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:25,441
context of rock 'n' roll.

282
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:26,542
It's good on drums.

283
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:27,576
It's good on bass.

284
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:28,711
It's good on guitars.

285
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:30,446
It's the facilitator.

286
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,581
It's a pretty badass console.

287
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,816
♪ Hit me with your best

288
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:35,251
shot ♪

289
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,619
It's unlike any other Neve

290
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:38,254
console that I have ever worked

291
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,655
on, and I've been lucky enough

292
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,490
to work on a ton of them now.

293
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:43,159
It would always be the

294
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,927
greatest-sounding desk I've ever

295
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:45,794
tracked on.

296
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:53,271
There is a large number of
modules about which look the

297
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,572
same, but which are marginally

298
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:55,805
different.

299
00:14:55,807 --> 00:15:00,544
The circuit was a microphone
amplifier circuit.

300
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:02,612
Cross-talk between circuits and

301
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:04,548
between buses was absolutely

302
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,782
paramount.

303
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:11,756
The way that transformer behaves
with DC flowing in it can vary

304
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:13,357
according to the material of the

305
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,926
core and the gapping of the

306
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:16,826
core.

307
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,663
If those things are properly

308
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,766
controlled, you get a very sweet

309
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:23,967
sound.

310
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:31,642
Rupert Neve is a fucking

311
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,544
genius.

312
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:41,822
At the time, that Neve
console cost $76,000.

313
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,623
To give you an example, I'd just

314
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,591
bought a house in Toluca Lake,

315
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:48,392
and I paid $38,000 for the

316
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:48,893
house.

317
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,495
My wife would've killed me if

318
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:55,934
she'd known I was doing that.

319
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:57,969
I thought, "If this place ever

320
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,604
goes under, that's the thing

321
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:03,575
that will pay all the debts".

322
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:05,844
The first track we cut on

323
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:08,447
this was "Crying in the Night"

324
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,382
with Buckingham Nicks.

325
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,017
Very first thing done on that

326
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:15,020
was that session.

327
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:18,757
That's how it started.

328
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,029
♪ She was that kind of lady

329
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:28,667
♪ Times were hard, whoa

330
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:29,968
We signed them to a

331
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,036
production deal.

332
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:32,771
They write their own songs.

333
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,673
So all we'd provide would be the

334
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,475
studio, the engineer, and the

not even thinking anything other than,

407
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:23,678
"I've heard some good music that

409
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:28,518

411

414

Everything was good.

415
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:37,995
Fleetwood Mac had had

416
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:39,530
a few albums with Peter Green in

417
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:40,698
England that had been

418
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,499
successful.

419
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:43,000
Then after Peter left,

420
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:45,102
Bob Welch, who then joined the

421
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:46,938
band, was more of a jazz

422
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,839
guitarist.

423
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:49,173
Mick called me.

424
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:51,642
"Bob Welch just left the band".

425
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,845
I phoned Keith Olsen.

426
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,681
I said, "You know the tape that

427
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:57,882

428

430
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:04,522
And Keith's like, "Well,

431
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:06,724
there is a problem there,

432
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:09,260
because you will never get him

434

435

girlfriend, too.

436
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:15,534

it.

438
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:28,482
We joined the band the first
day of 1975.

439
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,583

hadn't have been there?

471

The main reason it was

472
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:42,022
important was so that we got a

fantastic drum track.

474
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:47,861
It's the drum sound.

475
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,597
Let's start there, 'cause it's

476

something we all love.

477
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:23,732
The drums and the feel of a song
are like the heartbeat of the song.

478
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:25,300
It can be the backbone of the

song.

480
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:27,736
It can be the foundation of the

song.

482
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:35,177
So that's the first thing you

483
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,346
do.

484
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:39,715
You set up your kit, and you

start putting up your

486
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:42,385
microphones.

487
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:44,787
A room like this has a really

488
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:48,024
nice decay.

489
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:50,292
So, you put mikes around the

490
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:52,194
room to capture that.

491
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,363
You put close mikes on the

492
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:55,398
drums.

493
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,837
You have all of those
individual mikes spread over a

494

number of tracks - 16 tracks or

495
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,738
12 tracks.

496
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,375
So then you can bring the faders
up or down and balance those tracks.

497
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:16,684
Once you get a good drum take,
then it's like, "Oh, okay, great.

498
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:17,788
Now we got the beginning of a

The way to pick studios is

508
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,775
through blind-testing drums,

509
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:39,943
because you can record the

510
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,211
guitars pretty much anywhere,

511
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,779
and they could sound pretty much

512
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:43,714
like your guitars.

513
00:23:43,716 --> 00:23:44,949
But drums really change from

514
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,218
room to room.

515
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,722
That room shouldn't, on

516
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:53,291
paper, be a great drum room,

517
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:54,726
because it's like a big old

518
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,029
square room.

519
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:01,764
Sound City was a Vox factory
in the '60s, I guess.

520
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,867
They built Vox amps there,

521
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,404
and then they built the
"A" control room in '64.

522
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,840
It's one of those spaces that

523
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:10,775
just randomly, haphazardly

524
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:12,877
turned out to be fantastic to

525
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:14,112
record a drum set in.

526
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:15,780
That room is the space.

527
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:17,448
It's, like, what happens between

528
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,317
the notes, what you're playing.

529
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,086
There's a sound that's pretty

530
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:22,254
magical.

531
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:24,356
Every room has their sweet

532
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:26,492
spot for that sound, you know?

533
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:28,827
This, I think, has always been

534
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:30,929
Sound City's real sweet spot.

535
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,297
And the freaky thing is,

536
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,398
no one designed it.

537
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,134
A lot of people claim they did.

But no.

539
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,836
It's just luck.

540

Luck and magic.

Selfishly, the drum sound was

545
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,514
probably why we went there.

546
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:49,414

The first real Heartbreakers jam
to just feel each other out

565
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:13,371
was at Sound City.

566
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:16,071
The studio was fine, but we

567
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:17,138
just didn't have our shit

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,606
together.

569
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:18,440
We weren't ready.

570
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:19,374
We didn't have the songs.

571
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:20,342
We didn't know how to play

572
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:21,009
that well.

573
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,477
This is how you make a

574
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,178
record.

575
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,880
It was cruel, 'cause it

576
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:25,981
sounded so real.

577
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,382
And you'd go into the control

578
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:28,950
room, and they'd crank up the

579
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:30,352
speakers, and you go, "Man, I

580
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:32,988
just - I suck".

581
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,456
I think the vocal mike is

582
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,957
just a little bit loud.

583
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:40,195
That no-frills, no effects,

584
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:41,963
no place to hide - everything

585
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,266
coming out of an amp or

586
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,101
everything coming right out of a

587
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,369
speaker or right off a

588
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,070
microphone - that approach,

589
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:51,309
that was Sound City.

590
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,643
By our third album, we wanted
to get, you know,

591
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,313
somebody that could make
a good-sounding record.

592
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:59,015
So we hired Jimmy lovine.

593
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,416
He'd been a recording

594
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,285
engineer, and he'd worked with

595
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,086
Lennon and with Springsteen.

596
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:05,388
And they were recording live

597
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,023
tracks.

598
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,259
They weren't overdubbing a ton of
stuff. You had to learn how to play,

599
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,128
and you'd go in and play it.

600
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:17,836
I hired Jimmy as an engineer to do
"Damn the Torpedoes" there,

601
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:20,038
but he showed up with an

602
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,406
engineer without telling me.

603
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,542
He manipulated his way into

604
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,210
being the producer of the

605
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,112
record, along with me.

606
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:34,217
Jimmy is brilliant. I mean,
he now owns the music business.

607
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,154
When we showed up with Jimmy

608
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,523
at Sound City, he was just

609
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,691
horrified.

610
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,560
<i>Just horrified, like, "What is</i>

611
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,062
this place?"

612
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,363
And the first thing he said to

613
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,731
me is, "I don't know that we can

614
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:48,999
make a record in here".

615
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,367
Somebody should firebomb this

616
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,669
fucking place.

617
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,006
I said, "Yeah, I think you'll

618
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,074
be surprised".

619
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,744
We tracked live, and we

620
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,579
didn't edit from take to take.

621
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:03,448
So we had to get it right from

622
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,449
top to bottom.

623
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,650
When you're tracking live,

624
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:06,751
pressure's on the drummer

625
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:07,418
big-time.

626
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,619
Until you get that,

627
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:09,253
you've got nothing.

628
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,555
I just thought I should play

629
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:11,222
straight.

630
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:12,357
Throw it where the shaker's

631
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,591
trying to go.

632
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,865
Whoa!

633
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,766
It was emotional.

634
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,804
But, at the same time, I mean,
we all wanted to learn.

635
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:28,039
"Refugee," we played like

636
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,775

Joe was way over his head,

money for Joe and stuff, but Joe

1209

became like a second father to

1218
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,708

personal like it did to him.

1220

studios got nicer and nicer.

1232

01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:30,633
that you could drag music onto

1670
01:03:30,635 --> 01:03:31,767
the grid and make it sound

1671
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:32,869
perfect.

1672
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:34,703
The good thing about the

1673
01:03:34,705 --> 01:03:36,172
digital technology is if

1674
01:03:36,174 --> 01:03:37,606
somebody makes a mistake, like

1675
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:39,208
the bass player hits a wrong

1676
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,676
note or something, you might be

1677
01:03:40,678 --> 01:03:42,378
able to fix it much easier than

1678
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,279
we used to.

1679
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:44,947
The not-so-great is, it's

1680
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:47,183
kind of enabled people that have

1681
01:03:47,185 --> 01:03:48,951
no business being in a band or

1682
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:50,819
the music industry to become

1683
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:52,021
stars.

1684
01:03:52,523 --> 01:03:53,889
I heard some young guy in a

1685
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:55,457
band say, "Well, you don't have

1686
01:03:55,459 --> 01:03:56,959
to practice anymore.

1687
01:03:56,961 --> 01:04:00,964
You know, you just slice it up
in the machine," meaning the

1688
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,365
computer, "and it comes out

1689
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:03,900
perfectly".

1690
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:12,842
Somebody like Andrés Segovia,

1691
01:04:12,844 --> 01:04:14,911
you know, who played the guitar

1692
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:15,912
beautifully.

1693
01:04:15,914 --> 01:04:17,914
There's no machine is gonna do

1694
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,783
that.

1695
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:30,365
I am not a Pro Tools fan.

1696
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:34,966
But Trent and Atticus, they
really use it as a tool, and a

1697
01:04:34,967 --> 01:04:36,433
real creative tool.

1698
01:04:39,872 --> 01:04:44,176
I never went into the kind of
fear of, "It's cheating".

1699
01:04:44,177 --> 01:04:45,577
I never use samplers as a way to

1700
01:04:45,578 --> 01:04:47,377
sound like the real thing.

1701
01:04:47,379 --> 01:04:48,945
It was really amazing, 'cause
here's a thing that can record

1702
01:04:48,948 --> 01:04:50,414
sound like tape, but you can

1703
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:52,215
fuck with it in million
different ways.

1704
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:55,889
It's just a wildly inspiring
tool, really.

1705
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,690
♪ I believe I can see the

1706
01:04:58,691 --> 01:05:00,359
future ♪

1707
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:02,627
I like to record it in analog

1708
01:05:02,629 --> 01:05:03,961
at the highest level and listen

1709
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:04,862
to it that way.

1710
01:05:04,864 --> 01:05:06,664
But that's not what's happening

1711
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,598
on the street.

1712
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,300
That's not where our audience

1713
01:05:09,302 --> 01:05:09,700
is.

1714
01:05:09,702 --> 01:05:11,269
You want them to live their

1715

lives the way they want to live

1716
01:05:12,772 --> 01:05:13,671
it.

1717
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:15,440
I think it makes a lot of

1718
01:05:15,442 --> 01:05:16,975
independent music right now

1719
01:05:16,977 --> 01:05:17,743
possible.

1720
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:19,411
It's one of the reasons why

1721
01:05:19,413 --> 01:05:21,313
we're able to make records for a

1722
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:22,547
couple hundred bucks.

1723
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:24,449
I think one of the big tape

1724
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:25,951
manufacturers went out of

1725
01:05:25,953 --> 01:05:27,886
business, so that really pushed

1726
01:05:27,888 --> 01:05:29,888
everybody into the digital world

1727
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,490
and the Pro Tools world.

1728
01:05:31,992 --> 01:05:33,392
The days of moving into the

1729
01:05:33,394 --> 01:05:34,693
studio and writing your record

1730
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:35,927
and recording your record and

1731
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:37,429
mixing your record, those days

1732
01:05:37,431 --> 01:05:38,563
are gone now.

1733
01:05:38,565 --> 01:05:40,599
They used to have $200,000,

1734
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:42,701
$300,000 $400,000 budgets to do

1735
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:43,568
an album.

1736
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,504
Now the money is just not there

1737
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:46,872
the way it used to be.

1738
01:05:46,874 --> 01:05:48,540
Budgets were so small, we'd

1739
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:49,876
be tracking late five days,

1740
01:05:49,878 --> 01:05:50,543
10 days.

1741
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:51,778
It was always last-minute,

1742
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,012
"Can you work this afternoon?"

1743
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:54,547
or whatever.

1744
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,015
So...

1745
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,086
In the end, it was a little

1746
01:06:00,088 --> 01:06:01,354
hard to swallow.

1747
01:06:01,356 --> 01:06:03,089
You know, we started selling off

1748
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:04,957
the gear in studio "B", 'cause

1749
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:06,726
the studio was way behind on

1750
01:06:06,728 --> 01:06:07,760

have gone out of business, and a

lot of what you hear on the

1760
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,383
I think Pro Tools just really

1761
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,485
was, to a lot of people, was the

stuff, and I never dreamed, in a

And whose signature - is that

Dave, and that's how all this

1836
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:27,399
all started.

1837
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:34,374
All right. Let's do this.

1838
01:09:36,076 --> 01:09:40,783
To me, it's, like - it's a
living, breathing piece of the

1839
01:09:40,784 --> 01:09:43,384
music that we've made.

1840
01:09:44,585 --> 01:09:46,585
It's just as instrumental as any

1841
01:09:46,587 --> 01:09:48,253
instrument that's run through

1842
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:48,854
it.

1843
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:51,690
It's the sound of the records

1844
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:53,860
that were made at Sound City.

1845
01:09:55,162 --> 01:09:57,062
This thing is a piece of

1846
01:09:57,064 --> 01:09:58,865
rock 'n' roll history.

1847
01:09:58,867 --> 01:09:59,999
I thought that board would

1848
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,067
just go straight to the

1849
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:02,235
Rock 'n' Roll hall of fame.

1850
01:10:02,237 --> 01:10:03,970
I thought no one was gonna get

1851
01:10:03,972 --> 01:10:05,438
that board.

1852
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,996
I think they knew, like, I
wasn't just gonna bubble-wrap it

1853
01:10:27,997 --> 01:10:29,797
and stick it in a warehouse.

1854
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:34,369
I was gonna fucking use it...
A lot.

1855
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:36,171
Trying to pull it through a

1856
01:10:36,172 --> 01:10:36,971
window.

1857
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,974
I spent so much time sitting

1858
01:10:39,976 --> 01:10:41,942
over here, playing with these

1859
01:10:41,944 --> 01:10:42,910
things.

1860
01:10:44,814 --> 01:10:46,313
Well, was it still sitting

1861
01:10:46,315 --> 01:10:47,147
there, Dave?

1862
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:48,882
Yeah, you know, it had been

1863
01:10:48,884 --> 01:10:49,383
working.

1864
01:10:49,385 --> 01:10:51,051
So, the first thing I really

1865
01:10:51,053 --> 01:10:52,853
wanted to do was invite everyone

1866
01:10:52,855 --> 01:10:54,423
back to make this new record.

1867
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:58,359
Giving that old board this new

1868
01:10:58,361 --> 01:11:00,794
life with new music.

1869
01:11:03,733 --> 01:11:05,633
Telling the story of Sound City

1870
01:11:05,635 --> 01:11:06,367
is one thing.

1871
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:07,735
Plugging in and actually putting

1872
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:08,902
it through the board and putting

1873
01:11:08,904 --> 01:11:11,172
it on a 2-inch reel?

1874
01:11:11,174 --> 01:11:13,409
That's what I'm talking about.

1875
01:11:14,211 --> 01:11:18,851
♪ They don't talk much about
it ♪

1876
01:11:18,852 --> 01:11:21,352
♪ It goes back so many years

1889
01:11:59,257 --> 01:12:01,023
I messed up.

1890
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,158
It's amazing.

1891
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,426
Want to do another?

1892
01:12:03,428 --> 01:12:04,060
Sure.

1893
01:12:04,062 --> 01:12:05,127
You want to take it up

1894
01:12:05,129 --> 01:12:06,395
through verse one and verse two,

1895
01:12:06,397 --> 01:12:07,430
up to that first chorus?

1896
01:12:07,432 --> 01:12:08,064
Yeah.

1897
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:09,965
What we're hoping to do on

1898
01:12:09,967 --> 01:12:12,802
this album is to catch a little

1899
01:12:12,804 --> 01:12:15,071
bit of that vibe that was

1900
01:12:15,073 --> 01:12:16,806
captured when all those classic

1901
01:12:16,808 --> 01:12:18,374
records were made at Sound City.

1902
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,042
We'll try to put some of that

1903
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,110
into this album.

1904
01:12:21,113 --> 01:12:23,880

<i>That girl can sing.</i>

1914
01:12:54,813 --> 01:12:56,881
Any input from the foos?

1915
01:12:56,883 --> 01:12:57,882
Just go.

1916
01:12:57,884 --> 01:13:00,118
I'm not - just do what you do.

1917
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,786
I am kind of radical, you

1918
01:13:01,788 --> 01:13:03,355
know.

1919

01:13:10,864 --> 01:13:12,396
There's a reason why these

01:13:12,398 --> 01:13:13,998
people have achieved these

1923
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,401
things that they've achieved.

1924
01:13:17,303 --> 01:13:20,104
You can hear it. You can see it.

1925
01:13:20,106 --> 01:13:22,106
♪ Don't ever dance with the

1926
01:13:22,108 --> 01:13:24,445
devil ♪

1927
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:34,688
♪ He will burn you dow-ow-n

♪ You can't fix this

1929
01:13:45,132 --> 01:13:47,966
That's rad. Sounds rad.

1930
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:49,301
And I get to do my snake

1931
01:13:49,303 --> 01:13:49,902
dance.

1932
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:53,806
I'm just feeling very wonderful

1933
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:55,240
to be in your studio with this

1934
01:13:55,242 --> 01:13:56,875
board and know that this board

1935
01:13:56,877 --> 01:13:58,343
was the first place that we did

1936
01:13:58,345 --> 01:13:59,845
"Buckingham Nicks".

1937
01:14:00,347 --> 01:14:03,549
"15458 Cabrito Road, Van Nuys,

1938
01:14:03,551 --> 01:14:04,516
California".

1939
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:06,285
This is a letter that I wrote to

1940
01:14:06,287 --> 01:14:09,522
my mom and dad and my brother in

1941
01:14:09,524 --> 01:14:11,558
the middle of the making of

1942
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,159
"Buckingham Nicks".

1943
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,428
"Dear mom and dad and Chris,

1944
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,397
Well, here I am once again at

1945
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:19,465
the famous Sound City recording

1946
01:14:19,467 --> 01:14:20,900
studio".

1947
01:14:20,902 --> 01:14:22,869
"Sound City, Inc. "

1948
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:23,837
Ta-da!

1949
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,438
"I'm getting very tired of

1950
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,240
sitting around listening to

1951
01:14:27,242 --> 01:14:29,042
12 hours of music per day.

1952
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:29,542
Oh, well.

1953
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:31,144
I know it will pay off in the

1954
01:14:31,146 --> 01:14:31,511
end.

1955
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:33,246
It will all be worth it.

1956
01:14:33,248 --> 01:14:34,881
I hope that all of my little

1957
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:36,349
family is doing fine and not

1958
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:37,584
working too hard.

1959
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:39,886
Moving right along, I just want

1960
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:42,021
to say that I certainly do miss

1961
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:44,024
you all and wish you could be

1962
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:45,960
here to hear some of this stuff.

1963
01:14:45,962 --> 01:14:47,494
Lindsey may go down in history

1964
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:49,230
as one of the greats in guitar

1965
01:14:49,232 --> 01:14:49,930
playing.

1966
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:52,032
It really is quite amazing.

1967
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:54,235
Well, no more news as of yet.

1968
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:55,870
So much love to you all, and

1969
01:14:55,872 --> 01:14:57,371
hold good thoughts about this

1970
01:14:57,373 --> 01:14:57,972
thing.

1971
01:14:57,974 --> 01:14:59,375
I love you. Stevie".

1972
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:04,382
I think it really is a
testament to how many people

1973
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:07,883
actually did love Sound City and

1974
01:15:07,884 --> 01:15:09,884
do love that Neve console and

1975
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:11,619
want to be part of history.

1976
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:15,425
I was bragging to everybody.
"Guess who I'm calling tonight?

1977
01:15:15,426 --> 01:15:18,126
Rick fucking Springfield".

1978
01:15:31,397 --> 01:15:34,409
I've always just been a big
believer in the power of the song.

1979
01:15:34,411 --> 01:15:35,977
To me, the highest I ever feel

1980
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:37,279
is in the middle of writing a

1981
01:15:37,281 --> 01:15:38,613
song that I think I've hooked

1982
01:15:38,615 --> 01:15:40,015
into something, you know?

1983
01:15:40,017 --> 01:15:40,582
I had an idea.

1984
01:15:40,584 --> 01:15:42,050
I don't know if it would work.

1985
01:15:42,052 --> 01:15:43,151
But would you want to try

1986
01:15:43,153 --> 01:15:43,618
something?

1987
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:46,121
So, if we played over the riff,

1988
01:15:46,123 --> 01:15:46,988
it goes...

1989
01:15:58,427 --> 01:16:00,838
That'd be really cool.
Let's try it from the top and

1990
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:02,539
see how that sounds.

1991
01:16:27,443 --> 01:16:28,933
Yeah. I think it's a great part.

1992
01:16:28,934 --> 01:16:30,335
It's got "Rick Springfield"

1993
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,268
written all over it.

1994
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,069
It's awesome.

1995
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:32,602
I love it.

1996
01:16:32,604 --> 01:16:33,704
It's got that stress rock.

1997
01:16:33,706 --> 01:16:34,504
I like that.

1998
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,239
I just want to go hang out in

1999
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:37,007
the studio.

2000
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,241
I just like the process.

2001
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:39,710
I love doing things on the fly

2002
01:16:39,712 --> 01:16:41,011
and in the studio...

2003
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,713
I'm just trying to think what

2004
01:16:42,715 --> 01:16:44,548
would be nice to - if we - to

2005
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,350
get back into that section.

2006
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,985
...And just kind of play

2007
01:16:47,987 --> 01:16:49,453
arrangements in a repetitive

2008
01:16:49,455 --> 01:16:51,188
fashion over and over and over

2009
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,489
until some little change

2010
01:16:52,491 --> 01:16:53,223
happened.

2011
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:54,524
What did you just do?

2012
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,259
You did something kind of cool.

2013
01:16:56,261 --> 01:16:57,728
"D", "A".

2014
01:16:57,730 --> 01:17:00,330
A little happy accident or

2015
01:17:00,332 --> 01:17:01,398
whatever, and it's like,

2016
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,599
everyone, "Oh, what was that

2017
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:03,567
that just happened?"

2018
01:17:03,569 --> 01:17:05,035
That's part of the arrangement

2019
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:05,569
now.

2020
01:17:05,571 --> 01:17:06,637
Oh, that'd be so great, and

2021
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:07,672
then right out of there, you

2022
01:17:07,674 --> 01:17:09,107
just fucking go, "Aah!"

2023
01:17:09,109 --> 01:17:10,408
It's the perfect pair of

2024
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,009
pants.

2025
01:17:11,011 --> 01:17:12,076
It really is.

2026
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:18,683
But the good thing about

2027
01:17:18,685 --> 01:17:20,518
learning while you're recording,

2028
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,320
what you sometimes accidentally

2029
01:17:22,322 --> 01:17:23,755
get is something good if you

2030
01:17:23,757 --> 01:17:25,490
don't have any idea what you're

2031
01:17:25,492 --> 01:17:26,124
doing.

2032
01:17:26,126 --> 01:17:27,625
And the sense of discovery,

2033
01:17:27,627 --> 01:17:30,429
like, is a big part of it.

2034
01:17:31,531 --> 01:17:33,264
Everybody gets it all at

2035
01:17:33,266 --> 01:17:35,166
once, and that's the first time

2036
01:17:35,168 --> 01:17:37,101
you ever played it, and it's got

2037
01:17:37,103 --> 01:17:38,669
everything new for the first

2038
01:17:38,671 --> 01:17:39,270
time.

2039
01:17:39,272 --> 01:17:41,306
It's like your first anything.

2040
01:17:41,308 --> 01:17:42,741
And that's the cherry of all

2041
01:17:42,743 --> 01:17:43,342
time.

2042
01:17:43,344 --> 01:17:45,611
What if we tried doing the

2043
01:17:45,613 --> 01:17:48,113
Rick part as a pre-chorus?

2044
01:17:48,115 --> 01:17:49,314
Yes! Ha!

2045
01:17:49,316 --> 01:17:50,215
That's so good!

2046
01:17:51,052 --> 01:17:52,518
'Cause then it goes into the

2047
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,152
chorus.

2048
01:17:53,154 --> 01:17:54,686
That's awesome!

think everybody searches for.

2134
01:21:16,382 --> 01:21:20,900
I think the downside these days
is thinking that, "I can do this

can guarantee you that.

2141
01:21:45,412 --> 01:21:47,464
How would you define "feel"?

2142
01:21:47,465 --> 01:21:51,866
Feel is - is just a part of
who you are.

2143
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:56,335
It just comes from where you -

2144
01:21:56,337 --> 01:21:58,438
where you're coming from.

2145
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,740
It's just the way your heart

2146
01:22:01,742 --> 01:22:02,775
beats, you know?

2147
01:22:02,777 --> 01:22:04,378
Everybody's heart beats a little
different.

2148
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:06,579
Everybody's got a little

2149
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:08,616
different feel.

2150
01:22:10,318 --> 01:22:12,084
"Feel" doesn't mean you're in

2151
01:22:12,086 --> 01:22:12,718
time.

2152
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,453
You know, 'cause something might

2153
01:22:14,455 --> 01:22:15,921
have a really out-of-time kind

2154
01:22:15,923 --> 01:22:16,588
of feel.

2155
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:18,023
It might be gloriously out of

2156
01:22:18,025 --> 01:22:20,893
tune and just be awesome.

2157
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:25,432
It's a chemistry - something
that happens between people.

2158
01:22:26,435 --> 01:22:28,871
Feel is not something that you
learn in a book.

2159
01:22:28,872 --> 01:22:31,472
Feel is something that you find

2160
01:22:31,473 --> 01:22:32,639
as a musician.

2161
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:34,474
It's like when you take in a

2162
01:22:34,476 --> 01:22:35,975
breath, your body swells up.

2163
01:22:35,977 --> 01:22:37,811
When you exhale, it collapses a

2164
01:22:37,813 --> 01:22:39,913
bit, and sometimes music does

2165
01:22:39,915 --> 01:22:41,815
that so subtle.

2166
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:43,950
But feel is being human.

2167
01:23:03,389 --> 01:23:07,608
No two musicians are the same,
even if we're playing the same song.

2168
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:09,777
No two musicians do it the same

2169
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:11,312
way.

2170
01:23:11,814 --> 01:23:13,414
It's so hard to be understood

2171
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:14,715
in life, and that's why, when

2172
01:23:14,717 --> 01:23:15,883
you meet someone where you

2173
01:23:15,885 --> 01:23:17,385
understand each other at that

2174
01:23:17,387 --> 01:23:18,786
moment, you sort of want to hold

2175
01:23:18,788 --> 01:23:21,058
on to it, you know?

2176
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,493
When someone has great feel,

2177
01:23:25,495 --> 01:23:26,994
whether it's a drummer or a

2178
01:23:26,996 --> 01:23:28,863
guitar player, it kind of makes

2179
01:23:28,865 --> 01:23:30,564
you fall in love with their

2180
01:23:30,566 --> 01:23:31,565
personality.

2181
01:23:31,567 --> 01:23:32,633
You realize what a beautiful

2182
01:23:32,635 --> 01:23:34,369
person they are, you know?

2183
01:23:52,956 --> 01:23:56,959
There's a lot of people
growing up now that won't do

2184
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:57,860
studio time and have never

2185
01:23:57,861 --> 01:23:59,694
touched a compressor that's the

2186
01:23:59,696 --> 01:24:01,530
one that's being emulated as the

2187
01:24:01,532 --> 01:24:02,831
picture on their plug-in on

2188
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,965
their laptop.

2189
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:05,200
They're missing out on

2190
01:24:05,202 --> 01:24:06,001
something.

2191
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:07,002
You know?

2192
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:27,462
Trent is using technology as
an instrument, not as a crutch.

2193
01:24:27,863 --> 01:24:30,463
He doesn't need it.

2194
01:24:33,064 --> 01:24:34,597
He's one of the most brilliant

2195
01:24:34,599 --> 01:24:35,798
people I've ever met in my

2196
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,500
entire life.

2197
01:24:38,002 --> 01:24:40,136
He's the person that could

2198
01:24:40,138 --> 01:24:42,738
<i>inspire the digital end of this</i>

2199
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,673
conversation.

2200
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:46,642
Hey, you guys, no fucking way

2201
01:24:46,644 --> 01:24:48,010
with the smoke machine.

2202
01:24:48,012 --> 01:24:49,780
There's no fucking

2203
01:24:49,782 --> 01:24:51,114
way that's gonna go down.

2204
01:24:51,116 --> 01:24:52,149
I'll take the smoke machine

2205
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:52,783
in here.

2206
01:24:56,889 --> 01:24:58,655
My grandma pushed me into

2207
01:24:58,657 --> 01:24:59,089
piano.

2208
01:24:59,091 --> 01:25:00,791
I remember, when I was 5, I

2209
01:25:00,793 --> 01:25:02,192
started taking classical

2210
01:25:02,194 --> 01:25:02,926
lessons.

2211
01:25:02,928 --> 01:25:04,661
I liked it, and I felt I was

2212
01:25:04,663 --> 01:25:05,496
good at it.

2213
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:07,130
I knew, in life, I was supposed

2214
01:25:07,132 --> 01:25:08,265
to make music.

2215
01:25:08,267 --> 01:25:09,600
Feels like a need a

2216
01:25:09,602 --> 01:25:11,134
differentiator there - a cool

2217
01:25:11,136 --> 01:25:12,669
bass part.

2218
01:25:24,441 --> 01:25:29,455
The sound I have is not right.
That's not helping things at the moment.

2219
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:32,891
I could do better than that.

2220
01:25:34,828 --> 01:25:36,261
Are you hearing something you

2221
01:25:36,263 --> 01:25:37,829
want to try with the bass here?

2222
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:39,230
You're not stepping on my toes.

2223
01:26:04,436 --> 01:26:08,396
I practiced long and hard and
studied and learned how to play

2224
01:26:08,397 --> 01:26:10,997
an instrument that provided me a

2225
01:26:10,998 --> 01:26:12,965
foundation where I can base

2226
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,100
everything I think of in terms

2227
01:26:15,102 --> 01:26:17,403
of where it sits on the piano.

2228
01:26:18,005 --> 01:26:19,605
I sort of liked that, at one

2229
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:21,040
point, it kind of got there, and

2230
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,443
then it backed off.

2231
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,978
It can kind of brood and be

2232
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,080
really simple and empty and sort

2233
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:30,215
of kind of like lift the curtain

2234
01:26:30,217 --> 01:26:32,751
on it, and it can expand.

2235
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:34,988
All right, can I just say

2236
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,623
that that is fucking awesome?

2237
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,592
That, right there, sounds so

2238
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:39,859
fucking beautiful.

2239
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,028
I really like the sound of these

2240
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,697
three things together.

2241
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:44,998
I think it sounds really cool.

2242
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,132
Okay, then let's keep doing

2243
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:46,866
it that way.

2244
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:54,908
This whole thing should just

2245
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:55,375
sunrise.

2246
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,010
It would make it beautiful,

2247
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:57,711
you know?

2248
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,279
It sort of, like, evolves until

2249
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:01,214
it hits this point and maybe

2250
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,215
goes zoom!

2251
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,052
When I'm writing music today,

2252
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,320
rarely do I sit down and think,

2253
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,855
"Oh, this should resolve to that

2254
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:09,389
suspended... "

2255
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:10,891
You know, I don't think of that

2256
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,461
shit.

2257
01:27:13,763 --> 01:27:15,930
But, subconsciously, I know I

2258
01:27:15,932 --> 01:27:17,399
do.

2259
01:27:18,001 --> 01:27:19,800
And just when you've sold that

2260
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:21,268
enough, that's the time to

2261
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:23,104
change to an ending and sort of

2262
01:27:23,106 --> 01:27:24,372
like let it rip a little bit.

2263
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:25,406
You know what I mean?

2264
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:35,416
I like having that foundation in

2265
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:37,218
there, and that's a very

2266
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,986
un-punk-rock thing to say.

2267
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:50,969
But understanding an instrument
and thinking about it and

2268
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:53,670
learning that skill has been

2269
01:27:53,671 --> 01:27:54,803
invaluable to me.

2270
01:28:03,414 --> 01:28:04,379
Ah.

2271
01:28:04,381 --> 01:28:05,414
That was pretty good.

2272
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:07,249
Sounded pretty good to me,

2273
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:07,816
too.

2274
01:28:07,818 --> 01:28:09,317
I've found now, as processors

2275
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:10,752
have gotten faster and

2276
01:28:10,754 --> 01:28:12,020
programmers have gotten

2277
01:28:12,022 --> 01:28:13,422
smarter...

2278
01:28:14,191 --> 01:28:15,691
...There's some pretty music

2279
01:28:15,693 --> 01:28:17,125
tools that are showing up in the

2280
01:28:17,127 --> 01:28:17,959
digital world.

2281
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:19,327
Yeah, take me to the top of

2282
01:28:19,329 --> 01:28:20,397
the drop.

2283
01:28:37,469 --> 01:28:39,451
The tools are better.
You know, tools are much better

2284
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:42,252
today than they were five years

2285
01:28:42,253 --> 01:28:44,420
ago - certainly, 30 years ago.

2286
01:28:47,992 --> 01:28:49,325
Now that everyone is empowered

2287
01:28:49,327 --> 01:28:50,493
with these tools to create

2288
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:52,095
stuff, has there been a lot more

2289
01:28:52,097 --> 01:28:53,196
great shit coming out?

2290
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:54,965
Not really.

2291
01:28:55,467 --> 01:28:57,267
You still have to have something

2292
01:28:57,269 --> 01:28:58,502
to do with those tools.

2293
01:29:02,274 --> 01:29:03,741
Rad.

2294
01:29:03,743 --> 01:29:05,810
Yeah, just, you know...

2295
01:29:06,312 --> 01:29:08,245
You should really try to have

2296
01:29:08,247 --> 01:29:09,346
something to say.

2297
01:29:12,518 --> 01:29:15,352
It all started with this idea

2298
01:29:15,354 --> 01:29:16,987
that I wanted to tell the story

2299
01:29:16,989 --> 01:29:18,222
of the board.

2300
01:29:18,224 --> 01:29:20,124
The conversation became

2301
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:21,959
something much bigger.

2302
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:26,029
Like, in this age of technology,

2303
01:29:26,031 --> 01:29:27,331
where you can simulate or

2304
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:30,300
manipulate anything, how do we

2305
01:29:30,302 --> 01:29:32,470
retain that human element?

2306
01:29:33,073 --> 01:29:36,441
How do we keep music to sound

2307
01:29:36,443 --> 01:29:39,778
like people - that feeling that

2308
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,113
<i>I got when I was young - "Oh,</i>

2309
01:29:42,115 --> 01:29:43,414
I can do that, too"?

2310
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:44,783
Let's go do it.

2311
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:47,051
My musical foundation was

2312
01:29:47,053 --> 01:29:47,986
The Beatles.

2313
01:29:47,988 --> 01:29:50,421
Everything I know about playing

2314
01:29:50,423 --> 01:29:52,557
guitar and song structure,

2315
01:29:52,559 --> 01:29:55,126
composition, all of it, it all

2316
01:29:55,128 --> 01:29:57,195
started with The Beatles.

2317
01:29:57,197 --> 01:29:58,530
I like the chandelier, too, man.

2318
01:29:58,532 --> 01:29:59,898
It's a nice touch.

2319
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,499
Um, so, we don't know what

2320
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:02,467
we're doing...

2321
01:30:03,503 --> 01:30:05,069
...so we can just do

2322
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:05,837
anything.

2323
01:30:05,839 --> 01:30:07,806
Just - yeah.

2324
01:30:25,945 --> 01:30:30,229
I think he knows how you feel
when you play with him. I don't know.

2325
01:30:30,331 --> 01:30:31,831
I can't really describe it.

2326
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:33,199
I drop from the most nervous

2327
01:30:33,201 --> 01:30:34,567
I've ever been down to like,

2328
01:30:34,569 --> 01:30:35,935
"Oh, this is - okay".

2329
01:30:37,405 --> 01:30:38,337
Yeah!

2330
01:30:38,339 --> 01:30:40,139
Yeah.

2331
01:30:40,141 --> 01:30:41,910
♪ Mama

2332
01:30:44,613 --> 01:30:47,147

at Krist when we were playing,

2337
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:12,505
and we were going for it.

2338
01:31:12,507 --> 01:31:14,640
And you know, Krist was moving

2339
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:16,442
the way he used to move, and you

2340

were getting into it...

2341
01:31:18,213 --> 01:31:19,446
...and I was playing.

2342
01:31:19,448 --> 01:31:20,481
And I thought, "Oh, my god!

01:31:58,124 --> 01:32:01,124
based on what's most important

2355
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:02,991

2359
01:32:12,536 --> 01:32:14,603
that makes good music is some

My first band was called

2530
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:20,497
Fury, and we were a Kiss cover

Huh?

2540

A band called The Senders.

2541
01:41:32,545 --> 01:41:33,277
The Pixies.

2542
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:34,945

Wow.

2550
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:42,086
I'd been in practically every

2551
01:41:42,088 --> 01:41:43,554
other kind of band - blues

2552
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:45,022
bands, punk-rock bands, standard

2553
01:41:45,024 --> 01:41:46,524
rock 'n' roll bands, top-40

2554
01:41:46,526 --> 01:41:47,892
bands, jazz-rock fusion bands.

2555
01:41:47,894 --> 01:41:49,560
In New York, I had a band called

2556
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:50,227
Daybreak.

2557
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:51,295
Did you have a band?

2558
01:41:51,297 --> 01:41:52,096
Had a band.

2559
01:41:52,098 --> 01:41:53,130
What was the band?

2560
01:41:53,132 --> 01:41:54,965
The Pricks.

2561
01:43:04,408 --> 01:43:07,008
Made sense to me, too.

2562
01:43:07,108 --> 01:43:08,274
Okay, so, coming up on the

2563
01:43:08,276 --> 01:43:09,709
right, you know, we have the

2564
01:43:09,711 --> 01:43:13,614
Budweiser brewery, which...

2565
01:43:13,616 --> 01:43:16,116
on a good night...

2566
01:43:16,118 --> 01:43:17,751
smells like someone burping

2567
01:43:17,753 --> 01:43:18,752
right in your face.

2568
01:43:20,122 --> 01:43:21,321
The thing that was cool about

2569
01:43:21,323 --> 01:43:22,723
the brewery is, like, every band

2570
01:43:22,725 --> 01:43:23,924
that came there always wanted to

2571
01:43:23,926 --> 01:43:24,725
go take the tour.

2572
01:43:24,727 --> 01:43:25,892
So they would always go over

2573
01:43:25,894 --> 01:43:27,127
there and come back with cases

2574
01:43:27,129 --> 01:43:28,395
of Budweiser and then sit around

2575
01:43:28,397 --> 01:43:29,663
and get hammered all the rest of

2576
01:43:29,665 --> 01:43:30,130
the night.

2577
01:43:30,132 --> 01:43:31,331
But that smell - I'll never

2578
01:43:31,333 --> 01:43:32,866
forget that smell when the front

2579
01:43:32,868 --> 01:43:34,201
doors of Sound City were open on

2580
01:43:34,203 --> 01:43:36,036
a good, windy day.

2581
01:43:36,038 --> 01:43:37,270
The smell of hops would just

2582
01:43:37,272 --> 01:43:38,405
fill the whole building.

2583
01:43:38,407 --> 01:43:41,208
It was just, "Ew, what is that?"

2584
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:43,176
Beer smells like poop.

2585
01:43:43,178 --> 01:43:44,945
You know, apparently, Budweiser

2586
01:43:44,947 --> 01:43:46,280
smells like poops.

2587
01:43:46,282 --> 01:43:47,281
And the funny thing I

2588
01:43:47,283 --> 01:43:48,683
remember, when Gladys Knight and

2589
01:43:48,685 --> 01:43:49,817
The Pips were there, and they

2590
01:43:49,819 --> 01:43:50,818
walked out and they went,

2591
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:52,086
"Whoo-whee! Is that you?"

2592
01:43:52,088 --> 01:43:53,254
You know, they were, like,

2593
01:43:53,256 --> 01:43:54,722
kidding each other about it.

2594
01:43:54,724 --> 01:43:55,923
But it was pretty strong -

2595
01:43:55,925 --> 01:43:57,459
pretty...

2596
01:43:58,261 --> 01:43:59,327
See? Smell it.

2597
01:43:59,329 --> 01:44:00,828
Hmm.

2598
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:03,998
There you go. You got it.

2599
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,899
Gonna be a good night.
