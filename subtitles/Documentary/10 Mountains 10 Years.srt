- He's a model ? [ Chuckles ]
- A model.

Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumoured
to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

- Really.

Man, look at her.
Is she always so--

- Vapid ?
- How can you say that ? She's totally--

- Conceited.
- What are you talking about ?

There's more to her than you think.

Look at the way s-she smiles,
and-and look at her eyes, man.

She's totally pure.
You're missing what's there.

No, no, Cameron, no.
What's there...

174
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:15,289
is a snotty little princess wearing
a strategically planned sun dress...

175
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:18,626
to make guys like us realise
that we can never touch her...

and guys like Joey realise
that they want to.

177

She, my friend, is what we will spend
the rest of our lives not having.

178
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:27,385
Put her in your spank bank,
move on.

- Move on.
- No, no. You're wrong about her.

I mean, you know, not about the spanking
part, but the rest, you're wrong.

All right-- I'm wrong ?
You wanna take a shot, be my guest.

She's actually looking
for a French tutor.

Are you serious ?
That's perfect !

- Didn't you read last month's Cosmo ?
- Run along.

188

I know you can be overwhelmed,
and you can be under whelmed,

but can you ever
just be ''whelmed'' ?

190
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:09,761

- Hi, ladies.

like a ride ?
