1
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,075
What are you talking about?

2
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,747
Alan, don't get so uptight!

3
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,188
You're telling me
you don't want to do this anymore.

4
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,318
-That's not what I'm saying.
-Then what are you saying?

5
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,689
Nice.

6
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,130
What is it
with this morbid fixation of yours?

7
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,066
You've got talent, Alan.

8
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,739
I hate to see you squander it with
these adolescent monster movie images.

9
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,518
Why this obsession with death?

10
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,178
Everybody does life.

11
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,150
Maybe you haven't noticed,
my little deadly nightshade...

12
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,291
but it's a brand new age,
time to celebrate life...

13
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,160
the love and the beauty
of the world around us.

14
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,667
So why don't you draw what you see?

15
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,462
I do.

16
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,338
Yeah, more is the pity.

17
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,775
Life is beautiful, Alan.

18
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,472
This gruesome stuff isn't going
to get you anywhere.

19
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,913
That's what my grandmother says.

20
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,418
And a happy Hallow's Eve to you, my friend.

21
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,833
Tricky Dick, your war is sick!

22
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,428
Hell, no, we won't go!

23
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,140
I can't believe you're breaking up with me
on my birthday.

24
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,447
I'm not breaking up with you.

25
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,980
<i>God, you're being
so Leave it to Beaver about this.</i>

26
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,516
I'm sorry, Jessica, but I love you.
I thought you loved me.

27
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,720
I do.

28
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,555
I love everyone.

29
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,390
-You want to.
-No such luck.

30
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,431
Quit playing the Prince of Darkness
and kiss me.

31
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,105
I can't. Not now.

32
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,434
Suit yourself.

33
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,546
Happy birthday.

34
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,487
Yeah. Happy birthday to me.

35
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,008
Happy fucking birthday.

36
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,776
Fuck you, too!

37
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,785
Good idea, Alan.

38
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,595
You know, they don't appreciate you.

39
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,095
Show them how important you are.

40
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,365
Come on, Alan...

41
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,001
you know it's beautiful over here.

42
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:09,341
Just grit your teeth and cut!

43
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,017
That's it.

44
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,780
Show them, Alan.

45
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,685
Do it!

46
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,252
Cut!

47
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,248
Surprise!

48
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,540
Happy birthday!

49
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,951
Why don't you guys give us some privacy?

50
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,558
What are you doing?

51
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,201
<i>-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.</i>

52
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,374
<i>I am so sorry, Alan.</i>

53
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,782
<i>You know how much I love you.</i>

54
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,321
Damn!

55
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,800
I guess lunch is gonna have to wait
until round two.

56
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,465
That was a stupid fucking thing to do.

57
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,276
Jesus, Alan, I was only kidding.

58
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,547
I was trying to set you up
for your surprise party.

59
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,281
Guess I surprised you instead.

60
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,815
No shit.

61
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,891
Suicide is a very selfish act, you know.

62
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,995
Shit, one more life or death
seems pretty insignificant...

63
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,432
in the greater planetary scheme of things.

64
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,766
It makes a big difference to me.

65
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,833
Death isn't glamorous, Alan.

66
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,738
I guess I don't really know you.

67
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,876
You, and about four billion other people
on the planet.

68
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,112
Don't give me
that misunderstood artist bullshit.

69
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,747
We all have problems. We deal with them.

70
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,283
You know, you are whining.

71
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,760
You're being kind of a creep,
to tell you the truth.

72
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,131
I'm sorry.

73
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,062
I'm just in my "poor me" stage.

74
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,868
Call me an asshole.

75
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,805
Are you ever going to pull...

76
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,243
such a stupid, cruel, selfish stunt
like that again?

77
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,406
-No.
-Promise?

78
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,515
Promise. Cross my heart.

79
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,213
Now, who loves you?

80
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,118
-My mom.
-Who else?

81
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,490
Baby Jesus?

82
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,552
Funny. Who else?

83
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,458
-You?
-Yeah.

84
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,895
But I guess you want proof of that,
don't you?

85
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,560
Proof is good.

86
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,172
It's a little late, but...

87
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,775
-happy birthday.
-Thanks.

88
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,644
I like the artwork.

89
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,477
Let's see here.

90
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,859
"Rock 'n' Roll Revival,
Varsity Stadium in Toronto...

91
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,020
"starring John Lennon
and the Plastic Ono Band."

92
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,394
Jessie, where did you get these?

93
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,227
How do you cut yourself
shaving in a fucking bathtub?

94
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,762
That's just fucking clumsy.
Who shaves in a bathtub anyway?

95
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,570
Only chicks take baths, man.

96
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:58,974
-Shut up, Hector.
-Shut up?

97
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,138
Show him the picture you took.
He sold it to the school paper.

98
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,705
-Got $25, man.
-You going to split it with me?

99
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,317
-It is my naked ass in the paper.
-Well....

100
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,379
-Just fucking with you, man. Lighten up.
-See? I told you.

101
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,449
He ain't depressed if he's fucking with you.
It was an accident.

102
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,291
Look, you don't accidentally
slice your wrists.

103
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,992
Hector Passmore here passed out
as soon as he saw a little blood in the tub.

104
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,467
I didn't pass out,
I just felt a little woozy, is all.

105
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,529
I'm a pacifist, man.
I don't dig the sight of spilled blood.

106
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,940
-Tell Archie it was an accident.
-I'd really rather not talk about it right now.

107
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,440
See?

108
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,771
Whoa! Asshole!

109
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,211
Can I take a picture of your stitches?

110
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,121
Would you guys mind
getting the car for me?

111
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,125
Right, we'll get the car.

112
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,457
Can Alan come out and play?

113
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,995
Are you okay?

114
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,741
You weren't just setting me up, were you?

115
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,075
-Alan....
-It's okay, I'm not going to...

116
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,114
rip out my stitches or anything.

117
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,149
It's true, isn't it?

118
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,446
I care about you so much.

119
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,324
Then tell me the truth. I'll be okay.

120
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,191
I'm just trying to evolve here.

121
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,393
It's like you have a wall around you.

122
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,597
Like a moat to keep out your enemies.

123
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,669
I'm not your enemy.

124
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,807
I'm sorry, Jessica.

125
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,251
I figure we get fucked up...

126
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,549
go out, swipe a couple bags of candy
from trick-or-treaters...

127
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,887
then check out the Halloween party
at Kappa Gamma Nu.

128
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,756
-Far out.
-Who wants to go to Toronto?

129
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,596
As long as I can hold on
to my student deferment, I'm cool right here.

130
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,157
-They got Halloween in Canada?
-I don't know, but they got this.

131
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,566
What is it?

132
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,265
Only John Lennon
and the Plastic Ono Band.

133
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,233
-No way!
-Out-fucking-standing!

134
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,176
-Where'd you get them?
-From Jessica, for my birthday.

135
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,872
Isn't she going?

136
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:16,905
No.

137
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,418
-You're okay to travel, right? I mean....
-Man, he's okay!

138
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,749
I told you it was an accident!
Tell him you're okay, Alan.

139
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:28,452
<i>If everyone wants to know so bad that
I'm all right I'll take out an ad in The Voice.</i>

140
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,461
John "I am the fucking walrus" Lennon!

141
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,165
-Can I touch them?
-Don't let him, he's fucked up.

142
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,293
-So are you!
-Yeah, but I can maintain better than you.

143
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,595
Shit!

144
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,241
-You only got two tickets?
-Dibs. I got the car. I'm driving.

145
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,573
I got the tickets.

146
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,705
We'll all chip in and
buy the third ticket when we get there.

147
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,340
When do we go?

148
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,110
How about tonight?

149
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,982
Radical!

150
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,428
You think the other Beatles might show up?

151
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,596
Lennon's there going,
"This is an oldie, but a goodie..."

152
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,159
<i>and rips into I Want to Hold Your Hand
or something...</i>

153
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,603
and Paul, George, and Ringo
walk on stage...

154
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,073
and everybody just goes fucking apeshit!

155
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,336
As far as I'm concerned,
it's anything-can-happen day.

156
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,042
The Beatles, man!

157
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,282
-You know what's going to be weird?
-What?

158
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,913
When they get old.
What's it going to be like...

159
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,223
when Lennon and Hendrix and Janis...

160
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,594
and Jim Morrison
and all the gods of rock 'n' roll are like...

161
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,293
old and fat and bald and shit?

162
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,102
lt'll be a world I don't want to live in.

163
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,766
Amen, brother.

164
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,738
Don't answer it. It's gonna be Jessica
and she's gonna want her tickets back.

165
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,010
-Don't be ridiculous. It is not.
-It is. Don't answer!

166
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,142
It's bad news, I know it.

167
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,180
<i>-Hello?
-Hi, Alan. It's me.</i>

168
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,624
I'm sorry I said what I said. I love you.

169
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,221
Let's run away to Toronto and forget
about the rest of the world for a few days.

170
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,458
Okay? Please?

171
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,426
Please don't answer it.

172
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,531
<i>-Hello?
-Alan Parker?</i>

173
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,741
That's right.

174
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,178
<i>This is Janey McCurdy.
You know, next door to your mama?</i>

175
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,580
Hi, Mrs. McCurdy.

176
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,754
What is it? Is my mom okay?

177
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,151
It was a stroke.
It happened in the restaurant.

178
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,389
Oh, Jesus.

179
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,339
<i>I don't want you going off all halfcocked.
The doctors think she'll be okay.</i>

180
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,466
-Who is it?
-Shut up!

181
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,739
Is she still in the hospital?

182
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,516
Yes, and under the best of care.

183
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,985
You are not going to Toronto
with Cheech and Chong here...

184
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,751
while your mom's lying in a hospital
120 miles away, maybe dying.

185
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,655
When do you think you'll be coming down,
Alan? Saturday?

186
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,300
Tell her I'll be there tonight.

187
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,496
-What?
-No!

188
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,539
<i>Won't your mama be so happy to see you?</i>

189
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,875
Thanks. Bye.

190
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,478
What is it?

191
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:41,181
It's my mom. She's in the hospital
down in Lewiston. She had a stroke.

192
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,553
Shit. I'm sorry, Alan.

193
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,656
What about Toronto?

194
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,989
You guys go ahead.
I got to make sure my mom's okay.

195
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,511
<i>Look, Ma!</i>

196
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,157
I got a gold star, Ma.

197
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,377
What's the matter, Mama?

198
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,177
Oh, baby.

199
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,175
What?

200
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,513
It's gonna be okay, sweet pea.

201
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,154
Why are you crying?

202
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,821
It's your daddy.

203
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:14,932
A loving husband, a good father,
a generous friend....

204
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,842
It's just you and me now, baby.

205
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,310
Alan and Jean Parker against the world.

206
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,645
No!

207
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,699
-Thanks for the ride.
-Not a problem, man.

208
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,295
-Where you headed?
-Down to Lewiston.

209
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,533
I can take you up to Hampton Center, man.

210
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,973
Far out. Thanks.

211
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,178
-You want to get high?
-No, that's okay.

212
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,778
What are you, a narc?

213
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,984
No, I'm not a narc.

214
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,689
No, because if you're a narc,
you'd have to say you're a narc, right?

215
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,486
What's in Lewiston?

216
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,028
I've gotta see my mom in the hospital.

217
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,960
Shit. What is she, sick?

218
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,628
No, she hangs out there,
pulls tricks for a few extra bucks.

219
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,328
Kind of a hobby.

220
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,694
She had a stroke.

221
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,502
That's a drag. My mom died in a hospital.

222
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,437
Heavy shit. She had lung cancer.
She weighed like 75 pounds when she died.

223
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,640
Thanks for sharing that, asshole.
I feel much better now.

224
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,739
I'm sorry.

225
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,341
Yeah, I ain't.
She was a real DAR bitch, you know.

226
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,718
<i>Her and my dad really big on oppression.
Sieg heil, that whole thing.</i>

227
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,622
Actually, my mom's
Another Mother for Peace.

228
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,253
Oh, that's cool. Were you in the service?

229
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,354
No. Student deferment. You?

230
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,263
Fuck, no, man.
They tried to drag my ass to Vietnam.

231
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,963
I'm not going down there, man.
I'm not going to go get killed. I dig life.

232
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,336
"Give peace a chance," right?

233
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,143
I'll tell you what, pretty soon all the over-30s
are going to be six feet under.

234
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,272
Then we'll see. Did you go to Woodstock?

235
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,646
-No.
-You missed out, bro.

236
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,647
Righteous weed, skinny-dipping,
naked chicks.

237
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,347
Here, take this.

238
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,877
What the fuck was that?

239
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,543
What a trip, man. Are you all right, brother?

240
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,617
-What's with the wig?
-Shit, man!

241
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,156
Hey, man. Shit.

242
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,459
-This yours?
-Listen.

243
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,330
You know, they called me a baby killer
I'm no fucking baby killer.

244
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:07,838
I'm not gonna be a part of that war machine.
Look at me. I'm one of you.

245
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:12,571
You're not one of me,
you weekend hippie asshole.

246
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,044
-And you're a shitty driver.
-What kind of attitude is that?

247
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,644
Where are you going, man?

248
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,412
Where's that joint?

249
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,928
Mom?

250
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,198
What the fuck are you looking at?

251
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,900
Come on, let's move along.

252
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,338
Move along, please.

253
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,274
Hey, Alan, you need a ride?

254
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,324
What is it, hon?

255
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,996
How did Dad die?

256
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,102
He was killed in a car accident.
You know that.

257
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,178
Yeah, I know, but I never really knew how.

258
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,877
How did it happen?

259
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,228
He was coming home one night...

260
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,265
from a meeting he had out in Castle Rock.

261
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,430
And his car ran out of gas...

262
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,800
on Route Two, you know...

263
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,837
the middle of nowhere.

264
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,643
He was just walking down the road...

265
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,911
when someone just ran right into him.

266
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:24,250
When they finally found your daddy,
he was still holding on to the gas can.

267
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,726
I honestly don't know what I'd do
if I didn't have you.

268
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,603
Do you remember him?

269
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,033
Not so much.

270
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,372
I wish you could.

271
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,409
You're so much like him it scares me.

272
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:59,382
You get on up to Orono
and make me proud, okay?

273
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,118
Be careful, Al.

274
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:13,168
All right, son, let's perambulate along.
Nothing to see here.

275
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,899
Hello?

276
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,072
What do you want?

277
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,018
Who are you?

278
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,553
Dad?

279
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,492
She lied to you, you know.

280
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,541
-Hop on in, son. It's bugger-cold out there.
-Thanks.

281
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,820
I'm heading on down to Bowdoinham.

282
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,697
He trying to catch something?

283
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,565
You know, my wife Aleka, bless her soul,
she used to say...

284
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,207
I would end up in a ditch with a knife
in my back picking up hitchhikers.

285
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,640
But every time I see
a young fellow like you...

286
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,645
standing on the side of the road,
I think of my younger days.

287
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,271
I appreciate it.

288
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,850
Yeah. Where you headed, son?

289
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,647
Central Maine General Hospital
down in Lewiston.

290
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,155
-Yeah.
-My mother had a stroke.

291
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,623
I'm sorry to hear that.

292
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,056
-They think she'll be okay.
-Yeah.

293
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,661
Stroke's what claimed my Allie,
not four years back.

294
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,395
She just started babbling stuff,
not making a lick of sense.

295
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,532
After a while she just sort of
petered out, you know.

296
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,339
I miss her terrible.

297
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,513
On long drives,
I can still see her face sometimes...

298
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,812
sitting right there where you are.

299
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,127
Damn!

300
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:31,164
You know, I'd take you all the way,
but I promised my brother Ralph...

301
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,328
that I'd take him
over to that nursing home in Gates.

302
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,906
His wife's up there,
she's got that forgetting disease...

303
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,705
what do you call it,
Anderson's or whatever it is.

304
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:44,077
-Alzheimer's.
-Alzheimer's, yeah. That's the fellow.

305
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,644
Still, I suppose I could take you all the way.

306
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,783
Don't let him.
There's something wrong with him.

307
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:59,596
You don't have to do that.
I can get a ride from Gates easy.

308
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,330
Damn, damn truss!

309
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,631
Damn rupture!
You know, pardon my French...

310
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,402
but if you stick around
this old world long enough...

311
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,741
after a while all your works
start falling apart, you know.

312
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,575
It just seems like the longer you live...

313
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,481
the more God wants to kick you in the ass.

314
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,081
Still, it's good that you dropped everything
to go see your mom the way you're doing.

315
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,956
She's a good mom.

316
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,527
Okay, Mrs. Parker.

317
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,693
Well. This must be little Al.

318
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,430
Alan. Who are you?

319
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,761
This is Mr. Dalrymple from the ADC.

320
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,841
I think I have everything
I need for now, Mrs. Parker.

321
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,502
-Good. We'll be in touch.
-Thank you.

322
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,479
-Thanks for the coffee and cookies.
-You're welcome.

323
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,775
-Son.
-Goodbye!

324
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,755
-What's ADC?
-He says it's Aid to Dependent Children...

325
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,758
but I think it's Awful Damn Crapheads.

326
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,560
Gotta pucker up
and smooch his white heinie...

327
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:09,066
just to make sure he writes a good report,
so we can get an extra $50 a month.

328
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,724
-What?
-"Awful Damn Crapheads"?

329
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,872
It's just you and me against the world, Al.

330
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,677
Mom?

331
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,610
It got so my Allie...

332
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,476
didn't even know her own name.

333
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,220
She had that look in her eye,
like she's saying, "Let me out of here."

334
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,924
I mean, if she could think of the words
to say. You know what I mean?

335
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,894
Mom?

336
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,605
There's nothing we can really do for her.

337
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:28,008
She's going to need someone to care for her
for the rest of her life.

338
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,980
That's your job,
which means quitting school, of course...

339
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,482
and any semblance of a life
that you may have had.

340
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:39,378
Yeah. I know what you mean.

341
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,861
Look at that.
Look at that harvest moon, son.

342
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,961
Ain't she a corker?

343
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,564
Make a wish on it, boy!

344
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,732
<i>I wish my mom knows me
when I walk into her room.</i>

345
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,435
<i>That her eyes would light up
and she'd say my name.</i>

346
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,138
I wouldn't fuck with wishes if I were you.

347
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,507
<i>Remember The Monkey's Paw?</i>

348
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,875
I wish my Allie was here.

349
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,607
Oh, to hell with Ralph.

350
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,607
Why don't I just take you right on down
to Lewiston with me, son?

351
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,515
Just take you right on down there with me.
What would you say?

352
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,777
Don't do it!
It's another 20 miles of the stink of piss...

353
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:48,790
and weaving across lanes
till we get hit head on by some Mack truck!

354
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,089
He's dying, man! Can't you smell it?

355
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,197
-What do you say, son?
-No, that's okay.

356
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,767
You take care of your brother. He needs you
as much as my mom needs me.

357
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:03,101
To hell with Ralph! To hell with him!
I'll take you right to the hospital door...

358
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,642
even though we never met before.
What do you say, son?

359
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,474
What do you say? I'll take you right there!

360
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,104
No, it's okay.

361
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,379
Thanks. I can go out that way.
I can get a ride in no time.

362
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:22,183
Yeah, best you do that.

363
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,918
Get a ride outside of town.

364
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,020
Nobody would give you a ride inside town,
you know.

365
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,390
Okay.

366
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,535
You sure, now? A bird in the hand....

367
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,127
I'll be okay. Thank you.

368
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,362
Any time, son.

369
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,506
My wife Allie....

370
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,811
What's that?

371
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,255
What's the matter with you?

372
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:37,857
It was just a sad old man
with leaky plumbing in a sad old car.

373
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,627
There was nobody in there with him.

374
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,332
It was just a reflection or something.

375
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,570
What the hell were you so afraid of?

376
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,736
You were afraid you might
catch what he's got.

377
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,948
Sometimes it's right to be afraid.

378
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,519
I'm not afraid of death.

379
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,650
Oh, yeah, that's right.

380
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,087
You're the fucking Prince of Darkness.

381
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,232
Here we go.

382
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,172
Get a job, faggot!

383
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,514
Hey, fuck you!

384
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,479
Oh, shit!

385
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,995
There he is!

386
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,949
Pussy.

387
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,581
Go on! Go home!

388
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,317
Go on, go! Get! Go!

389
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,694
Jesus.

390
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,051
Don't you wanna see me before I die?

391
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,326
Of course I do, Mom.

392
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,560
Then why do you keep turning down rides?

393
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,562
Fun is fun and done is done.

394
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,237
Don't you love me?

395
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,089
Freezing.

396
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,421
-Look how high we are.
-Why did we do this?

397
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,116
-Mom, let's go.
-What?

398
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,082
I just want to go.

399
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:30,685
Al, you've been bugging me all weekend
to ride the Bullet.

400
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,991
I know. I just wanna go.

401
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,923
If you're gonna make me wait
in the freezing cold...

402
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:39,867
-you're going to go on the goddamned ride!
-I changed my mind. I can't.

403
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,029
That's it. That's the last time, buddy boy!

404
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,538
I've had it with your nonsense!

405
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,532
"George Staub."

406
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,407
Jesus, he died two years ago today.

407
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,975
Yeah, but he was born on your birthday.

408
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,852
-"Fun is fun."
-And done is done.

409
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,114
Oh, shit.

410
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,859
Mom's dead.

411
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,667
We're saving a place for you!

412
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,848
That didn't happen.

413
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,951
You're in a graveyard, on your way
to see your mom in the hospital.

414
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,789
You're riding with every maniac on the road.

415
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,227
You think you're in a horror movie,
but you're not.

416
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,232
You're just trying to get home to see Mom.

417
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,499
If you just walk out of here now
without looking back...

418
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,631
you can go on believing that
for the rest of your life.

419
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,440
Fuck that.

420
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,874
You know that's not what it said.

421
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,317
I just read it wrong.

422
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,786
Bullshit.
It said, "Fun is fun and done is done."

423
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,755
-Mom's dead.
-No.

424
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,218
-Thanks for the ride.
-Not a problem.

425
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,825
-Headed up to the city?
-Sure am.

426
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,019
Cool. Me, too.

427
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,631
Maybe we should have taken another car.

428
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,699
-What are you doing up in the city?
-Don't tell him.

429
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,604
There's something's wrong here.
Don't tell him.

430
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:45,739
My brother's getting married.
I'm gonna be his best man.

431
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:50,408
Rehearsal's tomorrow,
plus a stag party after.

432
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,214
Yeah?

433
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:56,024
Your brother's getting married. That's good.

434
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,591
-What's your name?
-Lie!

435
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:07,336
Hector. Hector Passmore.

436
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,074
There's something really wrong here.
You're never gonna make it to Lewiston.

437
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,908
Mom's dead.
You're never gonna make it home.

438
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,808
And what's that awful smell?

439
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,851
Bet you got a lot of shit for that,
back in school?

440
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,046
What?

441
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,018
Name like that. Hector Passmore.

442
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,119
Yeah, I guess so.

443
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,494
Shit, man. I'd have changed it.

444
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,059
Nice to meet you, Hector.

445
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,594
Name's George.

446
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,032
George Staub.

447
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:52,771
Formaldehyde! That's the smell!
The son of a bitch is dead!

448
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,880
<i>The dead travel fast.</i>

449
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,888
<i>I can't let him know I know.</i>

450
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,129
I dig this song, man. I really dig this song.

451
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,204
<i>Why didn't I go with the old guy
in the truss? What was I so afraid of?</i>

452
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,896
<i>The dead travel fast.</i>

453
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,567
<i>That old fart never moved more than 45.</i>

454
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,973
So, there's nothing like a wedding.

455
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:31,077
Yeah. Everyone should do it at least twice.

456
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,120
Easy! You can't let him know you know!

457
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:40,158
At least twice!
Yeah, sounds like my whole fucking family!

458
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,221
Yeah, mine, too.

459
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:47,397
-There's really nothing like a funeral, right?
-Wedding.

460
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:52,096
-What?
-Shit. You said "funeral"!

461
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,369
He knows!

462
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,780
God, what's under that hat?

463
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,593
Wedding.

464
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,128
You said "funeral."

465
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,400
Wedding.

466
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,772
Wedding is what I meant to say.

467
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,743
We always say what we mean to say, Hector.

468
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,110
That's what I think.

469
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,379
Me and Sigmund Freud.

470
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,684
He's fucking with you, man.

471
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:39,916
He knows you saw his grave.
He knows you know he's dead.

472
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,331
Feel all right?

473
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:57,733
Yeah.

474
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:02,067
-You sure?
-I'm just a little carsick, I guess.

475
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,713
I think you should let me out.

476
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:08,512
Maybe if I get a little fresh air,
my stomach will settle down.

477
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,744
Someone else will come along.

478
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,288
Oh, no, I can't let you out here.

479
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,855
In the middle of nowhere? All alone?

480
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,789
Could be hours
before someone came along...

481
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,995
and even if they did,
they might not pick you up.

482
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,402
No way I'm letting you out here.

483
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,707
Crack your window a little.

484
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,578
I know it doesn't smell so great in here.

485
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:41,879
Hung up one of those air fresheners,
but those things don't work worth a shit.

486
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,214
Of course...

487
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,583
some smells are harder to get rid of
than others.

488
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,191
Reminds me of that story...

489
00:58:56,666 --> 00:59:00,033
about that kid that buys
a brand-new Cadillac for $750.

490
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,071
You heard that story?

491
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,836
I think everybody's heard that story.

492
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,742
Kid wants to buy a car.

493
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,941
<i>Sees a brand-new Caddy sitting out
in front of this guy's house.</i>

494
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,780
<i>"For sale by owner. "</i>

495
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:19,450
<i>Kid knows he can't afford no Cadillac car.</i>

496
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,123
<i>Can't get within a shout of a Caddy...</i>

497
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,318
<i>but he's curious, you know?</i>

498
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,727
How much does something like this go for?

499
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:31,927
Kid, this is your lucky day.
$750 and you can drive it away.

500
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:36,262
Yeah, right. That's about as funny
as a screen door in a submarine.

501
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,804
No joke, kid.
Pony up the cash and she's yours.

502
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:43,502
Hell, I'll even take a check.
You've got an honest face.

503
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,741
I heard it was a Thunderbird.

504
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,776
T-Bird, Caddy, same shit.

505
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,616
It's a story.

506
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,146
I may only be 17, but I'm no idiot.

507
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,656
Nobody sells a car like this for $750.

508
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,487
I don't want her anymore, son.

509
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,228
She smells.

510
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,228
You can't get a smell like that out.

511
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:08,028
I've tried everything you can think of,
and some you can't.

512
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,270
You see....

513
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,141
<i>I was on a business trip.</i>

514
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,943
<i>Gone a couple, three weeks.</i>

515
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,660
God!

516
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:49,704
She must have been dead
practically the whole time he'd been gone.

517
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:53,338
I don't know if it was a suicide
or a heart attack or what.

518
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,543
She's all bloated up...

519
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,553
and the car, it's filled with that smell...

520
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,213
and all he wanted to do was sell it.

521
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,287
That's some story.

522
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,558
Why wouldn't he just call home?

523
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:07,822
What?

524
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,329
He's gone for weeks on a business trip...

525
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,595
he doesn't call home
to see how his wife's doing?

526
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,160
That's sort of beside the point, ain't it?

527
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:18,101
I mean, what a bargain! That's the point.

528
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,570
Who wouldn't be tempted?

529
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,544
Probably drive the fucking car
with the windows down, right?

530
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,047
It's a story. Fiction.

531
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,547
I thought of it
because of the smell in this car.

532
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,544
Which is a fact.

533
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,718
Check out this button. Thrill Village.

534
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,331
That's where I was today.

535
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,759
My girlfriend was gonna go,
but called and said she was sick.

536
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:50,135
You see, she gets these bad cramps
when she's O.T.R.

537
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,400
It's too bad...

538
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,408
but what's the alternative?

539
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,478
No rag at all? Then we'd both be in trouble.

540
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,774
So I went alone.

541
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,842
You ever been to Thrill Village?

542
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,714
Once.

543
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,018
<i>When I was 12.</i>

544
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:13,559
You didn't go alone, did you?
Not if you were 12, you didn't.

545
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,796
You didn't tell him that!
Not out loud! He's fucking with you.

546
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,700
You gotta just open the door,
tuck your head under your arms and jump!

547
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:25,467
<i>He'd only reach over and grab me
and pull me right back in with him.</i>

548
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,107
Yeah, my dad took me.

549
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,241
Your dad?

550
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,784
Did you ride the Bullet?
I rode that fucker four times!

551
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,988
Did you ride the Bullet, Alan?

552
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,052
You told him your name was Hector!

553
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,961
Don't let him know you know.

554
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:55,095
-Yeah, I rode the Bullet.
-No.

555
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,306
You didn't ride the Bullet.

556
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,613
I mean, you got in line and everything...

557
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:09,908
but you were with your mom,
not your dad. Remember?

558
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,777
The line was long...

559
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,721
your mom didn't wanna wait
out there in the cold.

560
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,050
But you kept hassling her all day.

561
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,892
And when you finally got to the head
of the line what happened, Alan?

562
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,528
You chickened out, didn't you? Didn't you?

563
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:27,961
Yes.

564
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,932
When we got close...

565
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:37,272
and I saw how high it was...

566
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,412
how it turned over the top...

567
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,379
how they screamed when it came down...

568
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,849
I chickened out.

569
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,628
And she swatted me.

570
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,529
She wouldn't talk to me all the way home.

571
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,870
I never rode the Bullet.

572
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,839
Until now.

573
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:11,042
I stopped by the state line to get some beers
on my way home.

574
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:14,082
I was gonna give my girlfriend
this button as a joke.

575
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:18,285
But you probably know
what happened then.

576
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:39,633
Every Halloween, when the moon is full
and the wind is high...

577
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,499
you might see George Staub
on Old Ridge Road...

578
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,805
Iooking for souls. Like yours!

579
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,606
There's nothing like a funeral, huh?

580
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,413
Isn't that what you said?

581
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:59,251
Let me out. Please.

582
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,180
Do you know who I am?

583
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:05,486
You're a ghost.

584
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:10,791
Come on. You can do better than that.

585
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,260
Casper is a fucking ghost.

586
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:18,101
Do I float in the air?
Can you see through me?

587
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,538
I'm a kind of messenger...

588
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,603
fucking Western Union
from beyond the grave.

589
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:29,148
Guys like me come out
whenever the circumstances are right...

590
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,977
because we like to play with guys like you.

591
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,453
Because you are one of us...

592
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:37,916
the walking dead.

593
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:43,155
Surgeon did good work.
He must have liked you.

594
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,725
After all, it is your legacy, isn't it?

595
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,138
-What do you mean?
-You know.

596
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,874
Since your dad killed himself.

597
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:57,839
Do you know how many children of suicides
commit suicide themselves?

598
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,376
It's your heritage, man.

599
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:05,019
My father didn't commit suicide.
He was killed in a car accident.

600
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:08,318
-Is that what she told you?
-It's what happened!

601
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,855
No, Alan.

602
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:14,191
Let me tell you what really happened.

603
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:40,878
<i>Splat!</i>

604
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,314
He painted Miss November with his brains.

605
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,553
That's bullshit!

606
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:49,525
Bullshit? You know it's not.

607
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,101
You know what I think?

608
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,662
I think whoever runs things
likes to be entertained.

609
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,470
He always wants to see
if you're happy with what you got...

610
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,569
or if he can talk you into
what's behind curtain number two.

611
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,978
But everything has to be just right.

612
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,777
And tonight it was.

613
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,819
You out there all by yourself,
needing a ride in the night...

614
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:15,253
in the dark, with your fucking wrist.

615
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,155
And your dad.

616
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,989
Your mother dying in the hospital.

617
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:20,653
She's not dying!

618
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,165
Yeah, right. Not yet.

619
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:29,100
None of this would've happened if I'd stayed
with the old man in the truck, would it?

620
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,968
That's hard to say.

621
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,507
Maybe he was dead, too.

622
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,609
There's no time to talk about that.

623
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,581
In five miles we're going
to start seeing houses again.

624
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:43,618
A few miles past that
is the Lewiston city line.

625
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:46,177
Which means you have to decide now.

626
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:48,788
Decide what?

627
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,421
Who rides the Bullet
and who stays on the ground.

628
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:54,993
You or your mother.

629
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,366
-What?
-I'm taking one of you with me, Al.

630
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,533
Who's it going be? You or your mom?

631
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:08,375
-What are you talking about?
-It's time for one of you to die!

632
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,542
The choice is yours. It's all up to you.

633
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,043
This shit isn't funny, man.

634
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,518
I'm serious.

635
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:23,080
I'm as serious as cancer.
You've got a choice to make.

636
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:24,926
You or Mommy.

637
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,387
So put on your thinking cap.

638
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,925
<i>Hi.</i>

639
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,760
We had peach pie, so I saved you a slice.

640
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,775
Come here, hon.

641
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,178
It's you and me against the world, Al.

642
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,785
What do you say, Al?

643
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,816
-Time's a-wasting.
-I can't decide something like that.

644
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:02,659
-It's not fair to ask me.
-I know.

645
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:05,760
They all say that.

646
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:10,196
But if you don't decide
by the time we get to that first light...

647
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,638
I'll just have to take you both.

648
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,273
Take us where?

649
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:17,244
Come on, that's an easy one.

650
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,639
This is your meat, Al.

651
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,650
Life obviously doesn't mean
that much to you.

652
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,683
You just love death, don't you?

653
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:30,187
The romance, the mystery,
the dark fucking beauty of it.

654
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,490
What's the big deal? People die every day.

655
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,359
A shitload of people.

656
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,259
It is a big deal.

657
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,834
I see.

658
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:43,133
Have we had a little change of heart,
drama boy?

659
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,766
What was that,
just a cry for help, O Prince of Darkness?

660
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,572
-No!
-What the fuck were you thinking?

661
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,574
What's more valuable than your life...

662
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,207
all that there is in your future,
hell, right now?

663
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,308
Come on, just give mom the boot.

664
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,853
She's already got diabetes,
smokes like a chimney.

665
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:02,220
-She doesn't have long left anyway.
-This is bullshit!

666
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,553
Yeah, they all say that, too.

667
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:11,698
You know, I'd just as soon take two as one.
It's more points for me.

668
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:17,203
Go ahead, Alan, you're an artist.
Paint the walls, like I did.

669
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:25,676
Come on, Al.
We're running out of wilderness.

670
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,375
What do you say?

671
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,614
It's time to choose.

672
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:34,279
-I'm not going to do that.
-Okay. Then I'll do it for you.

673
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,158
No.

674
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,969
This isn't a request, Al baby!

675
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,364
You're here for a reason.

676
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,172
It's not fair. You can't make me choose.

677
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,837
Hey, man, I didn't even have a choice.

678
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:00,478
You do.

679
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:02,808
I'd take it if I were you.

680
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,518
<i>I'm only 21.</i>

681
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:09,182
<i>I've got a whole life in front of me.
48 is old. She's sick, real sick.</i>

682
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,492
<i>And it is only a matter of time.</i>

683
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,255
Your mom worked her ass off for you.

684
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,423
All those shit jobs to put money away
so you could go to school.

685
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,227
Hell, so you could even eat.

686
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,393
Who the fuck are you anyway?

687
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,364
The angel on his right shoulder
or the devil on his left?

688
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,540
Then shut the fuck up!

689
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:31,605
Who's it going to be, Al?
You or Mommy? Or both?

690
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,041
No!

691
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,221
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

692
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,564
Just settle back and enjoy the ride, Son.

693
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:19,669
Why didn't you come, Al?
Why did you let me die all alone?

694
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,134
We never quite made it to Toronto, man!

695
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,137
Mom?

696
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:47,623
-Is that you?
-Of course it's me.

697
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,393
He brought me here.

698
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,898
You have to choose, honey.

699
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,303
You have to make the choice.

700
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,946
I can't do that, Mom.

701
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,583
You have to.

702
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,015
What's wrong with your hand?

703
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,754
You ripped the fucking skin off of it,
that's what's wrong!

704
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:29,126
You can't run away, Alan.
And you can't kill what's already dead.

705
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:32,297
Now quit pissing me off
and make your decision!

706
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:54,718
Hurry, Al. Speed it up.
That's the first house.

707
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,095
If you've got something to tell me,
you better tell me now.

708
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:01,396
<i>How do you choose?
How the hell do you choose?</i>

709
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,636
I've had it with your nonsense!

710
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,867
<i>Just you and me against the world, Al.</i>

711
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:13,604
<i>I honestly don't know what I'd do
if I didn't have you.</i>

712
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:16,481
<i>Make me proud, okay?</i>

713
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,290
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

714
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,422
Now, Al. Now!

715
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,797
Is it going to be your mother or you?

716
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,029
Now, Al!

717
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:42,303
Take her! Take my Mom, don't take me!

718
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,072
Pleasant dreams, Al.

719
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,175
Where are you headed, son?

720
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,803
-Lewiston.
-That works for both of us. Come on.

721
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:52,479
Thank you.

722
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:16,737
Good luck, son.
I hope your mom's on the mend.

723
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,267
Thanks.

724
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:23,502
Did you ride the Bullet?
I rode that fucker four times.

725
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,447
You all right, son?
You come over all shivery.

726
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:32,014
I'm okay.

727
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:35,322
Thanks again.

728
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,752
Hi, I'm here to see Jean Parker.

729
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:12,853
I'm sorry, visiting hours end at 9:00.

730
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,927
She's my mother. She had a stroke.

731
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:19,458
I hitchhiked all the way
from Orono to see her.

732
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:24,533
We can make the occasional exception
for immediate family, I think.

733
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,070
Thank you.

734
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,207
Let's see, that was Parker?

735
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:31,268
Right. Jean Parker.

736
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,384
Let me call Dr. Higgins.

737
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:46,284
Okay.

738
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,893
He'll be here in just a minute.

739
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,265
Mr. Parker?

740
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:59,866
I'm sorry, Alan,
but your mother passed away at about 8:00.

741
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,769
Let's see, that was Parker?

742
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,208
Right. Jean Parker.

743
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,677
I've got to call Dr. Shustek.

744
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,613
-What is it?
-Hi, Dr. Shustek.

745
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,713
Jean Parker's son is here.

746
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,083
Okay.

747
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,150
Dr. Shustek will be right here.

748
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,095
Mr. Parker?

749
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:27,427
I'm not going to lie to you.
Your mother is a vegetable.

750
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,697
A rutabaga. A banana squash.

751
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,005
She's fucked. And so are you.

752
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:37,003
Let's see. Here she is, in 487.

753
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,439
Let me call up and see
if it's okay for you to come up.

754
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,743
-Is she okay?
-Hang on a second.

755
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,516
Hi, Annie. Jean Parker's son is here.
Could he come up and see her?

756
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:53,282
Annie's just going down to check in on her.
It'll just be a minute.

757
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,589
Thanks.

758
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:08,439
<i>It's real.</i>

759
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,746
<i>Then why isn't she dead?</i>

760
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,938
Okay, Annie. I understand.

761
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,247
I will. Thanks.

762
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,015
Annie says you can come up,
but just for a few minutes.

763
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:24,320
Your mother's had her evening medication,
and she's a little soupy.

764
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,586
Thanks.

765
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:29,821
Mr. Parker? Hurry up, she's going.

766
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:33,327
-Going?
-No, I just meant the sedative.

767
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,063
She's going to sleep, that's all I meant.

768
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,567
God, I am so stupid. No, she is fine, just....

769
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:43,168
-You're not going to faint, are you?
-No.

770
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:00,819
I know what you did, Al!

771
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:13,325
Alan?

772
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,430
Honey?

773
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,913
Now, don't you cry.

774
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,313
No need for that.

775
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,383
I came as soon as I heard.

776
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,457
Mrs. McCurdy called.

777
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:46,456
I told her that the weekend would be fine.

778
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,628
Yeah, to hell with that.

779
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:54,270
How did you get here?

780
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:56,943
I hitchhiked.

781
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:58,805
Gory.

782
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,911
You have blood in your hair.

783
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:11,423
It's nothing, Mom. I bumped my head.

784
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,590
Not good.

785
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:17,430
You have to take care of yourself.

786
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,597
I think we should let her sleep now.
She's had a rough day.

787
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,532
I know.

788
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:30,133
I'm going, Ma.

789
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:33,212
I'll be back first thing tomorrow.

790
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:36,139
You get some sleep, okay?

791
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:40,019
Sleep. That's all I do.

792
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:50,994
I dreamed we were at that amusement park.

793
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:55,964
You did?

794
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:58,367
Waiting in line...

795
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,165
for the roller coaster...

796
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,141
that goes way up high.

797
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,474
Remember that one?

798
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:11,412
-The Bullet.
-The Bullet, yes.

799
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:15,183
You were so scared.

800
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,789
And I shouted at you.

801
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:24,064
Shouted and swatted you.

802
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:26,995
It's all right, Ma.

803
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,163
I'm so sorry.

804
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,831
That was a long time ago.

805
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:39,213
You never got your ride.

806
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,673
Mr. Parker, it really is time to go.

807
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,516
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

808
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:54,560
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

809
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:58,327
So sorry.

810
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:10,930
<i>There's nothing like a brush with mortality
to teach you to appreciate life.</i>

811
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,766
<i>A little bite of death
can help you grow up real quick.</i>

812
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,806
<i>Mom got out of the hospital a few days later.</i>

813
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:24,414
<i>She walked with a limp for a while.
About a month later she was back at work.</i>

814
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:29,184
<i>She tried to quit smoking
and for a little while, she did.</i>

815
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:33,019
<i>Then I came back for spring break
a day early and there she was....</i>

816
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:39,793
<i>We had a couple of pretty good years
after that.</i>

817
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:42,267
<i>I visited her most every weekend.</i>

818
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,538
<i>We'd play gin rummy or talk politics
until all hours.</i>

819
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,206
<i>Had a bucket-Ioad of laughs,
as she liked to say.</i>

820
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:04,282
Mom?

821
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:20,800
<i>Then one night...</i>

822
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,007
<i>she stopped laughing.</i>

823
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:38,818
<i>I will never forget
and always regret the choice I'd made.</i>

824
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:44,261
<i>The memory of that night
out on the Old Ridge Road never faded...</i>

825
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,857
<i>and grew dreamlike, as I expected it would.</i>

826
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:51,928
I'm sorry, Mom.

827
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,956
<i>I can't help but think
that maybe George Staub...</i>

828
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:15,923
<i>if there really was a George Staub...</i>

829
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:18,591
<i>just teased me with a little more time...</i>

830
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,963
<i>a couple more years.</i>

831
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:24,397
<i>But I was glad to have them.</i>

832
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:26,903
<i>It unlocked my heart.</i>

833
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:36,280
<i>Jessica and I got married a year later...</i>

834
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:38,011
<i>but it didn't last.</i>

835
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,076
<i>It wasn't anybody's fault.</i>

836
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:43,054
<i>We tried, but nothing ever seems to last.</i>

837
01:32:59,106 --> 01:33:02,769
<i>The Beatles never did get together
in Toronto back in 1969.</i>

838
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:05,374
<i>They never got together again.</i>

839
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:10,839
<i>John Lennon's life was taken
by a maniac with a gun...</i>

840
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:14,220
<i>George Harrison's by cigarettes and cancer.</i>

841
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,584
<i>And I never made a living as an artist.</i>

842
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,927
<i>But I still paint, because it's what I do.</i>

843
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:30,200
<i>I miss my mom
and I still think about her a lot.</i>

844
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:34,038
<i>I miss that time, too.</i>

845
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:38,804
<i>From the time of her stroke in 1969
to the time of her passing in 1972...</i>

846
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:41,137
<i>my world changed forever.</i>

847
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,182
<i>I think everybody's did.</i>

848
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:45,686
<i>Nothing seems to last...</i>

849
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:50,950
<i>but the Bullet.</i>

850
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:54,893
<i>The Bullet is constant.
The Bullet is always there.</i>

851
01:33:57,798 --> 01:33:59,663
<i>You wait in line, that's all.</i>

852
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:03,261
<i>When it's your turn to ride the Bullet,
maybe you ride and maybe you run.</i>

853
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:05,669
<i>Either way, it comes to the same thing.</i>

854
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:09,735
<i>Fun is fun and done is done.</i>

855
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:16,581
<i>Nobody lives forever, but we all shine on.</i>

856
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,172
You want a ride?

857
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:48,281
No, thanks. I think I'll walk.

858
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:57,453
Take your button and get out of here.
