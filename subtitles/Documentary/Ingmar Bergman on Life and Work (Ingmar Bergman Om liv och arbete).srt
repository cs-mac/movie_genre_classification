"Nobody can blow the
candle of life.."

3
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:20,378
"..which is protected
by God himself.."

00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:23,946
"Roll sound. Camera. Action"!.

5
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:45,811
Have you ever loved someone?

6
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:46,937
Yes!

7
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:48,344
Have you ever given your heart away?

8
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:49,473
Yes!

9
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,210
Me too!

10
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:18,775
All my young friends out there!

11
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,508
Don't you fall in love here!

12
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:29,522
I have loved and lost
my mind and sleep.

13
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:38,092
People around don't lie,
it's all true!

14
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:45,928
There is no ailment
like falling in love.

15
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:50,536
There is no control in the matters
of heart, what to do?!

16
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,545
There is no control in the matters
of heart, what to do?!

17
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:58,874
And there is no cure for
this ailment, too!

18
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:06,552
So sing, 'Om Shanti Om'!

19
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,097
'Om Shanti Om'!

20
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:18,161
'Om Shanti Om'!

21
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:30,076
'Om..
- Shanti Om'!

22
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:33,312
'Om..
- Shanti Om'!

23
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,581
'Om Shanti Om'!

24
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,589
'Om Shanti Om'!

25
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:40,421
'Om Shanti Om'!

26
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:45,422
'Om Shanti Om'!

27
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:53,166
'Om..

28
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,481
Hey Sidekick! What do you
think you are doing?

29
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:02,606
You are not the hero of the film.

30
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,473
What is it to you? Are you
the director of the film?

31
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,553
If I was, I would
Kick you out first!

32
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:09,179
Buzz off! - Cut it good shot.
- Lunch break, good shot!

33
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:17,020
Hey you! Mr. 'Hero'!

34
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,564
Who me?

35
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,896
Yes you!! Is that your
father's jacket that..

36
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,333
.. you are happily sneaking
out with it?!

37
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:26,463
E! Don't drag my father into this!

38
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:30,202
Why? Is your dad some 'Raj Kapoor'
who will stop our shoot!

39
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,641
Come on, return the jacket! Quick!

40
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,305
Relax! The 'hero' gave it to me with
so much love, that I just wore it!

41
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:39,151
Come on! Wearing this jacket
will not make you a hero..

42
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:42,120
You need a good face and personality
as well! Now give it back!

43
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:45,191
Idiot! Spoilt the jacket -Every
fool wants to become a hero!

44
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:47,050
Uncle.

45
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,293
Pappu! Did you hear that!

46
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:51,659
Don't worry Buddy!

47
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:56,662
How will a drunk dressman recognise
a superstar like you?

48
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:58,527
Superstar?!

49
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,663
Pappu you're sure l
will become a hero?

50
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,674
Of course! You Will definitely
become a hero.

51
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:05,341
My mom also says that!

52
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:07,573
I bet every comedian's mother says
that to her son as well Omi!

53
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,081
Really!
- Yes! That's how mothers are!

54
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:12,410
But you will surely become a hero.

55
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,955
But l, Pappu Master am telling..

56
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,422
..you that you will become a hero.

57
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:20,083
Because you have everything
it takes -

58
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:27,598
Style, Hair style, Grace,
Face, Talent!

59
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:31,504
But there is just one thing standing
between you and your stardom!

60
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:36,032
What's that?

61
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:37,167
Your name!

62
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,048
My name? Om Prakash Makhija!

63
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,344
Your Credit for two months
is still pending!

64
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:45,611
Ok OK! I will clear it!

65
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,118
When, in this lifetime or the next?

66
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,988
By the way, your soggy cream rolls..

67
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,354
.. are also from the silent
movie era! Pappu!

68
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:56,724
The day I become a superstar, l
will shut down this canteen first!

69
00:05:57,564 --> 00:06:01,056
You better remember my name Mister,
Om Prakash Makhija.. Go.

70
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:06,162
That's the problem Omi! We could have
managed with just Om and Prakash.

71
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:10,232
But 'Makhija', how will you ever
become a star with this name?!

72
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:12,676
I will not? - Of course not!
Now look at that poor guy.

73
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,475
He is also struggling
to become a hero.

74
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:16,674
You! Over here!
- Ya!

75
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:18,141
What is your name?

76
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:19,409
Govinda Ahuja!

77
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,749
God! You will never become
a hero with this name!

78
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:30,558
Why don't you change your name to a
dashing Rohan Kapoor or Raj Kiran.

79
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:32,592
The producers will start
queuing up instantly!

80
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,291
Just Govinda will do?!

81
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:36,762
Try it!

82
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,098
Thank you! Thank you!

83
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:43,666
You're right Pappu. Why did
father give me this name?

84
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:46,044
Out of all the amazing
actors in the..

85
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:48,637
.. industry like Jeetendra,
Dharmendra.

86
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,344
But my Dad's favourite had
to be Om Prakash! Gosh!

87
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:04,189
Look! Here comes everyone's
favourite-Rajesh Kapoor!

88
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:13,134
Autograph, please.
- Please, sir.

89
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,802
Now that is a Hero's name
- Kapoor! A name to reckon with!

90
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:24,082
Now get rid of this Makhija and
try changing your name to..

91
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:28,553
.. 'Kapoor' or 'Khanna', then see,
how your life takes off in one shot!

92
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:31,818
You're Right Pappu! I would have
changed my name today itself. - But?!

93
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:35,490
But you know what Mom will say!

94
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:41,224
Nooooooooo!

95
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,830
Oh My Lord! What am I hearing?

96
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,471
My darling son wants
to change his name!

97
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:54,843
I ask you what is wrong
with your name?

98
00:07:55,215 --> 00:08:01,347
Om stands for the Lord and
Prakash for Light, and..

99
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:04,549
And Makhija! Makhija stands
for shooing a fly away!

100
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:07,183
I can tolerate 'Om' and 'Prakash'.

101
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:12,857
With a name like Makhija, I will
never become a hero! Never!

102
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:17,863
You will definitely become
a hero one day my darling!

103
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,637
My heart says so. A mother's
heart is says so.

104
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,209
Mother's heart can go to hell!

105
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,804
I know I will never become
a hero with this name,

106
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:29,143
in this lifetime atleast!..

107
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:30,614
..I will die a Junior Artiste.

108
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:33,810
Just like dad!

109
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:42,359
Om Prakash's Father! I am glad you
died before hearing all this!

110
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,222
Quit overacting mom! Now I know why
you could never become a heroine!

111
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,236
Overacting and me?!

112
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:54,639
Do you know, I was called by the
Great K. Asif to screen test?

113
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:58,177
If it wasn't for you in my stomach..

114
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,509
.. then your Mother would have been
Anarkali of "Mughal-e-azam"!

115
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:08,249
Madhubala was not too bad herself,
but if I was the heroine of the film-

116
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:11,916
- Then the film would
have flopped badly!

117
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:15,193
Mom the truth is..

118
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:17,695
..that you are a Junior Artiste,
dad was a junior artiste.

119
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,197
And may be, I too shall always..

120
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,929
.. remain a Junior Artiste!
Case Dismissed!!

121
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:29,207
Om! Wait! I have made
your favourite pudding.

122
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:31,868
Silly boy has got upset.

123
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:33,939
What happened, Mummy? Why
are you standing like this?

124
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:38,780
See Pappu! Your Useless friend
fought with me again and stormed off.

125
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:45,224
Really? Then he must have gone to
meet his girlfriend on the bridge.

126
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:47,452
Girlfriend?

127
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:52,458
How are you Shanti? All well?

128
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:56,232
You know why I keep
coming back to you..

129
00:09:56,336 --> 00:10:00,238
..because you are my inspiration..

130
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,969
..my strength, my dream,
my destination. You.

131
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:11,648
Hey! Hope you are not getting
bored Shanti.. Thanks.

132
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,310
You know I am a very good actor.

133
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:18,256
Mother and Pappu also say that
one day I'll become a big hero.

134
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:20,986
But do you know, I want to become
a star only for you Shanti!

135
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:23,995
So that I can stand next
to you and say..

136
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:30,393
Hey! Hope you are not
getting bored? Thanks.

137
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,271
You know what I love the most about
you, that I keep talking..

138
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:38,003
.. and you never get bored.
You just keep smiling at me.

139
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:42,280
I know, you have millions of fans,
but let me tell you one thing..

140
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:46,284
.. no one can love
you more than I do.

141
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,286
Oh! And even if you were not
Shanti, the 'Superstar'..

142
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,620
..but Shanti the 'super
Junior Artiste',

143
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,626
I would still love you as much.

144
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:58,797
And believe me, we will
definitely meet one day.

145
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,026
And that day is not
very far my friend.

146
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:05,462
Pappu, Mother-when did you come?
Why didn't you say anything?

147
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,039
There was no need! Now get a side!

148
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:10,041
Let me take a look at
my Daughter-in-law.

149
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:13,378
God! She is like a
sparkling diamond!

150
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,811
Oh Mother! Stop it.

151
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:18,311
Listen please forgive me today for..

152
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:19,749
.. getting angry and
saying nasty things.

153
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,445
Don't worry my darling Prince.

154
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,319
One day you will become a hero..

155
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:27,393
..and your face will be on a poster

What I tell you in my dreams every
day, should I whisper it in your ear?

186

to beg for some ivory light.

192
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:57,162
Your gaze has seared my heart
so bad, hope it is not in vain.

Why feel shy from your beloved?
Let me touch you today my love!

233
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:27,534
I walk in a drunk pace
I totter in a daze.

234
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,872
My youth is a glass
of wine it seems.

240
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,474
How do I heed to this
wandering heart?

241
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:42,947
How do I make an emperor mine?

242
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:53,618
How do I wear the crown of love?
Why do you rule my heart beloved?

243
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:06,165

00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:19,644
after gazing at the splendor
of your youth.

is in my songs.

In your love for me, is my victory.

249
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:31,620
Winning this toss, is my loss.

250
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:38,261
But a loss like this
has your love in it.

251
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:47,639
Forget all the chores for the day,
let me touch you today.

252

308
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,331
And if it is not happy then it's
not 'the end' my friends!

309
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:18,949
The film is not over yet!
The film is not over yet!

310
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:23,481
I love you! I love you! I love you
all! I love you Rajesh Kapoor.

311
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:26,217
What a pathetic speech! That also
in the middle of the night!

312
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,384
I love you.
- Get lost!

313
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:30,661
Pappu! Look at him..

314
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:34,789
Hey you drunkard. You
did not recognize him?

315
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,958
Who are you?

316
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:38,929
He is superstar Om!

317
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,905
And you didn't recognize him? He
is the famous hero Manoj Kumar!

318
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:45,967
Then I am the famous wrestler
- Dara Singh! Get lost!

319
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:08,594
Om! Is that you?

320
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:13,595
It is mom.

321
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:16,675
What took you so long?
I was so scared!

322
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:21,577
Oh! My melodramatic mom! What
is there to get scared in it?

323
00:27:22,648 --> 00:27:28,018
You know however late I may get, l
will always come back home- to you!

324
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:33,417
Ok then, freshen up! I
will get food for you.

325
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,719
No
- I have eaten.

326
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,023
And you are drunk as well!

327
00:27:38,931 --> 00:27:44,028
Please forgive me today..
I am sorry!

328
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,806
Today was special.. you always
tell me that this moon is..

329
00:27:49,408 --> 00:27:50,636
What moon?

330
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:56,613
Look here mother
- the one in the sky! Over there!

331
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,314
You always tell me that
you have a dream for me..

332
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,047
..to reach for the
stars and the moon.

333
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,050
Tonight I went for the
stars and beyond.

334
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:12,989
I almost lived my dream. I even
touched it- with my own two hands.

335
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:14,456
Really?

336
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:17,061
Really! Oh my Prince!

337
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:20,064
Now sleep! You have to go
for shoot early morning!

338
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:27,344
This foolish make up man has pasted
my moustache so tightly..

339
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:30,415
.. I can't even open my mouth! How
Will I say my dialogues now?!

340
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:31,740
Look at brighter side, no one will..

341
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:33,079
.. recognize you with
the moustache atleast!

342
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:34,777
That's so true!
- That's why I've also put a mole.

343
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,411
Wow! I can hardly recognize
you with that!

344
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:37,955
You get lost! Assistant Sir! Here!

345
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,422
Am I supposed to do all
the work around here?

346
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,350
Sir, please tell me
what is the scene..

347
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:44,725
..exactly and what are my dialogues?

348
00:28:45,464 --> 00:28:48,900
The scene is, that this
field is on fire!

349
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:52,095
Actions!
- And your dialogue is - 'RUN!!

350
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:53,695
And?

351
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:56,498
That's it!

352
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,633
RUN!

353
00:28:57,743 --> 00:28:58,767
Assistant Sir! Sir!

354
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:00,971
Only 'run'?! But it is hardly
a dialogue! It's miniscule!

355
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,638
Miniscule!? I Have written it!

356
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:07,117
Oh wow! Amazing dialogue! How
creative! People will love it.

357
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,380
But Sir, if I had a better 'hero like'
dialogue, I would be so grateful.

358
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:10,819
Yes sir!

359
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,550
The hero of the film will say 'Hero
-like' dialogues, not you.

360
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,127
And he is there
- Ricky Sandhu!

361
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:22,900
Ok Madam, no problem! Someone
Call the Producer!

362
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:25,596
Oh God! This mad director is acting
up again! You Get lost from here.

363
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,737
Ricky Sandhu that ass..

364
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:32,470
Hush! He is the hero!

365
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:38,778
My shot is ready and she will not
shoot till the Producer comes!

366
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:43,150
She is telling me
- 'Partho Roy'-the great Director,

367
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:44,745
That she will come out only
when the producer is here.

368
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,484
Call the damn Producer!
Call Mukeshji!

369
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,719
Suresh Uncle, what
is all this drama?

370
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:51,428
Same old story! The heroine
is refusing to shoot..

371
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,430
.. they must have not paid
her for the last schedule!

372
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,432
Of course not! The
Producer of this..

373
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:56,831
.. film is a very big man
- Mukesh Mehra!

374
00:29:56,936 --> 00:29:59,427
It doesn't matter how big
or small the Producer is..

375
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:02,029
..these stars treat all
of them like dogs!

376
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:03,165
Uncle!!!
- Control!

377
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:05,175
Our Shanti ji is not like that!

378
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:09,036
Correct! Mukesh Mehra is the one
who gave her the first break!

379
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:14,816
In a film called 'ode to youth'.
Then Shanti was only sixteen!

380
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:18,051
"Greetings.."

381
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:19,818
Hey! Mukeshji is here! Mukeshji

382
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,969
Now watch, how the shooting
will start in ten minutes?!

383
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:40,067
Mukesh ji is amazing.
-What personality!

384
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:41,203
Totally Dashing!

385
00:30:44,116 --> 00:30:46,209
He should become a hero!
He is Tall as well!

386
00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:47,546
Smarty pants!

387
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,493
You know uncle, we would never..

388
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,626
.. do this measly dacoit role
for any other producer.

389
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:07,733
It is Mukeshji's film
that's why we agreed!

390
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,239
You seem to be coughing
a lot suddenly.

391
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:14,112
All ok.. Shanti will be ready in
10 minutes. You set up the shot.

392
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:19,583
Very good! Problem solved!
Mukeshji. My creativity is sinking..

393
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:22,153
Stop crying for every
little thing Partho.

394
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,087
This is Bombay. This is
how we make films here.

395
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:28,252
And make sure you finish
this scene today itself.

396
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,158
Of course! Of course!! I have
placed three cameras.

397
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:33,527
Just like the great art house
makers - One Satyajit Ray angle..

398
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,533
..One Bimolda angle, One Gurudott
angle.. totally in the shadows.

399
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:38,267
Put a Manmohan Desai angle as
well! The mainstream one.

400
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:40,264
That's the one that will work.

401
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:43,132
Camera ready! Wide angle!

402
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,104
Take it to a bit right.

403
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:55,148
Shanti baby! You are too much really!

404
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:58,746
You took so long! What are you
doing after pack up darling?

405
00:31:58,857 --> 00:31:59,881
Committing Suicide!

406
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,957
Baby I am ready to die
with you as well!

407
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:08,227
Ok! Going for the shot!
Field clear! Field clear!

408
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,631
Sir you are in the field!

409
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:11,134
What? Ok!

410
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:16,299
Light the fire! Start
rolling! Action!

411
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:17,801
Sir you are supposed
to say Camera first!

412
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,934
Uh yes! Camera..

413
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:23,638
Saarjoooo!
- Hey, somebody help her.

414
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:26,582
Run!

415
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:30,849
Run!

416
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:35,325
RUN!

417
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,127
Saarjoooo!
- Help very good.

418
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:40,323
Saarjoooo!

419
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:42,058
Very good! Sarjoo!
Jump into the fire!

420
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:45,000
This fire is too hot! Let it cool
down a bit-I will jump!! I will jump!

421
00:32:45,104 --> 00:32:47,834
What the hell is happening?
Put out the fire!

422
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,669
Sir, Cut the shot! Sarjoo
is refusing to jump in!

423
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:52,209
No!.. Till I get an okay
shot I can't cut it.

424
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,938
The Producer wants to
finish the scene today!

425
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:56,207
Jump. Some one help!

426
00:32:57,216 --> 00:33:00,617
While shooting 'Mother lndia' -
Sunil Dutt saved Nargis from the fire

427
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,243
Just like this.And then
they got married.

428
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:05,952
But I am already married.
So what's the point.

429
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:07,821
Help!

430
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:10,928
Shantiji is alone there.
Please help her.

431
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:14,795
If you are so concerned, why don't
you jump into the fire?! Packup!

432
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,162
I don't want to shoot anymore.

433
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:21,138
Somebody please cut the shot!

434
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,367
Somebody please jump in the fire!

435
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,804
Om.

436
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:18,353
Om.

437
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:20,292
Om Fire!

438
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,094
Where?
- Behind you!

439
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:25,136
Hey, somebody help me.

440
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:35,974
Omi! What happened! Hold him.
Omi! What happened!

441
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,447
Cut the shot! Very good!

442
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:51,160
Doctor can't you cut down your fee?
You came for half a shift only!

443
00:34:53,098 --> 00:34:54,463
It's hurting a lot Omi?
- Yes.

444
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,459
Have you lost it? Look at me,
I am talking to you!

445
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:02,000
What would I go and tell mother, if
something were to happen to you?

446
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,240
Look at me, I am talking to you!

447
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:05,367
Oh ho! Shanti was in the fire.

448
00:35:05,477 --> 00:35:08,446
Shanti can go to hell! There were
lots of people to rescue her.

449
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:12,476
But who would have come to save
you? Look at me, I am talking to you!

450
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:13,875
Then stop moving around!

451
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:19,754
Shut up! Thank God your back
was burnt and not your face!

452
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:21,758
Otherwise, instead of
becoming a film star..

453
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,760
.. you would have to work
in a horror film!

454
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:24,886
Fine, I would have worked
in a horror film.

455
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:29,333
So what?

456
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:33,770
Worse come to worse I would have
died in that fire? So what?

457
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:37,898
Pappu, I did not think that time.

458
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:41,846
All I could see was Shanti trapped
in that fire, helpless.

459
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:46,777
And you know, if need be, I will
jump in that fire again and again!

460
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:51,515
Not once but hundred times,
thousand times, to save Shanti!

461
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,159
Because nothing is more precious
to me than Shanti's life.

462
00:35:57,262 --> 00:36:01,221
My life, my dreams, nothing matters!

463
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:06,127
Now you look at me!

464
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:10,139
You look at me! What are you doing?

465
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:13,336
What are you doing?

466
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:19,309
I have known many people in my life,

467
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,815
but nobody has ever done anything
like this for me..

468
00:36:23,922 --> 00:36:27,255
.. what you have done,
being a stranger.

469
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,020
Shanti! I may be a stranger for you.

470
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:33,996
But you are already a part of me,
without you, I am incomplete.

471
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,889
What is your name?

472
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:40,165
My name is something which is
always connected to Shanti.

473
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:44,205
Om, before Shanti and
Om, after Shanti.

474
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,568
See, I know you are not mute.

475
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:51,047
If you will not tell me your name
then how will I thank you?

476
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:53,912
Om!
- Om!

477
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:56,048
Shanti.
- Om.

478
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:01,056
I think I have seen you somewhere.

479
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:03,590
Ya.. that night at the Premiere.

480
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:05,856
On the Posters! You must have..

481
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,489
.. seen the Posters of
his film 'Madras King'.

482
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,933
He is the rising star from the
south - Our Omaswami Shantinatahan!

483
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:13,061
Omswami who?

484
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:14,604
You! Who else?

485
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:16,372
He is so down to earth!

486
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:20,609
Who can tell that his last
film was a blockbuster hit?

487
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:22,003
Really?
- Really?

488
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,878
Really! You will see Shanti..

489
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:28,510
..very soon our Om will be the king
of Bombay lndustry as well.

490
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:31,046
Really?
- Really! - Of course!

491
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:36,623
By the way, you have made
one fan here already.

492
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:40,260
Not a fan, a friend Shantiji.

493
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:41,957
Call me Shanti.

494
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:48,638
Shanti?
- Shall I leave? - Ok..

495
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,634
Thank you once again.

496
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:58,949
Rule number one of friendship.
No sorry, no thank you!

497
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,215
Is this a dialogue of some film?

498
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:07,082
Not yet!! Om writes
his own dialogues.

499
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:14,362
Madam.. no.. sorry..
no.. thank you..

500
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:18,491
Sooraj what are you doing here?
Our set is over there. Let's go.

501
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:19,934
Daddy I was writing dialogues.

502
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:22,939
Oh Ok. Sing a sing a song..

503
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:32,340
Come on, hurry up.

504
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:38,686
Where is the camera?

505
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:45,694
You shotgun. me Quick Gun Murugan.

506
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:54,568
What is it, Rascal?

507
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:59,567
To die! Mind it!

508
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:00,702
Wow, what acting!

509
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,411
Wow, what acting!

510
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:08,649
Never mind it!

511
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,265
You Rascal! Mind it!

512
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:31,399
Wow, what acting!

513

Wow, what acting!

00:39:34,112 --> 00:39:35,511

00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:38,310
Tiger, tiger, tiger..

516

Mind it! Tiger!!

517
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:44,412
Wow, what a tiger!

518
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:46,590
Wow, What a tiger!

519

Naughty pussy!

522
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:02,106
Who is your daddy?

523
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:04,038
You want to say sorry..

Have you been to London to see
the Queen! Go See the queen!

526
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:17,178
Find it!

527
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,785
You fly! You die!

528
00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:32,135
Wow, what flying!

529
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:34,570

Wow, what Acting! Wow what acting!

533
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,688
Move on! You've just mugged
one line and rattling it!

534
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:57,819
Pappu! Is she coming?

535
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,829
Yes, you keep signing autographs!

536
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:03,731
Yes, I'll do it.
- Keep signing. - Yes, you go. Go.

537
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:07,635
Not me, but Shivaji Ganeshan,
Kamala Hassan, Gemni Ganeshan.

538
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:08,831
Autograph please!

539
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:14,167
No autographs on hands.. Oh Shanti?

540
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:18,774
When did you come?

541
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:21,717
Just now. You gave a superb shot.

542
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:23,511
Thanks.. a..

543
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:28,449
..this is nothing. You should
see my death scene some day.

544
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,594
I die splendidly! Very lively.

545
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:32,390
Is it?
- My spot!

546
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:36,257
Sir. My on the spot!

547
00:41:37,235 --> 00:41:39,135
And the best thing is, get going,
whichever film I die in..

548
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:41,705
..becomes a super hit.

549
00:41:41,806 --> 00:41:43,535
In this film, I die four times.

550
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:44,870
Four Times?
- Yes!

551
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:47,137
Double role sir! - Double role.
We are twins in the film.

552
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:50,306
Before lnterval, the villain
kills both of us.

553
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:52,713
And after the interval
we are reborn.

554
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:59,347
We kill the villain in the climax
and die again. Mind it!

555
00:42:02,794 --> 00:42:05,888
You are the first person who is
so happy after dying four times.

556
00:42:06,264 --> 00:42:09,631
Thank you! Actually, I love
everything about shooting.

557
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:13,333
Action! Lights!
Costume! Autograph!

558
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:19,642
Hey, hope you are not getting bored?

559
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:21,369
Absolutely not!

560
00:42:23,815 --> 00:42:24,839
Thanks..

561
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,810
What do you like the
most about shooting?

562
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:32,256
Pack up!
- Pack up!

563
00:42:32,357 --> 00:42:38,262
Hey! Who said pack up?! Break time
is over! Hey you! Sheila, Ramu!

564
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:39,796
Move towards your set everyone!

565
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:41,923
Sir Om Prakash,
will you please go on the set?

566
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,394
Come on, move everybody.

567
00:42:44,502 --> 00:42:46,470
Hey! What are you all staring at?

568
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:48,198
Everybody is looking for
you on the set next door!

569
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:49,765
Take it easy.

570
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,333
Give the vest also.

571
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,275
This is mine!
- Ok.

572
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:56,939
No, It is really mine.

573
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:05,950
Please forgive me Shanti.
I lied to you.

574
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:07,951
But what could I do?

575
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,956
You are such a big star and
I am just a junior artiste.

576
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,692
Who says you are just
a Junior artiste?

577
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:21,572
You jumped in the fire for me Om!

578
00:43:24,342 --> 00:43:25,366
You are a hero!

579
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:31,976
And if I can do anything for you,
I would be delighted to.

580
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:35,711
Anything, except jumping
in the fire!!

581
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,256
No.. There is something that
you can do for sure..

582
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:43,953
..but it will be almost like
jumping in the fire for you.

583
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:52,734
I don't think she will come.

584
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:54,565
Even I think so.
- Really?

585
00:43:54,973 --> 00:43:57,806
I'm just joking. She will
definitely come. - Shut up.

586
00:43:58,576 --> 00:43:59,770
Is everything ready inside?

587
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:05,009
Of course! She will have the time
of her life today! Good look.

588
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:12,015
A promise made, has to kept!

589
00:44:12,857 --> 00:44:15,792
Even if the world stops you..

590
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:18,886
Wait.. - Hey, this is sister.
- Who is Om Prakash?

591
00:44:19,397 --> 00:44:20,421
If you've to give something then me.

592
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,556
If you've to take something,
then him

593
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:23,964
Actually Shanti Ma'am has sent me.

594
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:26,836
She is very sorry that
she cannot come today.

595
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:32,871
See Pappu! With what style
she has broken my heart!

596
00:44:33,411 --> 00:44:37,370
Forget it, dude. All I had asked
for, was an evening with her!

597
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:41,316
Please go! And tell your Shanti..

598
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:45,048
..not to play with someone's
emotions like this.

599
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:50,560
After all it is not a glass bangle
but my heart that she has broken!

600
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:52,788
Tell her yourself.

601
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:55,058
Your culprit is standing right here.

602
00:45:06,845 --> 00:45:09,040
I was telling this idiot
that you will come!

603
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:10,341
This idiot kept saying you won't!

604
00:45:10,448 --> 00:45:12,006
What Rubbish! I was saying
that you will come.

605
00:45:12,117 --> 00:45:13,948
You are a liar! I was saying that.

606
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:15,952
You are a liar!
- Un.. unn cut it!!.

607
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,681
How could I not come?

608
00:45:19,057 --> 00:45:21,491
It was a promise made to a
friend I had to keep it.

609
00:45:27,866 --> 00:45:29,356
You have stopped me from
saying thank you..

610
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,628
..but please don't say no to this.

611
00:46:16,781 --> 00:46:21,047
"l have found you but it
seems I have lost myself!"

612
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,853
I want to tell you but
then how do I tell?

613
00:46:26,524 --> 00:46:30,790
I have found you but it
seems I have lost myself!

614
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:35,829
I want to tell you but
then how do I tell?

615
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,438
In any language that is known
I can't find the words alone..

616
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:45,168
To tell you, what you mean to me.

617
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:55,442
What if I say, a beauty like yours..
Can't be found in this cosmos!

618
00:46:55,553 --> 00:46:58,454
Your beauty and allure I may extol..

619
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:00,615
.. but all this is truly,
nothing at all!

620
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:05,185
I have found you but it
seems I have lost myself!

621
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:39,724
A sparkling demeanor flows
from your face..

622
00:47:40,064 --> 00:47:49,234
Your deep dark tresses, descend
in a dazzling maze!

623
00:47:49,874 --> 00:47:54,573
Your scarf that is flowing.. is
like a whiff of cloud blowing.

624
00:47:54,679 --> 00:48:02,108
Draped in your embrace.. are
both beauty and grace!

625
00:48:04,622 --> 00:48:09,252
If I say, charisma as yours..

626
00:48:09,627 --> 00:48:13,893
Can't be found, and
will never be around!

627
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:15,522
Your beauty and allure I may extol..

628
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:19,194
.. but all this is truly,
nothing at all!

629
00:48:19,304 --> 00:48:24,537
I have found you but it
seems I have lost myself!

630
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:43,957
You are very generous today.. then
here is the story from this day.

631
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:57,631
You are very generous today.. then
here is the story from this day

632
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,769
Now me and you cruise the same way,

633
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,246
I'll come with you,
where ever you say!

634
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:12,589
My beloved, if I say
to you, you are....

635
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:17,650
a fairy, or a riveting
nymph it's true!

636
00:49:17,762 --> 00:49:20,595
"Your beauty and
allure I may extol.."

637
00:49:20,698 --> 00:49:23,326
"..but all this is truly,
nothing at all!"

638
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,617
You know Om! I don't even remember..

639
00:49:47,725 --> 00:49:49,090
..when was the last
time I was so happy.

640
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:50,351
But not more than me!

641
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:55,996
Have you seen heaven? It is
right here, at my feet!

642
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:00,795
Hmmm.. so you never get sad?

643
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:02,763
No. Never.

644
00:50:03,274 --> 00:50:06,971
And if I do get sad,
I watch your film.

645
00:50:07,078 --> 00:50:10,138
Because happiness for
me means Shanti!

646
00:50:10,748 --> 00:50:15,117
The queen of hearts! Who is
loved by the entire world!

647
00:50:22,226 --> 00:50:24,990
Sometimes, the entire world's
love is not enough Om.

648
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:30,334
Sometimes getting love from that
one person is what counts.

649
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:36,401
You will get that love Shanti. All
you have to do is reach out for it.

650
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,872
You will get whatever you want.

651
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:43,736
You deserve all the happiness
in the world.

652
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:46,744
All you have to do is ask!

653
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,915
And then see, happiness
will follow you around!

654
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:57,284
Really?
- Really!

655
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:03,426
I will ask Om.

656
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:11,440
I will go for it. And
I will be happy.

657
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,314
And I will be the king of the world!

658
00:51:37,835 --> 00:51:38,859
Brother!

659
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:42,932
Why is this Junior Artiste getting
so excited. He's not the hero!

660
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,064
Cut it!

661
00:51:47,845 --> 00:51:49,813
Omi! Look at Salma!

662
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:52,315
She is playing my sister. Forget it!

663
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:53,747
Here, take this, I have to go.
Where are you going?

664
00:51:54,385 --> 00:51:56,353
Floor number 7, your sister-in-law
is shooting there.

665
00:52:00,124 --> 00:52:04,458
You Bastard! For God's
sake! Leave me!

666
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:07,827
If we leave you for the Gods,
then what are we going to do?

667
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:16,499
Fantastic! Very good!

668
00:52:46,904 --> 00:52:49,964
Forget it Om! These heroines
are heartless!

669
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:52,199
Om!

670
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:58,405
Wait here.

671
00:53:00,985 --> 00:53:02,213
Good afternoon ma'am. Please come.

672
00:53:04,188 --> 00:53:06,053
Shanti!
- Wait! Where are you going?

673
00:53:06,157 --> 00:53:07,419
Shantiji knows me!

674
00:53:07,525 --> 00:53:08,549
There are only star's
make up rooms here.

675
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:10,149
But I am also a star!
- Get lost from here.

676
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:13,055
Sir is here. Greetings, sir.

677
00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:32,439
I don't know, he was here right now.
Yes I have checked.

678
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:52,093
Look at this magazine Mukesh.

679
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,564
It says that you are getting
married to Harsh Mittal's daughter!

680
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,405
And getting Mittal Studios
as your wedding gift!

681
00:53:58,509 --> 00:53:59,533
God Dammit! It is all rubbish.

682
00:53:59,977 --> 00:54:02,411
You will hear Gossip like this
everyday, you know why?

683
00:54:02,513 --> 00:54:03,878
Because we are making the biggest,
the most expensive..

684
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:06,609
.. film ever made in lndia!

685
00:54:06,984 --> 00:54:09,885
Om Shanti Om! I am the Producer of
the film, you are the heroine..

686
00:54:09,987 --> 00:54:13,252
.. and Mittal is the man who
is making all this possible!

687
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:16,485
Shanti, Mittal has already invested
forty lakhs in this project.

688
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:19,461
So now stop behaving like
a child and go and shoot.

689
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:20,894
Delays in shooting schedule
means bad business.

690
00:54:20,998 --> 00:54:22,625
You always think about business.

691
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:25,360
That's why you are marrying
Harsh Mittal's daughter?

692
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:30,631
But how are you going to go through
with this wedding Mukesh?

693
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:33,106
Because you are already married!

694
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,575
To me!

695
00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:39,449
Shanti please! Be quiet.

696
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:43,509
What if some one hears us? Please
try to understand Shanti!

697
00:54:43,621 --> 00:54:44,645
Why don't you understand Mukesh?

698
00:54:46,023 --> 00:54:47,923
We have been married
for two years now..

699
00:54:48,025 --> 00:54:49,492
..and I can't be acknowledged
as your wife in public!

700
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:51,652
I don't care for anything
else Mukesh.

701
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:57,160
Not even Mittal's forty lakhs. All
want, is to be accepted as your wife.

702
00:54:57,268 --> 00:55:01,261
Really? Let me tell
you something Shanti.

703
00:55:01,372 --> 00:55:03,932
The day you will step out
of the house as my wife..

704
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,066
..'Om Shanti Om' will be finished!

705
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:12,107
Because no one will invest a penny
in a married heroine's film!

706
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:15,276
Everything will be doomed!

707
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:18,578
Not only your career,
but my future as well!

708
00:55:21,325 --> 00:55:24,590
You are my future Mukesh.
I am your wife.

709
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:27,688
You have to accept me in front
of the entire world.

710
00:55:28,332 --> 00:55:30,425
This is what will give me happiness.

711
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,265
And today I want to
make that choice.

712
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,168
Don't I deserve to be happy?!

713
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:42,973
What is this madness Shanti!?
You will do Om Shanti Om..

714
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,414
..and after it is finished,
we will tell everyone. OK?

715
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:50,110
But it will be too late by then.

716
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:53,454
What do you mean?

717
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,151
I mean that I am pregnant!

718
00:55:59,363 --> 00:56:01,228
Mukesh! You're going to be a father!

719
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:10,733
What? You are Pregnant?

720
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,546
This is.. fantastic!

721
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:18,741
Why didn't you tell this
to me earlier? - Really?

722
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:21,141
Of course!

723
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:26,779
"Neither do I live.."

724
00:56:26,957 --> 00:56:30,893
Nor do I die.

725
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:39,035
Tell me what to do, l
want to say good bye!

726
00:56:39,136 --> 00:56:43,368
Hearts were torn apart, before
they could be tied.

727
00:56:43,474 --> 00:56:46,102
Souls were separated
in a chasm so wide.

728
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:53,116
What has destiny in store who knows!

729
00:56:53,217 --> 00:56:57,051
These eyes well up with
tears yet again.

730
00:56:57,154 --> 00:57:00,419
Seeking a glimpse
of you but in vain!

731
00:57:00,524 --> 00:57:06,793
My beloved, this is destiny's game!

732
00:57:07,164 --> 00:57:14,434
How do I live each day? Without
you, it's a desolate bay!

733
00:57:14,638 --> 00:57:21,237
Neither do I live.. nor do I die.

734
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:36,158
A dream when destroyed..
makes your world a void.

735
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:43,826
Your love is not your's anymore..
your life is a barren core.

736
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:51,102
Why does this happen..

737
00:57:51,208 --> 00:58:00,310
..when this heart sobs, around
me the howling winds toss.

738
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:01,441
And my life seems totally lost.

739
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:08,822
A dream when destroyed makes
your world a void.

740
00:58:08,926 --> 00:58:18,858
"Your love is not your's anymore.
Your life is a barren core."

741
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:25,809
Shanti, you did the right thing.
You chose your happiness.

742
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:30,645
Don't think you have
broken my heart!

743
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:38,885
I am happy, because you are happy.

744
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:46,159
But you must tell Mr. Mehra, that
this I am letting him go..

745
00:58:46,263 --> 00:58:49,460
..only for you.

746
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:58,174
But if I ever happen to meet him
again in any other life time..

747
00:58:58,275 --> 00:59:01,676
..he better watch out! Mind it!!

748
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:08,708
"There is only solitude
all around me.."

749
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:12,482
Hey! Hope you are not
getting bored? Thanks!

750
00:59:12,589 --> 00:59:20,360
A dream when destroyed makes
your world a void.

751
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:30,738
Your love is not your's anymore.
Your life is a barren core.

752
01:00:04,842 --> 01:00:12,305
A dream when destroyed makes
your world a void.

753
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:21,984
Your love is not your's anymore.
Your life is a barren core.

754
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:33,827
"Solitude all around.."

755
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:46,272
Mukesh! Where are you taking me?
I Don't want to see any set!

756
01:00:46,383 --> 01:00:48,010
You don't even want to see
the venue for your wedding?

757
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:49,342
Really?

758
01:00:58,395 --> 01:00:59,794
It's beautiful Mukesh!

759
01:01:00,931 --> 01:01:04,833
Come! This is the magnificent
set Of 'Om Shanti Om'!

760
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:08,427
The biggest set of the biggest
film to be made in lndia.

761
01:01:08,872 --> 01:01:11,363
But there will be no shooting here.

762
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:14,903
Infact, we will dismantle
this set in a few days.

763
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:19,309
Because I was making this
film only for you..

764
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:23,853
..and no body can
replace you Shanti.

765
01:01:23,954 --> 01:01:26,320
But before breaking the set..

766
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:28,618
..we will have a huge party here.

767
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:30,052
Our wedding party!

768
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:33,453
Really Mukesh?

769
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,328
Of course! Of course my darling!
Our guests will arrive from here!

770
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:38,333
Walking on carpets of rose petals.

771
01:01:38,435 --> 01:01:40,335
And there! We will have
a forty piece orchestra..

772
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:41,927
..playing your favourite songs.

773
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:44,337
And right here will
be a huge fountain..

774
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:47,672
..with champagne flowing
in it, instead of water!

775
01:01:47,778 --> 01:01:51,339
And right here! Under this
magnificent chandelier..

776
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:54,349
.. we will exchange our wedding
vows and get married..

777
01:01:54,451 --> 01:01:56,578
..in front of everyone!

778
01:01:57,654 --> 01:01:59,087
I can't believe it Mukesh!

779
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,828
Mukesh I never thought you
could love me so much!

780
01:02:09,933 --> 01:02:12,094
I am sorry, I didn't trust you.

781
01:02:12,202 --> 01:02:17,799
No! I am sorry too, that
you trusted me Shanti!

782
01:02:18,475 --> 01:02:20,375
If you had not.. then I couldn't
have dreamt so big!

783
01:02:21,945 --> 01:02:23,105
But I did!

784
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:24,938
I dreamt of being the biggest
and most powerful..

785
01:02:25,048 --> 01:02:26,106
..producer in this industry.

786
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:29,384
And now, this dream is so big..

787
01:02:29,486 --> 01:02:32,978
..that I can break your trust
but I can't break this dream!

788
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,114
You're hurting me!

789
01:02:34,224 --> 01:02:38,456
No you are hurting me! Did you ever
think about it? Obviously not!

790
01:02:39,763 --> 01:02:42,061
Why did you do all this?

791
01:02:42,499 --> 01:02:45,127
Everything was going perfect!
We had Mittal's Money.

792
01:02:45,502 --> 01:02:48,403
You were going to be the
top heroine of lndia!

793
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:51,406
That I become a producer, but no..

794
01:02:51,508 --> 01:02:53,999
..you just wanted to be my
wife and ruin everything!

795
01:02:54,111 --> 01:02:56,636
But now you listen to me!
I can not marry you!

796
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:59,477
And neither can I return
Mittal's money!

797
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:03,145
Now there is only one way out!

798
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,544
Mukesh!

799
01:03:05,522 --> 01:03:07,922
Because of you this beautiful
set is going to be destroyed!

800
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:10,123
I am sorry!
- What a shame.

801
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:12,154
And I've already arranged
for it to burn down!

802
01:03:12,796 --> 01:03:16,493
But this set will not burn alone!

803
01:03:17,534 --> 01:03:20,503
The reason for its ruination
will be burnt with it!

804
01:03:22,906 --> 01:03:23,930
That's you!

805
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:31,174
I am sorry Shanti! But l
think it is fair enough!

806
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:39,920
No! Mukesh!

807
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:45,585
No!

808
01:03:51,568 --> 01:03:52,592
No!

809
01:03:53,103 --> 01:03:54,127
Mukesh!

810
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,968
Mukesh!

811
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,670
No! Mukesh please.

812
01:04:04,848 --> 01:04:05,872
Mukesh!

813
01:04:07,117 --> 01:04:08,709
Mukesh!

814
01:04:28,872 --> 01:04:30,066
Please open the door!

815
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,044
Please open.

816
01:04:37,881 --> 01:04:42,580
Please No, no Mukesh!

817
01:05:02,906 --> 01:05:03,930
Shanti!

818
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,042
Please let me out!

819
01:05:18,121 --> 01:05:19,713
Check that she doesn't come out!
- Ok sir.

820
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:28,822
Shanti!

821
01:07:19,309 --> 01:07:21,174
Shanti!

822
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:23,405
Om!

823
01:07:30,253 --> 01:07:35,418
Om!
- Shanti!

824
01:07:36,726 --> 01:07:37,818
Om!

825
01:07:49,806 --> 01:07:52,070
Om!

826
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,264
Shanti.

827
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:43,477
Congratulations Mr. Kapoor!
It's a boy!

828
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:03,623
What happened doctor?

829
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,628
Mr. Kapoor. I'm afraid,
it's bad news.

830
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:12,465
That man you brought in, we could
not save him. He is dead!

831
01:11:12,642 --> 01:11:17,511
Oh my god! Now what Nasser?

832
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:21,211
Don't worry sir! It was an accident.

833
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:22,918
The doctor said, the
guy was half dead..

834
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:24,646
..and injured even before
the accident.

835
01:11:24,754 --> 01:11:27,245
But Nasser, What about his family?

836
01:11:28,425 --> 01:11:31,588
Don't worry sir, I am your
secretary. I will handle everything.

837
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,960
Today it's superstar
Rajesh Kapoor's son..

838
01:12:06,062 --> 01:12:07,962
..Superstar Om Kapoor's birthday..

839
01:12:08,064 --> 01:12:10,692
..and all his fans are
here to wish him!

840
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:13,695
Happy birthday! Om!

841
01:12:14,337 --> 01:12:15,964
'l will have a luxurious bedroom,
just like the one..

842
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:17,164
..we see in Yash Chopra's movies..

843
01:12:17,273 --> 01:12:18,706
..with a round bed.'

844
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:22,971
'When I wake up in the morning,
before my feet..

845
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:26,981
..even touch the smooth
marble floor..'

846
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:29,517
..a servant will slip velvety
slippers under them.'

847
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:33,982
I will wear silk dressing gown like
the prince, when I'll move out..

848
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:38,720
'The second servant will be standing
there to serve fresh fruit juice.'

849
01:13:19,636 --> 01:13:24,300
Superstar Om Kapoor, better known
as OK, is in his balcony now!

850
01:13:24,407 --> 01:13:26,602
Love you guys, dudes.

851
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:29,644
Yeah, dad.
- Happy Birthday Son!

852
01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:32,779
Thank you dad!
- Love you!

853
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,310
Wow!

854
01:13:45,161 --> 01:13:47,789
Look, here he comes,
superstar Om Kapoor!

855
01:13:52,435 --> 01:13:53,800
He is only 4 hours late!

856
01:14:06,182 --> 01:14:07,206
Hello everyone!

857
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:08,341
Sir, Autograph

858
01:14:08,451 --> 01:14:10,612
Sir, Autograph Please

859
01:14:11,454 --> 01:14:12,819
He is so short in real life.

860
01:14:20,196 --> 01:14:23,529
Pappa it's 4'o clock! When
is the hero going to come?

861
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:25,832
I think I am getting an attack!

862
01:14:26,202 --> 01:14:28,261
C'mon c'mon everybody! Wakeup!

863
01:14:28,371 --> 01:14:29,497
Pappa he's here!

864
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:31,597
Wakeup! Wakeup! Ready, action!

865
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:32,834
Sir OK sir, ready sir!

866
01:14:32,942 --> 01:14:34,170
Director?!
- Yes sir!

867
01:14:34,277 --> 01:14:35,301
Tell me the scene!

868
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:37,106
Sir, as you see sir, this
is the climax scene..

869
01:14:37,213 --> 01:14:39,477
.. where heroine Natasha
is getting married to -

870
01:14:40,683 --> 01:14:41,843
Villian Ranbeer!

871
01:14:43,219 --> 01:14:44,652
Ya, that so rocks babe! Rocks?!

872
01:14:44,754 --> 01:14:46,847
Uh-huh! Nokia! Bluetooth!

873
01:14:47,223 --> 01:14:49,453
You keep talking and I'll keep
talking! Talk! Talk! Talk!

874
01:14:49,559 --> 01:14:51,823
Sir Raj, that's you, his
heart is breaking.

875
01:14:51,928 --> 01:14:55,329
He wants to tell the heroine that
'Natasha I really love you!'

876
01:14:55,431 --> 01:14:56,693
But he can's say it!

877
01:14:56,799 --> 01:14:57,857
Why? Am I mute?

878
01:14:58,234 --> 01:14:59,861
Correct Sir! You remember
your mother's death scene?

879
01:14:59,969 --> 01:15:01,266
Now there is a mother also?!

880
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,134
Sir, sir in mother's death scene,
you scream so loudly..

881
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:05,867
..that you loose your voice.

882
01:15:06,242 --> 01:15:09,143
Now for the last time, you
want to look at Natasha..

883
01:15:09,245 --> 01:15:11,713
..but sir, you can't even do that!
- Why? Why?

884
01:15:11,814 --> 01:15:12,872
Because you are blind as well sir!

885
01:15:13,249 --> 01:15:14,739
Oh I am blind also! I see.

886
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:16,216
No sir you don't!
- I don't!

887
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:18,719
Sir music starts in the background!
You leave foreground!

888
01:15:18,821 --> 01:15:20,220
Natasha turns to look at you and..

889
01:15:20,323 --> 01:15:23,724
One second. Natasha looks at
me, but Natasha is blind!

890
01:15:23,826 --> 01:15:25,885
No sir, you are Blind!
- But I was mute!

891
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:29,158
Sir you are mute and blind and when
Natasha calls out to you saying,

892
01:15:29,265 --> 01:15:31,426
.."Don't go Raj!" you
don't stop sir..

893
01:15:31,534 --> 01:15:32,899
..because in the film
you are deaf as well!

894
01:15:33,269 --> 01:15:35,760
What the fish! I don't know
what he is talking!

895
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:38,170
Yes sir, the wedding is happening
in the background..

896
01:15:38,274 --> 01:15:40,174
..and in the foreground it's just
you and your heart's voice!

897
01:15:40,276 --> 01:15:42,904
One second! I am angry now!
- Sir voice over..

898
01:15:43,012 --> 01:15:45,173
Voice over, one second..
Let me read the dialogue.

899
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:48,182
"Natasha I just want to say that..

900
01:15:48,284 --> 01:15:51,185
..I want to take you away
from this place..

901
01:15:51,287 --> 01:15:53,187
..but I am helpless, l
am on a wheelchair..

902
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:55,189
..and I have lost both my hands!

903
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:56,315
Cut Sir! Gone.

904
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:58,587
I have lost both my hands!
What is this?!

905
01:15:58,695 --> 01:16:02,927
In this film does the Hero have any
of his body parts in working order?

906
01:16:03,299 --> 01:16:05,665
Of course Sir, as you see,
his aching heart!

907
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:07,201
There won't be any heartache..

908
01:16:07,303 --> 01:16:08,327
..but the audience will definitely
have a headache!

909
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,201
This film will get critical
acclaim and award..

910
01:16:10,306 --> 01:16:12,206
..but let me tell you one thing..

911
01:16:12,308 --> 01:16:13,605
..this film is a flop! - Flop!

912
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:16,941
This film is gone! You are
dead old man! Dead! - No! No

913
01:16:17,313 --> 01:16:19,873
Unless, I think of
something as usual.

914
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:27,485
In this situation to express all
this pain, let's put an item song!

915
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:31,219
Item song. - Yes. A sad item,
may be a trance number..

916
01:16:31,327 --> 01:16:34,296
.. no a sad rock-n-roll,
done to death!

917
01:16:34,397 --> 01:16:36,228
I think it should be a painful..

918
01:16:36,332 --> 01:16:38,960
..disco

919
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:40,700
Disco!! But Sir..

920
01:16:40,803 --> 01:16:42,236
..in the script we have a handless,
footless, blind and mute actor..

921
01:16:42,338 --> 01:16:43,464
..how do we fit in the disco factor?

922
01:16:43,573 --> 01:16:45,370
Idiot! Dream sequence!!
OK can do anything.

923
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:47,375
Come on, give me a kiss.

924
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:51,580
And come here, your heroine is
quite sad. Your girlfriend?

925
01:16:51,681 --> 01:16:52,705
No Sir! My Pappa's.

926
01:16:52,815 --> 01:16:55,978
Pappa! I am sorry Pappa!
We'll have to change her.

927
01:16:56,085 --> 01:16:58,315
Get 5-10 hot girls instead.

928
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:01,254
I tell you only this song
can make your film a hit!

929
01:17:01,357 --> 01:17:04,588
Come on cheer up now and Pack up!

930
01:17:04,694 --> 01:17:07,390
Pack up?
- I've got an attack!!

931
01:17:26,382 --> 01:17:28,350
"Hey my beauty, My Precious one!"

932
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:30,577
What spell have you cast on me.

933
01:17:30,686 --> 01:17:32,881
My eyes can't sleep a wink

934
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:34,889
And my heart is ready to sink.

935
01:17:34,991 --> 01:17:37,016
Hey my beauty, My Precious one!

936
01:17:37,393 --> 01:17:39,418
What spell have you cast on me.

937
01:17:39,662 --> 01:17:41,892
My eyes can't sleep a wink

938
01:17:41,998 --> 01:17:43,898
And my heart is ready to sink.

939
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,366
About my poor heart, and
my wandering soul..

940
01:17:46,469 --> 01:17:49,302
Who should I go and tell.
All I can say is, well..

941
01:17:49,405 --> 01:17:51,373
..My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

942
01:17:51,474 --> 01:17:53,635
Pain of disco!

943
01:17:53,743 --> 01:17:55,802
My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

944
01:17:55,912 --> 01:17:58,506
Pain of disco!

945
01:17:58,614 --> 01:18:01,447
My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

946
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:02,677
Pain of disco!

947
01:18:02,785 --> 01:18:04,776
My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

948
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:07,048
Pain of disco!

949
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:38,580
There was a time when the flowers
were blooming all around.

950
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:43,086
There was a time, lost in
Love's whispering sounds.

951
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:52,030
There was a time when the flowers
were blooming all around.

952
01:18:52,135 --> 01:18:56,799
There was a time, lost in
Love's whispering sounds.

953
01:18:56,906 --> 01:19:00,933
What a time, when I lived in dreams!

954
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:05,571
What a time, when l
was drunk on youth!

955
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:07,672
But that time was short
and I got hurt..

956
01:19:07,783 --> 01:19:09,978
As the bubble of my love
and dreams just burst.

957
01:19:10,086 --> 01:19:12,384
Now I am a wanderer, and a lover
of disco, as I wander around..

958
01:19:12,488 --> 01:19:14,581
..London, Paris, New York,
L.A., San Francisco!

959
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,624
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

960
01:19:16,726 --> 01:19:19,024
Pain of disco!

961
01:19:19,128 --> 01:19:21,119
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

962
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:23,721
Pain of disco!

963
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:50,686
Hey my beauty, My Precious one!
What spell have you cast on me.

964
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:54,957
Every second was a wild wanting.

965
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:59,728
Every second was a daring fire.

966
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:08,170
Every second was a wild wanting.

967
01:20:08,544 --> 01:20:13,038
Every second was a daring fire.

968
01:20:13,149 --> 01:20:17,176
Blessings were showered
on me in abundance..

969
01:20:17,553 --> 01:20:21,785
And after this shower
I had no other desire.

970
01:20:21,891 --> 01:20:23,825
But once again I find myself alone..

971
01:20:23,926 --> 01:20:26,053
Oh my beloved!

972
01:20:26,162 --> 01:20:28,460
You broke my heart and you left.
to this day, I feel the rift.

973
01:20:28,564 --> 01:20:30,896
And the date you left
was the twenty sixth!

974
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,198
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

975
01:20:35,304 --> 01:20:37,602
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

976
01:20:39,575 --> 01:20:41,543
Hey my beauty, My Precious one!

977
01:20:41,644 --> 01:20:43,703
What spell have you cast on me.

978
01:20:43,813 --> 01:20:46,077
My eyes can't sleep a wink

979
01:20:46,182 --> 01:20:48,207
And my heart is ready to sink.

980
01:20:48,317 --> 01:20:50,080
About my poor heart, and
my wandering soul..

981
01:20:50,186 --> 01:20:53,212
Who should I go and tell.
All I can say is, well..

982
01:20:53,322 --> 01:20:57,759
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

983
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:02,092
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

984
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:06,760
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

985
01:21:06,869 --> 01:21:11,568
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

986
01:21:19,882 --> 01:21:24,251
Pain of disco!

987
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:29,247
Oh God! Cut it! Cut the shot.

988
01:21:31,894 --> 01:21:33,794
OK! OK!

989
01:21:36,165 --> 01:21:39,259
Who put the fire? Don't you know
he has a phobia of fire?!

990
01:21:39,368 --> 01:21:40,892
Phobia of fire? Pappa I didn't know!

991
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:42,595
You don't know!
- Anwar. Take me home.

992
01:21:42,705 --> 01:21:44,696
Take me home.
- Yes. Pack Up!

993
01:21:44,907 --> 01:21:47,273
Pack up. Father, pack up.
- Pack up!

994
01:21:48,644 --> 01:21:50,908
I am gone. Please everyone-I am ok!

995
01:21:53,115 --> 01:21:56,209
Om! My son! My son!

996
01:21:56,652 --> 01:21:58,142
Where do you keep disappearing
my son?

997
01:21:58,254 --> 01:22:01,087
You know how much I wait for you!

998
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,920
Anwar! Security!

999
01:22:04,026 --> 01:22:06,620
When are you coming
home dear? Tell me.

1000
01:22:06,929 --> 01:22:14,768
Listen to me Om! No leave
me! Let me go! Om!

1001
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:16,963
Who is this old woman? She
lands up in every studio!

1002
01:22:17,073 --> 01:22:18,904
I feel weird looking at her!

1003
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,738
Poor thing is mad! She
thinks you are her son!

1004
01:22:21,844 --> 01:22:24,142
Dude, I am a star! Every mother
in lndia thinks I am her son.

1005
01:22:24,246 --> 01:22:25,645
That's good! But this is not.

1006
01:22:25,748 --> 01:22:27,875
Make sure this doesn't happen
again. Hey! You will get hurt!

1007
01:22:27,983 --> 01:22:29,041
Come on! Move it man!

1008
01:22:40,196 --> 01:22:45,031
See Pappu, Om has gone and
left me again. Stop him!

1009
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:46,601
Why do you do this
to yourself mummy?

1010
01:22:46,702 --> 01:22:50,661
He is not our Om. He is Om Kapoor.
Only his face resembles our Om.

1011
01:22:50,773 --> 01:22:54,004
No Pappu, he is my son Om.

1012
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:57,807
Brother! He is my son Om!

1013
01:22:57,913 --> 01:23:01,007
Yeah sure! And Amitabh Bachchan
is my dad! Move now!

1014
01:23:04,253 --> 01:23:06,346
There are many reasons for
headaches and blackouts.

1015
01:23:07,156 --> 01:23:08,623
But he doesn't have any of them.

1016
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:11,625
Anwar! Cancel my dates
for that horny..

1017
01:23:11,727 --> 01:23:13,922
..producer and his
idiotic son's film!

1018
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:16,627
And give all my dates to the
superhero project!

1019
01:23:16,732 --> 01:23:17,892
Superheroes are in.

1020
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,627
I will give the dates but..

1021
01:23:19,735 --> 01:23:21,896
..how will those superhero guys
put up a set in one day?

1022
01:23:22,004 --> 01:23:23,631
Oh Shut up.If they
don't have a set..

1023
01:23:23,739 --> 01:23:26,003
..tell them to shoot
at real location.

1024
01:23:26,108 --> 01:23:27,700
Everything is ok with OK!

1025
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:32,373
And please shove this
up your nose, go on.

1026
01:23:32,481 --> 01:23:35,712
Shove this up your nose, go on.

1027
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:40,045
What did you say?

1028
01:23:40,156 --> 01:23:41,919
Come on, shove it up
your nose, go on.

1029
01:23:43,225 --> 01:23:46,388
Come on. No sneezing ok?

1030
01:23:47,029 --> 01:23:48,724
Now after this we will
try other holes.

1031
01:23:50,032 --> 01:23:52,728
I have been driving for hours now
-Where is this goddamn location?

1032
01:23:52,835 --> 01:23:54,200
Couldn't they put up
a set near the house?

1033
01:23:54,303 --> 01:23:55,668
They were building a
set near the house..

1034
01:23:55,771 --> 01:23:57,398
..but you said to shoot
at a real location.

1035
01:23:57,773 --> 01:23:59,400
At such short notice this is the
only place they could find..

1036
01:23:59,508 --> 01:24:00,907
What is so special about
this location?

1037
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:03,672
Except being in China
of course!? Ya, idiot!

1038
01:24:04,046 --> 01:24:06,412
This studio is completely burnt!

1039
01:24:06,782 --> 01:24:09,342
What?! Then why are
we shooting there?

1040
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:10,943
The director wanted an
old abandoned ruin..

1041
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:12,418
..and this place fits perfectly.

1042
01:24:12,521 --> 01:24:15,752
In fact this is one of the
most damned places ever!

1043
01:24:15,858 --> 01:24:17,416
What do you mean?

1044
01:24:17,793 --> 01:24:21,194
30 years ago there was
a big calamity here.

1045
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:24,425
A huge fire broke out
on one of the sets.

1046
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:33,230
The film got shelved and the studio
destroyed! Very unlucky place.

1047
01:24:33,342 --> 01:24:36,402
What a wonderful location! It's
unlucky. The set was burnt.

1048
01:24:36,512 --> 01:24:38,309
Studio was ruined, even
the film got scrapped!

1049
01:24:38,814 --> 01:24:42,113
Well done Anwar! Idiot!

1050
01:25:09,845 --> 01:25:12,905
Anwar have we come here before?

1051
01:25:13,015 --> 01:25:15,950
Of course not, Nobody comes here!

1052
01:25:16,285 --> 01:25:18,947
We will be the first ones
to shoot here in 30 years!

1053
01:25:23,859 --> 01:25:25,952
Your credit for two months
is still pending!

1054
01:25:30,866 --> 01:25:33,357
Style, hairstyle, face..

1055
01:25:36,372 --> 01:25:38,772
How will you become a
star with this name?

1056
01:25:43,345 --> 01:25:47,281
Where are you going? There are only
star's make up rooms inside!

1057
01:25:52,888 --> 01:25:53,912
Welcome sir!

1058
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:57,515
Dude what a location! Check
it out! Wild place!

1059
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:01,861
Please let me escort you
to the make up rooms..

1060
01:26:01,964 --> 01:26:02,988
where are the make up rooms?

1061
01:26:03,299 --> 01:26:04,527
This building, second floor.

1062
01:26:05,367 --> 01:26:07,961
Right! How did you know?

1063
01:26:08,904 --> 01:26:10,371
Let's go take a look at
the rooms! Come on!

1064
01:26:10,472 --> 01:26:12,531
Take the shot, man.
Come on. Let's go.

1065
01:26:45,207 --> 01:26:46,265
Freaky dude.

1066
01:26:47,476 --> 01:26:50,570
Sir, the shot isn't here.
It is downstairs.

1067
01:26:50,946 --> 01:26:52,846
Yes, damn!

1068
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:06,325
God! I am so hot! Babes!
What is this costume?

1069
01:27:06,428 --> 01:27:09,920
Actors get tortured. I am a star.
And this harness is going up..

1070
01:27:10,032 --> 01:27:11,056
Hey! Don't touch my hair please!

1071
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:12,861
And why am I made to wear my
underwear over the costume..

1072
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:14,526
..what is this?

1073
01:27:14,637 --> 01:27:17,333
Dude! You are a superhero!
Savior of love!

1074
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:18,599
Love
- man!!

1075
01:27:18,707 --> 01:27:20,504
Oh shut up! I feel more
like a moron man!

1076
01:27:20,609 --> 01:27:21,871
Come on OK. Spiderman..

1077
01:27:21,977 --> 01:27:23,205
..Superman-they also wear
their underwear like this..

1078
01:27:23,312 --> 01:27:24,336
Really? Give me a kiss then.

1079
01:27:25,247 --> 01:27:26,612
Anyways you are playing
a double role.

1080
01:27:26,715 --> 01:27:27,875
In the part where you are a
villager..

1081
01:27:27,983 --> 01:27:29,007
..you wear your underwear inside.

1082
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:30,210
Infact the way you wear
your underwear..

1083
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:32,253
..tells us who the
real superhero is!

1084
01:27:32,354 --> 01:27:33,616
Oh yeah! That's a good idea.

1085
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:37,615
Whatever, this is my last shot, and
you know I don't give retakes!

1086
01:27:37,726 --> 01:27:41,253
That's right! Because when Ok gives
a take- it is an Ok take!!

1087
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:43,625
Roll sound!
- Speed!

1088
01:27:43,932 --> 01:27:45,627
Actionsssss

1089
01:27:47,269 --> 01:27:51,638
Help!
- "Love- man" to the rescue!

1090
01:27:53,474 --> 01:27:55,635
Help!

1091
01:28:18,565 --> 01:28:20,624
"Love- man"! - To the rescue!

1092
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:24,094
Come, fly with me.

1093
01:28:30,043 --> 01:28:32,637
Baby did you enjoy? - Yes!

1094
01:28:32,746 --> 01:28:34,077
Come on! Let's dance!

1095
01:28:37,451 --> 01:28:38,941
"Oh my God.."

1096
01:28:42,055 --> 01:28:43,545
"Oh my God.."

1097
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:47,691
"Oh my God.."

1098
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:52,625
Mongesh it's you? Where is Love?
- Man?

1099
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:55,091
"Oh my God.."

1100
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:57,696
What a fish.

1101
01:29:00,207 --> 01:29:01,697
Why didn't they check
with the weather guy?

1102
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:04,405
Come on, come on, move it.

1103
01:29:08,081 --> 01:29:09,309
I don't believe this.

1104
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:15,987
Hey Hero! Get some coffee!

1105
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:47,020
Hello. Who is there dude?

1106
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:54,417
Hello. Anyone here?

1107
01:31:34,494 --> 01:31:39,591
Sir! What are you doing here?

1108
01:32:15,535 --> 01:32:16,934
Who will win the best
actor award today?

1109
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:19,904
My friend, Om Kapoor should win!

1110
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:21,398
Am I right, uncle?

1111
01:32:21,508 --> 01:32:23,738
I think Om Kapoor is just.. 'Wow!'

1112
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:25,979
It's Stupid! I am going
to win! Of course.

1113
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:30,012
Ok!!

1114
01:32:30,784 --> 01:32:34,345
Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen
and welcome to the filmfare awards!

1115
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:37,289
I have come to fight for the
rights of slum dwellers!

1116
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:39,518
And protest against
this award function!

1117
01:32:39,626 --> 01:32:43,392
Who is Om? Chunkey Pandey will win!

1118
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:47,367
OK!
- What OK? Only FK!

1119
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:49,969
OK!

1120
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:52,300
Just like a jeweler knows the true
worth of a diamond, likewise..

1121
01:32:52,406 --> 01:32:54,931
..Only a 'Johar' knows the
true worth of a hero!

1122
01:32:55,776 --> 01:32:58,370
Of course. My son will
get it, Hrithik Roshan.

1123
01:32:58,945 --> 01:33:01,812
I think, it will have to be me.

1124
01:33:02,416 --> 01:33:05,681
Om and me.. you don't say
these things on camera..

1125
01:33:05,786 --> 01:33:07,378
.. we are just good friends.

1126
01:33:07,487 --> 01:33:11,514
Om Kapoor and me, we are
just good friends!

1127
01:33:11,658 --> 01:33:14,491
Om Kapoor and me are
just good friends.

1128
01:33:14,594 --> 01:33:17,392
Om Kapoor and me, we are
just good friends.

1129
01:33:17,564 --> 01:33:19,395
I think it should go to Om Kapoor.

1130
01:33:19,933 --> 01:33:20,957
Om Kapoor? Who?

1131
01:33:21,435 --> 01:33:23,426
OK!

1132
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:26,731
Let's take a look at this year's
nominees for the best actor award!

1133
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:29,873
The best actor nominees..

1134
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:34,004
Abhishek Bachchan in Dhoom 5.

1135
01:33:34,981 --> 01:33:37,074
This time he's not a cop!

1136
01:33:41,088 --> 01:33:43,750
This time he's not with the babes!

1137
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:48,420
This time he's not going to lose!

1138
01:33:48,829 --> 01:33:53,027
Because this time he's
not in the film!

1139
01:33:53,667 --> 01:33:54,725
What?!

1140
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:00,701
Come on, Abhishek.

1141
01:34:00,807 --> 01:34:03,776
Come on. Come on. - Abhishek.

1142
01:34:04,478 --> 01:34:08,608
Om Kapoor for 'Phir
Bhi Dil Hai NRl'!

1143
01:34:18,058 --> 01:34:20,891
Rahul's my name, sounds familiar!

1144
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:38,467
Om Kapoor once more in
'Main Bhi Hoon Na'!

1145
01:34:48,522 --> 01:34:51,548
Rahul's my name, sounds familiar!

1146
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,860
Come on, Akki.

1147
01:35:04,538 --> 01:35:09,066
Akshay Kumar in 'Khiladi Returns'!

1148
01:35:59,759 --> 01:36:01,226
Tough Fight! Right!

1149
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:03,495
Anyway to give away the best
actor award we have..

1150
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:06,794
..the living legends, Mr. Subhash
Ghai and Rishi Kapoor!

1151
01:36:10,637 --> 01:36:12,605
Good evening Ladies and Gentleman.

1152
01:36:12,706 --> 01:36:14,571
Good evening Ladies and Gentleman.

1153
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:18,504
Good actor brings out somebody's
else's soul..

1154
01:36:18,612 --> 01:36:20,603
..into his soul and projects..

1155
01:36:20,714 --> 01:36:25,879
..the right kind of emotion,
and the good actor is..

1156
01:36:29,923 --> 01:36:30,947
Yeah.

1157
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:38,097
And the winner is..

1158
01:36:38,665 --> 01:36:41,896
..Om Kapoor!

1159
01:36:45,071 --> 01:36:46,766
Yeah.

1160
01:36:46,873 --> 01:36:48,067
I'm the man!

1161
01:36:53,847 --> 01:36:57,647
Why are you laughing?
You're in his team?!

1162
01:36:59,286 --> 01:37:02,153
This is my award! This is cheating!
This is fraud.

1163
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:03,714
This award is a fraud.

1164
01:37:10,864 --> 01:37:14,095
You think I will get an award?
- Of course!

1165
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:17,828
But if the award jury was here, they
would have given the award to you!

1166
01:37:17,971 --> 01:37:20,565
Really
- Yes. First accept this..

1167
01:37:20,674 --> 01:37:24,201
..'bottle award' from my side!
- Really - Yes.

1168
01:37:48,702 --> 01:37:51,170
Love you!

1169
01:37:52,038 --> 01:37:53,699
I just want to say..

1170
01:37:54,174 --> 01:37:59,669
I have wanted you so much..

1171
01:38:01,147 --> 01:38:05,607
I have wanted you so much
and so badly it's true..

1172
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:12,249
..that the entire universe has
conspired for me to get you.

1173
01:38:13,793 --> 01:38:17,627
They say, if you want something
with all your heart..

1174
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:21,292
..then the entire universe
will help you get it!

1175
01:38:21,768 --> 01:38:22,792
Today, you all have..

1176
01:38:22,902 --> 01:38:26,235
Today, you all have given me
everything that I wanted.

1177
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:29,870
Thank you very much.

1178
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:33,645
Thank you! I am thankful
to you all that..

1179
01:38:33,747 --> 01:38:36,773
..you've turned my dreams
into reality.

1180
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:39,714
I feel like the king of the world!

1181
01:38:42,022 --> 01:38:46,652
Thank you for making
me believe that..

1182
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:51,663
..just like in our films,
in life too..

1183
01:38:51,765 --> 01:38:57,795
.. finally in the end, everything
is ok, Happy Endings!

1184
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:05,034
And if it is not happy..

1185
01:39:07,347 --> 01:39:09,247
..then it's not 'the
end' my friends..

1186
01:39:11,317 --> 01:39:14,809
The film is not over yet!

1187
01:39:28,835 --> 01:39:29,859
OM!

1188
01:39:33,873 --> 01:39:36,706
Om! Come on! This party is for you!

1189
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:37,834
..and people want to meet you.

1190
01:39:40,847 --> 01:39:42,906
Are you ok son?

1191
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:45,808
I don't know dad!

1192
01:39:47,287 --> 01:39:49,778
I was thinking
- what if I was not your son?

1193
01:39:49,889 --> 01:39:53,825
If I was not Om Kapoor
- only some random guy called Om..

1194
01:39:53,927 --> 01:39:58,864
..then I wouldn't get all
this stardom, fame..

1195
01:39:59,299 --> 01:40:03,793
..and instead of this award l
may be holding this, who knows!

1196
01:40:03,903 --> 01:40:05,302
Lying drunk some where!

1197
01:40:05,405 --> 01:40:11,935
I want to promise you today Dad..
that I will really work hard..

1198
01:40:13,012 --> 01:40:16,209
.. and I will try to
be a better actor.

1199
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:20,843
If not that, I will try
and be a better son.

1200
01:40:22,288 --> 01:40:23,312
Yeah.

1201
01:40:23,423 --> 01:40:27,052
I am so proud of you my son!

1202
01:40:30,864 --> 01:40:34,994
Come on, this party and all these
special guests are here for you!

1203
01:40:35,502 --> 01:40:38,835
And get ready for a surprise!

1204
01:40:38,938 --> 01:40:43,875
Ladies and Gentlemen, this one is
for my dear friend and hero..

1205
01:40:44,511 --> 01:40:48,174
.. Om Kapoor! OK! We love you!

1206
01:41:06,499 --> 01:41:15,373
Tonight is a mystical night we
hail, bit by bit it weaves a tale.

1207
01:41:15,542 --> 01:41:24,348
Tonight is a mystical night we
hail, bit by bit it weaves a tale.

1208
01:41:24,484 --> 01:41:28,887
This beautiful sight
takes my breath away!

1209
01:41:28,988 --> 01:41:32,424
Stars of heaven are on earth today!

1210
01:41:32,559 --> 01:41:34,891
There is no sense of time
no guiding light.

1211
01:41:34,994 --> 01:41:36,894
It's just us and the crazy night!

1212
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:41,330
A crazy night! A crazy night!

1213
01:41:41,467 --> 01:41:43,492
There is no offense today, and
no one to lead the way..

1214
01:41:43,603 --> 01:41:45,901
On whom should this blame we lay?

1215
01:41:46,005 --> 01:41:50,908
A crazy night! A crazy night!

1216
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:59,247
All the hot girls put your hands
up and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1217
01:41:59,953 --> 01:42:08,361
All cool boys c'mon make some
noise and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1218
01:44:08,081 --> 01:44:12,074
The night is mythical,
it's bliss enticing..

1219
01:44:12,285 --> 01:44:16,381
It's casting a spell all around,
which ensnares and bounds!

1220
01:44:16,723 --> 01:44:21,057
The night is mythical,
it's bliss enticing..

1221
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:25,256
It's casting a spell all around,
which ensnares and bounds!

1222
01:44:25,365 --> 01:44:32,066
"Silky tresses of yours have let
down. - Breaths are fragrant.."

1223
01:44:32,171 --> 01:44:33,502
"These are the gestures.."

1224
01:44:33,606 --> 01:44:35,665
There is no sense of time
no guiding light!

1225
01:44:36,109 --> 01:44:38,100
It's just us and the crazy night!

1226
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:42,375
A crazy night! A crazy night!

1227
01:44:42,548 --> 01:44:44,607
There is no offense today, and
no one to lead the way..

1228
01:44:44,717 --> 01:44:46,685
On whom should this blame we lay?

1229
01:44:46,786 --> 01:44:51,689
A crazy night! A crazy night!

1230
01:44:52,125 --> 01:45:00,590
All the hot girls put your hands
up and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1231
01:45:00,767 --> 01:45:09,539

noise and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1234
01:47:27,847 --> 01:47:36,448
There is peace and calm around,
yet this heart is fervor bound!

1235
01:47:36,956 --> 01:47:45,330
There is peace and calm around,
yet this heart is fervor bound!

1236
01:47:45,431 --> 01:47:52,200
Eyes will knit such furtive
dreams! To her and him..

1237
01:47:52,305 --> 01:47:53,704
..it'll tell all and scream!

1238
01:47:53,806 --> 01:47:55,797
There is no sense of time
no guiding light.

1239
01:47:55,908 --> 01:47:58,274
It's just us and the crazy night!

1240
01:47:58,377 --> 01:48:02,507
A crazy night! A crazy night!

1241
01:48:02,682 --> 01:48:04,673
There is no offense today, and
no one to lead the way..

1242
01:48:04,784 --> 01:48:06,843
On whom should this blame we lay?

1243
01:48:06,953 --> 01:48:11,890
A crazy night! A crazy night!

1244
01:48:12,325 --> 01:48:20,630
All the hot girls put your hands
up and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1245
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:29,669
All cool boys c'mon make some
noise and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1246
01:48:29,976 --> 01:48:38,509
All the hot girls put your hands
up and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1247
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:47,556
All cool boys c'mon make some
noise and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1248
01:48:47,827 --> 01:48:56,326
All the hot girls put your hands
up and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1249
01:48:56,535 --> 01:49:05,409
All cool boys c'mon make some
noise and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1250
01:49:05,611 --> 01:49:13,985
All the hot girls put your hands
up and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1251
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:23,351
All cool boys c'mon make some
noise and say 'Om Shanti Om'!

1252
01:50:09,575 --> 01:50:12,567
Om, meet my friend Mukesh Mehra!

1253
01:50:13,112 --> 01:50:14,977
One of the top producer
of our times!

1254
01:50:15,715 --> 01:50:18,411
He was in Hollywood for
the last 25 years.

1255
01:50:18,517 --> 01:50:22,078
He wants to come back and make
a very big film with you.

1256
01:50:22,455 --> 01:50:23,513
It's great Mukesh!

1257
01:50:24,523 --> 01:50:27,424
Call me Mike! Everyone
in Hollywood does.

1258
01:50:35,134 --> 01:50:37,034
Om shake hands! Come on!

1259
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:49,440
Fantastic! Let's celebrate Mike!

1260
01:50:49,682 --> 01:50:50,842
It's wonderful that you could come.

1261
01:51:09,769 --> 01:51:10,827
Om.

1262
01:51:17,676 --> 01:51:19,007
You came here, dear.

1263
01:51:26,886 --> 01:51:27,910
It is mom.

1264
01:51:28,721 --> 01:51:33,090
What took you so long?
I was so scared!

1265
01:51:34,593 --> 01:51:35,787
My melodramatic mom!

1266
01:51:37,797 --> 01:51:39,526
What is there to get scared?

1267
01:51:43,536 --> 01:51:48,098
You know however late it may get,
I will always come back home..

1268
01:51:51,644 --> 01:51:52,941
..to you! - Really?

1269
01:51:55,548 --> 01:51:58,574
Then why did you leave
me and go? Tell me?

1270
01:51:59,051 --> 01:52:00,518
Please forgive me today mother.

1271
01:52:04,557 --> 01:52:08,550
I couldn't recognize you.

1272
01:52:12,565 --> 01:52:13,691
But you recognized me!

1273
01:52:14,834 --> 01:52:18,531
It's so true! Mother's
love is exceptional!

1274
01:52:21,674 --> 01:52:29,843
Oh! My Prince! My Prince!

1275
01:52:35,054 --> 01:52:36,112
Omi!

1276
01:52:50,102 --> 01:52:53,765
Hey! You have grown old!

1277
01:52:56,675 --> 01:53:00,907
But you are still the same..

1278
01:53:02,147 --> 01:53:03,614
..and now you have become
a star as well!

1279
01:53:04,717 --> 01:53:09,745
You only told me to change
my name to a 'Kapoor'!

1280
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:17,092
See Pappu! Didn't I tell you that my
son will definitely become a hero?!

1281
01:53:19,698 --> 01:53:21,893
Now you will not leave me and go?

1282
01:53:22,635 --> 01:53:26,969
No, I will not go
anywhere this time.

1283
01:53:27,072 --> 01:53:29,700
And this time all will be just fine.

1284
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:32,134
Really?

1285
01:53:33,646 --> 01:53:34,704
Really!

1286
01:53:38,651 --> 01:53:40,676
No one will believe your story.

1287
01:53:42,087 --> 01:53:45,147
Sometimes truth is stranger
than fiction.

1288
01:53:45,991 --> 01:53:47,754
Om, we won't be able
to prove anything.

1289
01:53:48,661 --> 01:53:50,219
And that bastard will
get away again!

1290
01:53:50,329 --> 01:53:52,160
Shanti's body was not even found!

1291
01:53:53,666 --> 01:53:55,293
And Om, you also disappeared!

1292
01:53:56,936 --> 01:53:58,096
Without any proof..

1293
01:53:58,203 --> 01:54:00,569
If you want something
with all your heart..

1294
01:54:00,673 --> 01:54:04,234
..then the entire universe
conspires for you to get it!

1295
01:54:07,813 --> 01:54:09,212
This is what we believed in Pappu!

1296
01:54:10,683 --> 01:54:14,244
Mukesh Mehra thinks he has
gotten away with murder!

1297
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,711
No evidence! No witness!

1298
01:54:17,022 --> 01:54:22,654
But look at this divine
intervention..

1299
01:54:24,163 --> 01:54:25,824
..which made me go back
to the same studio..

1300
01:54:25,931 --> 01:54:28,593
.. made me recognize myself
made me meet mother, you..

1301
01:54:28,701 --> 01:54:31,966
..all this is not just
a coincidence Pappu! No.

1302
01:54:33,739 --> 01:54:37,004
This story is being written
by somebody up there!

1303
01:54:37,977 --> 01:54:41,913
But this time the climax of the
story will be decided by us.

1304
01:54:43,349 --> 01:54:50,050
I can't forget Shanti's
pitiful screams!

1305
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:54,682
I couldn't save her that time..

1306
01:54:54,793 --> 01:54:57,956
.. I was helpless, I was a nobody..

1307
01:54:58,063 --> 01:54:59,724
..but this time, the
tables have turned.

1308
01:54:59,832 --> 01:55:02,699
This time Mukesh Mehra will
pay for all his sins!

1309
01:55:03,769 --> 01:55:07,705
This time Shanti will
get justice Pappu.

1310
01:55:07,806 --> 01:55:09,967
This time everything
will be all right.

1311
01:55:10,075 --> 01:55:17,709
Because the film is not
over yet, my friend!

1312
01:55:20,753 --> 01:55:22,744
You want to start 'Om
Shanti Om' again?

1313
01:55:22,855 --> 01:55:24,720
That's ridiculous!
You must be joking!

1314
01:55:24,823 --> 01:55:25,847
I'm serious Mukesh.

1315
01:55:26,759 --> 01:55:28,659
You know I get 3 to 4 scripts
offered everyday..

1316
01:55:28,761 --> 01:55:30,160
..but I reject all of them!

1317
01:55:30,262 --> 01:55:32,992
But 'Om Shanti Om'!

1318
01:55:33,766 --> 01:55:34,824
That's cool!

1319
01:55:34,933 --> 01:55:37,800
It has emotion, drama,
romance, action.

1320
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:39,835
I'm sure it's going to be
a blockbuster Mukesh!

1321
01:55:40,039 --> 01:55:42,132
Re-incarnation, rebirth..

1322
01:55:42,775 --> 01:55:46,176
..who's going to believe all this,
in this day and age?

1323
01:55:46,812 --> 01:55:48,803
How does it matter if anyone
else believes in it or not?

1324
01:55:49,348 --> 01:55:51,111
As long as you believe in it..

1325
01:55:53,786 --> 01:55:57,745
.. as a maker, you have to believe
in the script Mukesh.

1326
01:55:58,223 --> 01:56:01,021
Call me Mike. Everyone
in Hollywood does!

1327
01:56:01,794 --> 01:56:04,319
Mike! Mukesh becomes Mike..
that's funny Mike!

1328
01:56:04,797 --> 01:56:05,821
Thanks to Mike.

1329
01:56:05,931 --> 01:56:07,796
That film didn't even have a climax!

1330
01:56:08,801 --> 01:56:11,770
I mean that project was jinxed.
Bloody doomed!

1331
01:56:12,004 --> 01:56:15,701
Jinxed? The project was jinxed
for that lnsurance Company..

1332
01:56:15,808 --> 01:56:18,936
.. who paid you four times the
actual price of your set!

1333
01:56:19,078 --> 01:56:21,706
Then you got married to that
Harsh Mittal's daughter..

1334
01:56:21,814 --> 01:56:25,147
.. and got a big studio
as your wedding gift!

1335
01:56:25,851 --> 01:56:29,719
Then you went to Hollywood,
earned millions of dollars..

1336
01:56:29,822 --> 01:56:33,724
..you didn't even take a single
shot and 'Om Shanti Om'..

1337
01:56:33,826 --> 01:56:36,852
.. became the biggest film of your
career! So where is the jinx?

1338
01:56:39,264 --> 01:56:43,132
You know a lot about me Om!

1339
01:56:43,969 --> 01:56:47,302
Call me OK! Everyone
in Bollywood does!

1340
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,809
Alright.
- Got you, dude. - OK!

1341
01:56:50,943 --> 01:56:52,740
And I Also know that a big accident
happened on your set..

1342
01:56:52,845 --> 01:56:55,370
.. and your heroine,
what was her name?

1343
01:56:55,948 --> 01:56:56,972
Shanti..

1344
01:56:57,082 --> 01:56:59,073
Ya Shanti, what..

1345
01:56:59,852 --> 01:57:00,876
..Shantipriya

1346
01:57:00,986 --> 01:57:04,251
Shantipriya. What happened to her?

1347
01:57:06,859 --> 01:57:09,885
She disappeared!

1348
01:57:10,028 --> 01:57:16,456
Oh. I tried to find her
but she was just gone!

1349
01:57:16,869 --> 01:57:23,832
Oh gone-if you search hard enough,
you can find God himself!

1350
01:57:25,144 --> 01:57:29,171
I don't think you tried too much!

1351
01:57:33,418 --> 01:57:38,856
I Like you man. It's a joke. Chill
dude. Hey.. Take it away!

1352
01:57:38,957 --> 01:57:39,981
Hey, take it away.

1353
01:57:42,161 --> 01:57:43,185
Are you Ok? Ok!

1354
01:57:43,295 --> 01:57:46,128
I am not Ok.

1355
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,992
I am scared of fire!

1356
01:57:52,237 --> 01:57:53,261
Really?

1357
01:57:53,472 --> 01:57:55,872
I am scared of fire.
I don't know why.

1358
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:01,805
And.. Seriously speaking if you
want to make any film with me..

1359
01:58:01,914 --> 01:58:07,318
.. then it has to be 'Om Shanti
Om', otherwise I am not interested.

1360
01:58:11,056 --> 01:58:12,523
You know you are very stubborn OK.

1361
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:14,149
I know that.

1362
01:58:15,928 --> 01:58:16,952
I like that.

1363
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:20,057
I am going to America for a month.

1364
01:58:20,199 --> 01:58:23,896
If you find a heroine till then..

1365
01:58:25,304 --> 01:58:26,328
..we'll start the shoot!

1366
01:58:30,943 --> 01:58:31,967
You got it.

1367
01:58:33,078 --> 01:58:36,912
You got it. And don't worry
about the climax Mike.

1368
01:58:38,183 --> 01:58:42,415
This time I will write the end of
this story myself! Come on, Cheers.

1369
01:58:42,955 --> 01:58:43,979
To a new beginning!

1370
01:58:44,156 --> 01:58:46,249
To a new end, Mike!

1371
01:58:58,036 --> 01:59:00,470
'Pinch of this vermillion'..
shot 1, take 5!

1372
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:04,976
Worth of a pinch of this vermillion
how would you know Ramesh!?

1373
01:59:05,177 --> 01:59:07,441
Worth of a pinch of
this vermillion..

1374
01:59:07,646 --> 01:59:09,204
.. how would you know Ramesh!?

1375
01:59:09,314 --> 01:59:11,942
Worth of a pinch of
this vermillion..

1376
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:13,381
.. how would you know Ramesh!?

1377
01:59:14,453 --> 01:59:15,943
How would you know Yogesh..

1378
01:59:16,088 --> 01:59:20,024
Not Yogesh! Ramesh! Say!
Worth of a pinch..

1379
01:59:20,392 --> 01:59:22,952
What is this pinch of
this vermillion..

1380
01:59:24,997 --> 01:59:26,191
Say it with love!

1381
01:59:26,298 --> 01:59:27,890
With love? Worth of a pinch
of this vermillion..

1382
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,230
..how would you know Ramesh!?

1383
01:59:30,335 --> 01:59:32,496
Gift from god..

1384
01:59:32,638 --> 01:59:34,469
Gift from what?

1385
01:59:34,606 --> 01:59:37,973
I'll kill myself. - You'll die!
- What are you doing?

1386
01:59:38,076 --> 01:59:40,306
It's a crown of pride..

1387
01:59:40,679 --> 01:59:46,345
..pinch of this vermillion

1388
01:59:47,486 --> 01:59:48,510
And what?

1389
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:52,420
It's every woman's dream,
it's ruby sheen!

1390
01:59:54,026 --> 01:59:55,050
Say!

1391
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:56,184
A handful vermillion!

1392
01:59:56,295 --> 02:00:00,163
It's every woman's dream,
it's ruby sheen!

1393
02:00:06,238 --> 02:00:08,001
Aunty, who let you in?

1394
02:00:08,106 --> 02:00:11,234
Who did you call Aunty?
Your mother?!

1395
02:00:12,044 --> 02:00:13,102
Bye ok!

1396
02:00:13,211 --> 02:00:14,542
Later babes! Thanks mom!

1397
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:20,311
If it was 15-20 years earlier, then
I could have played Shanti's role!

1398
02:00:21,453 --> 02:00:24,013
We've packed up Om.. and
this was the last batch.

1399
02:00:24,489 --> 02:00:25,513
Ya whatever!

1400
02:00:25,691 --> 02:00:29,650
But none of them even remotely
resemble Shanti, you know that dude!

1401
02:00:30,062 --> 02:00:32,030
We'll find her Omi, we will
definitely find someone.

1402
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:33,290
We don't have much time Pappu!

1403
02:00:34,066 --> 02:00:35,556
Mukesh Mehra will be
back in a few days!

1404
02:00:35,701 --> 02:00:40,638
How will we find her?
Where will we find her?

1405
02:00:41,073 --> 02:00:42,404
Excuse me!
- What?!

1406
02:00:43,408 --> 02:00:45,069
Is Om Kapoor here?

1407
02:00:45,477 --> 02:00:47,035
No Om Kapoor is not here!

1408
02:00:47,412 --> 02:00:50,040
Go! We have already packed up!
Come for auditions tomorrow!

1409
02:00:50,449 --> 02:00:55,079
Tomorrow? But the watchman said
auditions are still going on..

1410
02:00:55,187 --> 02:00:56,245
..and Om Kapoor is inside.

1411
02:00:57,089 --> 02:01:00,354
See, I have come to give an
audition all the way from Bangalore..

1412
02:01:00,659 --> 02:01:02,126
.. please give me a chance!

1413
02:01:03,095 --> 02:01:05,154
By the way, I am Sandy,
as in Sandhya.

1414
02:01:05,731 --> 02:01:10,498
I just love OK, and
I'm his biggest fan.

1415
02:01:11,336 --> 02:01:14,066
Actually audition is just
an excuse to meet Ok.

1416
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:15,263
I only want his..

1417
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,704
Oh Fish! She's fallen! Pappu
switch on the lights please!

1418
02:01:21,113 --> 02:01:22,137
What?

1419
02:01:26,284 --> 02:01:34,089
Grace and beauty walk with you.
Oh what a lovely sight!

1420
02:01:34,226 --> 02:01:42,133
And the moon bows down to you,
to beg for some ivory light.

1421
02:01:42,334 --> 02:01:50,264
Your gaze has seared my heart
so bad, hope it is not in vain.

1422
02:01:50,675 --> 02:01:59,515
I want to drown in your eyes
forever never to surface again!

1423
02:02:00,152 --> 02:02:06,216
In your eyes there is this magic
I see, magic of a moonlit night.

1424
02:02:08,393 --> 02:02:14,127
In your eyes there is this magic
I see, magic of a moonlit night.

1425
02:02:14,499 --> 02:02:19,061
Your breath blows like
a wind around me..

1426
02:02:19,171 --> 02:02:23,130
..carrying my heart away
like a weightless kite.

1427
02:03:23,401 --> 02:03:25,198
Good morning everybody!

1428
02:03:25,337 --> 02:03:26,565
Dad the hero is here!

1429
02:03:26,872 --> 02:03:29,204
Already! But it is
only 11 'o clock!!

1430
02:03:29,307 --> 02:03:32,208
'Crippled Love'! Shot 3! Take 1!
- Action!

1431
02:03:37,516 --> 02:03:38,778
Cut it! Superb!

1432
02:03:40,652 --> 02:03:43,212
One minute director sir.
One more for me!

1433
02:03:43,321 --> 02:03:46,347
I can do better than this,
at least give me a chance..

1434
02:04:26,498 --> 02:04:30,434
Worth of a pinch of this
vermillion, how would you know?

1435
02:04:31,303 --> 02:04:35,797
It's a gift from God!
This crimson dot.

1436
02:04:36,308 --> 02:04:41,268
It's a gift from God!
This crimson dot

1437
02:04:41,947 --> 02:04:47,283
It's a crown of pride,
for an lndian bride!

1438
02:04:47,485 --> 02:04:53,617
It's a crown of pride,
for an lndian bride!

1439
02:04:53,725 --> 02:04:54,749
What's so funny?

1440
02:04:54,859 --> 02:04:57,293
What is so damn funny!
What is so funny?

1441
02:04:57,596 --> 02:04:59,325
Why are you laughing?
Is this a joke?

1442
02:05:00,332 --> 02:05:01,356
Why don't you understand?

1443
02:05:01,466 --> 02:05:04,697
Pappu she can't be our Shantipriya.
She is not like Shanti at all!

1444
02:05:04,803 --> 02:05:06,532
She is so stupid!

1445
02:05:09,574 --> 02:05:11,906
I know you are not an actress
and you can't act..

1446
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:13,307
.. but you can try at least!

1447
02:05:13,445 --> 02:05:15,640
We are all trying here!
You are laughing!

1448
02:05:16,348 --> 02:05:19,511
Incompetent Mutt! Get out of here!

1449
02:05:21,519 --> 02:05:23,953
Now you've made her cry!!

1450
02:05:27,759 --> 02:05:29,852
Om, we all are trying!

1451
02:05:30,362 --> 02:05:32,353
But the poor thing doesn't even
know why are we doing all this!

1452
02:05:32,464 --> 02:05:33,795
What is our plan?! What plan!

1453
02:05:33,898 --> 02:05:34,922
This plan can only be
successful when..

1454
02:05:35,033 --> 02:05:36,660
.. Mukesh Mehra believes
that Shantipriya is back!

1455
02:05:37,369 --> 02:05:40,395
She only looks like Shantipriya!
She can't be like Shantipriya.

1456
02:05:40,505 --> 02:05:41,529
It'll take one second for

1457
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:43,335
Mukesh Mehra to figure out,
that she's not Shanti!

1458
02:05:43,441 --> 02:05:44,772
Then he's gone! He'll take
the next flight out!

1459
02:05:44,876 --> 02:05:45,934
The plan will be finished!

1460
02:05:46,044 --> 02:05:47,511
Then we'll have to tell
her everything Om!

1461
02:05:48,013 --> 02:05:50,811
We'll have to tell her what is all
this.. and why is it so important?

1462
02:05:52,484 --> 02:05:55,510
Before being Shanti, she will
have to understand her Om!

1463
02:05:58,623 --> 02:06:01,353
Om Shanti Om's story is
the story of my life.

1464
02:06:02,394 --> 02:06:04,419
I should have told you
all this before Sandy!

1465
02:06:07,432 --> 02:06:11,300
Because without understanding
Om's pain..

1466
02:06:11,403 --> 02:06:14,668
.. you won't be able
to be his Shanti.

1467
02:06:16,775 --> 02:06:18,436
But how could I tell you?

1468
02:06:21,413 --> 02:06:23,404
No one would have believed my story!

1469
02:06:26,851 --> 02:06:27,875
Not even you!

1470
02:06:27,986 --> 02:06:29,385
I will not believe your story Om?

1471
02:06:31,423 --> 02:06:33,323
When you jump from a fifty
storey building..

1472
02:06:33,425 --> 02:06:35,689
.. and manage to stand on your
own two feet, I believe you.

1473
02:06:37,796 --> 02:06:41,391
You fight 100 goons and save
the heroine, I believe you!

1474
02:06:43,435 --> 02:06:47,667
You fly in the air, run on water!
I believe all this Om!

1475
02:06:49,074 --> 02:06:51,508
Then how could you ever think that
I will not believe your story?

1476
02:06:53,611 --> 02:06:59,743
I'm sorry Sandy. I really am..

1477
02:07:01,453 --> 02:07:04,945
It's ok. There is still time!

1478
02:07:07,492 --> 02:07:09,426
And this time I will try
with all my heart Om!

1479
02:07:10,528 --> 02:07:11,552
And I won't let you down!

1480
02:08:01,513 --> 02:08:02,537
Thank you Sandy.

1481
02:08:04,549 --> 02:08:07,484
Mummy? - These are tears
of happiness my boy!

1482
02:08:13,091 --> 02:08:16,822
That's unbelievable OK!
In such a short while..

1483
02:08:17,128 --> 02:08:19,426
The set, script, and
even the heroine?

1484
02:08:19,531 --> 02:08:21,556
..you have finalized everything.
- That's nothing.

1485
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:24,496
My people have organized an
inaugural ceremony as well!

1486
02:08:24,636 --> 02:08:27,434
Oh God, no. This ceremony!
This offering of prayers..

1487
02:08:27,539 --> 02:08:30,440
.. taking the prints to
a temple for blessings..

1488
02:08:30,542 --> 02:08:32,567
.. all this still happens here?

1489
02:08:33,812 --> 02:08:34,938
It's so damn primitive!

1490
02:08:35,046 --> 02:08:36,809
Even I don't believe in all this!

1491
02:08:37,148 --> 02:08:40,640
That's why I've kept the ceremony
at a very unusual place.

1492
02:08:42,554 --> 02:08:44,545
Stay cool, Mike.

1493
02:08:45,723 --> 02:08:47,520
I like surprises!

1494
02:08:47,625 --> 02:08:48,853
Oh yes! You will be surprised!

1495
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:19,750
What the hell is this OK?

1496
02:09:21,593 --> 02:09:23,618
From all the places, you
had to find this place?

1497
02:09:24,629 --> 02:09:25,653
You know this is the
same place where?

1498
02:09:25,763 --> 02:09:27,492
This is the place where
the accident happened..

1499
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:29,624
.. and the entire studio
was burnt down!

1500
02:09:29,834 --> 02:09:31,563
I know, I know everything!

1501
02:09:31,703 --> 02:09:32,863
That's why I have chosen this place.

1502
02:09:33,238 --> 02:09:36,730
It's called the 'circle
of life' Mike!

1503
02:09:37,175 --> 02:09:39,507
An unfinished story
should always start..

1504
02:09:39,611 --> 02:09:41,772
.. from the point where
we left it, right?

1505
02:09:44,616 --> 02:09:45,981
Rockstar, okay.

1506
02:09:46,618 --> 02:09:48,813
Why did you resume making
Om Shanti Om?

1507
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,615
How else would we finish
making the film?

1508
02:09:50,722 --> 02:09:52,587
And this place..
- Mike! Come on!

1509
02:09:53,825 --> 02:09:57,761
Sir. - And he is the director of
the film, what's your name?

1510
02:09:57,929 --> 02:10:01,126
F. Khan.
- Yes! My childhood friend F. Khan!

1511
02:10:02,634 --> 02:10:07,264
You should have checked with me
once. I wasn't expecting this!

1512
02:10:07,639 --> 02:10:10,699
There are lots of unexpected
things in store for you..

1513
02:10:11,009 --> 02:10:12,772
Dudes! The producer!

1514
02:10:12,911 --> 02:10:14,606
His friends call him Mike!

1515
02:10:14,746 --> 02:10:18,614
You can call him Mukesh Mehra!

1516
02:10:18,716 --> 02:10:20,911
And now dudes, let's
talk about the babes!

1517
02:10:21,653 --> 02:10:25,714
The heroine of the film is,
what's her name? - Dolly!

1518
02:10:26,024 --> 02:10:29,721
My childhood friend, Dolly!
Oh! Here she comes!

1519
02:10:30,194 --> 02:10:32,754
Oh wow.

1520
02:10:32,964 --> 02:10:35,194
You will really like her Mike!
She's very sexy!

1521
02:10:35,667 --> 02:10:36,691
I hope so!

1522
02:10:36,935 --> 02:10:42,737
"When I touched it with my lips,
there was a commotion.."

1523
02:10:44,676 --> 02:10:45,700
That's her?!

1524
02:10:45,810 --> 02:10:48,040
No! That's Dolly's mom!

1525
02:10:49,881 --> 02:10:51,075
"There was a commotion.."

1526
02:10:51,182 --> 02:10:52,649
What's her name?
- Kamini.

1527
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:54,741
Kamini my childhood friend!

1528
02:10:57,155 --> 02:10:58,645
Hello Mr. Producer!

1529
02:10:58,756 --> 02:11:01,691
Baby was so excited to see you that
she didn't sleep the entire night!

1530
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:05,657
Only the fear of dark
circles made her sleep!

1531
02:11:05,797 --> 02:11:09,665
But I never compromise
on my beauty sleep!

1532
02:11:09,767 --> 02:11:11,701
I can see! You look
as fresh as a daisy!

1533
02:11:11,803 --> 02:11:13,065
Thank you! You 'cutey'!

1534
02:11:14,906 --> 02:11:16,999
Where is baby?
- There's baby!

1535
02:11:35,727 --> 02:11:40,221
Hey, answer our questions, please.

1536
02:11:44,869 --> 02:11:46,700
Beautiful girl!

1537
02:11:47,739 --> 02:11:52,267
Baby, touch his feet! Oh!
She is so talented!

1538
02:11:53,878 --> 02:11:54,902
Hello Omi!
- Yes Pappu!

1539
02:11:55,747 --> 02:11:57,942
I am taking all of them on the set.
Is mom ready?

1540
02:11:58,116 --> 02:12:00,846
Yes she is ready, but she
is really over acting!

1541
02:12:01,753 --> 02:12:02,879
That's our family problem!

1542
02:12:03,755 --> 02:12:07,191
Ten for.
- Oh mom! Let's go!

1543
02:12:08,059 --> 02:12:11,358
What let's go! You don't understand!
Let me come in the character!

1544
02:12:11,763 --> 02:12:13,253
You'll come in the
character for sure!

1545
02:12:13,364 --> 02:12:14,729
But we have to go now, they're
all ready! Let's go!

1546
02:12:14,832 --> 02:12:16,766
What was the line?
- Don't go inside!

1547
02:12:16,868 --> 02:12:17,892
Don't go inside!

1548
02:12:18,002 --> 02:12:20,732
In my next film, I want a ponytail
like Mike's! It's cool!

1549
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:26,834
What happened Mike?

1550
02:12:27,979 --> 02:12:29,037
Why have you put up a set here?

1551
02:12:29,781 --> 02:12:33,774
Obviously man. I told you..
'circle of life'!

1552
02:12:33,885 --> 02:12:35,011
An unfinished story should
always start.. - I know!

1553
02:12:35,186 --> 02:12:37,746
You know! That's cool buddy!
Let's go!

1554
02:12:38,122 --> 02:12:40,750
Come, we'll have fun.

1555
02:12:43,828 --> 02:12:45,921
Come on, let's go inside.

1556
02:12:46,030 --> 02:12:48,760
Beware! Don't go in!

1557
02:12:48,866 --> 02:12:51,426
What the hell is this?
Don't touch me! Leave me!

1558
02:12:51,969 --> 02:12:56,235
Security. - She has been waiting
for you for a long time!

1559
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:57,364
What's up, dude?

1560
02:12:57,942 --> 02:12:59,773
She will not leave you!

1561
02:12:59,877 --> 02:13:00,901
Who will not leave him?!

1562
02:13:01,012 --> 02:13:02,070
She will not leave you!
- Who will not leave him?!

1563
02:13:03,815 --> 02:13:05,043
Shanti!

1564
02:13:07,885 --> 02:13:11,218
Mummy! - Don't cry baby,
your liner will get spoilt.

1565
02:13:11,823 --> 02:13:13,290
She is a psycho mummy,
why are you getting scared?!

1566
02:13:14,859 --> 02:13:15,883
Is there someone inside?

1567
02:13:16,727 --> 02:13:17,785
Possible..

1568
02:13:21,833 --> 02:13:24,893
Mike! Isn't the set nice?!

1569
02:13:29,307 --> 02:13:31,036
Oh, Mr. Rajesh. - Oh Dad!

1570
02:13:41,853 --> 02:13:42,911
Hey Mike.

1571
02:13:44,055 --> 02:13:46,387
Hi Mukesh!
- Hi Rajesh!

1572
02:13:46,491 --> 02:13:48,823
Mike meet Shahwar.
Shahwar meet Mike!

1573
02:13:48,926 --> 02:13:51,827
He is the villain of our film!
A dude like you dude!

1574
02:13:52,130 --> 02:13:53,859
OK, it is time to break the coconut.

1575
02:13:53,965 --> 02:13:55,330
We have to break the coconut!
- What?!

1576
02:13:55,867 --> 02:13:57,129
Coconut breaking time!

1577
02:13:57,235 --> 02:13:58,896
Everybody, let's go. Coconut time.

1578
02:14:00,905 --> 02:14:04,932
Priest. - Take this. Take this.
This is for peace.

1579
02:14:05,209 --> 02:14:07,973
'Om shanti shanti shanti'!

1580
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:11,276
Oh for Peace! But Mukesh, the
coconut should break in one go!

1581
02:14:11,516 --> 02:14:14,178
Otherwise it's considered to
be inauspicious! Right Dad?

1582
02:14:14,285 --> 02:14:15,843
Oh of course! C'mon Mukesh!

1583
02:14:15,953 --> 02:14:16,977
You can do this.

1584
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:23,884
Oh fish! Didn't break! Don't
worry Mike, try again! Go on!

1585
02:14:26,430 --> 02:14:30,423
Oh God! It's very bad luck!
- Yeah! - Mike! Let me do it..

1586
02:14:30,535 --> 02:14:32,025
No! I'll do it!

1587
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:33,865
Ok! One more time! C'mon guys!

1588
02:14:38,910 --> 02:14:39,968
Are you ok Mikey?

1589
02:14:40,077 --> 02:14:41,101
What is this nonsense!

1590
02:14:41,412 --> 02:14:43,812
Don't worry Mikey, I know
you are out of practice..

1591
02:14:43,915 --> 02:14:47,043
.. you don't break coconuts
in Hollywood!

1592
02:14:48,286 --> 02:14:51,813
But here, before starting
any auspicious project..

1593
02:14:51,923 --> 02:14:54,187
.. we break a coconut..for peace!

1594
02:14:54,458 --> 02:14:56,221
We can break all kind of nuts!
Come on!

1595
02:14:56,394 --> 02:14:58,885
Come on.

1596
02:15:03,467 --> 02:15:05,059
Congratulations.

1597
02:15:05,937 --> 02:15:09,964
Ladies and Gentlemen.. Babes!
Lots of speeches today!

1598
02:15:11,342 --> 02:15:15,836
On this occasion we would
like to pay a tribute..

1599
02:15:15,947 --> 02:15:21,214
..to that actress for whom this
film was originally written!

1600
02:15:22,386 --> 02:15:25,014
I believe wherever she is..

1601
02:15:26,023 --> 02:15:29,925
..she is watching over us.

1602
02:15:33,631 --> 02:15:35,997
Right! Ladies and Gentlemen..

1603
02:15:37,068 --> 02:15:38,092
..Shantipriya!

1604
02:15:44,108 --> 02:15:47,874
And now I request Dolly
,my childhood friend..

1605
02:15:47,979 --> 02:15:51,938
.. to light the lamp and take
Shantipriya's blessings.

1606
02:15:52,216 --> 02:15:54,980
While she does that I will
come down! Come on Dolly!

1607
02:16:04,495 --> 02:16:05,519
As soon as you press this button..

1608
02:16:05,630 --> 02:16:06,961
..there will be a spark
behind that photo.

1609
02:16:08,032 --> 02:16:10,967
If there's no spark behind that
photo, I'll whack you!- lt'll happen!

1610
02:16:13,004 --> 02:16:15,529
One! Two! Three!

1611
02:16:29,153 --> 02:16:30,177
What's happening? Why
is it not working?

1612
02:16:30,655 --> 02:16:32,987
It seems the wire is loose,
one minute..

1613
02:16:33,090 --> 02:16:35,024
How can it be loose? I told you
to check! - I'll just see!

1614
02:16:38,596 --> 02:16:40,393
Oh shit. Oh fish.

1615
02:16:43,501 --> 02:16:45,298
Help!

1616
02:16:46,037 --> 02:16:47,368
Come on, hurry up.

1617
02:16:48,539 --> 02:16:51,007
Someone put out the fire!

1618
02:16:53,044 --> 02:16:54,306
Run out.

1619
02:16:55,313 --> 02:16:56,371
Move back.

1620
02:16:57,048 --> 02:16:59,039
Don't go inside!

1621
02:17:02,053 --> 02:17:07,013
Mummy! What superb acting!! Take
this fake coconut from my side!

1622
02:17:08,259 --> 02:17:11,285
And take these fake eye
brows from my side too!!

1623
02:17:13,164 --> 02:17:14,597
It must have been good fun today?!

1624
02:17:16,100 --> 02:17:17,124
We'll have fun tomorrow!

1625
02:17:18,402 --> 02:17:21,337
Big day tomorrow Sandy!
You remember the plan?

1626
02:17:21,706 --> 02:17:25,039
Yes.. but I'm nervous. What
if I make a mistake?

1627
02:17:25,142 --> 02:17:28,077
No! There will be no mistake.
Don't be nervous.

1628
02:17:28,412 --> 02:17:30,471
Let's discuss the plan
once more, alright?

1629
02:17:32,083 --> 02:17:35,416
Tomorrow we'll all be
there for the shooting.

1630
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:39,182
Baby! Stop playing with your phone
and practice your dialogues!

1631
02:17:39,623 --> 02:17:40,647
Mukesh Mehra will also be there..

1632
02:17:45,096 --> 02:17:46,154
Madam your shot is ready.

1633
02:17:46,263 --> 02:17:48,731
Oh! Shot is ready! Let
me touch up my makeup!

1634
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:50,226
Not yours, Dolly madam's shot..

1635
02:17:52,136 --> 02:17:54,001
As soon as I get a chance..

1636
02:17:54,105 --> 02:17:57,131
..I will send a message to
Mukesh from Dolly's phone..

1637
02:17:58,743 --> 02:18:03,407
.. telling him to meet her
in the make up room, alone.

1638
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:13,750
As far as I know Mukesh,
he will definitely go.

1639
02:18:17,228 --> 02:18:18,490
Pappu, he's coming!

1640
02:18:19,130 --> 02:18:21,428
You take Sandy with you and
reach the make up room. Yeah.

1641
02:18:22,233 --> 02:18:24,224
Nothing can go wrong now dude!

1642
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:30,564
Where is she?!

1643
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:35,106
Where is Dolly's mother Kamini?

1644
02:18:35,246 --> 02:18:36,270
She has gone to touch
up her make up!

1645
02:18:36,447 --> 02:18:38,108
Why does she need touch..
where has she gone?

1646
02:18:38,582 --> 02:18:39,606
Greenroom.

1647
02:18:40,418 --> 02:18:42,409
Where is she?!

1648
02:18:43,154 --> 02:18:44,212
Where is she?!

1649
02:18:48,592 --> 02:18:50,492
Oh Fish!

1650
02:18:53,164 --> 02:18:54,188
Kamini!

1651
02:19:01,205 --> 02:19:03,696
Kamini! Kamini!

1652
02:19:04,442 --> 02:19:07,434
OK, you! Why is he following me?

1653
02:19:08,179 --> 02:19:10,170
I know you don't need this..

1654
02:19:10,281 --> 02:19:13,216
..but you forgot your compact,
I came to give it.

1655
02:19:13,317 --> 02:19:16,309
Oh! Very sweet of you! Why
did you take the trouble?

1656
02:19:16,454 --> 02:19:18,445
You should have sent
it with a spot boy.

1657
02:19:18,823 --> 02:19:20,154
No problem at all ma'am!

1658
02:19:20,858 --> 02:19:22,155
You cutey!

1659
02:19:23,461 --> 02:19:25,190
Kamini! One minute!

1660
02:19:27,698 --> 02:19:28,722
What are you doing?!

1661
02:19:30,434 --> 02:19:33,096
Compact was just an excuse..

1662
02:19:33,204 --> 02:19:37,231
..actually I wanted
to meet you alone.

1663
02:19:37,608 --> 02:19:38,632
Why?

1664
02:19:38,742 --> 02:19:42,803
Because, you know..

1665
02:19:44,215 --> 02:19:47,514
..I've always liked older women!

1666
02:19:54,825 --> 02:19:57,123
You know darling, when l
saw you the first time..

1667
02:19:57,228 --> 02:20:01,392
.. I knew that something
would happen between us.

1668
02:20:01,732 --> 02:20:04,326
But I didn't know it'll
happen so soon.

1669
02:20:04,768 --> 02:20:08,431
A sexy girl like you should
be in Hollywood!

1670
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:10,366
I can take you there!

1671
02:20:11,375 --> 02:20:15,277
Just make sure this is our secret..

1672
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:25,220
Mike what happened?

1673
02:20:25,589 --> 02:20:27,250
Hey, look at your hair,
it is a mess man.

1674
02:20:27,892 --> 02:20:31,225
What happened?
- lnside! - lnside?

1675
02:20:31,562 --> 02:20:32,586
There is somebody inside!

1676
02:20:32,696 --> 02:20:34,220
Oh God! Here also there is somebody?!

1677
02:20:34,331 --> 02:20:36,561
Mike you look as if
you've seen a ghost!

1678
02:20:37,268 --> 02:20:40,294
Ghost! I told baby not
to remove her make up!

1679
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:43,734
Don't worry. Take it easy!

1680
02:20:48,946 --> 02:20:50,379
What are you doing Kamini! Please!

1681
02:20:51,282 --> 02:20:53,648
Mike come here! There
is nobody here!

1682
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:59,915
See. There is nobody here!
- But I saw..

1683
02:21:00,357 --> 02:21:02,882
Did you see anyone going
out of this room? - No..

1684
02:21:03,294 --> 02:21:05,285
Did you see anyone going inside
the room?! Nobody is here Mike.

1685
02:21:05,396 --> 02:21:07,557
Dude, old man, relax!

1686
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:10,699
By the way, what were you
doing in Dolly's greenroom?

1687
02:21:10,801 --> 02:21:12,291
Yes, what were you doing?

1688
02:21:13,470 --> 02:21:15,938
I was looking for a bathroom.
I was lost.

1689
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:18,205
If you want to use the
bathroom next time..

1690
02:21:18,309 --> 02:21:19,833
.. please go to my green
room, not Dolly's!

1691
02:21:19,944 --> 02:21:22,276
You should respect women,
what say Kamini?

1692
02:21:22,413 --> 02:21:24,677
And love them too!
- Kamini! Take it easy.

1693
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:29,479
Cheers Mikey!

1694
02:21:30,821 --> 02:21:31,913
How are you feeling now?

1695
02:21:33,424 --> 02:21:35,949
I mean you've not been coming
for shooting lately.

1696
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:40,296
The entire unit was missing you..
especially Dolly and her bathroom!

1697
02:21:41,899 --> 02:21:43,799
A producer has many other important
things to attend to Ok.

1698
02:21:44,702 --> 02:21:46,294
Anyways, you are there to
take care of the shoot!

1699
02:21:46,637 --> 02:21:48,502
Yeah of course! I am there!

1700
02:21:50,341 --> 02:21:51,535
Let's watch the Scenes?
- Yeah!

1701
02:21:52,876 --> 02:21:54,969
Projectionist put reel number nine.

1702
02:21:56,480 --> 02:22:00,314
After watching these scenes..
you'll be stunned! Intense man!

1703
02:22:02,553 --> 02:22:05,488
I didn't know Ramesh that
you love me so much!

1704
02:22:06,357 --> 02:22:09,383
And you want to marry me!
That also here..

1705
02:22:10,394 --> 02:22:12,862
Forgive me Ramesh!
I didn't trust you!

1706
02:22:12,997 --> 02:22:15,431
You will come down from there,
dressed like a bride..

1707
02:22:16,433 --> 02:22:19,334
.. just like a fairy descending
from heaven..

1708
02:22:20,571 --> 02:22:21,595
Ramesh!

1709
02:22:23,374 --> 02:22:25,638
What's that? Take it easy!
What's wrong man?!

1710
02:22:26,410 --> 02:22:27,434
Did you see?
- Who?

1711
02:22:28,379 --> 02:22:30,370
Who?
- Her.. - Dolly?

1712
02:22:30,714 --> 02:22:31,806
NO! Not Dolly! That girl..

1713
02:22:31,915 --> 02:22:33,883
You're obsessed with Dolly!
Which girl? - The other girl!

1714
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:36,384
It's a gift from God!
This crimson dot.

1715
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:39,880
It's a crown of pride,
for an lndian bride!

1716
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:42,356
Mikey stop drinking! I think
you are getting high!

1717
02:22:42,926 --> 02:22:43,950
And Watch!

1718
02:22:44,061 --> 02:22:46,359
It's every woman's dream!
It's ruby sheen!

1719
02:22:47,431 --> 02:22:49,797
There! Look!

1720
02:22:50,401 --> 02:22:52,426
Stop the Projection!
Put on the lights!

1721
02:22:52,536 --> 02:22:54,697
Hey dude what are you doing?
What is this nonsense?

1722
02:22:55,406 --> 02:22:57,567
There is nobody on that
screen, except Dolly!

1723
02:22:57,675 --> 02:22:59,540
What's wrong with you?
You don't believe me?

1724
02:22:59,743 --> 02:23:03,042
One second! One second!
Projectionist play this reel again!

1725
02:23:03,414 --> 02:23:04,438
Ok Boss!

1726
02:23:04,581 --> 02:23:08,039
Relax! Watch now! Nobody
will come, watch!

1727
02:23:08,419 --> 02:23:10,444
It's a gift from God!
This crimson dot.

1728
02:23:11,455 --> 02:23:13,719
It's a crown of pride,
for an lndian bride!

1729
02:23:14,425 --> 02:23:16,484
It's every woman's dream!
It's ruby sheen!

1730
02:23:20,431 --> 02:23:22,922
What?! Everything is fine! See?

1731
02:23:23,934 --> 02:23:25,959
How is it possible?
- What is possible?

1732
02:23:27,871 --> 02:23:30,704
I swear OK! I saw her! She was here!

1733
02:23:30,808 --> 02:23:34,403
She was here, there! Who is
this girl you see everywhere?

1734
02:23:34,745 --> 02:23:36,679
First on the sets, then make
up room, and now here!

1735
02:23:37,448 --> 02:23:41,578
You know the entire unit is
already saying you are mad!

1736
02:23:41,685 --> 02:23:43,414
Tell me Mikey am I working
for a mad man?

1737
02:23:43,721 --> 02:23:45,712
If the press gets to
know about this..

1738
02:23:45,823 --> 02:23:48,758
I'm not crazy goddammit!
I'm not crazy!

1739
02:23:48,892 --> 02:23:51,486
So then what? Am I crazy?!
Am I mad?!

1740
02:23:52,463 --> 02:23:55,694
I am handling everything be it
casting, ceremony or the shooting!

1741
02:23:55,799 --> 02:23:56,823
You don't even come on the sets!

1742
02:23:57,868 --> 02:24:00,735
And now this madness! What's
wrong with you Mike?

1743
02:24:00,838 --> 02:24:06,435
I don't know OK. I can't
understand anything!

1744
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:11,505
I think I should go back
to America! - What?!

1745
02:24:11,882 --> 02:24:13,747
Yeah! That's what I'm going to do.

1746
02:24:15,753 --> 02:24:17,687
I think I will leave tomorrow
night itself!

1747
02:24:19,056 --> 02:24:21,456
No! You can't leave!

1748
02:24:21,825 --> 02:24:25,488
I mean we have our music
launch in two days!

1749
02:24:25,729 --> 02:24:27,458
You will have to stay
back for that atleast!

1750
02:24:27,564 --> 02:24:30,658
No OK! I can't stay here anymore!
I have to go.

1751
02:24:31,068 --> 02:24:32,399
No. Anyways you are here to take
care of the Music launch..

1752
02:24:32,503 --> 02:24:33,561
.. what's the big deal?

1753
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:36,662
It is a bloody big deal Mikey!

1754
02:24:37,574 --> 02:24:40,566
Media, guests, distributors,
everybody will be there..

1755
02:24:40,811 --> 02:24:42,472
And if the producer of the film
won't come how will it look?

1756
02:24:42,913 --> 02:24:45,507
And I am not your servant! No!

1757
02:24:46,083 --> 02:24:47,641
I can't handle everything for you!

1758
02:24:48,519 --> 02:24:50,544
I am a star Mikey, I'm a superstar!

1759
02:24:50,654 --> 02:24:51,678
So let me tell you one thing..

1760
02:24:51,889 --> 02:24:54,949
I am through with your 'Om Shanti
Om'! Take your film and stuff it!

1761
02:24:55,526 --> 02:24:56,584
Go back to L.A. Whatever!

1762
02:24:57,528 --> 02:24:59,428
And one more thing, I can
do ten other films..

1763
02:24:59,530 --> 02:25:02,431
.. but you have borrowed a lot
of money from the market..

1764
02:25:02,533 --> 02:25:06,560
..and if 'Om Shanti Om' is shelved
again, you will be on the roads!

1765
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:07,932
You will be finished Mikey!

1766
02:25:08,038 --> 02:25:11,132
No, you can't do this!

1767
02:25:11,542 --> 02:25:13,601
Oh shut up! Don't
show me the finger!

1768
02:25:14,178 --> 02:25:16,612
I can do this and I will!

1769
02:25:18,081 --> 02:25:20,447
If you want 'Om Shanti Om' to
finish, and get released..

1770
02:25:20,551 --> 02:25:22,678
..then be there for
the music launch!

1771
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:25,152
Otherwise you and your film
both, can go to hell!

1772
02:25:25,622 --> 02:25:29,524
Because frankly my dear,
I don't give a damn!

1773
02:25:30,794 --> 02:25:31,818
So fish it!

1774
02:25:37,568 --> 02:25:38,592
Have you lost it Om?

1775
02:25:38,902 --> 02:25:40,665
How will we prepare everything
in two days?

1776
02:25:41,839 --> 02:25:43,067
This plan was supposed to be
carried out after three weeks!

1777
02:25:43,173 --> 02:25:45,198
What could I do Pappu?
You were there!

1778
02:25:45,576 --> 02:25:46,907
He was saying he will
go back to America.

1779
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:49,544
So I used any excuse to stop him!

1780
02:25:49,646 --> 02:25:51,944
But Om, how will we make
it work in two days?

1781
02:25:52,716 --> 02:25:54,479
We have to fix the cameras
on the entire set..

1782
02:25:54,585 --> 02:25:56,576
..we have to build a monitor room!
Everyone will have to be briefed.

1783
02:25:57,588 --> 02:25:58,850
And even Sandy is not
fully ready yet!

1784
02:25:59,756 --> 02:26:02,816
Om I will try, but what
if I make a mistake..

1785
02:26:03,694 --> 02:26:05,958
There can be no mistake now Sandy!

1786
02:26:07,598 --> 02:26:10,066
He can't get away this time!

1787
02:26:11,068 --> 02:26:15,505
We'll have to make Mukesh
Mehra believe that..

1788
02:26:15,606 --> 02:26:17,938
..that Shanti has come back!

1789
02:26:18,642 --> 02:26:20,837
That's the only way he'll confess!

1790
02:26:21,678 --> 02:26:22,702
It's all upto you Sandy!

1791
02:26:23,614 --> 02:26:24,638
You'll have to scare him so much..

1792
02:26:24,748 --> 02:26:26,147
..that he blurts out the truth!

1793
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:28,582
Frankly I have serious
doubts about your plan!

1794
02:26:28,986 --> 02:26:33,889
Scaring him off! Letting him think
that Shanti is back, forget it!

1795
02:26:34,157 --> 02:26:35,590
Nothing is going to happen
Om! He won't come.

1796
02:26:35,726 --> 02:26:36,750
He will run away tonight itself!

1797
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:39,522
If you want something
with all your heart..

1798
02:26:39,630 --> 02:26:43,657
.. the entire universe conspires
for you to get it!

1799
02:26:46,270 --> 02:26:47,601
He will definitely come Om!

1800
02:26:48,972 --> 02:26:50,269
Don't worry Son!

1801
02:26:52,209 --> 02:26:54,700
Pappu! You go and arrange
for everything!

1802
02:26:55,646 --> 02:26:57,204
I know he will come..

1803
02:26:58,682 --> 02:27:01,150
..because the film is not over yet!

1804
02:27:54,705 --> 02:28:01,008
There is tale I have to tell

1805
02:28:01,745 --> 02:28:08,048
About a man who lost his heart,
and gave up his life as well!

1806
02:28:08,719 --> 02:28:11,916
The one who loves this way..

1807
02:28:12,189 --> 02:28:15,352
Can he die? Even if
death takes him away?

1808
02:28:15,892 --> 02:28:21,694
Come, hear this fable today!!

1809
02:28:22,299 --> 02:28:27,635
Once upon a time a man
loved a beauty..

1810
02:28:27,738 --> 02:28:34,302
..but his love for
her he had to hide!

1811
02:28:36,346 --> 02:28:42,649
For the lady was famed for her
beauty..

1812
02:28:42,753 --> 02:28:48,714
..in the world far and wide!

1813
02:28:49,926 --> 02:28:56,661
A tale of these two hearts alone..

1814
02:28:56,767 --> 02:29:04,071
..is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1815
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:36,330
The man had only one dream.

1816
02:29:36,807 --> 02:29:43,804
For the beautiful lady to
be his heart's queen!

1817
02:29:44,081 --> 02:29:50,919
The man had only one dream.

1818
02:29:51,121 --> 02:29:57,788
For the beautiful lady,
to be his heart's queen!

1819
02:29:57,894 --> 02:30:01,091
Little did he know,
it was all in vain..

1820
02:30:01,298 --> 02:30:04,790
What he thought was happiness,
turned out to be pain!

1821
02:30:04,935 --> 02:30:11,841
Why did this happen, and for
what..is the entire tale!

1822
02:30:11,975 --> 02:30:14,739
The story goes..

1823
02:30:14,845 --> 02:30:23,810
The beauty had already
given her heart away.

1824
02:30:25,922 --> 02:30:31,758
Our man unaware, was
still ensnared..

1825
02:30:31,862 --> 02:30:37,892
But his dreams had
to shatter one day.

1826
02:30:39,436 --> 02:30:46,774
Tale of shattered dreams and
a broken heart left lone..

1827
02:30:46,877 --> 02:30:53,874
.. is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1828
02:31:22,946 --> 02:31:29,476
There is a tale I have to tell..

1829
02:31:30,053 --> 02:31:36,925
The one who laughs the most,
one day he cries as well..

1830
02:31:37,194 --> 02:31:40,254
The beauty was, madly in love..

1831
02:31:40,564 --> 02:31:43,897
In return she was battered!

1832
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:50,335
Listen how her trust was
completely shattered!

1833
02:31:50,941 --> 02:31:53,341
The story goes..

1834
02:31:53,443 --> 02:32:02,909
The man, the beauty had her heart
on, from inside was a con!

1835
02:32:04,988 --> 02:32:08,389
Because she loved a rogue..

1836
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:17,024
She was caught in his lies, and
one day he left her to die!

1837
02:32:18,335 --> 02:32:25,867
The heartbreak of a woman who died
lone..

1838
02:32:25,976 --> 02:32:32,609
..is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1839
02:32:33,049 --> 02:32:36,382
Why does a murderer not understand?

1840
02:32:36,620 --> 02:32:39,953
It's a crime that cannot
be buried in the sand.

1841
02:32:40,190 --> 02:32:43,387
It's a stain that never will
fade,but is stamped.

1842
02:32:43,627 --> 02:32:47,063
And will remain etched
forever on his hand!

1843
02:32:47,364 --> 02:32:50,424
When the beauty was slayed..

1844
02:32:51,001 --> 02:32:54,061
Someone did reach there in haste.

1845
02:32:54,371 --> 02:32:57,499
He tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1846
02:32:58,008 --> 02:33:01,466
Love had to shed
tears for the loss!

1847
02:33:01,645 --> 02:33:04,978
Love had to shed
tears for the loss!

1848
02:33:08,351 --> 02:33:11,081
The story goes..

1849
02:33:11,187 --> 02:33:15,920
That someone who saw
the killer's face..

1850
02:33:16,026 --> 02:33:20,622
..that man has come back today!

1851
02:33:22,565 --> 02:33:26,001
Listen to the life's pace..
what it says..

1852
02:33:26,102 --> 02:33:35,101
The felon should know now, death
is dancing around him and how!

1853
02:33:36,079 --> 02:33:43,315
This circle of life, death
and karma well known!

1854
02:33:44,054 --> 02:33:50,050
Is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1855
02:33:51,061 --> 02:33:57,398
Is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1856
02:33:58,101 --> 02:34:06,201
Is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1857
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:31,624
What happened?

1858
02:34:56,126 --> 02:34:59,755
Guests will walk on carpets
of petals and come in.

1859
02:35:00,764 --> 02:35:03,426
There we'll have a forty
piece orchestra....

1860
02:35:03,666 --> 02:35:05,258
playing Shanti's favourite songs.

1861
02:35:06,703 --> 02:35:11,037
Over there is a fountain with
champagne flowing in it..

1862
02:35:11,141 --> 02:35:12,199
..instead of water!

1863
02:35:13,209 --> 02:35:18,112
And under this magnificent
chandelier, we will get married.

1864
02:35:19,282 --> 02:35:20,306
Who are you?

1865
02:35:21,418 --> 02:35:23,113
And how do you know all this?

1866
02:35:23,219 --> 02:35:25,050
Ya, you said all these things..

1867
02:35:25,155 --> 02:35:28,181
..to Shanti when you were alone.

1868
02:35:29,192 --> 02:35:32,218
But there was someone
else there as well..

1869
02:35:33,296 --> 02:35:35,491
..who not only heard all this..

1870
02:35:35,598 --> 02:35:38,761
..but also witnessed your
horrifying crime!

1871
02:35:41,237 --> 02:35:43,671
That was me Mukesh!

1872
02:35:44,607 --> 02:35:49,135
No! That's not possible!

1873
02:35:49,279 --> 02:35:52,180
Impossible, but true!

1874
02:35:53,450 --> 02:35:55,315
That night Shanti did not die alone!

1875
02:35:56,252 --> 02:35:57,480
I died with her!

1876
02:35:59,189 --> 02:36:00,213
Om Prakash!

1877
02:36:00,323 --> 02:36:05,158
Who used to play small roles in
your big films, a Junior artiste.

1878
02:36:06,362 --> 02:36:08,262
I could not save my Shanti.

1879
02:36:10,233 --> 02:36:11,495
But I will get justice for her!

1880
02:36:13,369 --> 02:36:14,700
You will be punished Mukesh!

1881
02:36:15,505 --> 02:36:17,166
You will pay for your sins!

1882
02:36:17,307 --> 02:36:19,400
Sandy this is your cue.
You know what to do?

1883
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:22,440
Yes Pappu. But I am very scared!

1884
02:36:22,579 --> 02:36:24,240
This is no time to get scared, you
need to scare other people off!

1885
02:36:24,481 --> 02:36:27,177
Everything depends on
you now. You can do it!

1886
02:36:27,717 --> 02:36:29,207
Best of lucks! Go dear!

1887
02:36:32,789 --> 02:36:37,488
That's brilliant OK! Fantastic!
You got me!

1888
02:36:38,761 --> 02:36:41,457
So you will send me to Prison? How?

1889
02:36:42,866 --> 02:36:46,529
You will stand in the court and
narrate your saga of reincarnation?

1890
02:36:48,238 --> 02:36:49,705
Why don't we do one thing,
let me confess everything!

1891
02:36:49,806 --> 02:36:51,205
But who will make me confess?!

1892
02:36:51,341 --> 02:36:53,536
You or your duplicate Shanti?

1893
02:36:57,814 --> 02:37:01,147
You thought you will get a two
bit actress and scare me off..

1894
02:37:01,251 --> 02:37:03,242
.. so that I admit everything?

1895
02:37:04,821 --> 02:37:05,845
But you see OK..

1896
02:37:06,256 --> 02:37:08,383
Ghosts don't get hurt,
they don't bleed!

1897
02:37:08,591 --> 02:37:12,288
So now why don't you and your
goddamn Shanti go to hell!

1898
02:37:14,430 --> 02:37:15,692
Oh God! He knows everything!

1899
02:37:16,266 --> 02:37:18,860
Anwar stop Sandy! This
bastard can do anything!

1900
02:37:21,437 --> 02:37:22,563
Pappu the door is jammed!

1901
02:37:27,544 --> 02:37:29,273
And you know what the problem is OK?

1902
02:37:29,679 --> 02:37:31,237
Court of law wants evidence..

1903
02:37:31,614 --> 02:37:33,343
..which you don't have.

1904
02:37:33,816 --> 02:37:36,250
Even if I have killed Shanti,
then where is her body?

1905
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:39,752
No one has found her body yet!

1906
02:37:41,291 --> 02:37:42,349
And believe me..

1907
02:37:43,326 --> 02:37:46,261
..OK, Om whatever!

1908
02:37:47,363 --> 02:37:49,263
Without this evidence..

1909
02:37:49,532 --> 02:37:51,432
.. even God can't touch me!

1910
02:37:53,303 --> 02:37:54,463
I will give the evidence, Mukesh!!

1911
02:37:58,708 --> 02:38:00,369
Oh God, Sandy.

1912
02:38:03,546 --> 02:38:05,480
Come! We were missing you!
- He knows.

1913
02:38:05,615 --> 02:38:07,742
You don't need to continue with
your rubbish acting now!

1914
02:38:08,318 --> 02:38:10,343
Go away, Sandy.
- Stop this acting or else..

1915
02:38:10,453 --> 02:38:14,583
Else what? You'll kill me? - Sandy
he knows everything, keep quiet!

1916
02:38:14,691 --> 02:38:15,885
How many times will
you kill me Mukesh?

1917
02:38:15,992 --> 02:38:17,357
Sandy he knows everything!
You just go from here.

1918
02:38:17,493 --> 02:38:20,291
Oh, just shut up. I don't want
to listen to your nonsense!

1919
02:38:20,396 --> 02:38:21,488
You will have to listen Mukesh.

1920
02:38:22,565 --> 02:38:23,589
And listen carefully.

1921
02:38:24,701 --> 02:38:25,725
You came back that night!

1922
02:38:26,336 --> 02:38:29,305
After the fire died down,
you came back Mukesh!

1923
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:30,565
Yes I did, so what?
- Sandy, listen to me Sandy.

1924
02:38:30,740 --> 02:38:32,332
To put away my dead body!

1925
02:38:32,442 --> 02:38:33,739
What rubbish!

1926
02:38:34,344 --> 02:38:35,572
I wasn't dead Mukesh!

1927
02:38:35,678 --> 02:38:36,702
I was still breathing!

1928
02:38:36,813 --> 02:38:39,475
How do you know all this?
- But you buried me alive!

1929
02:38:39,582 --> 02:38:40,606
How do you know all this?

1930
02:38:40,717 --> 02:38:44,551
Under this chandeliar!
- Who are you?! - Stop it, Sandy!

1931
02:38:44,887 --> 02:38:47,253
The court needs proof..
- Stop it, I said, stop it.

1932
02:38:47,357 --> 02:38:48,483
..they will get the proof Mukesh!

1933
02:38:48,591 --> 02:38:49,956
They will not get anything!

1934
02:38:51,494 --> 02:38:53,860
Right here under this chandelier,
they'll find Shanti's dead body!

1935
02:38:53,997 --> 02:38:56,989
I said shut up! There
is nothing here!

1936
02:38:57,367 --> 02:38:58,732
Which you buried that night!

1937
02:38:58,835 --> 02:38:59,859
There is nothing here!

1938
02:38:59,969 --> 02:39:01,493
You are going to pay
for your sins Mukesh!

1939
02:39:02,372 --> 02:39:03,396
You are going to die!

1940
02:39:03,506 --> 02:39:05,371
Shut up! Or I will shoot you!

1941
02:39:05,642 --> 02:39:07,803
No!

1942
02:39:54,824 --> 02:39:56,018
No!

1943
02:40:08,438 --> 02:40:10,668
Mukesh!

1944
02:40:27,990 --> 02:40:30,424
Om.. you don't kill him.

1945
02:40:32,462 --> 02:40:33,486
No!

1946
02:40:34,530 --> 02:40:36,464
He's destined to die!

1947
02:40:36,566 --> 02:40:37,590
He's destined to die..

1948
02:40:39,502 --> 02:40:40,799
..but you're not going to kill him!

1949
02:40:54,050 --> 02:40:55,711
No!

1950
02:41:24,547 --> 02:41:26,014
Om!
- Omi.

1951
02:41:26,516 --> 02:41:27,540
Om!

1952
02:41:53,142 --> 02:41:54,905
'So you buried me alive.'

1953
02:41:56,179 --> 02:41:58,875
'Under this chandelier.'

1954
02:42:00,116 --> 02:42:02,584
'You'll find Shanti's body
under this chandelier.'

1955
02:42:19,569 --> 02:42:25,530
Om! I'm sorry!

1956
02:42:25,641 --> 02:42:28,576
I couldn't..
- It's ok.

1957
02:42:35,151 --> 02:42:36,175
I couldn't..

1958
02:42:57,607 --> 02:43:01,600
Because the film
is not over yet, my friend!

1959
02:43:23,099 --> 02:43:24,623
Wow!

1960
02:43:33,776 --> 02:43:37,007
Wow! - Love you!

1961
02:43:59,001 --> 02:44:02,732
"Hey my beauty, My Precious one!
What spell have you cast on me.!"

1962
02:44:02,872 --> 02:44:06,808
"My eyes can't sleep a wink. And
my heart is ready to sink."

1963
02:44:06,909 --> 02:44:10,640
"Hey my beauty, My Precious one!
What spell have you cast on me.!"

1964
02:44:10,746 --> 02:44:14,079
"My eyes can't sleep a wink. And
my heart is ready to sink."

1965
02:44:14,183 --> 02:44:19,644
"About my poor heart and my wandering
soul. Who should I go and tell?"

1966
02:44:23,693 --> 02:44:25,160
Wow!

1967
02:44:25,261 --> 02:44:27,786
"Pain of disco.."

1968
02:44:57,326 --> 02:45:00,853
There was a time when the flowers
were blooming all around.

1969
02:45:01,230 --> 02:45:05,030
There was a time, lost in
Love's whispering sounds.

1970
02:45:08,938 --> 02:45:12,704
There was a time when the flowers
were blooming all around.

1971
02:45:12,842 --> 02:45:16,369
There was a time, lost in
Love's whispering sounds.

1972
02:45:16,746 --> 02:45:20,147
What a time, when I lived in dreams!

1973
02:45:20,383 --> 02:45:23,944
What a time, when l
was drunk on youth!

1974
02:45:24,053 --> 02:45:25,645
But that time was short and
I got hurt as the bubble of..

1975
02:45:25,755 --> 02:45:27,780
..my love and dreams just burst..

1976
02:45:27,890 --> 02:45:29,653
Now I am a wanderer, as
I wander around London..

1977
02:45:29,759 --> 02:45:31,784
..Paris, New York, L.A.,
San Francisco!..

1978
02:45:38,367 --> 02:45:46,741
Pain of disco!

1979
02:45:58,254 --> 02:46:02,748
Hey my beauty, My Precious one!

1980
02:46:02,858 --> 02:46:06,794
What spell have you cast on me.

1981
02:46:06,896 --> 02:46:10,127
Every second was a wild wanting.

1982
02:46:10,433 --> 02:46:14,233
Every second was a daring fire.

1983
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:21,771
Every second was a wild wanting.

1984
02:46:21,911 --> 02:46:25,813
Every second was a daring fire.

1985
02:46:25,981 --> 02:46:29,314
Blessings were showered
on me in abundance..

1986
02:46:29,819 --> 02:46:33,016
And after this shower
I had no other desire.

1987
02:46:33,122 --> 02:46:36,182
But once again I find myself
alone. Oh my beloved!..

1988
02:46:36,826 --> 02:46:38,817
You broke my heart and you left..
to this day, I feel the rift.

1989
02:46:38,928 --> 02:46:41,954
And the date you left
was the twenty sixth!

1990
02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:51,963
"Hey my beauty, My Precious one!
What spell have you cast on me.!"

1991
02:46:52,108 --> 02:46:55,373
"My eyes can't sleep a wink. And
my heart is ready to sink."

1992
02:46:55,478 --> 02:46:57,969
"About my poor heart and
my wandering soul.

1993
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:01,072
Who should I go and tell?"

1994
02:47:14,430 --> 02:47:22,496
Pain of disco!

1995
02:47:22,872 --> 02:47:31,940
Pain of disco!

1996
02:47:32,047 --> 02:47:35,847
'Om Shanti Om'!

1997
02:47:47,897 --> 02:47:55,497
There is peace and calm around,
yet this heart is fervor bound!

1998
02:47:55,971 --> 02:48:03,207
There is peace and calm around,
yet this heart is fervor bound!

1999
02:48:03,445 --> 02:48:08,815
Eyes will knit such furtive
dreams! To her and him..

2000
02:48:08,918 --> 02:48:10,909
..it'll tell all and scream!

2001
02:48:11,020 --> 02:48:12,885
There is no sense of time
no guiding light.

2002
02:48:12,988 --> 02:48:14,922
It's just us and the crazy night!

2003
02:48:15,024 --> 02:48:18,551
A crazy night! A crazy night!

2004
02:48:18,928 --> 02:48:20,919
There is no offense today, and
no one to lead the way..

2005
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:22,395
On whom should this blame we lay?

2006
02:48:22,498 --> 02:48:26,958
A crazy night! A crazy night!

2007
02:48:27,136 --> 02:48:34,508
All the hot girls put your hands
up and say 'Om Shanti Om'!
