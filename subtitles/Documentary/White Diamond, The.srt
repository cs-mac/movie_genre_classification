1
00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.982
Come on.

2
00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:43.358
Kamajors. Local militia
protecting their homes, huh?

3
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.396
- Do not look them in the eye.
- No.

4
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.371
Excuse me. Excuse me?

5
00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:05.684
Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen
with <i>Vital Affairs</i> magazine.

6
00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:08.914
Wonder if I could take your picture.
I'm just gonna get my camera.

7
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.025
I've heard about your struggle.
I'd love to know more about it.

8
00:01:12.193 --> 00:01:14.821
Would you mind if I took your picture?
Everyone together?

9
00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:16.926
Everyone could all come in together.

10
00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:22.460
Is that okay?
If everyone could come closer.

11
00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:26.599
If you come over here and come in
nice and close. That's good.

12
00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:30.233
Yeah. That's great.
And we'll get one with all of us.

13
00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:32.309
There you go. That's perfect.

14
00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.640
How about one together?
Us together, what do you think?

15
00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:38.786
I'll come in like this, yeah?

16
00:01:39.587 --> 00:01:40.576
Cheese.

17
00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:45.089
So do you think
they've read your work?

18
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.387
Shut up.

19
00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:02.607
Hey, get them, get them, get them.

20
00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:07.942
- I got a score. I got a score.
- You missed.

21
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.811
Where have you come from?

22
00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:14.116
- Where did you come from?
- Where have you come from?

23
00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:18.056
That's right. Yeah.
From New York. From America.

24
00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:20.126
I don't have anything for you.

25
00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:42.245
My name is Benjamin Margai.

26
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:45.010
Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.

27
00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:48.246
- Hello. How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

28
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.369
I'm the cameraman?

29
00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:10.911
The Belgians were the first
to chop off limbs in Africa.

30
00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.448
King Leopold took one hand
for every hundredth slave in the Congo...

31
00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:17.710
...to keep them in line.

32
00:03:18.353 --> 00:03:21.288
Many of these children
were taken by the RUF.

33
00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:23.447
We have taken them back.

34
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:26.719
Some of them have been
made to do horrible things.

35
00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:29.921
We are trying
to bring them back to life.

36
00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:31.725
Let me show you.

37
00:03:33.768 --> 00:03:36.066
Imagine doing all this, huh?

38
00:03:37.372 --> 00:03:39.272
What's your excuse?

39
00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:45.410
Well, it's gotten hard to go back
to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.

40
00:03:45.647 --> 00:03:48.275
So you're an action junkie, huh?

41
00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:51.515
Three out of five ex-boyfriends
recently polled...

42
00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:56.123
...say that I prefer to be
in a constant state of crisis.

43
00:03:56.658 --> 00:03:58.922
Maybe I just give a shit.

44
00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:03.586
You were good today.

45
00:04:06.034 --> 00:04:07.365
You know that?

46
00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:09.993
You too.

47
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.876
"...that sometimes they forgot
to close the door.

48
00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:19.104
She also wrote
about her sister Josie...

49
00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:24.708
...who was very ill
and who had to be taken to hospital."

50
00:04:26.754 --> 00:04:27.948
Cheers.

51
00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:33.352
So how many attacks
have there been in the area?

52
00:04:33.528 --> 00:04:36.429
I have known most of the rebels
since they were children.

53
00:04:36.598 --> 00:04:41.126
The local commander is still afraid
I will come after him with my ruler.

54
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.028
So you think because your intentions
are good, they'll spare you, huh?

55
00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:49.040
My heart always told me
that people are inherently good.

56
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.405
My experience suggests otherwise.

57
00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:53.376
But what about you, Mr. Archer?

58
00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:56.249
In your long career as a journalist...

59
00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:59.250
...would you say that people
are mostly good?

60
00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:02.755
No.

61
00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:04.548
I'd say they're just people.

62
00:05:04.726 --> 00:05:08.662
Exactly. It is what they do
that makes them good or bad.

63
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.061
A moment of love,
even in a bad man...

64
00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.801
...can give meaning to a life.

65
00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.598
None of us knows which path
will lead us to God.

66
00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:22.832
Hey!

67
00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:12.690
It's palm wine.

68
00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.904
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?

69
00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:26.563
God.

70
00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:29.471
- Drank that as a boy.
- In Rhodesia?

71
00:06:31.646 --> 00:06:32.874
I take notes.

72
00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.312
The Shona...

73
00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.917
The Shona have a word for me.

74
00:06:42.757 --> 00:06:46.386
- It means "white boy in Africa."
- When did you leave?

75
00:06:47.028 --> 00:06:48.723
I didn't leave.

76
00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:53.230
I got sent away to South Africa
in 1978 when the <i>munts</i> overran us.

77
00:06:53.568 --> 00:06:55.035
Then you joined the army?

78
00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.066
Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.

79
00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:02.937
- The 32 Battalion.
- That's right.

80
00:07:05.313 --> 00:07:08.578
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us...

81
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.242
...we fought with the blacks, huh?
Yeah. Side by side.

82
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.151
There was no apartheid in a foxhole.
The colonel always used to tell us that.

83
00:07:16.324 --> 00:07:19.725
- This is Colonel Coetzee?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:25.364
Then, of course, it's 1994.
No more army.

85
00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:27.364
No more apartheid.

86
00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:30.902
Truth and reconciliation
and all of that rubbish, you know.

87
00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:32.562
Kumbaya.

88
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:36.105
We fought and died together,
you know?

89
00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:39.542
Black and white. Most people back home
didn't even know we were at war.

90
00:07:39.714 --> 00:07:41.579
We thought we were
fighting Communism...

91
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:45.617
...but in the end, it was all about
who gets what, you know?

92
00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:48.847
Lvory, oil, gold:

93
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.554
Diamonds.

94
00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:57.765
So one day I decided,
"Fuck it," you know?

95
00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:59.957
"I'm gonna get mine."

96
00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:01.726
You gonna steal his diamond?

97
00:08:09.243 --> 00:08:12.940
That diamond is my ticket
out of this godforsaken continent.

98
00:08:13.147 --> 00:08:14.978
That doesn't answer the question.

99
00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:29.722
My dad came home
from the war in '69.

100
00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.864
And it took him...

101
00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:37.095
...about 20 years to get right.

102
00:08:38.973 --> 00:08:40.270
What?

103
00:08:43.144 --> 00:08:47.444
You Americans love to talk
about your feelings, huh?

104
00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:49.879
So, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

105
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:52.178
- Got a thing for messed-up vets now?
- Shut up.

106
00:08:54.188 --> 00:08:55.655
You lost both your parents.

107
00:08:56.557 --> 00:08:59.390
That's a polite way
of putting it, yeah.

108
00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:04.361
Mom was raped and shot...

109
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:10.295
...and Dad was decapitated
and hung from a hook in the barn.

110
00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:13.568
I was 9.

111
00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:18.770
Boohoo, right?

112
00:09:22.517 --> 00:09:24.644
Sometimes I wonder...

113
00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:30.815
...will God ever forgive us
for what we've done to each other?

114
00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:37.329
Then I look around and I realize...

115
00:09:38.232 --> 00:09:41.690
...God left this place a long time ago.

116
00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:50.434
It's...

117
00:09:52.713 --> 00:09:54.647
What's the point, huh?

118
00:10:38.092 --> 00:10:40.117
Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?

119
00:10:40.294 --> 00:10:42.057
- What?
- Drive at them. They'll panic.

120
00:10:42.229 --> 00:10:44.493
Do you know where the word
"infantry" comes from?

121
00:10:44.665 --> 00:10:47.964
It means "child soldier."
They are just children.

122
00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:51.798
- Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!
- Hi. Hello. Hello.

123
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.098
Hello, little brothers.

124
00:10:54.275 --> 00:10:56.800
- RUF on the road!
- Yeah, yeah. What is your names?

125
00:10:57.311 --> 00:10:59.609
I'm Dead Body.
Who is this motherfucker?

126
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.441
We are teachers on our way to Kono.

127
00:11:01.616 --> 00:11:03.846
Only RUF on the road.

128
00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:05.952
- RUF only!
- Yes, yes, I understand that.

129
00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:07.484
- Only RUF!
- But son, this is...

130
00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:11.349
Don't move! Don't move! Fuck.

131
00:11:13.594 --> 00:11:16.927
Jesus Christ! Maddy, press your hand
against the exit wound there, huh?

132
00:11:17.098 --> 00:11:19.396
- Got it.
- Keep it there, huh?

133
00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:21.330
Whatever you do,
don't talk, all right?

134
00:11:21.502 --> 00:11:23.333
Is there any wine left in that jug?

135
00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:25.369
- Here.
- Pour it all over everything, huh?

136
00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:29.842
The colonel's gonna have a medic
at the airstrip in Kono.

137
00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:33.003
- How far is it?
- You said not to talk.

138
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.474
A comedian, huh?

139
00:11:48.663 --> 00:11:51.063
- How's his pulse?
- I can feel it sometimes.

140
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:04.478
- Hold it right there.
- Stop.

141
00:12:04.645 --> 00:12:05.873
Papers, please.

142
00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:11.279
Excuse me.

143
00:12:11.452 --> 00:12:14.387
I was just trying
to keep pressure on the wound.

144
00:12:14.555 --> 00:12:17.080
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- You'll be all right, huh?

145
00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:19.055
Will you?

146
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.752
I'll check on him in the tent
in a little bit. Thank you.

147
00:12:22.997 --> 00:12:24.328
Hey.

148
00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:26.856
Look who's alive, eh?

149
00:12:27.034 --> 00:12:28.365
I told the H you'd be back.

150
00:12:30.337 --> 00:12:33.272
I'm afraid we're evacuating
all non-military personnel, miss.

151
00:12:33.441 --> 00:12:35.272
Transport touches down at 1600.

152
00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:37.206
She's with me, all right?

153
00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:41.074
No exceptions, pal. This is gonna be ugly.
Colonel doesn't want an audience.

154
00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:44.046
Is I.R.'s presence here
known to other African nations?

155
00:12:45.553 --> 00:12:47.578
- She's with you?
- Yeah.

156
00:12:48.723 --> 00:12:50.588
Come on. The colonel's this way.

157
00:12:50.758 --> 00:12:52.589
Give me a minute, huh?

158
00:12:55.763 --> 00:12:58.288
We block their escape
by blowing the bridge.

159
00:12:59.934 --> 00:13:01.629
That's correct.

160
00:13:02.369 --> 00:13:04.667
You made it out. Well done.

161
00:13:04.872 --> 00:13:06.806
Negative, Kilo Foxtrot, stand by.

162
00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:11.138
- Colonel, sir.
- So must be real, then.

163
00:13:12.313 --> 00:13:13.507
The pink.

164
00:13:14.014 --> 00:13:16.608
Well, you're part
of this operation now.

165
00:13:16.784 --> 00:13:20.276
First we snuff everything that moves
out there, then we find your diamond.

166
00:13:20.454 --> 00:13:22.081
Colonel?

167
00:13:22.623 --> 00:13:25.057
Go get kitted. Yes?

168
00:13:31.365 --> 00:13:33.356
Move, move, move!

169
00:13:33.567 --> 00:13:36.832
- Go get your kit.
- Will do, chum. Will do.

170
00:13:40.374 --> 00:13:43.537
It's go time, all right?
Meet me behind the tents.

171
00:13:46.647 --> 00:13:48.342
How's Benjamin?

172
00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:49.983
They say he'll live.

173
00:13:51.318 --> 00:13:52.580
Good. Good.

174
00:13:59.994 --> 00:14:01.791
Listen, Maddy...

175
00:14:03.197 --> 00:14:04.960
...I need you to do me one last favor.

176
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.365
Yeah?

177
00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:10.997
Tell that guard
you wanna put him...

178
00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:13.834
...on the cover of <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>
magazine for me.

179
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.108
You're going in.

180
00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.783
You and Solomon.

181
00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:30.946
You're going in now.

182
00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:33.987
Your plane leaves
in a few minutes, huh?

183
00:14:36.597 --> 00:14:38.565
You're an idiot.

184
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.737
- What if I wanted to go in with you?
- I'd say no.

185
00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:47.897
- What if I insist?
- I'd insist back.

186
00:14:54.014 --> 00:14:55.208
It's my story.

187
00:14:55.382 --> 00:14:58.783
Your story is Van De Kaap, all right?
That stone is mine.

188
00:14:58.953 --> 00:15:02.389
I'm not leaving here without it,
you understand?

189
00:15:03.858 --> 00:15:06.725
Please, just give me two minutes.

190
00:15:23.477 --> 00:15:24.876
Yeah.

191
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.885
- Hello.
- Hi.

192
00:15:38.058 --> 00:15:41.289
My name is Maddy Bowen.
I'm with <i>Vital Affairs</i> magazine.

193
00:15:41.462 --> 00:15:43.930
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

194
00:15:44.098 --> 00:15:45.622
Well, that depends what they are.

195
00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:49.758
Oh, I see you're familiar
with our devious ways, aren't you?

196
00:15:50.504 --> 00:15:52.404
Okay, so I'll start
with something simple.

197
00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:07.681
And before that you were with
the South African Defense...?

198
00:16:07.855 --> 00:16:09.516
- Defense Force, correct.
- Of course.

199
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.126
And was that with Colonel Coetzee?
Were you in Angola?

200
00:16:13.294 --> 00:16:14.818
Angola, yeah.

201
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.399
That is all I really need to know.
Thank you so much.

202
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.067
- Thank you.
- Okay.

203
00:16:31.078 --> 00:16:32.477
Thank you, huh?

204
00:16:32.646 --> 00:16:35.080
Just keeping my end of the deal.

205
00:16:35.683 --> 00:16:36.980
Good luck to you, Solomon.

206
00:16:37.284 --> 00:16:38.774
Okay.

207
00:16:39.954 --> 00:16:43.788
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- Thank you for all you have done.

208
00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:53.825
- Listen, l...
- No, you listen.

209
00:16:58.439 --> 00:17:00.339
In another life maybe, all right?

210
00:17:01.775 --> 00:17:03.606
Yeah. Sure.

211
00:17:03.777 --> 00:17:05.142
Yeah.

212
00:17:09.483 --> 00:17:11.610
You find yourself a good man,
all right, Maddy?

213
00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:20.584
You know, I've got three sisters.

214
00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:23.389
They're all married to good men.

215
00:17:25.265 --> 00:17:26.323
I prefer my life.

216
00:17:28.969 --> 00:17:33.429
Here is my office phone...

217
00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:35.973
...home phone, cell phone.

218
00:17:38.078 --> 00:17:41.241
I'm used to being pursued,
but what the heck.

219
00:17:52.426 --> 00:17:54.553
You better get on that plane, huh?

220
00:17:56.296 --> 00:17:58.196
You should get on that plane.

221
00:18:06.373 --> 00:18:08.170
So should you.

222
00:18:14.648 --> 00:18:15.774
You gonna call me?

223
00:18:19.586 --> 00:18:21.076
Soon as I'm near a phone, yeah.

224
00:18:22.022 --> 00:18:24.388
Yeah, right.

225
00:18:46.213 --> 00:18:49.478
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

226
00:18:54.054 --> 00:18:55.646
Oh, shit.

227
00:18:55.923 --> 00:18:58.653
Nabil? Yeah, I'll call you
when we get closer, all right?

228
00:18:58.826 --> 00:19:01.420
You keep me posted. Right.

229
00:19:01.595 --> 00:19:05.395
All right. I set the pace, huh?
Two-hour marches, five-minute breaks.

230
00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:09.400
If I hold my hand up like this, you stop.
If I point to the dirt, you lie flat.

231
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.131
If I say go, you move like your life
depended on it. Understood?

232
00:19:13.307 --> 00:19:15.969
- Yes, boss.
- Come on.

233
00:19:26.253 --> 00:19:27.914
Tell me about the stone.

234
00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:30.716
Is it clear or is it milky?

235
00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:32.415
Clear.

236
00:19:32.593 --> 00:19:34.993
And the color, is it strong?

237
00:19:35.162 --> 00:19:36.390
Does it hold the light?

238
00:19:36.563 --> 00:19:38.622
It is as you say.

239
00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:42.229
- About the size of a bird's egg?
- Yes.

240
00:19:42.402 --> 00:19:46.566
One hundred carats.
Come on, let's pick up the pace.

241
00:20:28.148 --> 00:20:29.513
Dia!

242
00:20:31.418 --> 00:20:33.386
Stop the truck!

243
00:20:34.154 --> 00:20:35.849
I thought it was Dia.

244
00:21:29.776 --> 00:21:31.334
Wake up.

245
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.274
Don't worry, they're gone, huh?

246
00:21:37.618 --> 00:21:40.746
You know, I once had this buddy...

247
00:21:40.921 --> 00:21:42.786
...named Mabhoko.

248
00:21:43.557 --> 00:21:46.788
We used to hunt bush meat
together as kids, huh?

249
00:21:47.594 --> 00:21:48.959
Baboons.

250
00:21:49.129 --> 00:21:51.996
Baboons, they were
the hardest to catch. They're...

251
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.431
They're cunning.

252
00:21:54.601 --> 00:21:56.694
Cunning creatures.

253
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.598
Fast, strong.

254
00:21:59.773 --> 00:22:02.003
Got good eyesight.

255
00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:06.536
We would always find them
by the smell of their shit.

256
00:22:06.713 --> 00:22:11.844
And that's how we learned to track
your black terrorists in Angola, huh?

257
00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:17.355
By the smell of your shit.

258
00:22:18.392 --> 00:22:19.859
It's not...

259
00:22:20.027 --> 00:22:22.757
It's not the same as a baboon's.

260
00:22:24.998 --> 00:22:28.559
But, you know, after you skin it...

261
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.100
...the flesh of a baboon...

262
00:22:32.372 --> 00:22:34.772
...isn't that much different
than a man's, you know.

263
00:22:38.178 --> 00:22:42.114
I'll tell you, I can track anything.

264
00:22:54.361 --> 00:22:56.522
You risk my life like that again...

265
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:04.029
...and I'll peel your face
back off your head.

266
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.804
Do you understand?

267
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.109
Make us a fire.

268
00:24:29.489 --> 00:24:31.081
What'd he say?

269
00:24:31.258 --> 00:24:33.385
We are going the right way.

270
00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:43.264
Hold up there, my man.
It's this way, huh?

271
00:24:44.738 --> 00:24:46.933
Where do you think you are going?

272
00:24:48.608 --> 00:24:50.269
Stop!

273
00:24:50.544 --> 00:24:52.239
I said, stop!

274
00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:54.237
He is not down there, all right?

275
00:24:56.283 --> 00:24:59.946
All right. You're gonna need
some of that old discipline, huh?

276
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.384
Now you listen here, my boy,
and you listen well.

277
00:25:02.556 --> 00:25:04.524
You are not going down there.
Are we clear?

278
00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:06.318
You are not the master.

279
00:25:06.493 --> 00:25:10.122
Right now, that is exactly what I am,
and you'd better remember it, Kaffir!

280
00:25:25.278 --> 00:25:26.609
Don't you fucking move, huh?

281
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.748
Don't you move. Don't you move, huh?

282
00:25:28.915 --> 00:25:31.247
- My son is there!
- Your son is gone!

283
00:25:31.418 --> 00:25:32.749
- He is alive!
- He's gone!

284
00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:35.479
He's alive! He's there
with those crazy people!

285
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.126
I am his father! His father!
I should have protected him!

286
00:25:40.594 --> 00:25:44.496
I must go find him.
I cannot live without knowing!

287
00:25:44.664 --> 00:25:46.894
Shoot me if you want, but I'm going.

288
00:25:49.002 --> 00:25:52.460
Why should it matter,
I'm dead already.

289
00:26:00.313 --> 00:26:02.577
We wait until dark, huh?

290
00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:33.144
Are you satisfied?

291
00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:38.641
All right, come on.

292
00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.585
- <i>is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

293
00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:48.819
<i>RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone</i>

294
00:26:48.995 --> 00:26:51.930
<i>Go tell my parents</i>
<i>They may see me no more</i>

295
00:26:52.098 --> 00:26:55.158
<i>In the battlefield</i>
<i>We're fighting forever</i>

296
00:26:55.335 --> 00:26:58.236
<i>Go tell my parents</i>
<i>They may see me no more</i>

297
00:26:58.405 --> 00:26:59.872
<i>In the battlefield...</i>

298
00:27:02.442 --> 00:27:04.410
You are how old?

299
00:27:04.578 --> 00:27:06.341
Me? I'm 31.

300
00:27:06.513 --> 00:27:08.674
And you have no wife?

301
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:12.016
- No.
- No children?

302
00:27:13.186 --> 00:27:14.483
No.

303
00:27:14.654 --> 00:27:16.281
And no home?

304
00:27:16.456 --> 00:27:18.117
No.

305
00:27:18.825 --> 00:27:21.225
But you have money, yes?

306
00:27:21.394 --> 00:27:23.658
Yeah, some.

307
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.821
But not enough?

308
00:27:28.335 --> 00:27:29.893
No.

309
00:27:30.637 --> 00:27:35.131
If you get this diamond,
you will have enough money, yes?

310
00:27:37.277 --> 00:27:38.301
Yes.

311
00:27:38.478 --> 00:27:41.276
Then you will get
a wife and children?

312
00:27:41.448 --> 00:27:42.847
Probably not, no.

313
00:27:44.918 --> 00:27:45.907
What?

314
00:27:48.021 --> 00:27:49.545
What?

315
00:27:49.956 --> 00:27:52.015
I am confused.

316
00:27:53.093 --> 00:27:54.560
Yeah?

317
00:27:54.728 --> 00:27:57.526
That makes two of us, my <i>bru.</i>

318
00:28:00.033 --> 00:28:03.525
Oh, Christ.
I've gotta quit smoking, huh?

319
00:28:04.137 --> 00:28:06.105
Why don't you?

320
00:28:06.373 --> 00:28:08.773
I'll tell you what, Solomon.

321
00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:13.570
You find me this diamond,
and I'll quit right then and there, huh?

322
00:28:20.987 --> 00:28:23.979
- You were born in Zimbabwe?
- Oh, yeah.

323
00:28:24.157 --> 00:28:27.320
- Is it beautiful there?
- Sure you're not a reporter?

324
00:28:27.727 --> 00:28:31.185
Because you ask a hell of a lot
of questions, my man.

325
00:28:38.838 --> 00:28:42.535
My grandfather told
many stories of war.

326
00:28:42.776 --> 00:28:45.609
How the Mende fought the Temne.

327
00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:49.510
Or how two tribes would fight
when somebody had stolen a woman.

328
00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:02.959
I understand white people
want our diamonds, yes?

329
00:29:05.999 --> 00:29:09.730
But how can my own people
do this to each other?

330
00:29:18.011 --> 00:29:20.070
I know good people...

331
00:29:20.246 --> 00:29:23.113
...who say there is something
wrong with us...

332
00:29:23.483 --> 00:29:24.643
...inside our black skin.

333
00:29:24.818 --> 00:29:28.151
That we were better off
when the white man ruled.

334
00:29:30.056 --> 00:29:32.854
But my son is good.

335
00:29:34.427 --> 00:29:36.622
And when he grows up...

336
00:29:36.796 --> 00:29:38.024
...and peace comes...

337
00:29:42.035 --> 00:29:44.697
...this place will be a paradise.

338
00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:55.047
We'll get your son back, huh?

339
00:30:36.756 --> 00:30:39.088
Where is it exactly?

340
00:30:40.627 --> 00:30:43.528
Through the camp, by the river.

341
00:30:48.134 --> 00:30:49.829
Christ.

342
00:30:50.303 --> 00:30:51.930
Okay.

343
00:30:52.572 --> 00:30:54.437
I'm gonna make contact
with the colonel.

344
00:30:54.607 --> 00:30:56.131
He'll send in an air strike.

345
00:30:56.576 --> 00:30:59.545
- What is that?
- A chopper, huh? An attack helicopter.

346
00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:02.237
- We use it as a diversion.
- What if my son is there?

347
00:31:02.415 --> 00:31:03.712
- He isn't.
- How do you know?

348
00:31:03.883 --> 00:31:07.478
I said we do it my way now, all right?
Don't fuck with me.

349
00:31:17.397 --> 00:31:19.797
Cordell, it's Danny.

350
00:31:19.966 --> 00:31:22.298
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up and listen, all right?

351
00:31:22.468 --> 00:31:25.335
You tell the colonel I've found the stone.

352
00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:28.474
No, I haven't got it in my hands,
but I'm oP-ing its location.

353
00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:30.233
It's a major rebel camp, my man.

354
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.776
You tell him to send in the dakadak.

355
00:31:33.346 --> 00:31:36.213
Because I stole a GPS, that's how.

356
00:31:36.382 --> 00:31:38.942
If you shut up and listen,
I could give the coordinates.

357
00:31:39.385 --> 00:31:42.411
Zero-nine-zero-five-four-two-four, north.

358
00:31:42.589 --> 00:31:47.151
Three-two-seven-two-nine
three-zero-five-zero, east.

359
00:31:47.327 --> 00:31:49.591
I'll call back at midnight to confirm.

360
00:31:52.365 --> 00:31:55.300
You can look all night,
my friend, right?

361
00:31:55.468 --> 00:31:58.130
I promise you he is not there.

362
00:32:03.376 --> 00:32:05.571
They're coming in the morning, all right?

363
00:32:05.745 --> 00:32:08.179
No movement, my friend. You stay still.

364
00:32:10.116 --> 00:32:12.550
When it gets dark,
then we move in closer.

365
00:32:34.707 --> 00:32:37.699
Solomon. Shit.

366
00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:49.887
I can do it.

367
00:32:50.056 --> 00:32:51.148
- Help me.
- Help him.

368
00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:53.383
Thank you, Papa.

369
00:33:35.335 --> 00:33:37.565
Hey, you smell.

370
00:33:38.771 --> 00:33:40.238
That's fine.

371
00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:54.520
- Ready? I'm winning.
- Okay, let's go.

372
00:33:54.687 --> 00:33:56.348
Play, man.

373
00:33:57.924 --> 00:34:00.825
- Play. Play the card.
- Play.

374
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.746
Dia.

375
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:33.486
Leave me alone.

376
00:34:34.527 --> 00:34:37.758
- Dia. I'm your papa. Come with me.
- Hey.

377
00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:39.659
- Dia.
- Get away from me.

378
00:34:39.832 --> 00:34:41.629
- Dia. Dia!
- I do not know you. Traitor!

379
00:34:42.001 --> 00:34:44.492
- Enemy! Enemy!
- What the hell are you doing?

380
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.898
- What are you doing?
- I don't know you!

381
00:34:46.072 --> 00:34:47.369
- What's wrong?
- I hate you!

382
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.269
- Dia, come with me!
- I hate you!

383
00:34:49.442 --> 00:34:50.966
Get away from me!

384
00:34:53.446 --> 00:34:55.311
- Get him!
- Don't shoot!

385
00:34:55.815 --> 00:34:58.045
- Don't shoot! Don't...! Don't shoot!
- I hate you!

386
00:34:58.217 --> 00:35:00.117
- Fisherman! Traitor!
- Don't shoot!

387
00:35:00.286 --> 00:35:02.516
Get away from me!

388
00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:11.790
I knew you would come back.

389
00:35:12.265 --> 00:35:15.757
I have dug and dug and dug,
but I've found nothing.

390
00:35:15.935 --> 00:35:17.835
Nothing.

391
00:35:18.104 --> 00:35:19.594
Dig, dig, dig!

392
00:35:19.772 --> 00:35:22.070
You will find it for me.

393
00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:25.340
You will dig up
what you have come back for.

394
00:35:25.511 --> 00:35:26.535
No.

395
00:35:26.712 --> 00:35:29.146
Why should the diamond
go to the foreign devils?

396
00:35:29.882 --> 00:35:33.147
We will use it
to make the country strong.

397
00:35:33.619 --> 00:35:36.213
RUF is fighting for the people!

398
00:35:38.558 --> 00:35:41.652
RUF is fighting for Sierra Leone!

399
00:35:44.497 --> 00:35:46.226
Pick it up.

400
00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:50.402
Why? You are going to kill me anyway.

401
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.664
I do not need to kill you,
Solomon Vandy.

402
00:35:56.509 --> 00:35:58.704
If you do not bring me the diamond...

403
00:35:58.878 --> 00:36:01.108
...I will find the rest of your family.

404
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.714
Just as I have found your son.

405
00:36:04.817 --> 00:36:08.184
I will rape your wife
in front of your eyes...

406
00:36:08.988 --> 00:36:11.286
...slit her throat...

407
00:36:11.891 --> 00:36:14.257
...and I will keep your daughters
for myself.

408
00:36:19.665 --> 00:36:22.099
You think I am a devil...

409
00:36:22.268 --> 00:36:24.600
...but only because I have lived in hell.

410
00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:28.901
I want to get out.

411
00:36:29.509 --> 00:36:31.602
You will help me.

412
00:36:34.447 --> 00:36:35.744
I don't remember.

413
00:36:35.915 --> 00:36:38.884
Find it or your family will die!

414
00:36:39.819 --> 00:36:41.684
Now pick it up!

415
00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:58.669
- Go!
- Bastards!

416
00:36:58.838 --> 00:37:00.203
Shoot it!

417
00:37:05.178 --> 00:37:06.167
Dia!

418
00:37:18.257 --> 00:37:20.452
Come, boy. Come. This way. This way.

419
00:37:21.327 --> 00:37:22.555
Dia!

420
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:47.043
<i>Colonel, we think Archer's there.</i>

421
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.053
I don't give a damn who's down there.
Kill them all.

422
00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:01.661
Dia!

423
00:38:16.415 --> 00:38:17.712
I'm coming!

424
00:38:21.254 --> 00:38:22.915
- Dia!
- Bastard!

425
00:38:46.078 --> 00:38:47.443
No!

426
00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:08.864
Dia!

427
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:18.036
- We found his digger, sir.
- Keep him close.

428
00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:22.200
- Danny boy.
- Colonel.

429
00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:25.742
- Thanks for calling it in.
- Yeah, yeah. Always happy to help, huh?

430
00:40:25.911 --> 00:40:29.244
So where is it? The stone?

431
00:40:29.415 --> 00:40:31.349
We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?

432
00:40:31.517 --> 00:40:33.144
Look around you, Danny boy.

433
00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:36.288
You're not in a position
to be dictating terms.

434
00:40:36.455 --> 00:40:38.548
Then you will never find it, sir.

435
00:40:38.724 --> 00:40:40.351
That's correct.

436
00:40:42.027 --> 00:40:44.655
- But he will.
- Come. Up.

437
00:40:46.298 --> 00:40:48.528
Introduce me to your digger.

438
00:40:50.102 --> 00:40:51.763
Solomon Vandy.

439
00:40:51.937 --> 00:40:54.098
This is Colonel Coetzee.
He wants the diamond.

440
00:40:54.273 --> 00:40:57.299
- No more than you.
- Fuck.

441
00:40:57.476 --> 00:40:59.467
You gonna show us where it's hidden?

442
00:41:02.148 --> 00:41:03.843
Does he speak English?

443
00:41:04.016 --> 00:41:07.042
He will only tell me, sir.
I promise you that.

444
00:41:07.887 --> 00:41:10.947
- Let me talk to him, huh?
- Go on.

445
00:41:17.696 --> 00:41:20.062
All right, my friend.

446
00:41:20.232 --> 00:41:22.166
End of the line here, huh?

447
00:41:22.334 --> 00:41:25.599
- You just tell him where it is, all right?
- I do not trust him.

448
00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:29.207
I don't trust him either,
but we haven't got much of a choice here.

449
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:34.038
I promise you
he will shoot us both in the head.

450
00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.244
Right, tell him, huh?
Tell him where it is, huh?

451
00:41:37.416 --> 00:41:40.010
- Go on. Come on.
- I'm not feeling the love, Danny.

452
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.053
All right.
No more messing about, all right?

453
00:41:44.223 --> 00:41:47.215
I said tell him where it is!
Tell him where it is! Now!

454
00:41:47.393 --> 00:41:49.054
Tell him!

455
00:41:50.229 --> 00:41:52.026
- No.
- Fucking...

456
00:41:52.198 --> 00:41:54.894
Danny, there are other ways
to do this, okay?

457
00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:56.694
Yeah, yeah.

458
00:42:04.877 --> 00:42:07.869
- If he tells us, do we have a deal, sir?
- Seventy-thirty.

459
00:42:08.047 --> 00:42:10.447
Sixty-forty. I've already lined up a buyer.

460
00:42:10.616 --> 00:42:12.277
Agreed.

461
00:42:17.456 --> 00:42:19.014
Come here.

462
00:42:21.594 --> 00:42:25.030
This is his son. Vandy will do
whatever you want for his sake, all right?

463
00:42:25.197 --> 00:42:29.964
Danny, you're a pisser, man. Well done.
Boys, we move out.

464
00:42:32.738 --> 00:42:35.036
What do you say, Mr. Vandy?

465
00:42:35.508 --> 00:42:38.409
- You ready to take a walk?
- Come on.

466
00:42:44.683 --> 00:42:46.275
Come on.

467
00:42:59.231 --> 00:43:02.325
So who's the buyer?
I'm guessing London.

468
00:43:02.535 --> 00:43:05.800
Well, they no longer accept
conflict diamonds, huh?

469
00:43:05.971 --> 00:43:08.439
Wouldn't hurt to interest
some other parties.

470
00:43:08.974 --> 00:43:11.966
- Start a bidding war.
- What, one war's not enough for you, huh?

471
00:43:12.912 --> 00:43:14.607
I missed you, Danny.

472
00:43:14.914 --> 00:43:19.078
See? It is here.
He has tried to find it.

473
00:43:19.251 --> 00:43:21.947
All right, Mr. Vandy.
Time for you to start digging.

474
00:43:37.002 --> 00:43:39.266
Hey, <i>boet,</i> have you got a smoke?

475
00:43:39.738 --> 00:43:41.638
Smoking will kill you.

476
00:43:42.408 --> 00:43:43.898
Sorry.

477
00:43:46.979 --> 00:43:48.879
It's all right.

478
00:43:49.048 --> 00:43:51.175
Time I quit smoking anyway,
huh, Solomon?

479
00:44:05.698 --> 00:44:07.029
- It's gone.
- What?

480
00:44:07.199 --> 00:44:09.292
Someone has taken it.

481
00:44:10.402 --> 00:44:14.168
This is where I buried it.
It isn't here.

482
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.007
Well, then there's no reason
for any of you to stay alive. Is there?

483
00:44:22.348 --> 00:44:24.009
Wait, wait, wait.

484
00:44:24.183 --> 00:44:26.413
I know, I know. I know where it is.

485
00:44:26.885 --> 00:44:28.876
- I know where it is.
- It better be there.

486
00:44:34.059 --> 00:44:35.048
Yes.

487
00:44:35.227 --> 00:44:38.594
Oh, here, here.
It is here.

488
00:44:38.764 --> 00:44:40.425
- Yeah? Yeah, there it is.
- Yes.

489
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.999
Fuck!

490
00:45:01.654 --> 00:45:03.588
TIA, huh, Danny?

491
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:06.582
TIA.

492
00:45:13.499 --> 00:45:16.957
Keep digging, huh?
They'll be here any second. Come on.

493
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:20.433
Keep digging.

494
00:45:33.285 --> 00:45:36.015
- It had better be there, huh?
- Yes, yes.

495
00:45:39.058 --> 00:45:40.650
Have you got it?

496
00:45:42.094 --> 00:45:45.359
- Have you got it, huh?
- Yes, got it. Oh, yes.

497
00:45:46.799 --> 00:45:48.061
Oh, yes.

498
00:45:50.235 --> 00:45:51.827
Solomon.

499
00:45:58.644 --> 00:46:01.613
Dia, what are you doing?

500
00:46:02.114 --> 00:46:03.604
Dia.

501
00:46:05.951 --> 00:46:07.851
What are you doing?

502
00:46:12.725 --> 00:46:14.022
Of the proud Mende tribe.

503
00:46:19.965 --> 00:46:24.834
You are a good boy
who loves soccer and school.

504
00:46:27.139 --> 00:46:30.267
Your mother loves you so much.

505
00:46:32.711 --> 00:46:35.509
She waits by the fire making plantains...

506
00:46:35.681 --> 00:46:38.343
...and red palm oil stew
with your sister N'Yanda...

507
00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:42.883
...and the new baby.

508
00:46:51.797 --> 00:46:54.061
The cows wait for you.

509
00:46:54.233 --> 00:47:00.035
And Babu, the wild dog
who minds no one but you.

510
00:47:02.608 --> 00:47:05.941
I know they made you do bad things...

511
00:47:06.111 --> 00:47:08.579
...but you are not a bad boy.

512
00:47:11.784 --> 00:47:14.184
I am your father...

513
00:47:15.888 --> 00:47:18.186
...who loves you.

514
00:47:19.458 --> 00:47:23.224
And you will come home with me
and be my son again.

515
00:47:48.654 --> 00:47:51.020
Solomon, we've got to move, huh?

516
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.748
We've got to...

517
00:47:55.928 --> 00:47:58.624
Go, go! Move!

518
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.958
Move. Move.

519
00:48:03.135 --> 00:48:04.432
Move, move, move!

520
00:48:04.603 --> 00:48:07.629
Move! Move! Move!

521
00:48:09.241 --> 00:48:10.469
How far?

522
00:48:10.642 --> 00:48:12.701
There's an airstrip
at the top of that gorge.

523
00:48:12.878 --> 00:48:14.971
A plane will meet us, huh?

524
00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.746
Hey, stop. Stop.

525
00:48:20.018 --> 00:48:24.011
Give it to me.
Come on, give it to me, huh?

526
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:34.590
Keep moving. They'll be tracking us.

527
00:48:40.906 --> 00:48:42.965
Nabil, where are you?

528
00:48:44.042 --> 00:48:46.670
I'm nearly there.
Tell me what's happening.

529
00:48:46.845 --> 00:48:50.303
We're about 10 K's out, huh?
We've got it, my friend.

530
00:48:50.482 --> 00:48:52.382
- <i>Who is we?</i>
- The fisherman and his son.

531
00:48:52.551 --> 00:48:54.143
<i>Lose them.</i>

532
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.393
It's at the top of that ridge there, huh?

533
00:49:10.569 --> 00:49:11.866
You must stop and rest.

534
00:49:12.037 --> 00:49:14.870
What? And give up the damn stone?

535
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.099
Keep moving. Come on.

536
00:49:51.743 --> 00:49:54.075
Come. Come, come.

537
00:50:41.193 --> 00:50:43.491
I can't. Stop.

538
00:50:43.662 --> 00:50:45.721
- Okay.
- Stop.

539
00:51:14.192 --> 00:51:15.284
Come on.

540
00:51:15.894 --> 00:51:18.488
No! God, no. Stop.

541
00:51:19.598 --> 00:51:22.931
Christ. No more. No more.

542
00:52:06.878 --> 00:52:08.573
Take it, huh?

543
00:52:10.982 --> 00:52:14.179
- Mr. Archer...
- Take it, take it.

544
00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:23.022
I thought you would steal it from me.

545
00:52:24.863 --> 00:52:28.492
Yeah, yeah, it occurred to me, huh?

546
00:52:39.444 --> 00:52:41.071
Listen...

547
00:52:44.049 --> 00:52:46.449
...this is Maddy's card, huh?

548
00:52:46.618 --> 00:52:48.779
You call her when
you get to Conakry, all right?

549
00:52:53.024 --> 00:52:54.992
And don't trust that pilot for a second.

550
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.220
You point this at his head
if he fucks around, all right?

551
00:52:58.396 --> 00:52:59.863
I can carry you.

552
00:53:12.777 --> 00:53:14.244
You take your boy home, huh?

553
00:53:19.417 --> 00:53:22.079
You take him home, huh?

554
00:53:26.691 --> 00:53:28.454
- Go! Go!
- Go. Come on.

555
00:53:29.294 --> 00:53:30.386
Go on!

556
00:53:36.134 --> 00:53:37.999
Come on. Come on.

557
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:47.175
Archer, you're a dead man!

558
00:53:47.345 --> 00:53:49.176
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:54:19.878 --> 00:54:21.243
Dia.

560
00:54:42.467 --> 00:54:43.627
Hello. Maddy Bowen.

561
00:54:43.868 --> 00:54:45.699
Yeah.

562
00:54:46.037 --> 00:54:47.698
Thought I'd never call, huh?

563
00:54:48.607 --> 00:54:52.668
And I'm so glad you did.
Excuse me.

564
00:54:54.646 --> 00:54:55.806
When am I gonna see you?

565
00:54:56.948 --> 00:55:02.682
Maddy, I want you to do me
one more favor, huh?

566
00:55:03.388 --> 00:55:07.916
I want you to go meet Solomon
in Conakry.

567
00:55:08.126 --> 00:55:10.822
In Guinea?
Why do you want me to go to Guinea?

568
00:55:13.832 --> 00:55:15.891
We found his son...

569
00:55:16.868 --> 00:55:20.269
...but he's gonna need some help,
you understand?

570
00:55:21.039 --> 00:55:22.131
<i>Maddy?</i>

571
00:55:24.943 --> 00:55:26.808
You're hurt.

572
00:55:27.445 --> 00:55:28.503
Are you hurt?

573
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.843
Yeah, well, I've got
a little problem here.

574
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:40.118
Okay. You...
You tell me where you are.

575
00:55:43.395 --> 00:55:44.419
<i>Archer?</i>

576
00:55:56.574 --> 00:56:01.307
I'm looking at an incredible view
right now.

577
00:56:02.714 --> 00:56:04.341
I wish you were here, Maddy.

578
00:56:04.516 --> 00:56:08.179
Okay, then I'm coming to be with you.
You just tell me where you are.

579
00:56:11.389 --> 00:56:12.720
I don't think so.

580
00:56:12.891 --> 00:56:16.224
Are you still in Kono? Because I can
get someone there to help you.

581
00:56:16.394 --> 00:56:20.660
Maddy, you find someplace safe
for the boy, all right?

582
00:56:20.832 --> 00:56:23.232
<i>And keep him out of sight.</i>

583
00:56:23.835 --> 00:56:26.565
<i>And get Solomon to London.</i>

584
00:56:29.708 --> 00:56:32.472
He's bringing something with him.

585
00:56:33.144 --> 00:56:35.078
But he's gonna need your help.

586
00:56:36.314 --> 00:56:38.145
Why aren't you bringing it yourself?

587
00:56:39.651 --> 00:56:44.714
I'm saying it's a real story now.

588
00:56:45.623 --> 00:56:47.352
And you can write the hell out of it.

589
00:56:54.566 --> 00:56:57.091
I'm really happy I met you.

590
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:59.659
You know that?

591
00:57:03.007 --> 00:57:05.134
Yeah, I'm...

592
00:57:06.344 --> 00:57:09.404
I'm really happy I met you too.

593
00:57:10.014 --> 00:57:14.007
<i>And I wish I could be there with you.</i>

594
00:57:14.886 --> 00:57:16.854
That's all right.

595
00:57:19.391 --> 00:57:21.791
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

596
00:58:15.413 --> 00:58:17.745
When we get to the stairs,
you just keep walking...

597
00:58:17.916 --> 00:58:19.941
...and I'll wait for you here.

598
00:58:20.518 --> 00:58:22.042
You're not coming.

599
00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:25.485
I'm not here. Good luck.

600
00:58:47.145 --> 00:58:49.807
You must understand, Mr. Vandy...

601
00:58:49.981 --> 00:58:56.045
...that your diamond could have ended up
nowhere else but with us.

602
00:58:59.357 --> 00:59:02.326
- It is not enough.
- I assure you, 2 million pounds...

603
00:59:02.494 --> 00:59:06.362
...is more than anyone else will offer you
for that stone under the circumstances.

604
00:59:06.531 --> 00:59:09.227
I want what was promised to me
by Mr. Archer.

605
00:59:12.704 --> 00:59:15.229
- What was promised to you?
- My family.

606
00:59:15.573 --> 00:59:17.564
When they are here,
you will get the stone.

607
00:59:18.243 --> 00:59:19.870
I will have the money too.

608
00:59:21.179 --> 00:59:22.703
Well, may I see what I'm buying?

609
00:59:22.881 --> 00:59:25.645
You will get the stone
once my family is here.

610
00:59:26.417 --> 00:59:28.214
How do I even know you've got it?

611
01:01:36.114 --> 01:01:38.878
Can you comment on the diamonds
mined in Sierra Leone?

612
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:42.952
I'm not going to comment
on some sensationalist magazine article.

613
01:01:43.121 --> 01:01:45.715
- What about Liberia?
- No comment. No comment.

614
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:48.290
- Mr. Van De Kaap...
- That's all I have to say.

615
01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:49.858
The natural resources
of a country...

616
01:01:51.863 --> 01:01:54.832
...are the property of its people.
They are not ours to steal...

617
01:01:56.167 --> 01:02:01.628
<i>... or exploit in the name of our comfort,</i>
<i>our corporations, or our consumerism.</i>

618
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:13.608
They're ready for you, sir.

619
01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:17.519
The Third World is not a world apart.

620
01:02:17.689 --> 01:02:22.353
And the witness you will hear today
speaks on its behalf.

621
01:02:22.527 --> 01:02:26.395
Let us hear the voice of that world.
Let us learn from that voice.

622
01:02:26.564 --> 01:02:30.091
And let us ignore it no more.

623
01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:33.601
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Solomon Vandy.

624
01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:23.850
