1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:02,352
I thought we'd be all
celebrating and shit.

2
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:05,712
All the shit we've been through.
We're all here,

3
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:07,192
all alive.

4
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:08,672
We made it.

5
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:10,992
I can give you your life back.

6
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:13,712
There's this guy. He took my power.

7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,912
You sold your powers?

8
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:15,952
Yeah, mate.

9
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:17,832
We were given them for a reason.

10
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,552
Do we have to have
the same powers as before?

11
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,512
He said if we've got the money,
we can take our pick.

12
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:25,992
OK, so who's first?

13
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:29,992
You're all such pussies!
I'll do it.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,592
Right. I need to speak to the...

15
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:48,592
cool, mysterious...

16
00:00:48,593 --> 00:00:52,592
power guy. Is he, is he in?

17
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:14,512
What are you doing?

18
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:18,512
Get back in here!

19
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,032
Sorry!

20
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:35,032
Wanker!

21
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,512
What the fuck...

22
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,272
do you think you're doing?

23
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:57,272
Think you can get rid of me?

24
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:58,352
I'm a part of you.

25
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:00,912
Cool power guy with the suits,

26
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,872
he could've sorted
this bullshit out,

27
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,432
but you had to make a big drama!

28
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,952
I won't let you bury me.
I'm staying right here.

29
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:09,272
You're such a whiney little bitch!

30
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:11,192
You hate me, you hate yourself.

31
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:14,752
Nobody loves themselves more than I
do. I'd fuck myself in a heartbeat.

32
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:18,752
So we're back to the whole
"I'm gay" thing there, aren't we?

33
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,832
Why bring that up? I'm not gay.

34
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,232
Remember that time in PE?
In the showers, you got turned on

35
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,432
watching Richard Saunders
soap his balls?

36
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,152
Oh, he's pathetic! He's sad.

37
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:30,712
You thought about it
when screwing the fake vagina

38
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:34,712
you made out of Mum's rubber gloves.

39
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:41,832
You trying to fuck me?

40
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,072
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

41
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:45,232
I am you!

42
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:49,232
You're nothing to do with me!

43
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:53,632
Rudy!

44
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,752
That could've gone
horribly wrong, that.

45
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:11,752
You could have killed us.

46
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:17,272
Shut up whining.

47
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,832
C'mon.

48
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,112
Get in here.

49
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:26,192
Whoa!

50
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:16,272
Argh.

51
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:18,032
You're not going to ask
about me limp?

52
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,752
No.

53
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:23,152
No, of course not!
Cos that would be doing your job.

54
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:25,752
I'm not sure you're cut out
to be a probation worker.

55
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:26,592
Is that right?

56
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:27,632
Yeah.

57
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:30,712
If you're finished
with the careers advice,

58
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:34,712
piss off and pick up some litter
with the other shitheads.

59
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,512
Right.

60
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:45,512
Before all the accusations,

61
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:48,472
recriminations start flying around,

62
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:51,032
before harmony turns to discord,

63
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:54,952
and everyone starts shouting,
jabbing their fingers at each other,

64
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:57,552
I just want to say for the record,
hand on heart,

65
00:06:57,553 --> 00:07:00,592
the other hand on a Bible,

66
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:03,312
that it wasn't absolutely wasn't me

67
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:07,312
who left the big floater
in the toilet back there.

68
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:22,952
These are the designs for an
intercontinental ballistic missile.

69
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:24,592
Yeah, mate.

70
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:26,432
Check out the propulsion system.

71
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:29,552
It's liquid nitrogen. It's wicked.

72
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:31,792
Where did you get them?

73
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,232
I drew them.

74
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,632
You?

75
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:39,072
You honestly expect me
to believe that?

76
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:40,312
You think I nicked them?

77
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:42,392
I fucking drew them.
They're my designs!

78
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:45,392
Get her out of here.

79
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:47,792
Take your hand off me, you prick!

80
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:51,072
I'm a fucking rocket scientist!

81
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:30,592
These new powers are bullshit.

82
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,112
I thought this power would make me
dead clever,

83
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,072
but all I know is
how to design rockets.

84
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:36,072
Guess it does what it says
on the tin.

85
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:38,192
Only there's no tin

86
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:41,832
or instructions. No-one believes
someone like me's a rocket scientist.

87
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,512
You don't exactly look
like a rocket scientist.

88
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:46,752
Maybe I should get some glasses,
to look dead intelligent.

89
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,872
Yeah, that'll do it.

90
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:52,392
Simon?

91
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:56,392
Hey.

92
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,872
Hurry up and put some clothes on.

93
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,872
I said we'd go or a drink.

94
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,552
Has anyone heard from Nathan?

95
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,592
He's in Vegas
with Marnie and Nathan Jr.

96
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,632
They want us to go over
for the weddings.

97
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:23,552
I'll go, if that prick pays
for my flights and my hotel.

98
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,832
He's going to use his power
to cheat money out of the casino.

99
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,992
You don't need to be able
to see the future

100
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:32,032
to know that's going to end badly.

101
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,232
The baby's really cute, though.

102
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,472
I think she's getting broody, mate.
Better knock her up.

103
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:41,472
Garcon!

104
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:44,632
Talking to me?

105
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:47,672
I believe so. It's French.

106
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,392
You're not a fan of the French?

107
00:09:49,393 --> 00:09:50,592
Fair enough.

108
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:54,592
I don't like the cunts either. Can I
have three pints of lager, please?

109
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:00,592
What's wrong?

110
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:01,792
Nothing.

111
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,272
I'm knackered. Can we go?

112
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:05,152
I'll come with you.

113
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,872
Later.

114
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,712
I'm away for a cigarette.

115
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,632
Good for you.

116
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:14,752
I just want you to know, right,

117
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:17,872
out of the two of you,
I like you the best.

118
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:19,312
I mean, she's all right.

119
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:20,912
She's not ugly or anything.

120
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,672
Maybe a six or seven out of ten.

121
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:25,032
So what am I?

122
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,752
I would never disrespect you
like that, or any woman,

123
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,432
but if I absolutely had to,

124
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,752
I'd give you a nine.

125
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:33,192
So, mathematically,

126
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:37,192
as the two most... attractive members
of our Community Service gang,

127
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,312
I believe we are genetically
predisposed to copulate.

128
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,992
Any reputable scientist
would tell you that, love.

129
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:45,432
Well, I'm obviously
incredibly flattered...

130
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,472
Thank you.

131
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:50,632
It's just, I don't find you
even remotely attractive.

132
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,792
I don't believe you.

133
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,392
Why would I lie?

134
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:54,512
I don't know. Why would you lie?

135
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:55,752
I'm not.

136
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:57,272
Not consciously,

137
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:01,272
just subconsciously, you're fucking
crazy about me. Aren't you?

138
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:05,632
To be continued.

139
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:10,032
Thank you.

140
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:12,792
She just totally knocked you back.

141
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:14,832
She's playing hard to get, mate.

142
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,912
She's out of your league.
She's laughing her arse off at you.

143
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,992
You can't go back in there.

144
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:22,272
You're gonna have to...

145
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:26,272
Oh, climb through the window!
Just go. C'mon.

146
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,032
No! You'd love that, wouldn't you?

147
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,232
Why don't I just go home

148
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:34,232
and spend the rest of the night
torturing myself about things I did
when I was like 14?

149
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,912
You mean the thing
with the neighbour's cat?

150
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,512
No!

151
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:42,512
We do not talk about that! Right?

152
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:44,072
Where are you going?

153
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,312
Just fuck the fuck off.

154
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,672
Wait for me outside.

155
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,672
Honestly, you're a miserable prick.

156
00:11:57,553 --> 00:12:01,552
So...

157
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:06,032
I believe you were just saying
how you, uh,

158
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,992
wanted to have sex with me?

159
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:12,992
What's that all about?

160
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,232
Oh!

161
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:21,472
Oh, no, ta, you're all right.

162
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:25,192
I'm genetically predisposed
to get cancer.

163
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,592
I think I'll pass.

164
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,352
If you don't smoke,
why are you out here?

165
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:30,392
I'm sick of all the wankers in there

166
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:32,472
acting like they're
having a good time.

167
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:34,992
So how come you're on
Community Service?

168
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:36,512
What've you done?

169
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:39,792
Oh, c'mon, what's your crime?

170
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:43,112
I was with my boyfriend,
and we got stopped by the police.

171
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,512
He put the drugs he was carrying
in my bag.

172
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:47,952
I saw him, but I didn't
have time to do anything.

173
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,312
You're kidding.

174
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:53,072
No-one's ever going to do
anything like that to me again.

175
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:57,072
People will shit all over you
any chance they get, won't they?

176
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:01,592
I had you all wrong.

177
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:02,632
I thought you were
a shallow little prick.

178
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:05,512
No, it's an act. It's a front.

179
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:09,512
I'm deeply insecure.

180
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,832
Do you want to...

181
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,352
go somewhere, just us?

182
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:19,352
Let's stay here. We're just getting
to know each other, aren't we?

183
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:24,312
We'll talk in there.

184
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,112
Hey.

185
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:32,112
This was great, wasn't it?

186
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,632
What happened?

187
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,752
Ah!

188
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:03,152
You've... you've bottled me!

189
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,672
What are you talking about?

190
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:07,032
This man just bottled me!

191
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,512
I didn't do anything to you!

192
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:09,832
Me face!

193
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:18,312
Am I still, am I still gorgeous?

194
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:23,952
His head's cut up. I'm standing
with a broken bottle.

195
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,672
I don't remember doing anything.

196
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,712
That is definitely some power shit.

197
00:15:27,713 --> 00:15:29,312
What are we going to do?

198
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:32,672
We don't have to do anything. Keep
our heads down and stay out of it.

199
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,032
Cos that always works.

200
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,032
This is the kind of shit where
we need that guy in the mask.

201
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:40,152
Why do we always get involved?

202
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:44,152
Can't we do normal stuff that normal
people do, like... go for brunch?

203
00:15:45,593 --> 00:15:48,232
What the fuck is brunch?

204
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:14,312
Would you like a bacon sandwich?

205
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:18,272
I would like that... very much.

206
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:22,272
Thank you.

207
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:26,152
You've just had unprotected
anal sex with that girl.

208
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,392
I most certainly did.
And she loved it.

209
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:29,592
What if she's got HIV?

210
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:32,472
Cute girls don't get HIV.

211
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:35,392
You need to take her to a clinic,
get her to have some tests,

212
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:36,872
get her a full work-up.

213
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:38,312
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

214
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,872
Do you know
how rare it is to find a girl

215
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:44,472
who genuinely, honest to God,
absolutely loves it up the arse?

216
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:48,032
Urgh.

217
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,312
Can you smell that?

218
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:53,152
That's bacon, gently sizzling
in the pan there.

219
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:55,432
Life doesn't get any better
than this for me!

220
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,792
It's as close to heaven
as I'm gonna get.

221
00:16:57,793 --> 00:17:01,592
If you don't get her
to have those tests, I will.

222
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:05,272
Don't go near her, do you hear me?
She doesn't need to see this shit.

223
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:09,032
I think she does. In fact, I'll go
tell her to stick some more bacon
on,

224
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:12,392
cos that's three for breakfast.

225
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:14,312
You have totally crossed the line!

226
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:16,752
Rudy? Are you OK?

227
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:19,832
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just
washing shit off me cock.

228
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,712
I'm going to tell her everything.

229
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:25,712
All your embarrassing
little secrets.

230
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,032
Who are you talking to?

231
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,552
No-one! Meself.

232
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:32,032
What're you doing in there?

233
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:36,032
Nothing.

234
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:40,152
Rudy!

235
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:43,672
Just a minute! Just a minute, yeah?

236
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:45,352
Ow!

237
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:49,032
Fuck!

238
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:52,112
What happened?

239
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,832
Funny thing. You know how I said
I was washing me cock?

240
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,312
I slipped on the soap
and impaled meself on some scissors!

241
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,152
How mad's that shit?

242
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:06,152
Actually really fucking hurts, like.

243
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,312
So is this like brunch?

244
00:18:11,313 --> 00:18:14,992
Cos it feels like I'm just
eating a bacon sandwich?

245
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,992
Hey. That's him. That's the guy
who said I bottled him.

246
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,352
What are you smiling at?

247
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:23,672
A gentleman never tells.

248
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:26,512
I've just fucked her up the arse!

249
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:30,272
Everything you said?
It was all bullshit!

250
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:31,312
How could you do that to me?

251
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:35,312
But I didn't do it to you...
I did it to her.

252
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:39,312
I'm the arse man.
King of the world!

253
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:44,072
What's she done to him?

254
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:56,232
Are you all right?

255
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,872
You're that crazy barman
who bottled me.

256
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:59,392
I didn't bottle you.

257
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:00,552
It must have been her.

258
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:04,552
Why would she do that?

259
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:35,312
Go!

260
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:54,752
Sorry, I...

261
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:58,392
thought you were someone else.

262
00:19:58,393 --> 00:20:01,792
Did you see a guy run down here?

263
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:05,792
I haven't seen anyone.

264
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:21,552
Sweet.

265
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:27,472
I've got to stop smoking
and doing loads of speed, me.

266
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,352
I thought they had you.

267
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:34,352
No. I got away. I...

268
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:36,952
I did my thing.

269
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:40,952
Ah! If that's some vague reference
to all this "power" bullshit,

270
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:47,272
then don't worry, cos I am
cool and the gang with all that.

271
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:54,752
You're very starey.

272
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,912
Ah, hey!

273
00:20:59,913 --> 00:21:02,512
Whoa, this is cool.

274
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:06,512
Loving that lift. Look at this lift!

275
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:11,752
Brilliant.

276
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,272
So this turning into a girl thing,

277
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:19,152
is it born out of
some sort of sexual confusion?

278
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:22,352
There ain't no sexual confusion.

279
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:23,512
If you say so.

280
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:25,872
They all got their powers before me!
It was all they had left.

281
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:29,192
He's a bit touchy, ain't he?

282
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:31,912
So this girl he turns into...

283
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:34,472
Would you?

284
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:35,832
You know?

285
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,392
Would you... fuck her?

286
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:38,952
We've never seen her.

287
00:21:38,953 --> 00:21:40,712
Oh.

288
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,312
Oh.

289
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,112
I've always wanted me own vagina.

290
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:48,432
Not to keep. Cos I've heard
they require a lot of maintenance.

291
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,912
Upkeep, like cleaning, polishing,

292
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:54,912
things like that.

293
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:11,112
Oh, it's... it's you.

294
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,032
Do you two know each other?

295
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:21,032
We went to the same college.

296
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,992
This has been brilliant... ain't it?

297
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:30,392
Ah, I really have to go, I've got
things... got to do stuff and that.

298
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:33,272
You all right, mate?

299
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:35,392
How does this fucking lift work?

300
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:37,752
Who has a lift in their flat, man?

301
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:39,712
Come on! Piece of shit!

302
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:43,352
Fuck!

303
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:47,352
Nice one.

304
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,112
Why's he here?

305
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:52,072
What's going on?

306
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,912
We were brunching.

307
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:57,912
And then it just kicked off.

308
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:29,672
It's her.

309
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:43,512
Look at it.

310
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:47,512
Look at it!

311
00:23:53,593 --> 00:24:01,312
What are we going to do?

312
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:07,752
Every power known to mankind seems
to be floating out there somewhere.

313
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:09,752
Someone must have it!

314
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:13,752
I don't care how long it takes,
you keep looking until you find it.

315
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,432
And what can I do for you?

316
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,392
There's this girl on the estate.

317
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:30,152
She used a power to make it look
like we trashed a car.

318
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:31,152
The police are after us.

319
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:33,952
And you're telling me because...?

320
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:37,072
I thought you could do something.
Take her power or something.

321
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:38,312
Oh, did you?

322
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:41,112
I'll just find my cape and tights
and get on it.

323
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:43,472
You think this is funny?
D'you see me laughing?

324
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:45,112
I've never seen you smile.

325
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:48,552
You always sit there with a massive
shit-eating grin on your face.

326
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:52,552
Mister Fucking Happy!

327
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:58,072
Look, are you going to do something
about this girl or not?

328
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:01,592
I really don't see that happening.

329
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:03,992
You don't give a shit about anyone,
do you?

330
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:07,992
I give a shit about me.

331
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,632
And just so you know,
this new power?

332
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:11,832
It's rubbish.

333
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,352
But you're a rocket scientist.

334
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:17,232
Yeah, and you're a dick!

335
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:18,472
Come by any time.

336
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:35,872
Little bastards.

337
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:42,752
Which one of you fuckers
took the dog?

338
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:43,992
What dog? Was there even a dog?

339
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:46,312
The charity box, for the blind?

340
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:49,552
The Labrador, Retriever, whatever
the fuck it was. Who nicked it?

341
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:52,032
What? I don't know nothing
about no dog, man.

342
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:56,032
Was there a dog?
Where is there a dog?

343
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:59,792
Who took it?

344
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,672
Right.

345
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:03,312
I really hate to be a grass,

346
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,472
but I did see
that strangely intense girl

347
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:09,912
with slightly inadequate breasts -
she was carrying something heavy

348
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:12,512
and dog-shaped
over to her locker before...

349
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:13,672
Which one?

350
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:17,672
It's number 43.

351
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:23,112
Ow.

352
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,352
Hey.

353
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:44,352
Come here. Mm, come here.

354
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:49,712
The probation worker's
looking for you.

355
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:50,832
And why's that?

356
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,032
Because he seems to be
under the impression

357
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,312
that you've stolen
a dog-shaped charity box,

358
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,912
on account of him having
found it in your locker.

359
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,312
Mm!

360
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:02,672
You fuck with me, I'll fuck you
right back with a cherry on top.

361
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:05,272
You have no idea
what I can do to you.

362
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:08,672
You think you can use
your little power to fi...

363
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:09,912
..ix this.

364
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:13,272
You're too late,
because he's already reported you.

365
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:16,752
And the cops are already coming.

366
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:19,032
You're going down, sweet child.
Don't mess with the assman!

367
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:24,352
You!

368
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:28,352
Office. Now.

369
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:34,552
Control, this is
Charlie-Echo-Two-Three.

370
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:37,952
We've got the suspect, heading back
to station. 15 minutes ETA.

371
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:41,352
'Charlie-Echo-Two-Three, 15 minutes ETA. Please confirm.'

372
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:44,072
Yeah, I can confirm...

373
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:47,632
'Charlie-Echo-Two-Three,
can you confirm?'

374
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:51,632
'Charlie-Echo-Two-Three,
repeat, come in.'

375
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:56,432
'Come in.'

376
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,552
You have to let Alisha know
what she did to you,

377
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:06,952
or you'll never get over it.
You have to confront her.

378
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:10,392
Why d'you need to dig this shit up?
It's old news. I'm over it!

379
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:12,592
You think about her all the time.

380
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:16,312
No. You think about her.

381
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:18,352
It's the same thing.

382
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:21,872
You know what?
I think about loads of things.

383
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:24,352
I think about shagging supermodels.

384
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:26,352
I think about shagging
normal models.

385
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:29,912
I think about how sad it is
that the polar bears are drowning

386
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:32,432
because all the ice is melting.

387
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:35,312
That doesn't mean I have
to do anything about it, though.

388
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,832
Mm?

389
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,872
Now, c'mon. Get in here.

390
00:28:38,873 --> 00:28:41,952
We have beers to drink,
and anuses to violate.

391
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,952
Oh...

392
00:28:56,553 --> 00:28:58,992
Is he fingering her?

393
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:01,992
I think he might be.

394
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:05,992
I'll get them in, hm?

395
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:19,992
That's thirsty work, that.

396
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:24,232
Same again, please.

397
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:26,352
So you're with Alisha, aren't you?

398
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:27,872
That's great, man.

399
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:31,872
I'm with that beautiful,
innocent-looking girl down there.

400
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:35,232
She absolutely loves it up the arse!

401
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:38,232
I know! We're all pussying around,
aren't we?

402
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:39,672
"Should I slip it up there?"

403
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:43,592
"You can't. That's where she
makes her toilet." Turns out...

404
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,632
Come here. Turns out...

405
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:48,032
it's also the way
to a woman's heart.

406
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:50,632
You stick anything up my arse,
I'll break your face.

407
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:53,752
It's just the posh ones.
Just the posh ones. Listen...

408
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:57,032
Just so you know, don't worry
about that girl who screwed with us,

409
00:29:57,033 --> 00:30:01,032
cos your uncle Rudy is all over
it like a motherfuckeeeerrrrr!

410
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:05,432
Oh!

411
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,192
Argh!

412
00:30:07,193 --> 00:30:08,472
Rudy?

413
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,992
Is he having a fit or something?

414
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:12,352
I'm fine. Nothing to see here.

415
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,112
Oh... Hurgh!

416
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,472
Ohh...

417
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:20,272
Right, just so you know,

418
00:30:20,273 --> 00:30:22,912
this doesn't change
how I feel about you,

419
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,032
or the thing with the thing...

420
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:25,952
Um, what the fuck is going on?

421
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:28,592
I can't believe there's two of you!

422
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,192
It's like he came out of
inside of you!

423
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:33,232
What?

424
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,472
You know what you did.

425
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:36,352
What did she do?

426
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:38,312
Let's just go. Come on! Let's go.
Wagons, roll!

427
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:40,392
We had sex together.

428
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:41,752
You had sex with her?

429
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:45,752
Not recently. I don't even
remember it. So many fannies, right?

430
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,832
Big ones. Small ones. Hairy ones.

431
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:51,472
Floppy, great, big, flappy fannies...

432
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:54,112
We were at a party.

433
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,752
I'd fancied you for two years.

434
00:30:56,753 --> 00:31:00,752
She took my virginity. It was
the happiest moment of my life.

435
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,952
For me, it was getting a handjob
on the Vortex at Thorpe Park.

436
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:05,932
Can we just go?

437
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:08,752
I told all my friends
I was seeing you, you know.

438
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:11,992
The next day,
you looked right through me.

439
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:15,192
I loved you,
and you wouldn't even look at me.

440
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:16,952
This is piss under the bridge.

441
00:31:16,953 --> 00:31:19,032
I had to watch you going
with all them other boys.

442
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,312
Why are you doing this?

443
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,152
It's drugs. He's on drugs.

444
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:26,232
Do you know
what they used to call you?

445
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:27,872
The Co... The Cockmonster.

446
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:29,592
Just leave it, yeah? Just fuck off.

447
00:31:29,593 --> 00:31:31,872
Why did they call you
The Cockmonster?

448
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,152
You have to ask?

449
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:34,472
I tried to kill myself!

450
00:31:34,473 --> 00:31:36,792
Oi! You shut your fucking mouth!

451
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:38,352
I wanted to die because of you.

452
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:39,712
Ohh...

453
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:43,712
It's not my fault you're so messed
up that you tried to kill yourself.

454
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:48,392
Fuck you, and your sad little
fantasies! This is bullshit!

455
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:52,392
You're denying it happened...
you're doing it again.

456
00:31:59,673 --> 00:32:05,072
Last orders.

457
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:23,912
I'm not that person any more.

458
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:26,432
I know.

459
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:28,312
I never wanted you to hear
those things about me...

460
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,392
It doesn't matter...

461
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,432
It doesn't matter that
your girlfriend

462
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:36,432
used to be called
"the cock-monster"?

463
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,912
We've all got a past.
I've got two pasts.

464
00:32:42,953 --> 00:32:46,952
All that matters is us, here... now.

465
00:32:55,193 --> 00:32:59,192
Do you know what they used
to call me at school...?

466
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:05,552
The pussy meister.

467
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:06,752
Shut up!

468
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:10,472
I was getting so much pussy,
I didn't know what to do with it.

469
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:13,592
Just loads of pussy, everywhere...

470
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:17,592
Will you stop saying "pussy"?!

471
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,152
How have you got in here...?

472
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:57,312
Broke a window.

473
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:05,152
D'you know, this isn't working out
for either of us.

474
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:10,592
I think we should stay split.

475
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:12,712
Per-Permanently...?

476
00:34:12,713 --> 00:34:15,032
Why not? You've had
your moment in the sun.

477
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:19,032
You've got it all off your chest.
Consider me humiliated.

478
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:26,032
You're your own man now. We can go
our separate ways. Separate lives.

479
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:30,032
We don't need to see each other
ever again. What d'you say?

480
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,912
You could move to Wales,

481
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:37,152
I've no fucking intention
of going there!

482
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:39,832
So you can walk around like
you're happy all the time?

483
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,192
It works for me.

484
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:44,912
I don't need you turning up
every time I feel down,

485
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:47,592
reminding me of everything that
makes me feel shit about myself.

486
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,672
But it's a part of who you are...

487
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:53,672
No. It's a part of who you are.
All this fighting, arguing.

488
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:57,632
Nobody wants to get stabbed in the
shoulder with a pair of scissors.

489
00:34:57,633 --> 00:35:01,632
It's not cool, and it hurts.

490
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:06,592
C'mon, man.
Let's just stay split.

491
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,112
I'm going to take
your moody silence as a "yes".

492
00:35:19,153 --> 00:35:23,152
Try not to break another window
on your way out.

493
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:47,912
Jesus!

494
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:51,472
I thought you were
at the police station...?

495
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:52,792
The police are going to have

496
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:56,792
a lot more important things to do
than look for me.

497
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:38,232
Oh, Jesus.

498
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:43,192
It wasn't me...

499
00:37:46,553 --> 00:37:49,352
What did you do...?

500
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:53,352
I didn't do anything.

501
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:32,872
Oh!

502
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:36,872
Jesus! Shit!

503
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:40,312
Well, this isn't good, is it?

504
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:42,632
Why's she doing this?

505
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:44,912
I honestly have no idea.

506
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:47,232
I'll find out where she is.

507
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:50,072
Oh, brilliant. We'll just untie
your hands, slip off the noose,

508
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:51,152
and away you go.

509
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:54,912
No... my power! I can put myself
in other people's shoes.

510
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:56,712
See what they see
through their eyes.

511
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:59,112
Do you have to be
wearing their shoes?

512
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:03,112
No. Right. That'd be
ridiculous, wouldn't it?

513
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:14,592
She's writing our suicide notes!

514
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:18,592
Fuck...

515
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,552
You don't have to do this!

516
00:39:23,553 --> 00:39:26,632
Well, someone's going to get
blamed for stabbing Charlie.

517
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:28,632
And it's not going to be me.

518
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:32,512
What if we promise
not to tell anyone...?

519
00:39:32,513 --> 00:39:35,792
But... if this is suicide,

520
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:39,512
how d'you explain our hands
being tied behind our backs?

521
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,992
I'll untie them when you're dead.

522
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,752
Hm. I'm glad you've
thought of everything.

523
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:48,752
Or should I say,
nearly everything?

524
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:50,672
No, you're bluffing.

525
00:39:50,673 --> 00:39:51,832
Am I?

526
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,192
Yeah!

527
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:55,272
I really wouldn't do that
if I were you. It's up to you.

528
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:57,952
Ooh, the irony.

529
00:39:57,953 --> 00:40:00,792
You're gonna kick yourself.

530
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:02,672
What the fuck are you talking about?

531
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:03,792
It's hilarious. It's too funny.

532
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:06,912
What is it?

533
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:07,952
Tell me!

534
00:40:07,953 --> 00:40:11,952
All right. It's this...

535
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:18,712
Rudy!

536
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:19,832
Wrap your legs round me.

537
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:23,192
I'll take your weight! Wrap
your legs around me! Come on!

538
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:25,432
I didn't mean to kill her!

539
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:26,632
You can't hold us...

540
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,672
Just hold on.

541
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:31,792
No point in us both dying.

542
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:34,072
Just hold on!

543
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:35,552
You broke my heart...

544
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:37,112
I know.

545
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:39,512
I lied.

546
00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:42,192
I do remember you.

547
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:45,592
I was a bitch. I didn't care
who I hurt, but I've changed.

548
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:49,512
I'm not that person any more!

549
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,872
I hate myself for
what I did to you.

550
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:53,992
I'm sorry.

551
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,352
That's good enough.

552
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,872
No! Rudy!

553
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:02,832
Rudy! Help!

554
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,792
Somebody help us...!

555
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:38,192
I thought you'd gone to Wales?

556
00:41:45,353 --> 00:41:48,752
I've got to tell you, guys...
I'm kind of freaking out here,

557
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:52,072
all this killing
and burying and dying.

558
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:54,432
Just, I'm outside
my comfort zone.

559
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:58,432
If it makes you feel any better,
we've done a couple of people too.

560
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,552
Shit just happened.

561
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:05,032
You bury 'em,
just get on with your life.

562
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:09,032
I just... keep seeing this image
of her cute little face,

563
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:14,152
she's biting down
on the mattress, there.

564
00:42:14,873 --> 00:42:18,872
She absolutely loved it
up the arse.

565
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:22,872
God rest her beautiful soul.

566
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:27,072
Amen.

567
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:43,712
Well, that could've
gone a lot worse, you know?

568
00:42:43,713 --> 00:42:46,392
For me.

569
00:42:46,393 --> 00:42:47,672
A new day tomorrow.

570
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:50,032
Who knows what it holds
for all of us.

571
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:53,152
Shit...

572
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,032
Just stay cool.

573
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:56,952
Don't get upset,
but this isn't exactly my car.

574
00:42:56,953 --> 00:42:57,672
Whose car is it?

575
00:42:57,673 --> 00:42:59,072
Nicked it off a man with a perm.

576
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:02,152
A man, with a perm.
What's that about?

577
00:43:02,153 --> 00:43:05,352
We can't get caught in no nicked
car. We're all on probation.

578
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:09,352
Maybe they'll let you off
with a warning, love.

579
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:12,712
Honestly, guys...

580
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:16,192
I thought they'd let you off
with a warning.

581
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:29,472
That didn't take you long,
did it? Congratulations.

582
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,992
You haven't changed.

583
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:35,992
That's where you're wrong, because
I've found a new dedication

584
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,512
to ensuring your complete
and total rehabilitation.

585
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,792
I'll get started, right after I've
watched Homes Under the Hammer.

586
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:49,792
Ooh! Can we watch that
with you?

587
00:43:49,873 --> 00:43:53,472
You lot can piss off
and do some work.

588
00:43:53,473 --> 00:43:57,472
Chop chop.

589
00:44:28,113 --> 00:44:29,112
What you doing?

590
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:31,032
Designing a new
propulsion system.

591
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:32,032
Why?

592
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:34,792
Because I'm a fucking
rocket scientist.

593
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:37,992
Ah, are we doing catchphrases?

594
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:41,992
Maybe we could all have one.
Mine could be, "Now you see me,

595
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,712
"Now you see two of me".

596
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:45,192
Why do we need catchphrases?

597
00:44:45,193 --> 00:44:49,192
You know... for when
shit goes down, man.

598
00:44:50,113 --> 00:44:53,272
C'mon. D'you really think we're
going to spend the next seven weeks

599
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,032
ambling around,
picking up litter?

600
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:56,032
He's got a point.

601
00:44:56,033 --> 00:44:58,832
Maybe it'll be different
this time.

602
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,472
Maybe there won't be
any shit going down.

603
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:04,272
Oh, trust me.
There'll be shit.

604
00:45:04,273 --> 00:45:08,272
It's in the air.

605
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:12,472
I can smell it.

606
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:27,152
So do you want to tell me
what's going on?

607
00:45:27,153 --> 00:45:29,872
Why are we following him?
Oh, my God.

608
00:45:29,873 --> 00:45:31,232
You fancy him!

609
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,672
You're Curtis Donovan,
aren't you?

610
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:34,592
So what is there to do
round here?

611
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:35,832
Have you just had a shag?

612
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,072
Something like that.

613
00:45:37,073 --> 00:45:38,872
Who's the lucky girl?

614
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:40,192
You don't know her.

615
00:45:40,193 --> 00:45:42,232
This was the worst sex
I have ever had.

616
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:45,192
When we were together,
was I...?

617
00:45:45,193 --> 00:45:46,712
What? Was I shit?

618
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:49,272
What are you doing?
That's Curtis's locker.

619
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:51,392
It's me, Curtis.

620
00:45:51,393 --> 00:45:53,255
This is how I look
when I'm a girl.

621
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,580
