1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,900
What would happen?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,967
If every human being on earth

3
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,434
Disappeared?

4
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:18,900
At some point in the future,

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,034
This could be the fate

6
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:23,900
Of our planet.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,201
This isn't the story

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,034
Of how we might vanish.

9
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,467
It is the story of what happens

10
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:54,800
To the world we leave behind.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,434
The disappearance of humans

12
00:00:56,434 --> 00:01:01,767
May seem like science fiction,

13
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,234
But eventually,

14
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:06,833
There will come a day like this;

15
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,900
A day when people

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:16,100
No longer walk the earth.

17
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:16,900
it's no great stretch

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,601
To imagine humans disappearing

19
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:20,000
From the face of the earth.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,700
Every generation has its tales

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,134
Of Armageddon or apocalypse.

22
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,401
We're the first generation

23
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,067
That could,

24
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,568
By deliberate actions,

25
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:33,634
Cause its own doom.

26
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,534
What will life be like

27
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:40,134
After people?

28
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,067
We're tantalized by our myths

29
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:48,100
About our own destruction,

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,100
But also tantalized

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,134
By the notion,

32
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,367
"hey, maybe it's the turn

33
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:54,234
Of someone else."

34
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,234
What will they do

35
00:01:55,234 --> 00:02:01,034
If we're gone?

36
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:01,800
What will the earth do

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,568
When I'm gone?

38
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:06,501
It's the most natural question

39
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:14,800
In the world.

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:30,867
Time has run out for man.

41
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:36,100
Our hold on the planet is over.

42
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:44,700
Welcome to earth,

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:57,301
Population zero.

44
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,367
Within hours after we're gone,

45
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:01,501
Lights start going out

46
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:08,501
Around the world.

47
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,401
More than 70 percent of power

48
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:11,800
In the United States

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,967
Is generated by the burning

50
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:17,267
Of fossil fuels.

51
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,100
the plant will only continue

52
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,301
To produce electricity

53
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,401
As long as the fuel

54
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,267
Takes to be consumed.

55
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,501
If there's no one around

56
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,967
To provide the new fuel

57
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,967
Into the generating plant,

58
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,301
Then it'll be quite quick

59
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,501
Before the lights

60
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,534
Start going out in cities

61
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:38,733
All over the world.

62
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:39,733
Nuclear power plants

63
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,700
Are unlikely to melt down.

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,534
The average reactor

65
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:44,568
Holds enough fuel

66
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:47,367
To keep running for two years.

67
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,334
But without humans

68
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:49,467
Consuming the power

69
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,867
Generated by the plant,

70
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,501
The reactors will automatically

71
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,568
Shut down into a safe mode

72
00:03:56,568 --> 00:04:00,867
In as little as two days.

73
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,167
even wind generation

74
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,501
Can't last forever.

75
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,767
The turbines require bearings

76
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:07,601
And lubrication

77
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,401
Of those bearings

78
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,967
In order to keep operating.

79
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:12,668
If there's no one around

80
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:15,334
To maintain the turbines,

81
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:16,134
The electricity

82
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:20,100
Doesn't get produced.

83
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,501
as generating plants go down,

84
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,034
Outages on the power grid

85
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,401
Contribute to a cascade

86
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:29,867
Of failure worldwide.

87
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,434
After a few weeks,

88
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:32,501
The planet is plunged

89
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,967
Into a deep darkness.

90
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:35,334
It has not experienced

91
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,267
Since humans first huddled

92
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:41,334
Around campfires.

93
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,767
Perhaps, the last glow

94
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,134
Of artificial lights on earth

95
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:45,934
Will be seen

96
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:52,467
In the American southwest.

97
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,301
Here, the mighty hover dam

98
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:55,800
Hydropower plant

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Takes little notice

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Of the absence of humans.

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,867
Its source of fuel

102
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,833
Is virtually limitless.

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,234
at hover dam,

104
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:06,401
Our fuel supply

105
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,867
Is actually the water

106
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,800
In the reservoir in Lake Mead

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,767
Behind hover dam,

108
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,167
So as long as there's water

109
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,234
In the reservoir,

110
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,167
This power plant

111
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:22,334
Can keep running.

112
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,568
There's water in the reservoir

113
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:24,934
Keeps supplying the water

114
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:30,134
To the hydro turbine generators.

115
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:31,000
These generators

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,234
Are operating automatically

117
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,467
And that would continue

118
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,100
As long as all of the systems

119
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,234
Are functioning normally.

120
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:43,000
If I and my staff

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,401
Were to leave tonight

122
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:48,401
And not come back to hover dam,

123
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,568
Say just in the condition

124
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,601
Of the plant is in right now,

125
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,767
This would continue operating

126
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,568
Without us here.

127
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:56,434
That would still be true

128
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:00,034
After about a week,

129
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:04,267
Several weeks, several months,

130
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,334
Maybe even a couple of years,

131
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,301
Everything would still be

132
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:10,167
Running normally.

133
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,534
In a life after people,

134
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,301
It is possible that hover dam

135
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:13,867
Would be one

136
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:14,800
Of the last power plants

137
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,267
Still running.

138
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,401
as the power goes out

139
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,634
Around the world,

140
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,800
Other systems

141
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,534
Are quickly beginning to fail.

142
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,234
beneath all the major cities,

143
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,434
There's a complex network

144
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,967
Of underground tunnels,

145
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:36,501
And these are there

146
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:38,234
For drainage purposes

147
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:39,568
Or for cabling purposes,

148
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:40,201
And in the case

149
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,234
Of the big cities,

150
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:48,167
For transportation as well.

151
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,134
There are many of those

152
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,501
Sit below the level

153
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,900
Of the water table,

154
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,934
And in order to keep them dry,

155
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:55,733
We have to have

156
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,900
A system of pumps

157
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,534
That is switched on

158
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:58,668
When necessary

159
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:03,067
To drain the tunnels.

160
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,167
deep within new York

161
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,568
City subways,

162
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:06,867
More than 700 pumps

163
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,767
Constantly struggle to keep out

164
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,367
A flood of ground water,

165
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,234
An average of 13 million gallons

166
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:17,267
A day.

167
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,334
now, if all these people

168
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,568
Were not around,

169
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:20,568
There will be nobody

170
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,568
To switch the pumps on.

171
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,267
It's estimated,

172
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:24,568
That the tunnels will fill

173
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:28,034
With water in about 36 hours.

174
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:44,100
back above ground,

175
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,967
Food is rotting

176
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:57,601
On supermarket shelves.

177
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:58,434
Home refrigerators

178
00:07:58,434 --> 00:07:59,401
Become nothing more

179
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:02,900
Than cabinets for decaying food,

180
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
But melt water

181
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,733
From defrosting freezers

182
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,800
May provide a temporary lifeline

183
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,201
For some of the creatures

184
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:13,034
We've left behind.

185
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,034
What will be the fate

186
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,434
Of our family pets

187
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,034
Once there are no humans left

188
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:18,668
To care for them?

189
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,434
Right from the get-go,

190
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,367
There's going to be a massive

191
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,334
Die off of dogs.

192
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,700
The instance that humans

193
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,100
Are gone,

194
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,568
They're not creating the debris

195
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,668
Or producing the food

196
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:41,100
That the dogs are living on.

197
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:42,367
He can't open cans,

198
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:42,934
He can't get

199
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:45,867
In the refrigerator.

200
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:46,401
They got to get

201
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,568
Out of the house.

202
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:50,367
The family dog

203
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,234
Has got to get out of the house

204
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:57,401
Or he's going to die there.

205
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,668
And once he gets out,

206
00:08:58,668 --> 00:08:59,367
He's got to go

207
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:08,301
To some source of food.

208
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:09,134
The first thing that happens

209
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:10,267
Is that they all jump out

210
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,034
Of the windows

211
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,501
And they are now out there

212
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,067
In a new landscape.

213
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,867
And the first to whack at it

214
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:18,201
It is that they go back

215
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,034
To scavenging a whole bunch

216
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:20,967
Of dead things out there

217
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:25,234
In the world.

218
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:26,568
there are estimated to be

219
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,067
Four hundred million dogs

220
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,467
In the world

221
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:37,601
And 300 different breeds.

222
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:39,301
But very few of them are suited

223
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,733
To surviving in a life

224
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:46,067
After humans.

225
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:46,800
The smallest dogs

226
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,367
Probably won't last a week

227
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,134
Without us.

228
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,100
there's probably no niche

229
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,833
For the smaller dogs.

230
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,000
Dogs are very competitive

231
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,334
And when you have wolves,

232
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,401
They displace coyotes,

233
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:58,467
Coyotes displace foxes,

234
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,668
And we would assume

235
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,234
That hierarchy would prevail

236
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,234
Among domestic dogs.

237
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:05,934
in fact,

238
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,501
Many of the unique features

239
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,267
That has been bred into dogs

240
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,700
Over the years

241
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Will now become major handicaps

242
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,800
In the fight for survival.

243
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,733
there are dog

244
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,067
For the really short legs,

245
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:17,967
I think the dogs

246
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,833
With the really short faces

247
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,201
Or long faces, I think,

248
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:25,301
That they're all doomed.

249
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:25,867
You know, they're not

250
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:26,900
Going to move well,

251
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,634
They're not going to be able

252
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:32,668
To search and explore.

253
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:33,367
I think that the kind of

254
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,401
The middle of the spectrum,

255
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,201
The kind of average dog,

256
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:42,000
Have the best chances in this.

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,733
I think that they will survive

258
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,434
In the long haul,

259
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:49,767
But it's not going to be pretty.

260
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,301
as the surviving dogs

261
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,234
Struggle to find

262
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,867
Their new niche,

263
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:54,833
Household pests

264
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,568
Are slowly beginning to notice

265
00:10:56,568 --> 00:11:02,934
Our absence.

266
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,800
Little creatures,

267
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,434
Rats and house mice,

268
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:07,467
They would seem to be able

269
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,034
To exist without us

270
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,767
Are surprisingly quite dependent

271
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,401
On our food supplies.

272
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:14,601
rats and mice

273
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:16,401
Are usually termed

274
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,067
"commensally rodents," which means

275
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,568
That term means literally

276
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:20,967
Sharing the table.

277
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:21,900
They're very dependent

278
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,201
On people.

279
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,900
And the little house mouse

280
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,301
And Norway rat

281
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:28,900
Are great examples of animals

282
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,467
That would do less well

283
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:35,634
In the absence of people.

284
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:36,700
in the initial weeks

285
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,034
After people are gone,

286
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,401
They will raid pantries

287
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:42,167
In homes, in grocery shelves

288
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:50,134
In stores.

289
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:50,934
After eating through

290
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:51,800
These food supplies,

291
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,668
They will struggle to survive

292
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:55,800
On things like cardboard, cloth,

293
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,000
Or glue.

294
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,668
I think that if a city

295
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:01,634
Was abandoned,

296
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,668
The rats would have to go back

297
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:05,201
To earning an honest living.

298
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,100
An honest living

299
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,634
Means to go back to the wild

300
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:13,234
And compete for resources there.

301
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,367
eventually, these rodents

302
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,568
Will abandon homes

303
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,733
And buildings,

304
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,568
Which will make them

305
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:25,201
Easy pickings for predators.

306
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,067
Although, rats and mice

307
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,167
Will mostly likely survive

308
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,301
In the future,

309
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:28,967
Their numbers

310
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:37,568
Will be greatly diminished.

311
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:38,733
After six months

312
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:42,434
Into a life after people,

313
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:42,900
Urban areas

314
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,967
Are already taking a turn

315
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:47,334
For the wild.

316
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,800
the predators would return

317
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,967
Very quickly in the absence

318
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,401
Of humans

319
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:53,800
Because we suppress them,

320
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,167
We create conditions

321
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,934
That either work against them,

322
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,467
Or we deliberately go out,

323
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,833
And remove and destroy them.

324
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,700
They would come back

325
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,668
Very quickly.

326
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:05,534
smaller predators

327
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,201
Like coyotes and bobcats

328
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,601
Always survive on the fringe

329
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:11,000
Of human populations.

330
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,668
They are the first to colonize

331
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:17,267
Our abandoned neighborhoods.

332
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,067
Larger carnivores

333
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,401
Will have to wait longer

334
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,167
For the habitat

335
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,034
To recover enough

336
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,800
To support their appetites.

337
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,700
But soon enough, they, too,

338
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,800
Will hunt in what

339
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,833
Were once our backyards.

340
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,800
One year into a life

341
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,301
After people,

342
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:44,301
Towns and cities

343
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,601
Are still recognizable.

344
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:47,167
But nature

345
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,900
Is beginning to reclaim

346
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,967
Her old turf.

347
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:53,700
one of the first

348
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,000
Great physical effects

349
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,634
In the absence of people

350
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,668
Would be the transition

351
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,634
Of the impervious surfaces:

352
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:01,467
The parking lots, the roads

353
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,668
Into places that supported

354
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,301
And then had an abundance

355
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:09,334
Of plant life.

356
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:09,833
any place

357
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,100
Where you have sunlight

358
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,668
That's hitting,

359
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:14,301
You're probably going to get

360
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:16,000
Some plant growth.

361
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:16,534
Little seeds

362
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:17,201
Are going to get stuck

363
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,833
In the cracks and so forth,

364
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,301
And these things

365
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:23,334
Are all going to start to creep.

366
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,668
Plants are wonderful that way.

367
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,301
They can destroy things

368
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,601
In matters of, you know,

369
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:37,568
A few years.

370
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,201
without humans

371
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,833
To remove them,

372
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,534
Weeds like dandelions

373
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,034
Infiltrate every crack

374
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:46,401
In the pavement.

375
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:47,867
As these weeds die,

376
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,067
Their remnants combine

377
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,601
With ever-spreading moss

378
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,167
And lichen

379
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:58,668
To create a layer of topsoil.

380
00:14:58,668 --> 00:14:59,733
This sandy soil

381
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,501
Is poor in nutrients,

382
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,668
So only plants like clover

383
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:05,733
That can pull nitrogen

384
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,234
From the air

385
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:11,301
Flourish at first.

386
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,167
Formerly manicured yards

387
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:16,534
Morph into fields

388
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:17,967
For a white-tailed deer

389
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:22,234
Forage for food.

390
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,034
Wild animals have also begun

391
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:24,967
To find their way

392
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:33,833
Into abandoned cities.

393
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,700
Man's supposed domination

394
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,833
Over nature

395
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,034
Has proven to be quite tenuous.

396
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:41,934
The signs of our vulnerability

397
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:45,867
Have always been there.

398
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:48,201
this is an ailanthus tree.

399
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,334
It seems to enjoy rooting itself

400
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:52,934
In very inhospitable locations.

401
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,267
And it likes to attach itself

402
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,934
To crevices in buildings.

403
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,067
And when it does so,

404
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,401
It causes damage.

405
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,668
The roots expand,

406
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,301
And the expansive forces of that

407
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,767
Force out mortar

408
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:05,568
And stone and cause crumbling

409
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:06,568
Of a facade.

410
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:07,668
If you get a lot of this

411
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,167
On an entire building facade,

412
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,334
It could cause

413
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:17,700
Major, major damage.

414
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,000
as nature battles back,

415
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,733
Even manmade goliaths

416
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:22,967
Like hover dam

417
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,401
Aren't invincible.

418
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:27,234
To harness the power

419
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,434
Of this river

420
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,434
Took 21,000 men and five years

421
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:36,067
Of hard labor.

422
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,000
But one year after people,

423
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,634
Its 17 massive and seemingly

424
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,833
Indestructible generators

425
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,833
Are about to be brought down

426
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,401
By an organism

427
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:52,800
The size of a human thumbnail.

428
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,067
The lake above the dam

429
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,000
Is infested

430
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,267
With an invasive species

431
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:57,167
Of mollusk

432
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,900
Called the "quake mussel."

433
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,134
This stealthy invader

434
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,100
From Eastern Europe

435
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,733
Had no natural predators

436
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,401
In North America

437
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,934
Other than the humans tasked

438
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,534
With scraping it from the grates

439
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:12,467
And pipes it colonizes.

440
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,067
the mussels attach themselves

441
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:18,301
To the inside wall of pipes

442
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:19,867
And they're very prolific.

443
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:20,800
They colonize

444
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,167
And rapidly build up

445
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,267
And can grow

446
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,833
On top of each other,

447
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,534
And eventually completely block

448
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:40,134
The diameter of a pipe.

449
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,000
the small pipes

450
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,334
That brings cooling water

451
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:44,301
To hover dam's generators

452
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:45,234
Make perfect homes

453
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,167
For these creatures.

454
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,301
And with no people around

455
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,733
To remove them,

456
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:52,867
They spread like a cancer.

457
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:53,467
and in fact,

458
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,434
Those mussels could clog up

459
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,967
The cooling water pipes,

460
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:58,367
To the point

461
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,000
Where we couldn't keep

462
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,833
These generators cool anymore.

463
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,000
And it would cause

464
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,401
The high temperature alarm

465
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:15,601
In the automatic control system.

466
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:16,568
And that automatic

467
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:17,501
Control system

468
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:18,467
Would then start

469
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:19,934
The shutdown sequence

470
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:23,000
Of that generator.

471
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, that would happen

472
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,833
One by one

473
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,934
For all of the generators

474
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:26,700
Of hover dam,

475
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,234
And eventually

476
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:28,201
The entire power plant

477
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,601
Would be shut down.

478
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,000
in lass Vegas,

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,967
The last glimmers

480
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,301
Of manmade light on earth

481
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,634
Relinquish the night

482
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:41,501
To its primeval blackness.

483
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:42,167
With the generators

484
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,900
No longer running,

485
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,833
No water at all

486
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:51,000
Is passing through hover dam.

487
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,067
And the Colorado River

488
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:58,401
Downstream begins to run dry.

489
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,367
On the other side of the dam,

490
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,967
The water has nowhere to go

491
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:06,568
And Lake Mead starts to rise.

492
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:07,134
it would just keep

493
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:10,034
Building up in Lake Mead.

494
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:10,733
And it would eventually

495
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,301
Gets to the point

496
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,634
Of spilling over

497
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:13,501
Through the spillways

498
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:18,900
On either side of the dam.

499
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,067
unchecked,

500
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,067
Nature's most powerful elements

501
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,601
Reclaim their supremacy

502
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:27,800
On earth.

503
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,000
Triggered by lightning strikes,

504
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,668
The wildfires

505
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,201
Those humans once battled

506
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,501
So valiantly

507
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:43,134
Now rage unchecked.

508
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:44,301
Cities and neighborhoods

509
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:46,034
Full of abandoned buildings,

510
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,267
Wild grasses, and debris

511
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:59,234
Is prime fuel for the flames.

512
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:04,568
Chicago burns.

513
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:05,434
San Francisco

514
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,900
Stately wooden Victorians

515
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,568
Are now only useful as kindling.

516
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:15,568
And just as it did

517
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:17,501
In the time of the ancients,

518
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:23,668
Rome is burning again.

519
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:24,467
As structures

520
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,167
Burn to the ground,

521
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:26,967
Charred timbers

522
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,201
Release nutrients into the soil,

523
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,267
Providing the next wave

524
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:31,601
Of plant life,

525
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:32,167
With the nitrogen

526
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:35,100
It needs to grow

527
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:50,267
And thrive.

528
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,434
Five years after people,

529
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:53,467
The roads of the world

530
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:54,401
Are disappearing

531
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,934
Beneath a green map

532
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:56,534
That spreads

533
00:20:56,534 --> 00:21:01,800
Like some relentless monster.

534
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,934
The advance of nature

535
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:05,800
Knows no boundaries.

536
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,234
The gates

537
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:08,100
Of London's Buckingham palace

538
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Are easily breached by vines

539
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,401
And moss.

540
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,367
In Moscow, red square

541
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,534
Is becoming very green.

542
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:18,034
in reality,

543
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:19,334
Nature will reclaim earth

544
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:21,934
Very quickly.

545
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:22,967
These stairs were cleared

546
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,201
18 months ago.

547
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:25,668
If we came back

548
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:26,833
In another 18 months,

549
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,634
We'd have a hard time

550
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,967
Finding them.

551
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,201
If we came back in five years,

552
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:32,367
It would be almost impossible

553
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,634
To find.

554
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:36,501
man's mastery over nature

555
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,167
Has always been

556
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:42,034
Just an illusion.

557
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,201
When the Cambodian city

558
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,100
Of Angkor

559
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,668
And its temple complexes

560
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:48,401
Were abandoned in 15th century,

561
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:49,467
Jungle trees grew

562
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,833
Indiscriminately

563
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,601
Over its stone structures.

564
00:21:52,601 --> 00:22:00,833
Entangling them in their roots.

565
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,067
Now, without armies of gardeners

566
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,534
And repairmen,

567
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,301
Modern cities are laid bare

568
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:10,867
To nature's revenge.

569
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:12,700
In New York's central park,

570
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
The great lawns, now untended,

571
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,800
Sprout with saplings.

572
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,733
Five years without humans

573
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:21,401
Leaves the park

574
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:25,134
Looking more like a forest.

575
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:29,134
central park will go bananas.

576
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:30,201
So all of a sudden

577
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:30,967
You'll get trees,

578
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:33,934
You'll get growth.

579
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,668
All the animals and plants

580
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:38,000
That is there now will go up

581
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,367
In population levels

582
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:40,668
And they'll start to spread out

583
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:45,767
Into the city.

584
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:46,800
the story is the same

585
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,367
In Washington DC

586
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,134
The great monuments

587
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:57,434
Have been swallowed by greenery.

588
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:58,334
And on what used to be

589
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:01,301
The national mall,

590
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,568
The sounds of the jungle

591
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:04,201
Are echoing.

592
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:04,833
zoo animals

593
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:10,134
Are really the great unknown.

594
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,201
Depending on whether or not

595
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,634
They could escape

596
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:13,601
From their confinement,

597
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,967
Then things change dramatically

598
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,501
Because you might have lions,

599
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:18,900
You might have tigers;

600
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,601
Both of which

601
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,000
Would be perfectly capable

602
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,067
Of surviving

603
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:27,967
In a post-human period.

604
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,568
They'd do better further south

605
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,100
Than they would do

606
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,000
in Washington DC

607
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,467
But these are animals

608
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,668
That is perfectly capable

609
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:36,100
Of figuring out how to do it

610
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,501
And how to survive.

611
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,201
zoo animals

612
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,234
May be the great unknown

613
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:41,867
But there are things

614
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,267
We can know for sure

615
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:44,867
About life 20 years

616
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:50,601
After people are gone

617
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,934
Because there's one spot

618
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:53,601
On the globe

619
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:58,668
Where it's already happened.

620
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,667
it's 20 years

621
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:26,434
Into a life after people.

622
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:27,000
Without humans

623
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,733
To apply fresh paint

624
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,534
And fill in cracks,

625
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:31,767
Even concrete buildings

626
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:36,401
Have already begun to crumble.

627
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:37,967
Lack of maintenance turns cities

628
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:45,434
Into eerie ghost towns.

629
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:46,967
Animals that have long avoided

630
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,867
Human population centers

631
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,667
Now return to make new homes

632
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:57,134
Among the decaying walls.

633
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:59,367
How do we know this?

634
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,201
Because there's one place

635
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,700
In the world

636
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,334
Where it's already happened.

637
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:08,867
we're standing

638
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,501
In the central square

639
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:12,534
Of Pripjat, Ukraine,

640
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:13,568
The city that was once

641
00:25:13,568 --> 00:25:15,468
The most modern city

642
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:20,434
In the former Soviet Union.

643
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,301
For 20 years now,

644
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:25,034
This city

645
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:26,967
Has been sitting abandoned,

646
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,434
And it really gives you

647
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:31,067
A picture of what would happen

648
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,733
If people are removed

649
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:33,534
From a place

650
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:42,534
Of normal civilization.

651
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:43,667
evacuated after

652
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,667
The Chernobyl nuclear disaster,

653
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,301
Pripjat went

654
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:52,633
From a city of 50,000

655
00:25:52,633 --> 00:26:07,367
To ghost town overnight.

656
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,501
Dust-covered school rooms remain

657
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,667
As students left them

658
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:23,234
Just over 20 years ago.

659
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,401
Vegetation pries apart masonry

660
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:34,401
As it crawls over buildings.

661
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:35,600
An amusement park

662
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Scheduled to open

663
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
Four days after the date

664
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,534
Of the accident

665
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:47,267
Remains never used.

666
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:48,600
The park's ferries wheel

667
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,201
Accumulates rust

668
00:26:50,201 --> 00:27:06,568
Rather than riders.

669
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:08,267
The bumper cars sit in a state

670
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:16,167
Of motionless decay.

671
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,934
Pripjat has provided an amazing

672
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:19,700
And rare opportunity

673
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,367
To see what happens

674
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:22,034
To a manmade city

675
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:29,633
When humans disappear.

676
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:30,101
I can see

677
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:31,301
From my Geiger counter

678
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,468
That it's really quite safe

679
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:33,468
To be here,

680
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:34,267
Radiation levels

681
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,600
Were not very high.

682
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
But you can see

683
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,468
That we've really hit

684
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:40,934
A point of no return

685
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:48,501
In recapturing these facilities.

686
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,334
We're in what was

687
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,434
The cultural center

688
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:53,501
Of the city of Pripjat.

689
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:54,633
And indeed, this was a place

690
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,134
Where friends gathered,

691
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,301
Where there would be

692
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,501
Celebrations,

693
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:01,167
There would be balls,

694
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,234
There would be music,

695
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:03,967
There would be dancing,

696
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,067
There would be performing

697
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:10,501
On the stage here behind me.

698
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,733
But after 20 years,

699
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,034
The forces of nature

700
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:14,967
Have started to decay

701
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:18,501
This facility.

702
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:20,301
this concrete soviet facade

703
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:22,434
May look imposing

704
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,134
But it's no match

705
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,434
For the frigid Ukrainian winters.

706
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:27,367
As the temperature drops

707
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:28,834
Below freezing,

708
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,067
Water that has accumulated

709
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:32,267
In cracks, expands,

710
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,633
Exerting bursting pressure

711
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:35,034
That pulls apart

712
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:37,401
The masonry.

713
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:39,600
As vegetation grows unchecked,

714
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,367
The roots spread

715
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:43,434
Through foundations and stairs.

716
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:45,201
These roots suck in moisture

717
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:48,934
That makes them expand and grow.

718
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,568
Like miniature hydraulic jacks,

719
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:52,468
Over time,

720
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:54,234
They slowly push apart

721
00:28:54,234 --> 00:29:00,101
The concrete.

722
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:03,301
this is only 20 years.

723
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:03,967
Can you imagine

724
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:04,967
What this facility

725
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:13,434
Will look like after 200 years?

726
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:14,700
after the accident,

727
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,501
Scientists expected the worst

728
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:19,167
For the wildlife in the region.

729
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:19,967
Most of the trees

730
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,101
In a 1 1/2 square mile area

731
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:23,534
Around the nuclear plant

732
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:26,434
Were killed off by radiation.

733
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:29,867
Many animals died.

734
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:31,900
But incredibly, the effect

735
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,568
Of the absence of humans

736
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,034
For 20 years has outweighed

737
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:37,101
The initial damage

738
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:44,434
Caused by the nuclear nightmare.

739
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:46,101
this is the red forest,

740
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:46,967
An area

741
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,401
That was horribly impacted

742
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:51,101
By radioactivity

743
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:55,034
Due to the Chernobyl explosion.

744
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:56,201
And the trees that you see

745
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:57,867
Around me were killed

746
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:02,000
By the radioactivity.

747
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,167
The original amounts

748
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,301
Of radioactivity were sufficient

749
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:06,667
To kill all of the wildlife

750
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:12,000
In the region as well.

751
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,301
But now we see resurgence

752
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:22,234
Of the wildlife.

753
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,000
As an example of how wildlife

754
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,267
Has prospered here,

755
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:28,067
We see, here, we have an antler

756
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,034
From a red deer and, obviously,

757
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,067
A fairly large

758
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:35,633
And healthy red deer.

759
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,834
Red deer are hardly found

760
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,568
In any other areas

761
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:39,434
In this region

762
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:41,334
And the Chernobyl zone

763
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:42,167
Is the only place

764
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,167
That you'll find populations

765
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:47,834
Of red deer.

766
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,867
We also find Russian wild boars

767
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,934
That the populations in the zone

768
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,967
Are 10 to 15 times higher

769
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:55,101
Than they are outside

770
00:30:55,101 --> 00:31:04,101
Of the zone.

771
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:06,234
we're now at the kindergarten

772
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:08,334
Of Karachi village, not far

773
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,134
From the Chernobyl station.

774
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,434
Children were living here

775
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:13,267
While their parents worked.

776
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:14,201
But after that night

777
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:16,034
In April 1986,

778
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:20,501
They never returned.

779
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:24,800
We are in what was formerly

780
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,633
A bedroom in this kindergarten

781
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:27,767
Where children used to sleep

782
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:30,733
And rest.

783
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:31,134
Now, there's

784
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:34,167
Certain emptiness here.

785
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,234
All these windows are broken.

786
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:37,201
But the room continues

787
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:42,267
To live on.

788
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:42,767
Birds fly in here

789
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,034
And sit on these bars.

790
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,201
We even found evidence

791
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,267
That an owl comes here.

792
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:50,334
An owl, it regurgitates food,

793
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:54,167
Fur, bones, and feathers.

794
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,534
Evidently, it likes to sit here

795
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,134
On this window pane.

796
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:58,568
So this room continues

797
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:12,767
To maintain life.

798
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,201
Even trees which had proven

799
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:15,667
Especially vulnerable

800
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,733
To radioactive fallout.

801
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:19,234
Are finding new homes

802
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:26,101
In the evacuation zone.

803
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:26,667
I'm sitting

804
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,568
In the Pripjat soccer stadium

805
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:30,000
Where, 20 years ago,

806
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,201
Hundreds of people would come

807
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:31,767
And cheer

808
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:36,301
On their favorite team.

809
00:32:38,468 --> 00:32:39,633
You can imagine the laughter

810
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:40,334
Of the sounds

811
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,700
Of the crowds here.

812
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,401
The activity on the field

813
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:47,334
Which, 20 years later,

814
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:58,501
Is barely discernable.

815
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:00,000
The soccer field now is going

816
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,034
Through succession

817
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:02,934
As you would expect in returning

818
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:05,101
To what it was originally

819
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:06,367
Hundreds of years ago

820
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:07,167
Which was a mixed

821
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:15,600
Deciduous forest.

822
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,733
I grew up in a town

823
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,301
About like this

824
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:19,600
And I used to enjoy

825
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,134
Riding bumper cars like these

826
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,967
About a half a world away.

827
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,534
And it seems pretty sad

828
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:27,501
When you look now

829
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:28,600
And you see what's become

830
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,867
Of this beautiful city

831
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,967
Of Pripjat and that people

832
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:41,600
Will never live here again.

833
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,367
But there's another side

834
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,633
To this story,

835
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:45,667
A very encouraging side;

836
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,600
One that says that life

837
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,234
Is much more resilient

838
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,367
Than what we thought possible.

839
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:54,101
That in the absence of man,

840
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,733
That life will continue

841
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,600
And that life will thrive

842
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,867
And that the legacy of life

843
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,501
Will always be here,

844
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,367
Because we are a part of life.

845
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:08,167
Even if we disappear,

846
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,234
Our legacy of life

847
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,800
Will continue.

848
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,665
Through decaying neighborhoods

849
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:53,732
In search of their next meal.

850
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:54,999
In some of the great cities

851
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,366
Of the world,

852
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,966
Solid ground is getting harder

853
00:34:57,966 --> 00:35:02,399
To find.

854
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,032
In the time of humans,

855
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:05,133
London was protected

856
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:06,500
From tidal surges

857
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,032
By 10 retractable steel gates

858
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:09,765
That could be raised

859
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,566
During storms to seal off

860
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:12,699
The Thames River

861
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:16,832
From the North Sea.

862
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:17,600
Without humans

863
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,233
To operate the barrier,

864
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:28,199
London is defenseless.

865
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,333
Another low-lying city,

866
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,466
Amsterdam,

867
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:46,699
Meets the same watery fate.

868
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:49,399
In a New York City high rise,

869
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,899
Some windows have already

870
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,233
Cracked and slipped loose

871
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:56,899
From their frames and many more

872
00:35:56,899 --> 00:36:01,133
Are on the verge of destruction.

873
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,333
After a quarter century

874
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,899
Of exposure to moisture

875
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:06,333
And heat without maintenance,

876
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,765
The normally flexible window

877
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,866
Sealant has become rigid,

878
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:10,932
Locking this window

879
00:36:10,932 --> 00:36:13,266
To its frame.

880
00:36:13,266 --> 00:36:14,799
As the metal frame expands

881
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,333
And contracts with changes

882
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,999
In temperature,

883
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:19,999
It induces stresses

884
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:21,466
On the glass.

885
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:23,133
It cracks and plummets

886
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:27,999
To the sidewalk below.

887
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,665
after a few of the windows

888
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,133
Fall out of a building

889
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,199
Like this,

890
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,899
Then the wind pressure effect

891
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:35,266
Changes dramatically.

892
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,732
As well as external pressure

893
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:37,899
Coming on to the building,

894
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,366
You also get suction.

895
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:40,765
And that aggravates the problem

896
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,333
So more of the panels

897
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:47,765
Are likely to fall out.

898
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:48,999
through these gaping holes,

899
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:49,966
The building fills

900
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:57,566
With windswept debris.

901
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:02,665
A summer storm rolls in.

902
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,199
On top of the structure,

903
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,632
The copper-lightning deterrent

904
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:07,166
System that once protected

905
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,066
Thousands of office workers

906
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:17,632
Is now corroded and useless.

907
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,299
A lightning bolt turns the tower

908
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:34,333
Into a raging inferno.

909
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,665
The gutted building makes

910
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:36,866
The perfect home

911
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:44,399
For a surprising survivor.

912
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,533
Although pigeons once relied

913
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,966
On the handouts of humans,

914
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,433
They have done just fine

915
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:55,799
In 25 years without us.

916
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:57,799
pigeons are survivors.

917
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:58,632
They can live in the wild;

918
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,500
They do live in the wild still.

919
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,433
And in a period

920
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:03,932
Where there were no people

921
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:05,765
But there still were edifices

922
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:07,600
And artifacts, our buildings,

923
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:08,632
They would do very well

924
00:38:08,632 --> 00:38:10,032
Because they would adopt these

925
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:10,732
As kind of

926
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:12,133
Artificial cliff faces,

927
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:13,133
Which is what they really are

928
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:17,399
Adapted to.

929
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:22,032
like the pigeon,

930
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,266
The disappearance of humans

931
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:24,665
Forced a change in the habits

932
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:28,066
Of the lowly cockroach.

933
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,133
think of the poor cockroach

934
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:30,966
After they gorge

935
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:32,600
Upon our surplus

936
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,032
When we're gone,

937
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:37,233
They'll mourn us.

938
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:38,799
They'll be sorry.

939
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,133
but the morning won't last

940
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,665
For long.

941
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:43,799
While cockroaches thrived

942
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,399
On our scraps,

943
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:47,333
They can also eat bookbinding's,

944
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,166
And cardboard,

945
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,066
And any rotting organic matter

946
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:55,099
Including dead leaves and roots.

947
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,099
While food isn't a problem,

948
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:00,099
Roaches also need warmth;

949
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:00,999
The kind that humans

950
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:02,233
Had always supplied

951
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:06,732
Through artificial heat.

952
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:07,732
Cockroaches started

953
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:10,166
As a tropical species

954
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,233
And some experts say

955
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:12,732
They couldn't survive the winter

956
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:16,533
In colder cities.

957
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:17,366
But it's hard to bet

958
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:18,832
Against a creature that has seen

959
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:22,433
The dinosaurs come and go.

960
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:23,266
cockroaches are

961
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:25,066
Extremely adaptable.

962
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:25,632
They've been around

963
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:26,966
For 300 million years.

964
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:27,665
If I have to bet,

965
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,765
I'd put my money on them

966
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:29,866
Being able to survive

967
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:35,732
In one form or another.

968
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:36,466
the first winter

969
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:38,066
After humans did witness

970
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:41,699
The die-off of some cockroaches,

971
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,366
But many more moved underground

972
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:44,899
To find warmth until

973
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:49,732
Milder temperatures returned.

974
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,600
In an abandoned downtown

975
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,533
Devoid of insecticides,

976
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,233
Overrun by vegetation

977
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:58,133
And with a rising water table,

978
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,233
This former pest is now enjoying

979
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:11,500
A golden age.

980
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,032
Cockroaches were only a nuisance

981
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:16,999
To humans,

982
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:23,066
But wolves were a terror.

983
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:25,866
So man hunted them mercilessly.

984
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,500
When the first European settlers

985
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,600
Arrived in what is now

986
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,333
The United States,

987
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,500
It's believed nearly half

988
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,600
A million wolves roamed

989
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,166
The country side.

990
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,799
By the 20th century,

991
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,632
These predators

992
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,966
Were nearly extinct

993
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:42,899
In the lower 48 states.

994
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,500
Now, with no humans left

995
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,866
To battle them,

996
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:47,533
Wolf populations multiply

997
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:50,899
By as much six times each year.

998
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:51,932
Within 25 years

999
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,533
Of our disappearance,

1000
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:54,932
There could easily be half

1001
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:56,133
A million of them roaming

1002
00:40:56,133 --> 00:41:02,999
The united states again.

1003
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,399
This amazing comeback

1004
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,166
Has been seen

1005
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:08,699
On a small scale before.

1006
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,966
In 1995, biologists released

1007
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:13,399
A few dozen wolves

1008
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,366
Within the boundaries

1009
00:41:14,366 --> 00:41:18,266
Of yellow stone national park;

1010
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:18,899
A place

1011
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:19,799
Where they would be protected

1012
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:32,333
From persecution by humans.

1013
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,433
Within a decade,

1014
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:34,932
A few dozen had multiplied

1015
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:37,665
Into 1,500

1016
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:38,299
And the wolves

1017
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:39,099
Quickly spread out

1018
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,699
From their release point

1019
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:41,932
To occupy territory

1020
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:42,765
Throughout the states

1021
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:50,399
Of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

1022
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,632
it would be fast

1023
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:52,433
If you can start

1024
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:53,899
With just a few dozen wolves

1025
00:41:53,899 --> 00:41:55,466
And in the course of one decade,

1026
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:57,765
Have a population of 1,500

1027
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,366
And you could have

1028
00:41:58,366 --> 00:41:59,866
A geographic expansion

1029
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:01,466
Where they filled up a big chunk

1030
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:02,765
Of a three-state area.

1031
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:03,299
And these are

1032
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:04,765
Big western states.

1033
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:05,665
Yeah, when the conditions

1034
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:06,366
Are right,

1035
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:07,233
They can re-colonize

1036
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,732
Pretty rapidly.

1037
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:12,133
Could we see them in Manhattan?

1038
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:15,133
Or Chicago?

1039
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,566
As soon as the deer get there,

1040
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:17,366
The wolves will be right

1041
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:25,966
Behind them.

1042
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:26,699
animals haven't

1043
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,799
Just been hunted by humans;

1044
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:38,600
They've also been hemmed in.

1045
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,866
There are roughly three million

1046
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,333
Miles of paved road

1047
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:46,399
In the united states alone.

1048
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,799
And it's no coincidence

1049
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:48,899
That many of them cut

1050
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,099
Right through the paths

1051
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,999
Animals use to get from place

1052
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:54,799
To place.

1053
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:55,632
the things that make

1054
00:42:55,632 --> 00:42:56,433
A landscape good

1055
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:58,832
For animal movement

1056
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,133
Also make it easy to engineer

1057
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:04,066
A road in that location.

1058
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,866
So, we've cut off pretty much

1059
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:07,066
All major migrations

1060
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:12,632
In North America.

1061
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,066
asphalt and automobiles

1062
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:15,765
Wreaked particular havoc

1063
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:24,333
On the grizzly bear.

1064
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:24,999
Their habitat

1065
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:27,765
Was so carved up by roads

1066
00:43:27,765 --> 00:43:28,433
That they're confined

1067
00:43:28,433 --> 00:43:30,966
To isolated pockets,

1068
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:31,533
Cutting them off

1069
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:32,832
From food sources

1070
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:41,233
And potential mates.

1071
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:43,600
In a life after humans,

1072
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,299
Roads are no longer barriers

1073
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:47,632
For the grizzly.

1074
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:50,366
Instead they are pathways;

1075
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,500
Trails that lead them back

1076
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,433
Into the heart

1077
00:43:52,433 --> 00:44:04,899
Of their former range.

1078
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:08,133
forty years after people.

1079
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,366
While cities of steel

1080
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:10,199
And concrete

1081
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,500
Are still standing tall,

1082
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,166
The suburbs are under attack.

1083
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,099
Roughly 90 percent of all homes

1084
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:21,466
In the United States

1085
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:24,765
Have wood frames.

1086
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:30,600
While some have burned,

1087
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:39,032
Others are now being devoured.

1088
00:44:39,032 --> 00:44:41,433
Without paint and preservatives,

1089
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:42,466
The lumber of homes

1090
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:46,932
Is defenseless against termites.

1091
00:44:46,932 --> 00:44:49,133
Termites feast on cellulose,

1092
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,366
The basic building block

1093
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:52,366
Of wood.

1094
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:53,533
And their appetites

1095
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:56,233
Are relentless.

1096
00:44:56,233 --> 00:44:57,399
Some colonies can eat

1097
00:44:57,399 --> 00:44:59,732
As much as 1,000 pounds of wood

1098
00:44:59,732 --> 00:45:04,932
Per year.

1099
00:45:04,932 --> 00:45:06,866
In this destructive advance,

1100
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:07,566
The termites

1101
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:09,333
Aren't working alone.

1102
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:09,999
the process we know

1103
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,333
As rotting will occur

1104
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,566
When the wood gets exposed

1105
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:15,233
To the elements.

1106
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:16,500
And this rotting, actually,

1107
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,799
Is a more complicated process.

1108
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:20,166
It's a process by which microbes

1109
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:21,233
Attack the wood

1110
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:22,533
And release carbon dioxide

1111
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:24,732
And methane to the atmosphere.

1112
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:26,166
If humans were to leave,

1113
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,099
It'd be a matter of decades

1114
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,166
Before most structures

1115
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:28,699
That had significant

1116
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:29,765
Wood components

1117
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:32,832
Would start to decay.

1118
00:45:32,832 --> 00:45:33,500
faced with

1119
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,665
A two pronged attack

1120
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,899
From termites and rot,

1121
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:38,632
The beams that hold up the roof

1122
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:41,233
Give way.

1123
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:42,099
And the boundary

1124
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:43,832
Between inside and out,

1125
00:45:43,832 --> 00:45:45,566
That had once been so important

1126
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:46,399
To the humans

1127
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:49,566
Who called this building home

1128
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:53,533
Is forever erased.

1129
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,399
other substances

1130
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:55,500
Like this mortar and rock

1131
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,899
Are going to last longer

1132
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:58,266
Than several decades,

1133
00:45:58,266 --> 00:45:59,665
But they'll still crumble

1134
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:00,765
After natural, chemical,

1135
00:46:00,765 --> 00:46:01,500
And physical weathering

1136
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,366
Processes,

1137
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:03,466
And eventually these walls

1138
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:05,032
Will fall down as well,

1139
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:10,199
And there'll be no remnants.

1140
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:12,433
now, nature will act quickly

1141
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:16,299
To swallow up these ruins.

1142
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:17,433
This crumbling house

1143
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,966
In Baltimore's druid hill park

1144
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:21,533
Was once home to the caretaker

1145
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:23,665
Of the city zoo.

1146
00:46:23,665 --> 00:46:24,466
it looks like this building

1147
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:25,233
Has been abandoned

1148
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:26,966
For more than a hundred years.

1149
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:27,732
But in reality,

1150
00:46:27,732 --> 00:46:28,899
People have been living here

1151
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:31,166
Up till 40 years ago.

1152
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,066
It's amazing how quickly

1153
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:33,932
The vegetation has reclaimed

1154
00:46:33,932 --> 00:46:34,732
The area.

1155
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:36,333
The vines have started to climb

1156
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,899
Up the walls.

1157
00:46:37,899 --> 00:46:38,732
The trees are growing

1158
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,133
Into the structure,

1159
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,166
And they're both physically

1160
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,533
Pulling the structure apart,

1161
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,699
And chemically dissolving it.

1162
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:48,299
structures built entirely

1163
00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:49,765
Of stone or masonry

1164
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,899
Will far outlive

1165
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:54,366
Anything made of wood.

1166
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,399
Exactly how fast

1167
00:46:55,399 --> 00:46:56,866
They will crumble depends

1168
00:46:56,866 --> 00:47:03,500
On their environment.

1169
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:04,399
the coast of Maine, really,

1170
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:07,333
Isn't very kind to buildings.

1171
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,233
Structures out here

1172
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:09,099
Don't so much decay

1173
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:10,299
When you live them alone;

1174
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:12,765
They melt.

1175
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:13,566
these structures

1176
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:15,399
On black island, Maine

1177
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,266
Used to be part

1178
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,399
Of granite quarry whose stone

1179
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:19,932
Was used to build and decorate

1180
00:47:19,932 --> 00:47:22,099
Cities like Boston, New York,

1181
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,899
And Philadelphia.

1182
00:47:25,899 --> 00:47:29,466
It was abandoned around 1920.

1183
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:30,299
here, the buildings

1184
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:31,032
Have all vanished

1185
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:31,765
Within the space

1186
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,932
Of 80 and 90 years.

1187
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:39,999
There's almost nothing left.

1188
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:41,600
in the right conditions

1189
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
And with human maintenance,

1190
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,166
Stone construction can last

1191
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:49,266
For thousands of years.

1192
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,166
In some places in Europe,

1193
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,632
Ancient roman aqueducts

1194
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:54,999
Are still in use.

1195
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:56,832
But without maintenance,

1196
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,600
Stone can fall victim

1197
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,366
To a very stealthy enemy.

1198
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,099
one of the great enemies

1199
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:03,433
Of stone are actually salts

1200
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:04,732
And salt crystals.

1201
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:06,199
Even thousands of years ago,

1202
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:07,466
People notice the effect

1203
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:09,166
That salts had on deteriorating

1204
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:13,832
The ancient pyramids.

1205
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:14,932
there are many ways

1206
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:17,066
Salts infiltrate stone buildings

1207
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:18,500
And monuments:

1208
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,032
Polluted air, seawater,

1209
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:24,233
And even bird droppings.

1210
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:25,266
soluble salts dissolve

1211
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:25,999
In water,

1212
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:27,133
And as the water evaporates,

1213
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:28,966
It will rise up inside

1214
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:30,665
Of porous building materials;

1215
00:48:30,665 --> 00:48:32,266
Things like brick and stone

1216
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:33,466
And even concrete.

1217
00:48:33,466 --> 00:48:35,500
And what happen are the salts

1218
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,665
Will continue to grow

1219
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:38,999
Inside the pores of the stone

1220
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,133
Until they come up

1221
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:42,333
Against the side of the wall,

1222
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:43,466
And they'll actually push

1223
00:48:43,466 --> 00:48:48,133
The stone apart.

1224
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:48,765
what we're seeing

1225
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:49,866
In this time-lapse video

1226
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:51,466
Really shows the rapid decay

1227
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:52,966
Of the stone in response

1228
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:57,866
To this deterioration by salts.

1229
00:48:57,866 --> 00:48:58,732
In this experiment,

1230
00:48:58,732 --> 00:49:00,099
It took about three weeks to go

1231
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:05,699
From this piece of stone

1232
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:07,299
To this piece of stone,

1233
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:09,333
Which is completely deteriorated

1234
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,566
By sodium sulfate

1235
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:12,166
Crystallization.

1236
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,566
three weeks in this

1237
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:16,099
Accelerated aging chamber

1238
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:17,966
Are equivalent to a few years

1239
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:20,399
In the harshest of environments,

1240
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:22,299
Or a few decades in a more

1241
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:24,600
Benign desert climate.

1242
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,299
if we could see

1243
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,433
Microscopically what's going on

1244
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:28,732
Inside the pyramids,

1245
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,333
This is what

1246
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,233
Would be taking place.

1247
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,299
You can actually see the salts

1248
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:36,266
Deteriorate the stone.

1249
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,732
although not immune to decay,

1250
00:49:38,732 --> 00:49:39,999
The pyramids have survived

1251
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:42,466
For nearly 5,000 years

1252
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:44,600
Because of their sheer volume

1253
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,399
And their hot,

1254
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,299
Dry desert environment.

1255
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:49,966
Too massive to be destroyed

1256
00:49:49,966 --> 00:49:52,899
By either man or nature,

1257
00:49:52,899 --> 00:49:54,233
The pyramids of Giza

1258
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:55,366
Were the only one

1259
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:56,600
Of the seven wonders

1260
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,932
Of the ancient world to survive

1261
00:49:58,932 --> 00:50:01,299
Into the modern era.

1262
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:02,832
Many ancient monuments

1263
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:03,932
Have survived only

1264
00:50:03,932 --> 00:50:05,600
Because of human maintenance

1265
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,366
Throughout the centuries.

1266
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:11,765
The sphinx was uncovered

1267
00:50:11,765 --> 00:50:13,699
And restored for the first time

1268
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:16,899
Back in 1400 back.

1269
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:18,433
Modern experts who have studied

1270
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,066
The sphinx, predict

1271
00:50:20,066 --> 00:50:22,199
That without human intervention,

1272
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,032
Deterioration from salts

1273
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:26,032
And wind erosion could render it

1274
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:27,466
A pile of dust

1275
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:36,765
Within 500 to 1,000 years.

1276
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:38,799
The largest concrete structures

1277
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:40,866
Like hover dam, will last

1278
00:50:40,866 --> 00:50:48,066
Even longer than that.

1279
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:49,399
Hover is so thick

1280
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:50,765
That over 70 years

1281
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:52,500
After it was constructed

1282
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,032
The concrete deep inside

1283
00:50:54,032 --> 00:50:59,366
Was still curing.

1284
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:01,333
But of the 15 tallest dams

1285
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,233
In the United States,

1286
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:05,966
Only 10 are concrete.

1287
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:07,765
The others are made of compacted

1288
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,632
Rock or earth,

1289
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:10,932
Like northern California's

1290
00:51:10,932 --> 00:51:14,932
Trinity dam.

1291
00:51:14,932 --> 00:51:16,866
If there were humans around,

1292
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,199
This leak in the dam would get

1293
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:21,600
An emergency fix.

1294
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,732
But those days are long gone.

1295
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:26,799
some of these dams

1296
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:29,399
Are absolutely enormous.

1297
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:30,399
And if they fail,

1298
00:51:30,399 --> 00:51:31,966
As they will in time,

1299
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:33,399
Then the surge of water

1300
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,166
That falls in behind them

1301
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,266
And cascades

1302
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:38,632
Down a valley below

1303
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:40,266
Would have a huge force,

1304
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,333
Big enough to sweep away

1305
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:45,966
Everything on its path.

1306
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:58,399
fifty years after humans,

1307
00:51:58,399 --> 00:51:59,732
The strain of neglect

1308
00:51:59,732 --> 00:52:00,999
Is beginning to show

1309
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:02,433
On even the best design

1310
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:12,999
Of manmade structures.

1311
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,799
everything that man designs

1312
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,166
Carries within it, the seeds

1313
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,466
Of its own destruction;

1314
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:19,765
That includes bridges

1315
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:21,899
And buildings.

1316
00:52:21,899 --> 00:52:22,932
The Brooklyn Bridge,

1317
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,266
One of the most famous bridges

1318
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:30,133
In the world for over 125 years.

1319
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:30,866
The reason

1320
00:52:30,866 --> 00:52:32,799
Those bridges last so long

1321
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:34,032
Is because engineers

1322
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:35,266
Look after them.

1323
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,566
They inspect them regularly,

1324
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:37,566
They maintain them,

1325
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:38,566
They paint them,

1326
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:39,799
They replace pieces that need

1327
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:41,466
To be replaced.

1328
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:42,399
Without people,

1329
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:43,699
Without engineers,

1330
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:45,399
The deterioration process

1331
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:50,799
Will accelerate dramatically.

1332
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:52,066
the most vulnerable parts

1333
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:53,600
Of a suspension bridge

1334
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,266
Are the steel vertical hanger

1335
00:52:55,266 --> 00:53:00,866
Cables.

1336
00:53:00,932 --> 00:53:01,632
these have been tested

1337
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:02,966
In the laboratory,

1338
00:53:02,966 --> 00:53:04,466
Unfortunately not on the bridge,

1339
00:53:04,466 --> 00:53:05,665
But what you see

1340
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:08,133
Is a classic kind of a failure

1341
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:11,032
That occurs in these wires.

1342
00:53:11,032 --> 00:53:12,899
These are the individual wires,

1343
00:53:13,032 --> 00:53:13,433
All right?

1344
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,266
That's an individual wire.

1345
00:53:15,266 --> 00:53:15,932
That probably has

1346
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:16,732
A tensile strength

1347
00:53:16,732 --> 00:53:18,266
That's maybe 200,000 pounds

1348
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:18,866
Per square inch.

1349
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:19,832
That's a very high strength

1350
00:53:19,832 --> 00:53:21,399
Steel.

1351
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,166
as strong as they are,

1352
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,333
These cables have a fatal flaw:

1353
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:32,032
It's the stuff they're made of.

1354
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:32,899
steel is a mineral

1355
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:34,433
That comes from the earth

1356
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:36,433
That's mostly iron,

1357
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:37,366
So it's probably

1358
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:42,133
95, 98 percent iron.

1359
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,366
exposed to moisture

1360
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:44,999
In the environment,

1361
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:46,399
Iron will start to revert

1362
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:47,566
Back to the minerals

1363
00:53:47,566 --> 00:53:49,166
It came from.

1364
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:53,099
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1365
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:55,066
it's going to go back home.

1366
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:55,765
It came from the earth

1367
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:58,133
As iron oxide of some form,

1368
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:01,266
And it's going to go back.

1369
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:02,832
this is the process we know

1370
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:04,600
As corrosion,

1371
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,133
And you see it wherever steel

1372
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:09,233
Is exposed to moisture.

1373
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:11,032
the enemy of steel

1374
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:12,999
Is corrosion.

1375
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:13,533
The problem

1376
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:16,133
Is keeping the water out.

1377
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:17,799
Part of that is maintenance.

1378
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,166
If you don't maintain them,

1379
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:23,732
You will get corrosion.

1380
00:54:23,732 --> 00:54:26,366
completed in 1883,

1381
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,832
The Brooklyn bridge cost

1382
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:31,832
$15 million to build.

1383
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:33,632
Over the last two decades,

1384
00:54:33,632 --> 00:54:35,999
$3 billion have been spent

1385
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:37,166
Maintaining it

1386
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,233
And the other bridges

1387
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,932
Over the east river.

1388
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:43,032
In the time of humans,

1389
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:43,999
The Brooklyn Bridge

1390
00:54:43,999 --> 00:54:45,732
Was continually maintained

1391
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:47,266
And fully repainted,

1392
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:49,966
Roughly, every dozen years.

1393
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:51,199
While across the country

1394
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,699
In San Francisco,

1395
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:56,966
The golden gate bridge

1396
00:54:56,966 --> 00:54:59,032
Was protected at all times

1397
00:54:59,032 --> 00:55:00,466
By a vigilant brigade

1398
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:02,632
Of 17 iron workers

1399
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:07,600
And 38 painters.

1400
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,732
what do they do all the time?

1401
00:55:08,732 --> 00:55:09,765
They will tell you, "We paint

1402
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,866
This bridge continuously."

1403
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:14,866
What happens when that stops?

1404
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:15,600
I can tell you what happens

1405
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,765
When that stops.

1406
00:55:16,765 --> 00:55:18,632
The cables begin to rust,

1407
00:55:18,632 --> 00:55:19,999
The paint peels off,

1408
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:21,999
The wires begin to break,

1409
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:23,699
And they'll come to a point

1410
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:24,366
When the bridge

1411
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:34,533
Is going to come down.

1412
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:35,899
seventy-five years

1413
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,600
After people.

1414
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,166
Most of the 600 million cars

1415
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:42,600
That once traveled the roads

1416
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,233
Of the world

1417
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:46,399
Are now just rusted remnants

1418
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:52,566
Of the human past.

1419
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:53,699
abandoned cars will behave

1420
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:54,699
Differently depending

1421
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:55,500
On the environment

1422
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,166
That they're in.

1423
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:58,433
A car left in the Mojave Desert,

1424
00:55:58,433 --> 00:55:59,032
For example,

1425
00:55:59,032 --> 00:56:01,433
Is going to last a long time.

1426
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,433
A car abandoned

1427
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:03,999
In my native Scotland

1428
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:04,632
Is going to have

1429
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:06,632
A very different fate.

1430
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:07,433
Any cars

1431
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:08,966
In a coastal environment

1432
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,066
With salt in the atmosphere,

1433
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:11,966
They might not last

1434
00:56:11,966 --> 00:56:16,765
More than 20, 30 years.

1435
00:56:16,765 --> 00:56:17,732
tires deflate

1436
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:19,665
Within a few years,

1437
00:56:19,665 --> 00:56:20,433
Although the rubber

1438
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:22,032
And synthetics they're made of

1439
00:56:22,032 --> 00:56:22,966
Will remain intact

1440
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,932
For centuries.

1441
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:28,433
Paint deteriorates quickly.

1442
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:30,533
And once it flakes away,

1443
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:32,665
Rust corrodes the car's body

1444
00:56:32,665 --> 00:56:34,466
At a rate of 5,000ths

1445
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:37,466
Of an inch per year.

1446
00:56:37,466 --> 00:56:40,832
Seventy-five years after humans,

1447
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:41,966
Most cars,

1448
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,266
Even in the most forgiving

1449
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,533
Of environments,

1450
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:48,099
Will be reduced to skeletons.

1451
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:50,932
After a century, the family car

1452
00:56:50,932 --> 00:56:53,166
Is a barely recognizable heap

1453
00:56:53,166 --> 00:57:06,999
Of metal.

1454
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:09,665
It's now 100 years into a life

1455
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:13,665
After people.

1456
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:15,166
The Brooklyn Bridge,

1457
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:15,932
Which had stood

1458
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,632
For over 125 years with people,

1459
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:21,632
Can't survive even a century

1460
00:57:21,632 --> 00:57:24,333
Without them.

1461
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:26,133
As the cables fail,

1462
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:27,866
The deck and railings begin

1463
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:35,233
To warp and sway.

1464
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:38,732
The deck pulls free,

1465
00:57:38,732 --> 00:57:40,433
And the roadway spills

1466
00:57:40,433 --> 00:57:49,665
Into the east river.

1467
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:51,732
as an engineer,

1468
00:57:51,732 --> 00:57:53,665
It's very sad to contemplate

1469
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:55,333
That this beautiful iconic

1470
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,999
Structure has got an end

1471
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:58,366
To its life.

1472
00:57:58,366 --> 00:57:59,999
But without maintenance,

1473
00:57:59,999 --> 00:58:00,999
An end to its life

1474
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:07,166
It certainly has.

1475
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,299
how exactly do bridges fail?

1476
00:58:10,299 --> 00:58:12,166
Once corrosion starts,

1477
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:15,566
The wires begin to crack.

1478
00:58:15,566 --> 00:58:16,099
and the wire

1479
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:16,665
Doesn't have to have

1480
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:17,500
A very big crack

1481
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,699
Before it breaks.

1482
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:20,366
Maybe a third

1483
00:58:20,366 --> 00:58:22,433
Of the way through.

1484
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,899
You may wonder what happens

1485
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:24,665
When they fail.

1486
00:58:24,665 --> 00:58:25,500
How do they fail?

1487
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,333
Do they just break?

1488
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,199
And what do they do?

1489
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,799
And the answer

1490
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:30,533
Is they tend to shred and fail,

1491
00:58:30,665 --> 00:58:31,665
With individual strands

1492
00:58:31,665 --> 00:58:32,366
Starting to fail

1493
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:34,133
And then, kind of, cascading,

1494
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:35,832
And a whole series of wires

1495
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:39,799
Then begin to break.

1496
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:40,832
a suspension bridge

1497
00:58:40,832 --> 00:58:42,866
Like the golden gate can survive

1498
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,466
The weakening of one

1499
00:58:44,466 --> 00:58:46,466
Of its vertical cables.

1500
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:47,765
But once two or three

1501
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:49,166
Start to go,

1502
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:52,600
The whole bridge is in jeopardy.

1503
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,665
Twisted steel crashes

1504
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:58,999
Into the waters below.

1505
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:01,266
it's going to be gone.

1506
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:02,500
Two hundred years?

1507
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,299
I doubt it will last 200 years.

1508
00:59:05,299 --> 00:59:06,765
The bridge is going to be

1509
00:59:06,765 --> 00:59:08,133
In the drink.

1510
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:10,533
if some

1511
00:59:10,533 --> 00:59:11,832
Of our largest structures

1512
00:59:11,832 --> 00:59:13,099
Have already failed

1513
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:16,133
After 100 years,

1514
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:17,566
Can there be any hope

1515
00:59:17,566 --> 00:59:18,600
That our civilization

1516
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,233
Will leave a permanent mark

1517
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:24,533
After we're gone?

1518
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:26,099
What will remain of the records

1519
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,233
Of our history and culture

1520
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:33,133
A hundred years after people?

1521
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:34,500
our vaults contain

1522
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,299
Our most precious materials,

1523
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:38,299
And their biggest enemies

1524
00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:43,765
Are temperature and humidity.

1525
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:44,399
As long

1526
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:46,399
As their long-term storage

1527
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:47,533
Is kept at these

1528
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:50,566
Very controlled settings,

1529
00:59:50,566 --> 00:59:51,632
We feel assured

1530
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:52,699
That the materials

1531
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:59,066
Will be lasting a long time.

1532
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:00,233
stored

1533
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,799
Under ideal conditions,

1534
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,866
Paper and film both have

1535
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,333
An estimated shelf life

1536
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:09,500
Of 200 to 300 years.

1537
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,999
But expose them to the rigors

1538
01:00:10,999 --> 01:00:13,366
Of an uncontrolled environment

1539
01:00:13,366 --> 01:00:15,233
And that lifespan is cut

1540
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:19,166
At least in half.

1541
01:00:19,233 --> 01:00:23,732
if all the power went off,

1542
01:00:23,732 --> 01:00:24,932
Probably within a week,

1543
01:00:24,932 --> 01:00:27,199
We'd see very big spikes

1544
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:32,266
In the temperature and humidity.

1545
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:35,433
in this hostile environment,

1546
01:00:35,433 --> 01:00:37,199
Cellulose acetate,

1547
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:38,433
The most common material

1548
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:40,566
Used for films and photographs

1549
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:43,732
Throughout the 20th century

1550
01:00:43,732 --> 01:00:47,765
Begins to bubble and warp.

1551
01:00:47,765 --> 01:00:49,866
All of that culture and history,

1552
01:00:49,866 --> 01:00:51,832
From the landings on d-day

1553
01:00:51,832 --> 01:00:53,366
To Hollywood films

1554
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:54,533
And even your cherished

1555
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:56,533
Home movies and photographs,

1556
01:00:56,533 --> 01:00:58,199
Won't last a century

1557
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,765
Without the care of humans.

1558
01:01:01,765 --> 01:01:04,199
so, those precious images,

1559
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:06,133
Given time,

1560
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:09,333
Are going to end up like this.

1561
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,533
All of these are examples

1562
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,166
Of various stages in the decay

1563
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:16,665
Of cellulose acetate-based film

1564
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:18,166
Exposed to very high amounts

1565
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:19,999
Of humidity.

1566
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,966
Essentially,

1567
01:01:20,966 --> 01:01:27,533
These materials are finished.

1568
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,166
in libraries,

1569
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:30,600
The great repositories

1570
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,732
Of our collective knowledge,

1571
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:33,799
The damage comes

1572
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:39,832
From microscopic invaders.

1573
01:01:39,832 --> 01:01:41,832
Although we can't see them,

1574
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:42,932
Mold spores

1575
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,266
Are on all the surfaces

1576
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:46,932
Around us, lying dormant,

1577
01:01:46,932 --> 01:01:48,266
Biding their time

1578
01:01:48,266 --> 01:01:49,699
For the right conditions

1579
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:54,433
To strike.

1580
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:55,732
High humidity

1581
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:59,466
Creates the right conditions.

1582
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,299
and so,

1583
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,266
The situation is set up

1584
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:11,399
For the mold to really boom.

1585
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:12,466
some books and documents

1586
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:16,133
Will avoid this fate.

1587
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:17,433
The Dead Sea scrolls

1588
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,832
Survived 2,000 years in caves

1589
01:02:19,832 --> 01:02:21,600
In the Judean desert,

1590
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,799
Owing their longevity

1591
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,233
To the arid climate

1592
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:28,632
And lack of damaging sunlight.

1593
01:02:28,632 --> 01:02:32,466
But these are rare exceptions.

1594
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:33,032
so without

1595
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:34,600
Human intervention,

1596
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,099
A book like this might last,

1597
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:42,233
At best, another hundred years.

1598
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,499
even our digital media

1599
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:53,866
Won't last forever.

1600
01:02:53,866 --> 01:02:55,066
Estimates for the lifespan

1601
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:57,766
Of CDs and DVDs range

1602
01:02:57,766 --> 01:02:59,266
From a few decades

1603
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:00,632
To a few centuries

1604
01:03:00,632 --> 01:03:04,599
Under ideal conditions.

1605
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:04,966
we know

1606
01:03:04,966 --> 01:03:06,166
About the ancient Egyptians

1607
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,233
Because what they left behind

1608
01:03:08,233 --> 01:03:09,699
Was engraved in stones.

1609
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:16,599
Our form of capturing knowledge,

1610
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:18,099
Information, our history,

1611
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:20,199
Our advancement is typically

1612
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:21,465
Either in a computerized form,

1613
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,899
In a cod, or in a printed paper

1614
01:03:23,899 --> 01:03:25,300
Like this.

1615
01:03:25,432 --> 01:03:26,532
What we have here is something

1616
01:03:26,532 --> 01:03:28,133
That will degrade over time.

1617
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:29,666
It will not last

1618
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:30,799
For thousands of years

1619
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:31,432
Like what

1620
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,465
The ancient Egyptians

1621
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:34,799
Left behind.

1622
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,632
it seems pretty ironic

1623
01:03:37,632 --> 01:03:40,899
That with all of our advances,

1624
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:42,933
We still have not come up

1625
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:44,432
With anything as durable

1626
01:03:44,432 --> 01:03:49,532
As clay tablets and stone tools.

1627
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,565
150 years after humans,

1628
01:04:01,565 --> 01:04:02,333
The subways

1629
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,699
That had started to flood

1630
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:06,832
In the first 36 hours

1631
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:07,632
Are now flowing

1632
01:04:07,632 --> 01:04:11,333
Subterranean streams.

1633
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,732
The beams and archways

1634
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:13,966
That holds up the roofs

1635
01:04:13,966 --> 01:04:15,465
Of these tunnels

1636
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:19,166
Are on the verge of collapse.

1637
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:19,866
now, these tunnels

1638
01:04:19,866 --> 01:04:21,899
Are not far below street level.

1639
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,933
These columns are supporting

1640
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:25,699
Not just the roof of the tunnel,

1641
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,532
But the street above.

1642
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:28,999
And in time that these tunnels

1643
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,266
Are inundated,

1644
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,400
Flooded with water,

1645
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,400
Corrosion will start

1646
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,966
To take hold and we'll start

1647
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:37,333
To see collapses.

1648
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,333
the tunnels echo

1649
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,166
With the sound

1650
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:42,899
Of cracking steel and cement

1651
01:04:42,899 --> 01:04:47,899
As the streets above

1652
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:50,532
Are sucked into the underground.

1653
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:01,532
Above ground, life in the city

1654
01:05:01,532 --> 01:05:06,233
Is once again bustling.

1655
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:08,099
Vines have grown up the sides

1656
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:10,866
Of abandoned skyscrapers,

1657
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:13,066
Adapting to feed off rainwater

1658
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:15,233
That pools in crevices

1659
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:19,699
And on ledges.

1660
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:21,333
these vines all start up.

1661
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,233
And the vines

1662
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:23,400
Have little branches.

1663
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:23,933
It'd be nice

1664
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:25,166
If they produce a fruit

1665
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,465
Or something that was edible.

1666
01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:28,400
You got to have a plant

1667
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,300
With some fruit or, you know,

1668
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,999
Some source of energy

1669
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:33,933
For animals.

1670
01:05:34,066 --> 01:05:34,632
And then you would get

1671
01:05:34,632 --> 01:05:37,666
This vertical ecosystem

1672
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:38,933
Out there, and you would get

1673
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:41,199
Birds nesting in there.

1674
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:41,766
You get things

1675
01:05:41,766 --> 01:05:42,866
Hunting in through there.

1676
01:05:42,866 --> 01:05:44,666
You could have snakes there.

1677
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:45,133
You could have

1678
01:05:45,133 --> 01:05:53,666
All kinds of things.

1679
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:54,532
as insects

1680
01:05:54,532 --> 01:05:55,465
And smaller animals

1681
01:05:55,465 --> 01:06:00,300
Get established,

1682
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:05,366
Cats move in.

1683
01:06:05,366 --> 01:06:06,066
and there's some

1684
01:06:06,066 --> 01:06:07,400
Interesting examples of that

1685
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,565
Around the world.

1686
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:10,799
If you go to the colloseum--

1687
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:11,699
You just look in it--

1688
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:14,799
It's just loaded with cats.

1689
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:15,732
And the old tombs

1690
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:17,400
And old catacombs and so on

1691
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,766
Get loaded with cats

1692
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,166
That uses this as a living space

1693
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:20,866
From which, then,

1694
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:25,766
They radiate out during the day.

1695
01:06:25,766 --> 01:06:26,866
these felines

1696
01:06:26,866 --> 01:06:27,832
Are the descendants

1697
01:06:27,832 --> 01:06:30,599
Of our former house cats.

1698
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:31,699
Immediately after people

1699
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:33,632
Were gone, they replaced

1700
01:06:33,632 --> 01:06:35,599
Their human-supplied diets

1701
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,899
With field mice and small birds.

1702
01:06:38,899 --> 01:06:40,266
Hunting out in the open

1703
01:06:40,266 --> 01:06:42,933
Was hard work.

1704
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:44,333
But up here,

1705
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:48,233
The pickings are easy.

1706
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:49,532
Now, they live

1707
01:06:49,532 --> 01:06:50,766
Their whole lives

1708
01:06:50,766 --> 01:06:52,866
High above the city,

1709
01:06:52,866 --> 01:06:54,199
Finding all that they need

1710
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:56,532
To survive without ever having

1711
01:06:56,532 --> 01:06:59,266
To touch the ground.

1712
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:00,366
They are the kings

1713
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:01,966
Of the new high altitude

1714
01:07:01,966 --> 01:07:03,266
Food chain,

1715
01:07:03,266 --> 01:07:05,066
With million-dollar views

1716
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:05,999
Of a bizarrely

1717
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:15,799
Altered cityscape.

1718
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,266
I could picture new York city

1719
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,166
With all the buildings

1720
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:21,933
Covered with vines, you know?

1721
01:07:21,933 --> 01:07:25,333
Hawks sailing around.

1722
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,632
It'd be lovely.

1723
01:07:26,632 --> 01:07:28,465
It would be absolutely lovely.

1724
01:07:31,766 --> 01:07:33,233
for cats,

1725
01:07:33,233 --> 01:07:35,266
Life in this new environment

1726
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:36,532
Could eventually lead

1727
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:41,199
To some strange adaptations.

1728
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:42,199
I suppose, if you wanted

1729
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:43,300
To be really imaginative

1730
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,766
About it, you could say that,

1731
01:07:45,766 --> 01:07:46,866
Eventually, they could be

1732
01:07:46,866 --> 01:07:48,666
Like flying squirrels and so on.

1733
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:52,465
They could glide from places.

1734
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:55,465
The possibility is always there

1735
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:59,166
For some imaginative responses

1736
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:05,532
To this unusual environment.

1737
01:08:05,532 --> 01:08:06,565
while some cats

1738
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:11,066
Have made a great leap forward,

1739
01:08:11,066 --> 01:08:13,166
Many dogs have reverted

1740
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:16,999
To the ways of their ancestors.

1741
01:08:16,999 --> 01:08:19,099
Some that have interbred

1742
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:22,400
With wolves now fall in packs

1743
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,532
To bring down larger prey.

1744
01:08:33,999 --> 01:08:35,732
I think our dogs,

1745
01:08:35,732 --> 01:08:37,333
As placid as they may seem

1746
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,499
When they're in our homes

1747
01:08:38,499 --> 01:08:40,532
Lying on the living room floor,

1748
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,866
Still posses the instinct

1749
01:08:42,866 --> 01:08:44,233
To survive,

1750
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:45,999
Enough that they would be able

1751
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:48,432
To do whatever it took

1752
01:08:48,432 --> 01:08:49,400
In bringing down prey

1753
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,766
In order to live.

1754
01:09:03,933 --> 01:09:10,499
150 years after people,

1755
01:09:10,499 --> 01:09:11,899
The oceans are teeming

1756
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:16,366
With life.

1757
01:09:16,366 --> 01:09:17,766
The creatures of the sea

1758
01:09:17,766 --> 01:09:18,599
Have welcomed

1759
01:09:18,599 --> 01:09:22,699
The disappearance of mankind.

1760
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:23,599
historically,

1761
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:24,400
We've treated the oceans

1762
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,166
In two strange ways

1763
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,933
At the same time:

1764
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:31,933
A pantry and a toilet.

1765
01:09:31,999 --> 01:09:33,933
And over time,

1766
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:36,799
Our ability to damage the ocean

1767
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:41,966
Has grown and grown and grown.

1768
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,832
with humans no longer fishing

1769
01:09:43,832 --> 01:09:45,666
And polluting the sea,

1770
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:46,832
The path was cleared

1771
01:09:46,832 --> 01:09:49,366
For this astonishing recovery.

1772
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:52,599
It has happened before.

1773
01:09:52,599 --> 01:09:54,300
During World War II,

1774
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,966
Allied fishing trawlers

1775
01:09:55,966 --> 01:09:58,532
Avoided the north Atlantic,

1776
01:09:58,532 --> 01:10:00,099
And populations of fish there

1777
01:10:00,099 --> 01:10:04,799
Skyrocketed.

1778
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,599
in here, the basic biology

1779
01:10:06,599 --> 01:10:07,666
Of these kinds of animals

1780
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,799
Is working in our favor

1781
01:10:08,799 --> 01:10:10,033
Because animals

1782
01:10:10,033 --> 01:10:10,899
Like this sunfish

1783
01:10:10,899 --> 01:10:11,465
Can produce millions

1784
01:10:11,465 --> 01:10:14,066
Of offspring in a year,

1785
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:14,899
Much more

1786
01:10:14,899 --> 01:10:15,832
Than an equivalent-sized

1787
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:18,599
Terrestrial animal like a cow.

1788
01:10:18,599 --> 01:10:19,400
And because of that

1789
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,632
Prodigious potential

1790
01:10:20,632 --> 01:10:22,233
To reproduce,

1791
01:10:22,233 --> 01:10:23,832
The oceans could come back

1792
01:10:23,832 --> 01:10:25,133
Pretty quickly

1793
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:27,099
If the human population

1794
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:33,432
Were suddenly to disappear.

1795
01:10:33,432 --> 01:10:34,599
research has shown

1796
01:10:34,599 --> 01:10:36,333
That in the 18th century,

1797
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,300
Before the havoc

1798
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,799
Caused by humans,

1799
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:39,899
The oceans were capable

1800
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:40,699
Of sustaining

1801
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:45,133
Massive amounts of life.

1802
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:45,999
so many whales

1803
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:48,966
That they stink up the air;

1804
01:10:48,966 --> 01:10:50,199
So many tunas

1805
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:52,066
That they froth the ocean;

1806
01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:52,766
So many turtles

1807
01:10:52,766 --> 01:10:53,499
That you could walk

1808
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,933
Across the sea on their backs.

1809
01:10:55,933 --> 01:10:58,066
So, if people were to vanish

1810
01:10:58,066 --> 01:10:59,266
Off the face of the earth,

1811
01:10:59,266 --> 01:11:00,999
Then that's the kind of ocean

1812
01:11:00,999 --> 01:11:06,999
It could be.

1813
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,565
seagulls are also

1814
01:11:11,565 --> 01:11:13,532
Flourishing, but it has been

1815
01:11:13,532 --> 01:11:15,999
A treacherous flight.

1816
01:11:15,999 --> 01:11:17,166
The abundance of food

1817
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:17,832
From humans

1818
01:11:17,832 --> 01:11:19,432
Had allowed gull populations

1819
01:11:19,432 --> 01:11:21,465
To explode beyond what nature

1820
01:11:21,465 --> 01:11:25,766
Could normally support.

1821
01:11:25,766 --> 01:11:26,266
we humans

1822
01:11:26,266 --> 01:11:28,199
Are pretty messy species.

1823
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:29,999
And for a very long time,

1824
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:31,866
We had open landfill dumps

1825
01:11:31,866 --> 01:11:32,866
Where, as far

1826
01:11:32,866 --> 01:11:33,699
As we were concerned,

1827
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:34,199
All the stuff

1828
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:35,499
That wasn't fit to eat

1829
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,832
Was just thrown out.

1830
01:11:36,832 --> 01:11:37,899
But from the gulls'

1831
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:38,565
Point of view,

1832
01:11:38,565 --> 01:11:39,300
This was an amazing

1833
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,033
Free lunch counter.

1834
01:11:41,099 --> 01:11:42,300
So, you had a lot of birds

1835
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:42,799
That probably

1836
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:43,699
Wouldn't have made it through

1837
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,499
Their first winter

1838
01:11:44,499 --> 01:11:45,099
If they've had to feed

1839
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:46,300
For themselves.

1840
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:46,933
Suddenly, they had

1841
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:47,866
All these free food

1842
01:11:47,866 --> 01:11:50,266
Available to them.

1843
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,033
An immediate consequence

1844
01:11:51,033 --> 01:11:52,699
Of a world without people

1845
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:54,066
Would be some very hungry gulls

1846
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:55,899
Who would be very voraciously

1847
01:11:55,899 --> 01:12:00,366
Looking for other things to eat.

1848
01:12:00,366 --> 01:12:03,799
after an initial die-off,

1849
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:04,933
The remaining gulls

1850
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:05,933
Took advantage

1851
01:12:05,933 --> 01:12:07,832
Of the recovering oceans,

1852
01:12:07,832 --> 01:12:09,400
Where plentiful schools of fish

1853
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,133
Erased any memories

1854
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:13,366
Of the human-manufactured feasts

1855
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:21,400
They used to enjoy.

1856
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,133
Two hundred years after people,

1857
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:27,966
From New York to Chicago,

1858
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:30,400
Seattle and Paris,

1859
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,333
Our iron and steel icons

1860
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:37,832
Are on the verge of collapse.

1861
01:12:37,832 --> 01:12:39,099
While it has outlived

1862
01:12:39,099 --> 01:12:41,432
Our great suspension bridges,

1863
01:12:41,432 --> 01:12:42,632
The Eiffel tower

1864
01:12:42,632 --> 01:12:44,799
Is not invincible.

1865
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,465
In the time of humans,

1866
01:12:46,465 --> 01:12:47,832
Its iron superstructure

1867
01:12:47,832 --> 01:12:48,565
Was painted

1868
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,300
Once every seven years

1869
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,766
To protect it from corrosion.

1870
01:12:54,766 --> 01:12:57,066
In both age and structure,

1871
01:12:57,066 --> 01:12:58,166
The Eiffel tower

1872
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,400
Has a lot in common

1873
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,766
With the 300-foot high

1874
01:13:00,766 --> 01:13:02,732
Kinsman railroad viaduct

1875
01:13:02,732 --> 01:13:04,666
In Pennsylvania.

1876
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:05,166
was a bridge

1877
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:05,732
That was wrought iron

1878
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:06,866
Originally.

1879
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:07,899
It was reconstructed

1880
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:08,832
About the turn of the century

1881
01:13:08,832 --> 01:13:11,166
In steel.

1882
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:12,532
And what happens here of course

1883
01:13:12,532 --> 01:13:14,933
Is that unless it's maintained,

1884
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:16,199
Corrosion occurs.

1885
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:16,832
And what happens

1886
01:13:16,832 --> 01:13:18,732
With the corrosion?

1887
01:13:18,866 --> 01:13:22,366
The connection points freeze up.

1888
01:13:22,366 --> 01:13:25,133
They are not allowed to move.

1889
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:25,899
And here are some pieces

1890
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:27,066
From that viaduct.

1891
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:27,699
You can see

1892
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:28,432
That there's corrosion

1893
01:13:28,432 --> 01:13:29,866
All over the place.

1894
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:33,933
That's no longer steel.

1895
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:34,565
a structure

1896
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:36,400
With frozen connection points

1897
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,999
Can't absorb the stress

1898
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:40,799
Of high winds.

1899
01:13:40,799 --> 01:13:41,832
eventually,

1900
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:43,400
In this strong wind storm,

1901
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:49,532
It literally fell over.

1902
01:13:49,532 --> 01:13:51,300
Section by section,

1903
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,532
Piece by piece,

1904
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:54,966
It fell over into the valley

1905
01:13:54,966 --> 01:13:56,666
Where it had spanned the valley

1906
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:02,333
For over a hundred years.

1907
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:06,199
Just not maintained.

1908
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:07,499
You can think of many structures

1909
01:14:07,499 --> 01:14:08,199
That is coming

1910
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:09,233
From that same era

1911
01:14:09,233 --> 01:14:10,199
Like the Eiffel tower,

1912
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:11,732
Its iconic structure.

1913
01:14:11,732 --> 01:14:12,532
That doesn't shield it

1914
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,033
From the fact that's it

1915
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:17,666
In a corrosive environment.

1916
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:19,266
And so in time

1917
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,899
If you do not do anything

1918
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:22,099
For that structure,

1919
01:14:22,099 --> 01:14:26,266
It will fail.

1920
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:51,966
And it will come down.

1921
01:14:51,966 --> 01:14:53,333
the time between one

1922
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:56,333
And 300 years after people

1923
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:57,766
Will likely be the era

1924
01:14:57,766 --> 01:14:59,066
Of the great collapses

1925
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:01,966
Worldwide.

1926
01:15:01,966 --> 01:15:03,300
In Seattle,

1927
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,666
The iconic space needle

1928
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,832
Was designed to sway

1929
01:15:05,832 --> 01:15:07,999
One inch for every 10 miles

1930
01:15:07,999 --> 01:15:09,666
Per hour of wind,

1931
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:10,666
But with its steel

1932
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:12,565
Weakened by corrosion,

1933
01:15:12,565 --> 01:15:13,565
It takes little more

1934
01:15:13,565 --> 01:15:14,933
Than a strong breeze

1935
01:15:14,933 --> 01:15:15,832
For the symbol

1936
01:15:15,832 --> 01:15:18,465
Of the 1962 world's fair

1937
01:15:18,465 --> 01:15:38,999
To crash down from the skyline.

1938
01:15:38,999 --> 01:15:40,732
When humans disappeared,

1939
01:15:40,732 --> 01:15:41,999
Sea levels were already

1940
01:15:41,999 --> 01:15:45,732
On the rise.

1941
01:15:45,732 --> 01:15:46,699
In Manhattan,

1942
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:48,033
Over the centuries,

1943
01:15:48,033 --> 01:15:49,499
Saturated soil

1944
01:15:49,499 --> 01:15:50,632
Around the empire state

1945
01:15:50,632 --> 01:15:52,766
Building's foundation pilings

1946
01:15:52,766 --> 01:15:53,933
Have allowed the building

1947
01:15:53,933 --> 01:15:55,099
To lean.

1948
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,666
once a building strays

1949
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:57,666
From the vertical,

1950
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:58,499
Then gravity forces

1951
01:15:58,499 --> 01:16:00,099
Are also acting

1952
01:16:00,099 --> 01:16:01,432
Against the structure,

1953
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,333
Increasing the stresses

1954
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:04,432
At the base of the building,

1955
01:16:04,432 --> 01:16:05,499
Now we're unlikely to see

1956
01:16:05,499 --> 01:16:06,799
A skyscraper fall

1957
01:16:06,799 --> 01:16:09,266
Like a tree in the forest.

1958
01:16:09,266 --> 01:16:11,799
Once it does start to incline,

1959
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:13,599
Gravitational force will cause

1960
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:15,133
The top of the building

1961
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:16,099
To collapse downward

1962
01:16:16,099 --> 01:16:18,499
On top of itself.

1963
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:23,766
decay has also overtaken

1964
01:16:23,766 --> 01:16:25,732
The city of Chicago,

1965
01:16:25,732 --> 01:16:26,532
The birthplace

1966
01:16:26,532 --> 01:16:31,499
Of the skyscraper.

1967
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:32,766
The sears tower,

1968
01:16:32,766 --> 01:16:34,199
The tallest man-made structure

1969
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:35,799
In North America,

1970
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:36,333
Has reached

1971
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:40,233
The end of its reign.

1972
01:17:00,633 --> 01:17:02,032
The first 500 years

1973
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:04,032
After people has been an era

1974
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:13,333
Of decay and destruction.

1975
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:14,700
Our concrete structures

1976
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,865
Have lasted the longest.

1977
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:18,965
The ancient Romans

1978
01:17:18,965 --> 01:17:20,166
Invented the first form

1979
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,899
Of concrete.

1980
01:17:22,899 --> 01:17:24,099
And some of their structures

1981
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:25,232
Remained intact

1982
01:17:25,232 --> 01:17:29,566
For over 2,000 years.

1983
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:30,800
But modern concrete

1984
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,766
Isn't nearly as durable.

1985
01:17:32,766 --> 01:17:34,800
It has higher water content

1986
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,733
And is more loosely packed,

1987
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:37,666
Which leads to more

1988
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:40,899
Air pockets and cracks.

1989
01:17:40,899 --> 01:17:42,032
Modern concrete structures

1990
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:45,232
Have another fatal flaw.

1991
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:45,932
below the surface

1992
01:17:45,932 --> 01:17:46,499
Of reinforced

1993
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:47,700
Concrete structures,

1994
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,832
There is a mesh

1995
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:50,700
Of steel reinforcing bars

1996
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,433
And they don't corrode

1997
01:17:52,433 --> 01:17:54,366
Because the concrete maintains

1998
01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:55,832
An alkaline environment

1999
01:17:55,832 --> 01:17:56,999
Around them.

2000
01:17:56,999 --> 01:17:58,433
Now, when that alkalinity

2001
01:17:58,433 --> 01:17:59,499
Breaks down,

2002
01:17:59,499 --> 01:18:00,865
As it will in time,

2003
01:18:00,865 --> 01:18:01,599
Then the steel

2004
01:18:01,599 --> 01:18:05,733
Will start to corrode.

2005
01:18:05,733 --> 01:18:07,633
as the steel rebar rusts,

2006
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:09,733
It expands to three times

2007
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:11,533
Its original volume

2008
01:18:11,533 --> 01:18:13,099
Creating an outward pressure

2009
01:18:13,099 --> 01:18:14,566
That causes the concrete

2010
01:18:14,566 --> 01:18:22,466
To crumble.

2011
01:18:22,466 --> 01:18:23,499
in very broad terms,

2012
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:24,566
After 50 years

2013
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:25,299
We'd start to see

2014
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:27,533
Surface cracking on concrete.

2015
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:29,066
After a hundred years,

2016
01:18:29,066 --> 01:18:31,166
Flaking of the concrete surface.

2017
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:32,800
After maybe 500 years,

2018
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,733
Most reinforced

2019
01:18:33,733 --> 01:18:34,965
Concrete structures

2020
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:38,932
Will be gone.

2021
01:18:38,932 --> 01:18:40,032
we look at these images

2022
01:18:40,032 --> 01:18:46,533
Of our fallen civilization,

2023
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:47,666
It helps us to identify

2024
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:48,766
With the past,

2025
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,466
With the Greeks and the Romans,

2026
01:18:50,466 --> 01:18:52,199
With the crumbled

2027
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,599
Mud brick cities of urn.

2028
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:55,299
Each of us knows

2029
01:18:55,299 --> 01:18:56,032
That our bodies

2030
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:59,266
Are going to fall apart;

2031
01:18:59,266 --> 01:19:03,999
Why not our cities too?

2032
01:19:08,899 --> 01:19:10,666
a thousand years ago,

2033
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:12,733
6 1/2 billion people

2034
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:16,533
Called this planet home.

2035
01:19:16,533 --> 01:19:19,066
At the early 21st century,

2036
01:19:19,066 --> 01:19:20,066
More than half of them

2037
01:19:20,066 --> 01:19:26,599
Lived in cities.

2038
01:19:26,599 --> 01:19:28,499
Now those cities

2039
01:19:28,499 --> 01:19:32,700
Are unrecognizable.

2040
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,099
after maybe a thousand years

2041
01:19:34,099 --> 01:19:35,800
Or so, the scene behind me

2042
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,399
Would be very, very different.

2043
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:39,399
There'll be very little evidence

2044
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,700
Of buildings,

2045
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:42,566
Very little evidence

2046
01:19:42,566 --> 01:19:44,266
Of the activities of man.

2047
01:19:44,266 --> 01:19:45,199
What we would see

2048
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:49,132
Would be a jungle of vegetation.

2049
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:50,499
the future of cities

2050
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:52,166
In a life after people

2051
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,733
Can be best imagined

2052
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:57,099
By looking to the past.

2053
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:58,199
this is minute street

2054
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,066
In Greenwich Village.

2055
01:20:00,066 --> 01:20:01,132
Most new Yorkers might come here

2056
01:20:01,132 --> 01:20:02,166
And wonder why it curves

2057
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:04,132
Like this.

2058
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:04,700
It curves

2059
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,865
Because once upon a time

2060
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:06,999
There was a stream here,

2061
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:08,466
And then a brook.

2062
01:20:08,466 --> 01:20:09,599
There were more than 40 streams

2063
01:20:09,599 --> 01:20:14,999
On Manhattan island.

2064
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:23,399
All flowing down

2065
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:24,700
And carrying the rainwater

2066
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,433
Down to the sea.

2067
01:20:27,433 --> 01:20:28,633
So what happens today?

2068
01:20:28,633 --> 01:20:30,832
The rain falls, the snow melts,

2069
01:20:30,832 --> 01:20:31,466
But it flows

2070
01:20:31,466 --> 01:20:32,865
Right along the street

2071
01:20:32,865 --> 01:20:34,032
And down into that storm drain

2072
01:20:34,032 --> 01:20:35,399
There.

2073
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:36,266
If there weren't people here

2074
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:37,466
Anymore, there'll be no one here

2075
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:38,999
To maintain the sidewalks

2076
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:40,299
And maintain the streets.

2077
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:41,766
They'd start to crumble up.

2078
01:20:41,766 --> 01:20:43,499
They'd start to break apart.

2079
01:20:43,499 --> 01:20:44,433
Trees would come back,

2080
01:20:44,433 --> 01:20:45,700
Vegetation would come back,

2081
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,232
And eventually

2082
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:47,466
The hydrological cycle

2083
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:48,965
Would reestablish itself.

2084
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:49,865
And who knows,

2085
01:20:49,865 --> 01:20:51,399
Maybe Minute Street

2086
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:52,366
Might once again

2087
01:20:52,366 --> 01:20:55,499
Become minute brook.

2088
01:20:55,499 --> 01:20:57,166
using historic maps

2089
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:58,666
And computer modeling,

2090
01:20:58,666 --> 01:20:59,733
Scientists

2091
01:20:59,733 --> 01:21:01,032
With the Manhattan project

2092
01:21:01,032 --> 01:21:02,800
Are rediscovering

2093
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,032
What Manhattan Island

2094
01:21:04,032 --> 01:21:05,932
Looked like when explorer

2095
01:21:05,932 --> 01:21:07,965
Henry Hudson first sailed

2096
01:21:07,965 --> 01:21:14,199
Around its shores in 1609.

2097
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:15,899
here we are in Foley square,

2098
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:16,733
The administrative center

2099
01:21:16,733 --> 01:21:17,965
Of New York City

2100
01:21:17,965 --> 01:21:18,865
And location to the famous

2101
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:22,299
Courthouses you see on TV.

2102
01:21:22,299 --> 01:21:23,366
This place hasn't always had

2103
01:21:23,366 --> 01:21:24,599
Such colossal buildings

2104
01:21:24,599 --> 01:21:26,299
And stony streets.

2105
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:28,399
Once upon a time, 400 years ago,

2106
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:29,666
The collect pond was here,

2107
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:30,865
The freshwater source

2108
01:21:30,865 --> 01:21:31,766
For New York City.

2109
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:33,132
Right behind me,

2110
01:21:33,132 --> 01:21:34,399
There was a stream that drained

2111
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:36,832
Down to the Hudson River shore,

2112
01:21:36,832 --> 01:21:37,399
Another stream

2113
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:38,865
To the east river.

2114
01:21:38,865 --> 01:21:39,499
And there was

2115
01:21:39,499 --> 01:21:40,132
This beautiful pond

2116
01:21:40,132 --> 01:21:40,733
That was nestled

2117
01:21:40,733 --> 01:21:43,166
In an amphitheater of hills.

2118
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:44,166
So what would happen

2119
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:44,700
If all the people

2120
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:49,599
Were to disappear?

2121
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:50,066
The buildings,

2122
01:21:50,066 --> 01:21:51,366
They would tumble down.

2123
01:21:51,366 --> 01:21:52,965
The soil would start to reform.

2124
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:53,832
Trees would start to grow

2125
01:21:53,832 --> 01:21:54,733
Out of them.

2126
01:21:54,733 --> 01:21:56,466
They would become the new hills,

2127
01:21:56,466 --> 01:21:57,199
The new amphitheater

2128
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,965
Around this place.

2129
01:22:00,965 --> 01:22:02,832
Nature would reestablish itself

2130
01:22:02,832 --> 01:22:03,832
And slowly bring this place

2131
01:22:03,832 --> 01:22:05,566
Back into the green heart

2132
01:22:05,566 --> 01:22:07,199
Of what it means to be here

2133
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:17,599
On planet earth.

2134
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,166
New York city,

2135
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:20,932
Like the rest of the planet,

2136
01:22:20,932 --> 01:22:34,999
Has changed radically.

2137
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:36,032
The transformation

2138
01:22:36,032 --> 01:22:39,466
Is most shocking in Times Square.

2139
01:22:39,466 --> 01:22:40,533
As the once beating

2140
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:43,132
Heart of the city is silenced

2141
01:22:43,132 --> 01:23:17,965
By nature's onslaught.

2142
01:23:17,965 --> 01:23:22,366
It's 10,000 years after people.

2143
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,633
Could it be possible

2144
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:28,132
After only 10 millennia

2145
01:23:28,132 --> 01:23:29,666
That humanity has vanished

2146
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:40,733
Without a trace?

2147
01:23:40,733 --> 01:23:42,766
Human scientists once predicted

2148
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:44,533
That our history and culture

2149
01:23:44,533 --> 01:23:46,166
Would live on through our radio

2150
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:48,599
And television broadcasts,

2151
01:23:48,599 --> 01:23:49,499
Which carry on

2152
01:23:49,499 --> 01:23:50,266
Through the universe

2153
01:23:50,266 --> 01:23:53,965
Toward the infinite,

2154
01:23:53,965 --> 01:23:55,399
Perhaps to be tuned in

2155
01:23:55,399 --> 01:23:57,166
By an intelligent species

2156
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:59,633
On a distant planet.

2157
01:23:59,633 --> 01:24:00,166
some people think

2158
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,700
That there's an expanding shell

2159
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,999
Of radio and television

2160
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:06,700
From earth, expanding outward

2161
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,199
Alerting the universe,

2162
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,299
"here we are

2163
01:24:10,299 --> 01:24:17,166
And this is our culture."

2164
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:17,899
Unfortunately,

2165
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:18,999
Recent calculations

2166
01:24:18,999 --> 01:24:21,566
By of all people, the SETI,

2167
01:24:21,566 --> 01:24:22,766
Search for extraterrestrial

2168
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:25,132
Intelligence group,

2169
01:24:25,132 --> 01:24:26,433
Has shown that all

2170
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:27,633
Of this dissipates

2171
01:24:27,633 --> 01:24:29,099
Within one and two light-years

2172
01:24:29,099 --> 01:24:32,566
Into noise.

2173
01:24:32,566 --> 01:24:34,299
if this is true,

2174
01:24:34,299 --> 01:24:35,733
Our signals won't even make it

2175
01:24:35,733 --> 01:24:37,266
Out to the newest star

2176
01:24:37,266 --> 01:24:42,832
Beyond the sun.

2177
01:24:45,533 --> 01:24:47,965
So what will remain 10,000 years

2178
01:24:47,965 --> 01:24:50,633
After people to tell the story

2179
01:24:50,633 --> 01:24:52,466
Of the once great civilizations

2180
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:54,832
That walked the earth?

2181
01:24:54,832 --> 01:24:57,066
Iron corrodes,

2182
01:24:57,066 --> 01:24:59,533
Concrete crumbles,

2183
01:24:59,533 --> 01:25:03,266
Wood and paper decay.

2184
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:05,066
Still, some of what man

2185
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:10,132
Built on earth remains.

2186
01:25:10,132 --> 01:25:11,232
The most colossal

2187
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:13,066
Of our stone structures

2188
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,132
Like the Great Wall of China

2189
01:25:15,132 --> 01:25:17,466
Have aged like mountains,

2190
01:25:17,466 --> 01:25:19,366
Subject to erosion,

2191
01:25:19,366 --> 01:25:21,499
But at such slow time scales,

2192
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,199
They will still be recognizable

2193
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:27,733
In some form for eons.

2194
01:25:27,733 --> 01:25:29,499
The great pyramid at Giza

2195
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,700
Is so massive that it lasts

2196
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,566
Long enough to be swallowed up

2197
01:25:33,566 --> 01:25:39,999
By the desert sands.

2198
01:25:39,999 --> 01:25:41,433
The hover dam

2199
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:42,700
Built to be as tough

2200
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,199
As the canyon walls around it

2201
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,199
Is one of the last

2202
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:47,599
Man-made structures

2203
01:25:47,599 --> 01:25:50,399
Still standing.

2204
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:53,466
But now thousands of years

2205
01:25:53,466 --> 01:25:54,899
In the future,

2206
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:56,932
Earth is about to be visited

2207
01:25:56,932 --> 01:25:57,965
By the last

2208
01:25:57,965 --> 01:26:04,533
Of the great collapses.

2209
01:26:04,533 --> 01:26:05,433
it's the environment

2210
01:26:05,433 --> 01:26:07,466
That eventually wins.

2211
01:26:07,466 --> 01:26:18,899
Earthquakes, sandstorms, rain.

2212
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:21,166
But there are a few exceptions.

2213
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:22,299
I would have to say

2214
01:26:22,299 --> 01:26:24,433
That mounts Rushmore,

2215
01:26:24,433 --> 01:26:26,999
Carved out of solid granite

2216
01:26:26,999 --> 01:26:30,266
In an ecologically stable place,

2217
01:26:30,266 --> 01:26:32,266
The only enemy it has

2218
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:35,899
Are wind-driven pellets of rain.

2219
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:36,800
I think that mount Rushmore

2220
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,166
May be around

2221
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:39,266
A hundred thousand years,

2222
01:26:39,266 --> 01:26:41,199
Possibly 200.

2223
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,266
Possibly even in time

2224
01:26:42,266 --> 01:26:45,199
To be looked at in awe

2225
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,999
By the earliest

2226
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:53,366
Of our replacements.

2227
01:26:53,366 --> 01:26:55,166
and who or what might

2228
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:59,832
Those replacements be?

2229
01:26:59,832 --> 01:27:02,333
Perhaps chimpanzees

2230
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:06,099
Might somehow make the leap.

2231
01:27:06,099 --> 01:27:08,666
but we have to consider this:

2232
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:10,333
Some scientists believe

2233
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:12,499
That it's easy for nature

2234
01:27:12,499 --> 01:27:13,266
To bring animals

2235
01:27:13,266 --> 01:27:15,666
Up to a clever level

2236
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:17,499
Where they might use tools,

2237
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:18,533
They might become masters

2238
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:21,733
Of their environment.

2239
01:27:21,733 --> 01:27:23,099
But the leap to being able

2240
01:27:23,099 --> 01:27:24,700
To stare at the sky

2241
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,965
And imagine a cosmos,

2242
01:27:27,965 --> 01:27:28,865
To be able

2243
01:27:28,865 --> 01:27:30,266
To contemplate yourself,

2244
01:27:30,266 --> 01:27:31,199
To be able to contemplate

2245
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:35,965
Your own role in the earth,

2246
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:37,066
This may be a leap

2247
01:27:37,066 --> 01:27:38,599
That was a sheer accident

2248
01:27:38,599 --> 01:27:40,733
For humanity.

2249
01:27:40,733 --> 01:27:41,433
In which case,

2250
01:27:41,433 --> 01:27:42,666
You're not talking

2251
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:45,132
About a complete recovery.

2252
01:27:45,132 --> 01:27:46,099
You're talking about a planet

2253
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:49,932
That may continue,

2254
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:51,466
But nobody to talk about it,

2255
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:56,399
Nobody to think about it.

2256
01:27:56,466 --> 01:27:57,066
if earth's

2257
01:27:57,066 --> 01:28:00,333
4 1/2 billion years of existence

2258
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:03,466
Were condensed into 24 hours,

2259
01:28:03,466 --> 01:28:06,299
The passage of 10,000 years

2260
01:28:06,299 --> 01:28:09,366
Would be a fraction of a second.

2261
01:28:09,366 --> 01:28:11,599
Man's time on the planet so far

2262
01:28:11,599 --> 01:28:12,299
Would be

2263
01:28:12,299 --> 01:28:17,333
About half a minute long.

2264
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,299
So, like an abandoned village

2265
01:28:19,299 --> 01:28:21,366
On a global scale,

2266
01:28:21,366 --> 01:28:22,666
The earth will move on

2267
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:24,333
Without us.

2268
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,266
There was life before people.

2269
01:28:26,965 --> 01:28:31,032
There will be life after people.
