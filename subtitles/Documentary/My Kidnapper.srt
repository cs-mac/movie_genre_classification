1
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:34,192
I guess not every girl in the world
has to wait in the hot sun...

2
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:36,925
for her father to get out of jail.

3
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,762
But I didn't care about that.

4
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,599
I just wanted us
to be together again.

5
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:45,437
I used to be pretty angry
at him. Eddie was, too.

6
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,806
We figured he kinda dumped us.

7
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:49,936
But it wasn't that simple.

8
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:53,448
We've all done a lot of growing up
since the bad old days.

9
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:56,679
You see,
the thing aboutJack...

10
00:00:56,752 --> 00:01:00,210
I don't know,
he kinda grows on ya.

11
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,892
Where is he?

12
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:17,371
Are you sure this is the day?
I don't think this is the day.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,273
He's comin'.

14
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,580
- There he is!
- Where?

15
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:34,479
Come on!

16
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,057
Dad!

17
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:43,388
Dad!

18
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:49,467
Look at us. The perfect,
happy family, right?

19
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:53,339
Well, trust me.
It wasn't always like this.

20
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,745
You can run for cover

21
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:10,291
You can run for help

22
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,850
You can run to your lover

23
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:17,332
But you can't ever run
from yourself

24
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,560
No, no, no

25
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:24,401
- How many times
have I told you about this?
- You're hurting me!

26
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,441
- I am not going to tell you again.
- Let me go!

27
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:28,943
- Shut up!
- I didn't do it. It wasn't my fault!

28
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,742
No matter how far you go

29
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:40,181
No matter how far you go

30
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:46,358
No matter how long you stay

31
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:49,592
You can run forever

32
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:52,099
But, darlin'you will never

33
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:56,366
Never find true happiness that way

34
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:27,493
- You're going on a trip.
- You're kidding me!

35
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,663
I-I've got this big deal goin'
down and I'm outta here, I rea--

36
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,832
Far away. Not alone.

37
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:35,206
Yeah, New Orleans. I mean,
it ain't no hop, skip and a jump.

38
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:37,268
So I mean, this is,
this is real good, right?

39
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:42,712
Wh-Wh--

40
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:45,652
Uh, uh, over all, I mean, y-y--
Please, Celeste, don't be tellin' me
no negative stuff.

41
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,713
I mean, I can't be havin'
nothin' draining my energy right now.

42
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,759
Draw another.

43
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:01,195
Just gotta think positive.

44
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,501
Now, come on! He's got a couple of kids
and no wife to look after them.

45
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:06,837
Now don't that
mean anything to you?

46
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,639
Well, yeah--
He, he got a fo--

47
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:11,703
All right, all right, all right!

48
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:14,545
I'll talk to my client.

49
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:16,414
Don't be using her
for your games.

50
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:19,454
Jack, if you hadn't put
your kids in foster care...

51
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:21,319
they would've knocked
six months off your sentence.

52
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,022
I didn't put 'em nowhere.
Linda died and the State took 'em.

53
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:31,965
Now I ain't happy about that, but they're doin' just fine and so am I.

54
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:34,468
Now, what's the deal?

55
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:36,937
Well, considering everything,
we did pretty well.

56
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,338
The D.A. says we can plea bargain it
down to two years.

57
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:42,571
Two years for what?
I robbed drug dealers.

58
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:48,242
That's right, until you robbed an
undercover cop posing as a drug dealer.

59
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:52,344
Look, I'm gonna tell you something.
I ain't goin' to jail.

60
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:56,755
I am this close to doin' a deal where I'm
gonna see more money than you can imagine.

61
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:59,886
And I ain't lettin' nothin'
mess it up. You got me?

62
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:02,487
Jack, this is so easy.

63
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:05,557
If we do go to trial, I call
the kids in. We put them on--

64
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:08,467
Leave the kids out
of it, all right?

65
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:11,734
The best thing I ever did for them
was keepin' out of their lives...

66
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,401
and keeping them outta mine.

67
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:17,071
Okay!

68
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:19,341
We see the judge in two days.

69
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:23,476
Now, you think you can stay
out of trouble for two days?

70
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:27,386
Of course!

71
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:32,257
How sweet it is
to be loved by you

72
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:35,764
Yes, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh

73
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:39,892
How sweet it is
to be loved by you

74
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:44,234
Ooh, baby

75
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:49,005
I needed the shelter
of someone's arms

76
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:52,138
And there you were

77
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:55,377
- Who is it?
- Kelly.

78
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:59,410
- Kelly who?
- Very funny!Just open the door.

79
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,791
Hi, Daddy.

80
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:08,825
- Oh, you've changed.
- Yeah, well, you haven't!

81
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:15,532
And I'm runnin', right?
And then the alarm's going off.

82
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,767
I'm like, ''Kelly, you better
get over this fence, man.''

83
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:23,369
Do you know what they do to kids who try
and get outta that place? Bigelow Hall.

84
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:25,640
Well, I'll tell you what. You oughta
look at it a little more positively...

85
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:29,445
like, uh, a little bit like,
um, prep school.

86
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:32,248
It's really sick in there.

87
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:36,587
Kids are getting hit
all the time.

88
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,820
I mean, hit really hard.

89
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:42,489
You do one thing wrong, and someone's
comin' after you with something...

90
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,965
or, or slammin' you
up against a wall.

91
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:47,434
And Lazzaro, the guy
who runs the place?

92
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:52,668
He never uses his hands, but he knows
what's goin' on and he just lets it happen.

93
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:54,641
You are outta here,
little girl.

94
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,940
'Cause this is gonna be the first place they look for you.

95
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,776
- Then get me transferred.
- I can't do that.

96
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,979
Yes, you can! They have
to listen to you,Jack. It's the law.

97
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:06,886
Finish your pizza
and you're gone.

98
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,925
What about Eddie?
Remember Eddie?

99
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:17,125
- What about Eddie?
- They're putting him in Bigelow tomorrow.

100
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,997
No. No, ma'am.

101
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,629
He is in Humboldt
with that foster family.

102
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:27,768
No, he's not! They're putting him
in Bigelow tomorrow like a prisoner.

103
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:31,074
He has never done one thing wrong
except to have you as a father.

104
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:34,047
- See you smile
- God!

105
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:37,176
Little girl,
you back off now.

106
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:42,123
You know, when they put him
in Bigelow...

107
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,284
they'll put him in handcuffs.

108
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,922
Just get into that, why don't you?
Your own little boy in handcuffs.

109
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:52,365
-Seven years old!
-I thought he was five.

110
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,548
- Yo, hello.
- Hey,Jack, is that you?

111
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,679
- Hey, hey,Jerry.
- Did I wake you up, man? You sound like--

112
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:16,224
No, man, I've been up for hours.
What's the deal?

113
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:19,261
- Are you in there?
- Don't call him.

114
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:22,957
I'm in. You sure it's
a quarter of a million?

115
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:26,126
Just sittin' there waitin' for us. Come on!

116
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:29,466
Baby. Okay, well,
sit tight, stay cool...

117
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:33,235
and I will be in New Orleans
before your rice begins to boil.

118
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:37,277
Okay, later.

119
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:52,885
You know, we could go pick up Eddie.
I mean, then it just wouldn't be the two of us.

120
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,795
And, I don't know, we could
all have a lot of fun.

121
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:59,231
True love, baby
that's what you give to me

122
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:04,336
Your love
Your love

123
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:08,206
Where are we going?
This is the way to Bigelow.

124
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,177
You can't do this to me,Jack.
You're my father!

125
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:14,045
Look, face facts!
I was never your father.

126
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:17,415
You understand me?
I hate all this family crap.

127
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:20,512
- I'm gonna jump out of this car.
- Be my guest!

128
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,184
- Fine!
- What are you doin'? Get in here!

129
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,059
- Get in here! You'll get me killed.
- I don't care, all right?

130
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,360
Are you crazy?

131
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:34,334
Look, I'm gonna tell you something.
I am outta here. You got me?

132
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:37,304
Why can't you just
get me transferred?

133
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:40,672
I mean, what about Eddie?
Um, are you even gonna talk to them?

134
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:44,008
- You're just gonna let 'em
throw him in Bigelow?
- Hell yes!

135
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:53,046
All right. If I get them
to put you someplace else...

136
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:57,149
will you stay put
and stop hassling me, huh?

137
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:01,596
You give me something, baby
I can't forget

138
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:05,497
You give me your love
Your love

139
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,434
Stay put and don't touch--
Ohh!

140
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,774
I need another day in court
like a hole in the head.

141
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:25,052
So, since his mother died, I have been very
concerned about, you know, their welfare.

142
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:27,247
And that's the reason
we gotta do something about it...

143
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,722
at least until we can come
together again as a family.

144
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:33,751
'Cause as far as I'm concerned, there ain't
nothing more important than a man's family.

145
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:38,732
- You're the boy's father?
- Well, uh, we never did
blood tests, but yeah.

146
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:42,760
Mr. Charles, do you know
what these are?

147
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:45,432
Uh, I believe those
are folders, Your Honor.

148
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:50,510
No. These are lives,
very young lives.

149
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,809
And it's my job to make
a hundred judgments a day...

150
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:56,282
about what would be best
for each of these lives.

151
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:59,286
Well, excuse me, Your Honor, but, you know,
I know a little bit about young lives, too.

152
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,686
All right? Because
I grew up in these places.

153
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:04,749
And what I Know is I can't have them running around trying to find me all the 
time.

154
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:08,126
And that's the reason I want them out
of this Bigelow place and into this--

155
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:11,325
Weel, Bigelow happens to be one of the finest institutions of its Kind in the 
country.

156
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,733
Pardon me, Your Honor. Uh, not that I want
to get into this here with you right now...

157
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:16,430
because, you know,
I'm a very positive kind of person.

158
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:18,439
But this Bigelow place, man,
I'm tellin' you.

159
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:22,341
The-They're abusing the kids,
they got 'em running away and
I'll tell you one more thing.

160
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:26,279
-Well, I can hardly wait.
-They're handcuffing these children.

161
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:30,148
I'm tellin' you. Little Kids in handcuffs. They're cuffing these Kids.

162
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:32,187
I'm serious.

163
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:38,151
Mr. Lazzaro, would you
approach the bench, please?

164
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:46,128
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Lazzaro, would
you please tell the court...

165
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,965
a-and Mr. Charles...

166
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:51,028
is it the policy of the
Youth Services Administration...

167
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:57,011
to use handcuffs or any other
form of restraint on children?

168
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,946
-No, of course not, Your Honor.
-They're handcuffin' these Kids.

169
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:01,277
- Then they got 'em starvin'.
- Mr. Charles!

170
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,443
- Their wrists are scarred.
- Mr. Charles?

171
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,146
- Sorry.
- May I remind you you're in a courtroom?

172
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,984
Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry, but
th-th-this Lasagna dude's lyin'.

173
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:11,116
-Just look at him.
- Your Honor, Kelly Charles has been missing...

174
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:13,661
from our facility since last night.

175
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:19,031
Mr. Charles, although he has abandoned
her, may be giving her safe haven.

176
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,365
- Is this true?
- Your Honor, all I'm tryin' to ask...

177
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,996
- is this San Diego place any good?
- Mr. Charles, if you don't mind.

178
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:26,404
Young Edward Charles,
who is right now in our van, he--

179
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,807
- Yeah, probably in handcuffs, no doubt.
- Mr. Charles!

180
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:31,345
I am sorry, Your Honor.

181
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:34,678
Look, can I at least see the kid?

182
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,844
As a reward for your exemplary
behavior in my courtroom?

183
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,854
I said I was sorry.

184
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:43,551
I mean, if this dude can see him,
I can see him. I demand to see him now!

185
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:49,325
Please.
I say get down,yeah

186
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:10,675
Edward, this is your father.

187
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:14,085
Yo, uh, Eddie, what's happenin'?

188
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,224
- You, uh, doin' all right?
- Dad!

189
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:26,233
Yo, hey! Yo, hey,
be, be cool, kid.

190
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:29,270
- You come to take me home?
- Well, you know, um--

191
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,037
Uh, you eatin' enough? Uh, looks
like you'd be bigger or somethin'.

192
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:37,340
Dad, please, you gotta take
me home. I hate it in there.

193
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:38,709
All right, that's it.
You're upsetting the child.

194
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,509
Hey, hey, wait!
I'm still talkin' to the kid.

195
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:44,746
Your Honor, I cannot stand idly by
while Mr. Charles agitates the child.

196
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,220
This visit is detrimental
to the child's welfare.

197
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,120
Hey, what do you know
about it? He's my kid.

198
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:54,151
Correction, Mr. Charles, it's my kid.
You gave him to me two years ago.

199
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,457
- No!
- Keep your hands off of him,jerk.

200
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,327
Please!

201
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,596
You asked to see your son.

202
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:04,867
Nobody, nobody messes or takes
with Jack Charles, you get me?

203
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,500
You get me?
I'll seal your fate, baby.

204
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,650
That boy just messed
with the wrong guy.

205
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,914
- What happened?
- Why'd you lie to me about the handcuffs?

206
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:23,287
I am not lying! I mean, who are you
gonna believe, them or me?

207
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,733
There he is.

208
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:39,865
That son-of-a-- He lied to me.
He lied to me!

209
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:43,308
- See? I told you.
- Oh, shut up.

210
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:50,149
All right, baby,
cover your face.

211
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:52,686
All right.

212
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,269
Put on your seat belt now!

213
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,247
Hey!

214
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:25,650
- What the hell is this about?
- Hello, baby, get in there!

215
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,985
- What is this?
- This is visiting hours.

216
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:30,820
- Dad!
- Hello, class. I'm your substitute teacher.

217
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,656
And our first lesson today is how to mess with a real scumbag.

218
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:36,129
Sit down!

219
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:38,996
- Unlock him.
- Dad, I knew you'd come for me.

220
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,728
- Yeah, sure.
- Dad, the driver!

221
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:44,067
Unless you wanna get hurt,
I'd sit down and shut up now.

222
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,733
- Okay, all right, all right.
- Sit down!

223
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:49,299
Mister, I don't wanna have
my baby in this place.

224
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:52,074
- What do I look like, a halfway house?
- Take her,Jack, she's a friend.

225
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:54,775
- You get in the car now!
- Please!

226
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:00,219
All right, unlock her, too.
Hurry up!

227
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:06,719
- Thanks.
- Poor little civil servant,
just tryin' to do his job, huh?

228
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:09,923
- Come on, let's go!
- Well, it's your turn in the barrel.

229
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:14,162
Pucker up, sweetheart.
Eat it.

230
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,602
- Huh?
- Right now! Eat it.

231
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:19,196
Yeah. Yeah!

232
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,743
Now swallow it.

233
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:28,112
Mmm-mmm, good.
And so good for you.

234
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:30,674
- Good boy.
- Good boy.

235
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:37,548
Did you see that sucker?

236
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,924
- Whoa!
- Who is this guy?

237
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,699
- He's my dad!
- In your dreams, kid.

238
00:16:57,412 --> 00:17:00,176
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey,Jack, we got company.

239
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:02,443
Uh-oh. Hang on!

240
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:06,453
-Jack, he's right behind us.
- Here we go!

241
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:12,053
Watch out! Watch out!

242
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:26,307
That sucker ain't
following us now!

243
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:30,037
- Radical, Dad!
- Don't call me that.

244
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:37,310
So, where can I dump you,
whatever your name is?

245
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:41,185
Whatever happens, I am
never going back to that place.

246
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,520
Just wait a minute, okay?

247
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:45,059
-You're gonna be fine.
-I Know.

248
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:46,718
- I love you.
- Come on, we ain't got all day.

249
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:47,887
- You take care, all right.
- Bye.

250
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:50,295
- Hurry up!
- Bye.

251
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:54,165
Geez, Mr. Impatient!
What are we in such a hurry for?

252
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,672
So, are you taking us
with you?

253
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:00,367
They're never gonna transfer us
now that you kidnapped us,Jack.

254
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:03,775
Yeah, Dad,
what are we gonna do?

255
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:07,337
We're goin' to Grandma's house.

256
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:14,148
- Now what?
- Your Grandma likes to play here.

257
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:16,911
Stay put and don't move.

258
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,385
I'll be back.

259
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,454
Ladies and gentlemen in the gambling hall
area, please place your bets right now.

260
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,261
- Place your bets now.
- I learned how to shake
these dice playin' Parcheesi.

261
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,393
That's right,
playin' Parcheesi.

262
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:36,528
- Now I win if I get a seven?

263
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:39,073

- Yeah, you won! You won, sweetheart.
- My God! Land sakes alive!

269
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:58,250
If Henry could see me now!

270
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:00,556
- Mom, I've gotta talk to you. Now.
- Not now.

271
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:02,995
- Now, I gotta talk to you--
- I gotta put these little winnings in here.

272
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:05,157
- And, yeah, put these

Yeah, yeah, yeah, on the field.
Ye, yep, yep.

275
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:12,370
Yep, nope, nope.
Man, she's got it down, doesn't she?

276
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,704
- A little backup there. All right!

277
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,074
- 'cause the shooters comin' out.

283
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,320
Lady. Excuse me, lady.
I need to talk to you.

284
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:36,023
Oh, no, she's on
a winnin' streak, man.

285
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:40,500
- What's wrong?
- I got a pain here. It hurts.
It hurts. Oh, God! Oh!

286
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:43,264
- Somebody help the la-la--
G-G-Get somebody to help her.
- Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

287
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:46,398
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

288
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,534
- Call 91 1 .
-John, get 91 1 .

289
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:56,274
What in the hell did you think you were
doin' in there? Didn't I teach you nothin'?

290
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:59,047
Comin' in there dressed like some hood
when I had those suckers...

291
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,850
set up this close to
gettin' me some serious money.

292
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:05,689
This close? I'll tell you what you were
this close to: goin' to jail, sweetheart.

293
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,526
- I rescued your butt just like I always do.
- Oh-ho, oh-ho. Rescued my butt?

294
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,963
- Yes, ma'am. You know I did.
- Goin' to jail? Please don't tell me...

295
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:14,126
-you're goin' to jail again.
- I got something much more
important to talk to you about.

296
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:15,499
- Okay?
- Important?

297
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,438
I brought your grandchildren
to see you.

298
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:23,341
- I thought they were in foster.
- Nope. They're here to see their Grandma.

299
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:27,279
- Say hi to your Grandma.
- Hi, Grandma. I'm Eddie.

300
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:29,976
- Grandma.
- Deal with it.

301
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:35,320
Sugar!
Gimme some sugar.

302
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,486
- How are you, you cute thing?
- So, how 'bout it?

303
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:43,262
- One night.
- Deal.

304
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,526
Yeah. Ha-ha. Let's go!

305
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:49,195
- Let's rock. We're goin' to Grandma's house.
- Hi, Grandma.

306
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,295
Hi, guys.
You're gonna love my place.

307
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:57,702
So, what do you think?

308
00:21:57,779 --> 00:21:59,872
Not a lot.

309
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:10,522
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

310
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:13,390
Are you coloring
in your sideburns?

311
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:15,452
So what if I am?

312
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,591
I got a image to keep up.
And I got gaps.

313
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:22,431
Yeah, well, where
are you goin' anyway?

314
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:26,440
- It's late.
- So what am I supposed to do, baby-sit?

315
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:29,739
Yeah, well, if you spend all our money
on a hooker, I'm gonna kill you, okay?

316
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:31,904
You are treadin'
on thin water, sweetheart.

317
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,642
It's thin ice,Jack.

318
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:38,277
I mean, you are coming back, right?
You're not just gonna leave us here.

319
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:42,255
Now how can I eave somebody when I ain't with ' em in the first place?

320
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:53,962
Go to bed!

321
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:56,265
You're not my mom.

322
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:04,276
Will you--
Will you move?

323
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:08,779
- Aha!
- What is your problem?

324
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,513
I knew it! You were going to run off
and leave me with your kids.

325
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:14,316
- Weren't you? Admit it!
- I was not!

326
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:17,051
I'm in major party mode.
I'm goin' out playin'.

327
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:21,289
You are not going to lay your
responsibilities on Mother's shoulders.

328
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:24,559
You gotta take these kids, Mama,
just for a little while, please?

329
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,657
Hello!

330
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:29,726
I got a major deal goin' down
in New Orleans.

331
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:33,831
This briefcase comes in once a month and it is filled with cash.

332
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:38,004
Just a minute,Jack. This is the first time in my life that I can think about me.

333
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,448
- It is my turn!
- This is my big chance, Mama.

334
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:45,077
If I don't get outta here,
I go to jail.

335
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:48,145
You are going
to work this out yourself.

336
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:54,887
I give up. I can't talk to you.
I can never talk to you.

337
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:17,051
- Whoa!
-Jack, wake up. Get your backside outta bed.

338
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:19,177
Jack, I said wake up.

339
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,357
- What now?
- I want you to look at this!

340
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:26,120
- Read this.
- Um, ah--

341
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:28,924
Well, look at it!

342
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:31,227
- Oh, my!
- You see it?

343
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,765
Hey, Dad, did you know
we're close to the Hoover Dam?

344
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:12,431
- So what?
- So, I'd like to see it?

345
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:14,839
Where did they get this picture of me?
I look like a total geek.

346
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,843
Let's see.

347
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:20,369
Mine ain't bad.

348
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:23,884
Hey,Jack, this says
you've been in jail three times.
I thought you only did time twice.

349
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:26,318
- They don't know nothing.
- Dad, I'm hungry.

350
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:30,721
Listen to this,
''Charles terrorized the children
on the Youth Services bus. He then--''

351
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:34,888
That's not true.
Those kids liked ya, Dad.

352
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:38,262
Does, does anybody here like Egg McMuffins?

353
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:42,702
- ''Armed with an M-1 6
automatic assault rifle--''
- M-1 6? Let me see that!

354
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:46,097
God! They're
gonna get me killed!

355
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:49,007
Now they're gonna shoot to kill,
they're gonna bring out the helicopters.

356
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:51,068
These jerks will do anything
for a headline.

357
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:54,808
- Who's writin' that crap?
- Um, Kathleen Mercer.

358
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:58,249
Ha. I'm gonna handle her case.

359
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,777
- First thing I gotta do is dump this car.
- Oh, no, I like this car.

360
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,723
- Oh, shut up!
- Well, at least they got one thing right.

361
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,818
''The mental state of this individual
is highly unpredictable.''

362
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:09,453
- Let me see that.
- That's cute.

363
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,521
- It's my turn!
- Get off of me!

364
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,157
- You've had it for a long time.
Give it to me!
- Oh, back off.

365
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:15,429
I'm not finished yet, all right?

366
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:17,767
- Get off of me!
- It's my turn. You've had it a long time.

367
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,966
Oh, give it a rest!
-I7m not finished with it, all right?

368
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,771
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

369
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:25,278
You stay on your side of the car.
You stay on yours.

370
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:28,076
You mess with each other again,
I'm gonna mess with you, all right?

371
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,617
I'm sick of you!
I can't take this!

372
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:33,483
Well, I hope we get caught
so I can get rid of you.

373
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,290
Look what you made me do.
I was speeding!

374
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:43,228
- You guys are bad luck.
- Well, maybe he's just
gonna give us a warning.

375
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:46,289
A warning? Girlfriend,
our picture's in the paper.

376
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,801
Now sit that thing under
the seat so he, he doesn't see it.

377
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,360
Well, I didn't tell you
to speed, did I?

378
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:52,429
Maybe, maybe he didn't see
the paper today.

379
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:56,534
Okay, dude, let's play, baby.
C'mon up here.

380
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:02,110
C'mon! C'mon!

381
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:06,612
Let's rock!

382
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:16,461
Well, the news of the saucer's
been flyin'around

383
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:19,056
He was havin'a walk
seein'over the ground

384
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,795
First at the scene
he was soarin'and then

385
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:24,429
Got drunk and started a band

386
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,201
Flyin'saucer rock n'roll

387
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:29,539
Flyin'saucer rock n'roll

388
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,238
I couldn't understand
a thing they said

389
00:27:32,313 --> 00:27:34,747
It was a crazy beat
just a-knockin'me dead, huh

390
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,788
- So, we havin' fun yet?
- Yeah, Dad. Floor it!

391
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,461
Well, them little green men
they knew that cat

392
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:58,130
Rockin'and a-rollin'
to the lazy cats

393
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:00,674
Faster, Dad!

394
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:03,403
Brought out the drums
and he started to roll

395
00:28:03,478 --> 00:28:05,946
Flyin'saucer rock n'roll

396
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:08,345
Flyin'saucer rock n'roll

397
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,782
I couldn't understand
a thing that they said

398
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,717
Get off me, sucker.

399
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:15,119
He's still comin'!

400
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:18,625
- Dad, go in a zigzag or something.
- Don't tell me what to do.

401
00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:21,127
Yeah!

402
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:28,194
Okay, sucker,
now it's my turn!

403
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:36,602
Flyin'saucer rock n'roll
Flyin'saucer

404
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,474
Holy shit!

405
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:40,605
I couldn't understand
a thing they said

406
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:45,175
It was a crazy beat
just a-knockin'me dead

407
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,027
We did it! We did it!

408
00:28:57,698 --> 00:29:03,034
I haven't seen Jackie in say,
oh, I guess it's been two years.

409
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,267
Uh,Jackie? Does he go
by any other name than Jackie?

410
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,969
He gets so upset
when I call him Jackie.

411
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:15,175
But you know how boys are.
You know what I mean?

412
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:20,243
Get off my side. Get-- Stop it!
Dad, she's on my side of the line again.

413
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:21,913
-Just sit down, please. I'm asking.
- I am not.

414
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:25,390
You're always on my side of the line.
Why don't you get off me?

415
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,656
-Jack, would you please
make him stop jiggling his foot?
- I'm not jiggling!

416
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:30,560
- Yes, you are. You jiggle all the time.
- You're jiggling!

417
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,998
- You're so stupid!
- At least I have the sixth grade reading level.

418
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:36,935
- Get off my side!
-Jack, I'm hungry.

419
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:39,063
Ju-- Too bad. Too bad.

420
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,506
- I have low blood sugar.
- Mom had that, too.

421
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:42,975
- I do, too.
- You don't remember her.

422
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:44,477
- Dad, I gotta take a piss!
- Will you shut up?

423
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:46,706
If I don't eat,
I'm gonna pass out.

424
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:49,341
- Shut up, shut up.
- Dad, Dad, I have to go to the bathroom.

425
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,816
- Shut up. Time--
- Would you please get over...

426
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:53,911
-Just shut up!
- and stop jiggling your feet!

427
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:58,890
- Get out, get out. Get out. Get out.
- Get off my side!

428
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,121
- What are you--
- Get up. Get out!

429
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,220
Get out of my car now!

430
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:06,494
- Dad, what are you doing? Are you nuts?
- I can't take you!

431
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:10,731
- Dad, where are you going?
- I'm not your father!

432
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:13,865
- Where are you going?
- Snotty little dirt bags!

433
00:30:19,013 --> 00:30:23,006
You jerks are gonna get me killed.
You're drivin' me crazy!

434
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:27,020
- Oh, great! What are we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

435
00:30:28,923 --> 00:30:32,051
They deserve to be in that
juvenile home. They're animals!

436
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,488
Little jerks.

437
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:41,194
Good riddance!

438
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:53,303
Shit!

439
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:10,027
I don't like you

440
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:12,224
But I love you

441
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,031
Seems that I'm always

442
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,333
Thinkin'of you

443
00:31:18,406 --> 00:31:23,400
Though-whoa-whoa
you treat me bad, babe

444
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:27,140
I love ya madly
You really got a hold on me

445
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:31,207
- Dad?
- Don't even think about it.

446
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:35,779
Oh, we're so close to the Hoover Dam.
Please, Dad,just once? I wanna see it.

447
00:31:37,058 --> 00:31:39,390
Come on,Jack,just stop.
He's never gonna shut up.

448
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:44,093
We could get a car there.

449
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,366
I was already planning
on doin' that.

450
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:51,838
Don't wanna kiss you
but I need you

451
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:55,171
Though-whoa-whoa
you do me wrong

452
00:31:55,242 --> 00:31:57,733
- Kelly, check this out!
- What for?

453
00:31:57,812 --> 00:32:00,610
It's amazing!

454
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:06,078
Dad, do you have
any more quarters?

455
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,420
Yeah, can I speak
to a Kathleen Mercer, please?

456
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:17,896
-Jimmy, I need that copy!
- Okay, I got it!

457
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:20,297
Kathleen, you have
a Jack Charles on one.

458
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:22,768
-Jack who?
- He says it's important.

459
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,805
Oh! Right.

460
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:29,365
- Kathleen Mercer speaking.
- So, what are you tryin' to do?
Get me killed?

461
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:31,707
What is this crap
you're writin', sweetheart?

462
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,247
- What do you have to tell me, Mr. Charles?
- What do I have to tell you?

463
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:37,876
Okay, point number one:
I didn't have no M-1 6!

464
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:39,886
Point number two:
these are my kids!

465
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:44,015
You got me kidnaping my own kids
when I'm tryin' to save the little jerks.

466
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,821
Mm-hmm. Hold on for a second.
City desk. Mercer speaking.

467
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:49,556
H-Ho-- What?

468
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,531
I don't believe this.

469
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,330
- Saving them from what, Mr. Charles?
- What is your problem?

470
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:59,703
What do you think,
I'm some nobody to put me on hold?
You call yourself a reporter?

471
00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:02,902
Let me ask you something.
Where did you get this rubbish?

472
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:05,138
Did you just make this junk up?

473
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:08,909
Look, do you have anything in the form
of information that you'd like to tell me?

474
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:10,610
Yeah, I got something to say.

475
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:14,347
I am tryin' to save my kids.
You are not helping.

476
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:17,118
- So the blood is gonna be
on your hands, sweetheart.
- Oh!

477
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:20,217
But I'd like to ask you
one thing. Now you got kids?

478
00:33:20,294 --> 00:33:24,424
Ah, come off it, Mr. Charles. You abandoned
those kids and you didn't visit 'em once.

479
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,558
And now you're facing
ten to 1 2 years in jail.

480
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,830
And because of you,
it's gonna be 50!

481
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:33,738
Look, if you've got something
real to say, then say it.

482
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:35,935
Real? Let me ask you something.
What is real to you?

483
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,707
I have been tryin' to bust this
foster care racket for over a year now.

484
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,807
But it's against the law for a journalist
to talk to a minor. So here's something real.

485
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:47,945
Ask your daughter if she's ever taken a field trip to Yosemite National Park.

486
00:33:48,022 --> 00:33:50,047
And then ask her how many
times a week she ate meat.

487
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:52,922
What? Wh-Wh-What are you talkin' about?
Are you tryin' to give me
some kind of runaround?

488
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:56,429
Just get me some details, all right?
That's how you get a story like this.

489
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:59,694
You follow the money.

490
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,668
- Back off. Let's go. Back off.
- jack? Jack?

491
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:04,727
Are you listenin'to me,Jack?

492
00:34:04,805 --> 00:34:07,069
Jack!

493
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:14,608
Get over here. Get over here. Get over here.
Hurry up. Get over here. Fast, fast!

494
00:34:14,682 --> 00:34:16,673
- What's goin' on?
- Look behind you.

495
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,709
Now you guys, stay here, don't move.
I'll be back. I'm gonna get a car.

496
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:34,757
The sooner we do this, the sooner you
people can go. So, please, everybody out.

497
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:40,066
How is he gonna get a car
with all those cops there?

498
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,335
I don't know!

499
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,741
It's your stupid idea to come here in the first place.

500
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,473
Leave me alone.

501
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:03,450
Dad!

502
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:29,413
Psst! Yo!

503
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:32,279
-Jack!
- Dad!

504
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:35,254
- Shut up!
- But you're alive.

505
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:39,486
- Come on, let's go. Let's party.
- Come on.

506
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,428
Those suckers are so stupid!

507
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,175
I hate foreign cars!

508
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,385
Did you see that sucker?

509
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:08,353
Dra-kaboom!

510
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:18,063
What? What is the crybaby crap?

511
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:20,965
- He thought you were dead, okay?
- Dead? Dead?

512
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:23,333
It was the coolest thing I ever
saw in my life. Did you see it?

513
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:25,702
It was like Schwarzenegger.
It was like TV.

514
00:37:25,773 --> 00:37:27,900
- It was amazing!
- Yeah, it was real great!

515
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:31,103
Now instead of a couple cops after us,
there's probably gonna be a hundred!

516
00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:33,703
You guys are wet blankets.
I can't take it.

517
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:36,375
I gotta be around
somethin' more positive.

518
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:44,582
This is Andrea of unit five.
We're in pursuit.

519
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:47,991
We'll notify on contact.
Unit five out.

520
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:10,846
- Please,just leave me alone.
- Shh. Hey, hey, hey.

521
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:15,116
You know, I looked for you
last night.

522
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:18,750
- Don't you disappoint me again, sweetheart.
- MacDougall.

523
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:20,760
- Mr. MacDougall?
- Go on, get out.

524
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:25,765
- May I have a word with you?
- What's up, Chief?

525
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,666
I got a call from the L.A. Post.

526
00:38:28,736 --> 00:38:31,705
-Jack Charles phoned in.
- And?

527
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:34,673
This woman reporter has been trying
to smear our facility for a year.

528
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:37,233
She's totally irresponsible.

529
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:41,407
Sometimes I just don't understand
what makes people so vindictive.

530
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:43,211
You know, I'd love to say to her...

531
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:46,582
''Miss Mercer, if you think you can do
a better job with these children...

532
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:51,352
you are welcome to take several
of them home with you.''

533
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:54,690
Well, in the meantime,
Mr. MacDougall, uh...

534
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:57,253
just try to keep everything
shipshape around here.

535
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:10,272
Did you love Mom?

536
00:39:10,344 --> 00:39:14,246
Dad, what are we gonna do
past Flagstaff?

537
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:19,011
Well, uh, they'll figure Mexico.

538
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:22,613
but we're gonna go east
and fool 'em all.

539
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:25,487
So, did you?

540
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,584
What are you tryin' to do,
make conversation?

541
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:31,825
- Forget it.
- We can take the 1 80 right into Texas, okay?

542
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:34,390
Yep.

543
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:38,029
So, Kelly, when you were
at Bigelow, did, um--

544
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:41,302
Did you ever go to
Yosemite National Park?

545
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,673
What are you talking about?

546
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:46,338
I don't know.

547
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:49,143
Steak, what about steak?
You ever eat steak?

548
00:39:49,216 --> 00:39:52,014
You'll talk about anything except
what I want to talk about, won't you?

549
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:55,179
-Just answer me!
- We never went anywhere.

550
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:58,486
I don't want to go to
Yosemite National Park anyway.

551
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,858
The only time I ever saw a steak was when
I had to clean up the custodians' dining room.

552
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:04,727
Okay? Happy?

553
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:07,460
Now answer my question.

554
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:10,594
Did you love her?

555
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:12,400
She was a
good-looking woman.

556
00:40:14,575 --> 00:40:19,877
We'd walk down the streets of Reno,
and every head would turn to look at her.

557
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:24,043
She was a tough cookie though. And legs,
girlfriend, she had legs up to her chin.

558
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:27,679
Actually, you look a lot like her.

559
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:31,053
Well, who could tell though,
with those dumb-looking
high-water pants and army boots.

560
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,356
The problem was...

561
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,921
her legs were a little too long.

562
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:43,527
She sure liked the good life.

563
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,110
Good morning! I'm Chad Carter, and here's what's happening.

564
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:02,019
Here's Tony Mosdy
with News 9 1.

565
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:05,684
- Stop it!
- The search for L.A. mobster
jack Charles continues.

566
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:08,159
- Uh-oh, not again.
- The search has widened
to include six states...

567
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,924
- Shut up!
- and personnel from over
30 local police forces...

568
00:41:10,998 --> 00:41:13,364
as well as the FBI.

569
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:17,267
- On the weather front,
morning patchy clouds--
- The FBI?

570
00:41:17,337 --> 00:41:19,498
- Cool! The whole world's looking for us.
- Damn.

571
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:24,533
Gangster. Mobster. The way these
squirrel-peckered, numb nuts
use the damn English language...

572
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:27,205
makes me wanna puke!

573
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,785
I gotta pull in
and make a call.

574
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:37,290
Hey, Dad, could you grab me
something to eat? I'm starving.

575
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:48,960
Girlfriend, you ain't doin'jack
about gettin' 'em off my trail.

576
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:51,937
Well, you're not exactly doin'jack
about doin' anything to help me, either.

577
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:53,802
Okay. Okay.

578
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:57,310
She ain't never been to
no Yosemite National Park...

579
00:41:57,377 --> 00:41:59,208
and she ain't never ate a steak.

580
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:02,442
Well, now, isn't that interesting.

581
00:42:02,516 --> 00:42:04,780
I've got reimbursement sheets,
and Lazzaro's charged the State...

582
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:07,342
for two trips to Yosemite
this past year.

583
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:08,786
And he was given money
for steak dinners...

584
00:42:08,855 --> 00:42:11,949
on Tuesdays and Saturdays
for the past three years.

585
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:14,391
That's another $30,000.

586
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:18,295
So now, are you gonna change your
stories and get 'em off my butt or what?

587
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:23,803
- He's been in there a long time.
- He probably snuck out the back.

588
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,804
Cut it out, Kelly.
He's our dad.

589
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:34,645
- He took us.
- He didn't take us! We took him.

590
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,376
I don't care. I love him.

591
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,884
You don't know what love is.

592
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:42,115
I mean, you'd love a dog
if it licked your hand.

593
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:44,919
- So?
- So?

594
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,658
- Who's that?
- A friend in New Orleans.

595
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:53,757
Ooh! Kelly's got a boyfriend!

596
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:55,927
You better not say anything!

597
00:42:56,003 --> 00:42:58,699
And you better not tell him
I know he's goin' to New Orleans, okay?

598
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,398
Now look, I told you
about the trips...

599
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:03,875
and the meat, right?

600
00:43:03,944 --> 00:43:06,936
That is the information
that you really needed to know.

601
00:43:07,014 --> 00:43:08,481
So, you got it!
Go with it!

602
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:12,848
Jack, was your daughter...

603
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:15,012
abused in Bigelow Hall?

604
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:19,454
Oh, yeah. Absolutely!

605
00:43:19,526 --> 00:43:23,656
You're her father,Jack.
You can ask her that.

606
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:26,858
What do you know about
being a father in today's world?

607
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:30,425
You're a, y-y-y-you're, you're
a scrawny little Irish chick...

608
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:35,532
who pushes pencils and lives
alone and, an-and eats take-out
and has a cat named Ginger.

609
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:37,099
How'd you know that?

610
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:40,010
Well, y-y-you live on the streets,
you pick shit up.

611
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,072
One thing.
I'm allergic to cats.

612
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:46,284
Hey, I know, I know, I know!

613
00:43:46,353 --> 00:43:48,947
When I rescued these little sh--
When I rescued my kids...

614
00:43:49,022 --> 00:43:52,116
I rescued a little girl
named Dolores.

615
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:54,251
You talk to her, she'll back up
everything I'm sayin'.

616
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,818
- Dolores what?
- Wha-- How should I know?

617
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:58,228
You're the-- Dolores!
You're th--

618
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:01,927
You're the reporter. Find it!

619
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:05,096
Uh-uh! I'm in no mood
for cowboys and Indians.

620
00:44:05,172 --> 00:44:07,936
Now,just put it
on the counter, sir.

621
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:12,938
I don't--
I don't want any trouble.

622
00:44:13,013 --> 00:44:14,913
I knew that. I really did.

623
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:19,281
There you go. Thank you, sir.

624
00:44:20,654 --> 00:44:26,149
Now, let's do a little negotiatin'.

625
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:30,694
Here, wrap these around you.

626
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:32,959
Whoa! How much did these cost?

627
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:35,695
- Nothing. He robbed the guy.
- No, I didn't!

628
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:39,000
- Kelly,just give him a break.
- You're always so negative.

629
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:44,900
Lou, is that you?
Hey, listen, man.

630
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:49,642
That outlaw from Los Angeles,
the one that took the kids?

631
00:44:49,716 --> 00:44:51,650
Yeah, he was here
in my place, man.

632
00:44:51,718 --> 00:44:54,687
Yeah, I'm sure it was him.

633
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:02,951
Come on, give me
one more dance

634
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:06,294
Before this night is through

635
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:10,803
I'd love to watch
the sunrise with you

636
00:45:13,073 --> 00:45:16,975
I got time on my hands

637
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:19,944
I got a pocketful of money

638
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:23,214
I got no plans but I--

639
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:29,855
Hey, Kelly, wake up.

640
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:33,690
- Kelly!
- What?

641
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,991
- Get up! Take over.
- Take over what?

642
00:45:37,063 --> 00:45:38,621
Drivin'.

643
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:40,791
I can't drive. I'm a kid.

644
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:43,301
Everybody in our family
can drive.

645
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,429
There's nothing to it.
Get out.

646
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:49,305
...on K-l0l FM,your favorite
all-night station in Santa Fe.

647
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:52,038
There's the wheel, there's the brake,
there's the gas, there's the road.

648
00:45:52,112 --> 00:45:56,310
Just don't overload.
Nighty-night, sweetheart.

649
00:45:58,752 --> 00:46:00,652
Here we go.

650
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,124
Above is a summer moon

651
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:13,564
Children will be sleeping soon

652
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:16,101
This is cool.

653
00:46:16,169 --> 00:46:18,763
We drink by the fire's glow

654
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:21,671
I'm definitely driving next.

655
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:24,869
Not a chance.

656
00:46:24,945 --> 00:46:28,642
The stories will all be told
and we'll dream

657
00:46:30,283 --> 00:46:34,515
- No! Leave me alone!
- You can't do that! Don't do that!

658
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:38,354
- You better get in the house, lady.
- No! For God's sake! Please.

659
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:42,691
- Step back!
- Don't do that! Don't do that!

660
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:45,754
- Don't do that! She's just a little girl.
- Get in the house, lady!

661
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:48,562
- She's just a little girl.
- Don't let her scratch you, boy.

662
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:50,102
- Don't let her scratch you.
- Don't, please!

663
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,469
- Step back.
- I got a wild one. Get in!

664
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,472
Get in the house!

665
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:12,280
- Hey, Dad, we just crossed into Texas!
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:16,352
Hey, Dad, after New Orleans,
we're gonna have plenty of money, right?

667
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:19,364
Yeah, we're gonna have lots of--

668
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:21,798
What do you know about it?
Who said anything about New Orleans?

669
00:47:21,868 --> 00:47:24,928
I did! I heard you say it
back in L.A., okay?

670
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:27,098
Well, it doesn't make one bit of difference,
'cause as soon as we get there...

671
00:47:27,173 --> 00:47:28,834
you're both goin' back into foster.

672
00:47:28,908 --> 00:47:31,843
Look! Look, let's not fight, okay?I'm sorry.

673
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:34,607
-Who's fightin'? Who's fighting'?
-What Kind of a way is that to talk?

674
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:37,616
- He is a human being. He is your son.
- Oh, shut up!

675
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:42,119
No, you shut up!
You're mad at me, not him.

676
00:47:42,188 --> 00:47:44,679
Kelly! Kelly, look out!

677
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:58,099
I didn't see him, I swear.
I'm sorry.

678
00:47:58,171 --> 00:48:00,833
Don't worry about it.
I've banged up a hundred of'em.

679
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:06,139
That's it? That's her punishment
for wrecking a BMW...

680
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:09,010
and I get yelled at every time I have
to go to the goddarned bathroom?

681
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:11,209
- Come on!
- Will you lay off of her and be cool?

682
00:48:11,284 --> 00:48:15,015
-You folks all right?
-We're fine.

683
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:19,422
- I put a call out on my CB for some help.
- You did what?

684
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:21,790
I-I put a call out
for help on my CB.

685
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:24,853
Uh, could you please call them back
and tell them not to come?

686
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:28,991
- Sure.
- Thank you.

687
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,738
Jack, it won't start.

688
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:35,274
Forget it. We're outta here.
Let's jam.

689
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:39,870
What is happenin' to my luck?
I'm sick of this.

690
00:48:39,946 --> 00:48:42,710
Stupid kids!

691
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:46,218
Where is Dolores,
Mrs. Carter?

692
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,811
It's very important
that I speak with her.

693
00:48:53,093 --> 00:48:56,756
Did she ever speak to you
about Bigelow Hall?

694
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,564
No.

695
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:04,565
They took her.

696
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:07,105
Where?

697
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:09,266
I don't know.

698
00:49:09,342 --> 00:49:12,505
You are her aunt,
aren't you, Mrs. Carter?

699
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:15,104
I'm not her aunt.

700
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,075
She liked to call me that,
you know, but--

701
00:49:21,321 --> 00:49:25,621
You see, Dolores was
my foster child years ago.

702
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:29,423
And then they took her
away from me.

703
00:49:29,496 --> 00:49:33,159
How come they did that?
Didn't you try to adopt her?

704
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:35,895
Yes, I did.
I most certainly did.

705
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:39,302
But it's hard with kids
in foster. It--

706
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:42,307
You know how it is.

707
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:44,275
I mean,
they wanna keep them.

708
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:47,404
Once they get their hands on them,
they wanna keep them forever.

709
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:54,580
It's all-- It's all money
to those people.

710
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:58,387
It's all money.

711
00:50:03,196 --> 00:50:05,858
Car 7252 to dispatch.

712
00:50:05,932 --> 00:50:09,265
We found the car stolen
by the kidnapper from California. Over.

713
00:50:09,335 --> 00:50:11,826
This is like the most fun
I've ever had.

714
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:14,169
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,334
Thought this was Texas,
the land of the wide-open spaces.

716
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:22,607
Oh, Lord. I just wish
I knew where I was.

717
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:31,548
Wow!

718
00:50:31,624 --> 00:50:34,354
Man.

719
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:36,987
- Cool. Look at that!
- C'mon, kid. I ain't got--
I ain't got time for this.

720
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:40,760
- Wait a min--
- I got a day and a half,
and we ain't stoppin' to breathe.

721
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:42,768
Hurry up!

722
00:50:50,643 --> 00:50:52,611
Stay here.

723
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:15,558
One of life's sweet moments: when
you're just about to take what you want.

724
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:18,570
- In the car.
- I'm goin' in that cave.

725
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:21,334
You ain't goin'--
Get in the car or I'll kill you, kid.

726
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:25,036
- The third largest in America.
I'm goin'! Goin'.
- Look! Look!

727
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:27,978
My life is runnin' away from me before
my eyes like a cockroach up the wall...

728
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:29,981
and you wanna go in a cave.
Get in the--

729
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:36,211
Out of the car. Out of the car now. Get outta
the car now, now. Go that way. Go, go, go.

730
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:39,925
The more we know
about caves...

731
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:42,120
the more we can tell
about geological history.

732
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:44,720
And also, the more we see
what nature has done...

733
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:47,322
and the time involved,
the smaller we seem.

734
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,393
- It's awesome, Dad! Can we live here?
- Oh, shut up!

735
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:53,996
...of silt mud and shale
on the bottom of the sea.

736
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:58,533
The police are here, and they want
all the people back upstairs. That's it.

737
00:51:58,611 --> 00:52:01,444
Folks, I'm sorry.
We gotta cut it short today.

738
00:52:01,514 --> 00:52:04,642
The police want us upstairs.

739
00:52:06,853 --> 00:52:08,912
Okay.

740
00:52:08,988 --> 00:52:11,980
C'mon, folks. Let's move it out.
Come on out, folks.

741
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:14,492
Leave very carefully
and watch your step.

742
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:19,294
Watch your step, folks.
Very good, folks. Watch your step.

743
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:21,560
Watch your step, folks.
Be very careful.

744
00:52:21,634 --> 00:52:24,797
Watch your step
and move to the left.

745
00:52:29,142 --> 00:52:30,734
Turn on your flashlight!

746
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,869
Got any bright ideas,
O Fearless One?

747
00:52:32,946 --> 00:52:36,575
Ah, Kelly, please, not now.
I-I ain't in no mood.

748
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:40,017
Move. Go, go!

749
00:52:40,086 --> 00:52:41,747
Hurry.

750
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:52,022
Jack Charles!

751
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:54,828
We know you're down here!

752
00:52:54,901 --> 00:52:57,597
Come out and
you won't get hurt.

753
00:53:08,748 --> 00:53:11,842
You wanna try and calm down, Bill?
He's got kids with him!

754
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,820
- Get goin'. Go.
- C'mon, guys. This way.

755
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:22,520
- Where are we going?
- Shh.

756
00:53:22,595 --> 00:53:24,995
- Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying.

757
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:41,179
C'mon, guys!

758
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:44,774
This way.

759
00:53:49,722 --> 00:53:52,213
Look, you guys.
I found a door.

760
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:57,062
Go.

761
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:03,829
C'mon, now. Hurry up.

762
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:11,366
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

763
00:54:11,444 --> 00:54:13,412
I can't deal with this.
I'm afraid of heights.

764
00:54:13,479 --> 00:54:18,075
- C'mon,just follow me.
- Oh, God! Okay, you go on.

765
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:21,814
- C'mon, Dad.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'. Oh, God!

766
00:54:21,888 --> 00:54:24,482
- You're doing great,Jack.
- Oh, my God!

767
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:31,185
- C'mon.
- Oh, no! My flashlight!

768
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:33,824
Forget about it unless you
wanna get shot in the butt. Go!

769
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:42,573
Let's go.

770
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:50,108
- They're everywhere.
- There's millions of'em!

771
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:52,447
There, there, there. Go, go!

772
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,020
What are we gonna do?

773
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:06,554
- You guys get seasick?
- What?

774
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:09,191
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

775
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:14,800
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Shh, shh.

776
00:55:14,874 --> 00:55:16,432
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Get up.

777
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:21,905
- I'm on! I'm on!
- Okay, shut up!

778
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,463
Whoa! Mm-hmm.

779
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:47,597
Let's see here.

780
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:56,641
Mm-mmm! We're gonna have ourselves
a little Thanksgiving dinner.

781
00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:01,952
This is good.
To the good life.

782
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,955
- To the good life.
- Whatever that means.

783
00:56:09,094 --> 00:56:11,688
Hey, Dad, tug it with me.

784
00:56:11,763 --> 00:56:14,323
No way.
Somebody made that up.

785
00:56:14,399 --> 00:56:18,062
- Come on, Dad, please?
- Uh-uh.

786
00:56:18,136 --> 00:56:21,196
Come on, please?
Just tug it with me.

787
00:56:22,608 --> 00:56:25,042
- Oh, I knew it! I knew it!
- Yes, I won!

788
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:28,204
I can't get a break.

789
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,908
Doesn't mean anything.
Forget it. Keep eatin'.

790
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:34,350
I remember the last time
we had Thanksgiving.

791
00:56:35,954 --> 00:56:37,854
No, you don't!
You were two years old.

792
00:56:37,923 --> 00:56:40,551
Yes, I do!

793
00:56:40,626 --> 00:56:43,026
You know what?
I remember one Thanksgiving.

794
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:46,428
I think it was Thanks-- Well, it was
a turkey, so I g-- It had to be Thanksgiving.

795
00:56:46,498 --> 00:56:49,592
Um, Rita and my old man were fightin' again, as usual...

796
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:51,727
this time about the turkey
not being ready.

797
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:55,102
Rita couldn't cook it anyway
'cause she was drunk on her behind.

798
00:56:55,173 --> 00:56:57,937
And so, my old man says-- Slams her
against the wall and he says...

799
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,739
''I'm goin' out to get
take-out chicken.''

800
00:56:59,811 --> 00:57:03,577
And I know. Right then I know.
He's gone. He ain't never comin' back.

801
00:57:03,649 --> 00:57:06,618
Uh, I decided to play hero. I run out the back
of the house, run around the house...

802
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:08,653
jump in the trunk, and I decide to wait
for him because I'm gonna bust him...

803
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,210
when he tries to split.

804
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:12,052
So I'm waitin',
and nobody comes.

805
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:16,254
I'm waitin', and waitin' and waitin'
and still, nobody comes.

806
00:57:16,328 --> 00:57:21,027
I wound up havin' to stay in that trunk
all night long. I peed all over myself.

807
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:24,034
And I had to wait, you know, 'til the cops
came and found me the next morning.

808
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:28,038
- That's sort of depressing.
- No, it ain't depressing.

809
00:57:28,106 --> 00:57:31,200
Everything that's ever happened to me
in my life has taught me something.

810
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:33,403
You just gotta remember
to think positive.

811
00:57:33,478 --> 00:57:35,605
You could use a little of that.

812
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:38,445
Eddie, go up and check.
Make sure we're headed east.

813
00:57:38,517 --> 00:57:40,451
Okay.

814
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:42,749
Yo, yo, yo, yo, wait!
Sit down.

815
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:44,448
Now what?

816
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:49,027
Um--

817
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:54,229
You know that Bigelow place
you were in?

818
00:57:55,534 --> 00:57:59,470
Did anybody, you know,
ever touch you?

819
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:04,371
Touch me?

820
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:07,071
Why would I ever
tell you something like that?

821
00:58:07,145 --> 00:58:10,444
Why don't you stop asking me questions, okay?
Just stop pretending you're my father!

822
00:58:10,515 --> 00:58:12,949
Yo, yo, yo!
I told you something.

823
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:17,887
- Y-You're drunk.
- What's-- I am not drunk.

824
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:21,050
Anyway, I didn't want to know.
It was this reporter that wanted--

825
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:25,085
Look, no one ever touched me,
okay? No one touches me.

826
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:27,654
They wouldn't dare.

827
00:58:28,433 --> 00:58:31,300
No one!

828
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,919
- Kathleen Mercer.
- Yeah. Yo, it's me.

829
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:51,512
Jack, they caught Dolores
and put her back in Bigelow.

830
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,922
I'm gonna try to get by there to see her,
but they probably won't let me.

831
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:57,393
Listen, I think they abused
my daughter in there, okay?

832
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:00,431
Jack...

833
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:03,832
what would you say if I
asked you to come back here...

834
00:59:03,902 --> 00:59:06,029
bring yourself, bring your kids
and tell your story?

835
00:59:06,104 --> 00:59:07,628
-You're crazy!
They ain't gonna believe my st--
-Oh, no, no, Jack.Really.

836
00:59:07,706 --> 00:59:11,164
- Really. I think I can cut a deal for you.
- Deal? Deal?

837
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:13,108
I'll tell you about my last deal
somebody tried to make for me.

838
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:14,770
I was lookin' at
a lot of hard time.

839
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:16,814
Well, this deal is
gonna be different, okay?

840
00:59:16,882 --> 00:59:20,716
Hey, hey, hey. What was I doin'?
I was robbing drug dealers.

841
00:59:20,786 --> 00:59:24,017
What's he doing?

842
00:59:24,089 --> 00:59:27,024
- He's still talking on the phone.
- Well, make him hurry up.

843
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:32,427
- Make the guy stop! Make him stop! Dad!
- Huh?

844
00:59:32,497 --> 00:59:34,294
-Jack!
-They're pulling away! Hey, I'm comin'.

845
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:35,765
- Hurry up!Jack!
- Hang on.

846
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:41,599
- Dad, come on!
- Hurry up!

847
00:59:41,673 --> 00:59:44,403
- You can do it. I know you can.
-Jack, hurry up!

848
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:48,742
Come on, run!
Hurry up!

849
00:59:53,351 --> 00:59:55,285
Okay.

850
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:06,661
He stopped running.

851
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:09,565
Not even Jack
can catch a car, Eddie.

852
01:00:20,846 --> 01:00:22,780
Uh, who owns the truck
with the antlers on it?

853
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:28,116
I'm tellin' you, man. This is
the greatest watch I've ever seen.

854
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:30,518
- Are these diamonds real?
- Yeah.

855
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,557
It's just a great watch, man. I mean, I don't
normally wear watches, but I'm gonna--

856
01:00:32,624 --> 01:00:35,149
- Why do you paint yourself like that?
- Oh, it's just to get women.

857
01:00:35,227 --> 01:00:38,560
They're good luck symbols.
My mother does 'em.

858
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,030
All right, when we get up here,
I want you to jam on his tail...

859
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:44,193
and stay right behind him so
he don't see you in his mirror, okay?

860
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:47,261
I-I just gotta tell ya, you look real familiar
to me. I'm real good with faces.

861
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,899
And I know that I know you from somewhere.
I mean, I know that I don't know you, but...

862
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:52,205
but I know you,
you know what I mean?

863
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:54,472
- Uh, do you do television or something?
- No.

864
01:00:54,546 --> 01:00:56,411
Okay, it's just that you remind me
of a guy I know on television.

865
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:58,039
Well, I mean, I don't know him,
but I, I know him from television.

866
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:00,277
There! There it is!
Go, go, go! Move it!

867
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:03,685
- Get up behind him.
Don't let him see you. Go!
- I got it! I got it!

868
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:06,053
Get behind him
and stay behind him.

869
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,058
- Okay, closer.
- Okay.

870
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:09,957
- Closer.
- I'm gettin' it. Okay.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

871
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:11,962
- Easy, easy.
- What do you got on this boat anyway?

872
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,999
My kids are on that boat.
Easy, easy.

873
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:18,661
Wait a minute. Hey, I know
who you are! You're the hit guy!
You're the guy from California!

874
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:21,297
I know you! You're the hit guy!
I know you!

875
01:01:28,346 --> 01:01:30,906
Shotgun boogie

876
01:01:30,982 --> 01:01:33,780
All right!
Give 'em hell,Jack!

877
01:01:33,852 --> 01:01:37,447
Look out, big boy
He's loaded all the time

878
01:01:37,522 --> 01:01:39,854
Ta-da! I'm back!

879
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:42,018
- Dad!
- How could you do that to us?

880
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:45,392
You're just blabbing away on the phone!
Are you crazy? I-I thought you were--

881
01:01:45,463 --> 01:01:48,227
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.
I lived through a bar full of rednecks.

882
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,327
I jump off the front of a truck onto a boat.
I risk my life! I mean, let me ask you somethin'.

883
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:55,202
Are you perfect? You ain't never missed
a busted appointment or nothin'?

884
01:01:55,273 --> 01:01:57,503
Look at your son!Just look
at what you're doing to him!

885
01:01:57,576 --> 01:02:00,136
What am I doin' to him? I ain't even talked
to the kid. I ain't even been nice to him.

886
01:02:00,212 --> 01:02:03,045
You're making him
fall in love with you.

887
01:02:03,114 --> 01:02:05,810
It isn't fair,Jack.
You're gonna break his heart.

888
01:02:05,884 --> 01:02:08,876
Stop it! You're gonna make him
go away again!

889
01:02:12,023 --> 01:02:15,459
Where are we?
Let me see your map.

890
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:19,823
- Where are we?
- We're right there.

891
01:02:25,637 --> 01:02:29,129
This is takin' a lot longer
than I planned.

892
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:33,007
Well, at least we're on the right road.
It kinda feels like my luck is back!

893
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,473
You really believe in that
luck junk, don't you,Jack?

894
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:40,518
In my business, you better believe
in somethin', sweetheart.

895
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:45,181
- I believe in luck!
- Only because he does.

896
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:48,055
No, I've always believed
in luck ever since I was a kid.

897
01:02:48,126 --> 01:02:50,890
I believe in luck,
and I believe in Mom.

898
01:02:50,962 --> 01:02:53,430
You believe in Mom?
You believe in a dead woman?

899
01:02:53,498 --> 01:02:56,797
Yo, back off!
That's what believin' is.

900
01:02:56,868 --> 01:02:58,665
If it's staring you right in the face,
you ain't gotta believe in it.

901
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:03,174
It's about believin' in the stuff
you can't see that you gotta believe in.

902
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:08,369
It was a good idea,
gettin' that map.

903
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:13,374
So, can I ask you somethin'?

904
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:16,011
- What?
- Why ain't you ever called me dad?

905
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:39,640
What's happening?

906
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:44,277
Son-of-a-bitch
just launched us.

907
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:48,308
- Bull, gimme a hand?
- Yeah, I'd be glad to.

908
01:03:56,161 --> 01:03:57,594
- Can you unhook that?
- Yeah.

909
01:03:57,662 --> 01:04:00,995
- Thanks, buddy.
- There you go.

910
01:04:03,935 --> 01:04:05,459
- Have a good day.
- What the hell!

911
01:04:06,638 --> 01:04:08,799
Hey!

912
01:04:08,873 --> 01:04:13,401
Hey! Stop!
That's my boat!

913
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:15,469
What do you think you're doin'?

914
01:04:23,688 --> 01:04:25,679
Come back!

915
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,660
That's my boat!

916
01:04:46,911 --> 01:04:50,938
You are so wonderful

917
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:53,941
Being near you

918
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:57,853
Is all that I'm living for

919
01:04:57,922 --> 01:05:03,588
You've shown me more kindness
in little ways

920
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:08,894
Than I've ever known
in all my days

921
01:05:08,967 --> 01:05:11,902
Tell me we'll stay together

922
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:15,030
Let me love you forever

923
01:05:15,106 --> 01:05:17,370
'Cause you're a wonderful one

924
01:05:17,442 --> 01:05:20,206
You're a wonderful one

925
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:21,905
Ooh, And you--

926
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,971
This is great, isn't it, Dad?

927
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,677
Yeah.

928
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:30,517
- Can I steer?
- No, man. If I'm late, I--

929
01:05:31,823 --> 01:05:33,586
- Yeah, come on.
- Yeah!

930
01:05:33,658 --> 01:05:36,218
Get over here. Got it?

931
01:05:36,294 --> 01:05:39,058
Hey, look. No, look.
No hands!

932
01:05:40,532 --> 01:05:42,932
...in return
Wonderful one

933
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:45,993
You're really more
than I deserve

934
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:49,097
From my heart
I mean these words

935
01:05:49,174 --> 01:05:51,404
'Cause you're a wonderful one

936
01:05:51,476 --> 01:05:54,104
You're a wonderful one

937
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:57,114
Oh,you're a wonderful one

938
01:05:57,182 --> 01:05:59,582
Baby,you're a wonderful one

939
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:02,552
Sweetheart,you're a wonderful one

940
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,589
My darlin; you're a wonderful one

941
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:07,386
Baby,you're a wonderful one

942
01:06:09,561 --> 01:06:12,359
Look!

943
01:06:17,302 --> 01:06:20,897
Shut off your engine!
This is the Louisiana State Police.

944
01:06:20,972 --> 01:06:23,634
- It's party time!
- Stop the boat!

945
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,869
You're ordered to turn around
and follow us.

946
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,639
He's gonna kill us, Dad!

947
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:31,079
Be cool, kid.
They can't even land.

948
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:34,843
Stop the boat!

949
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,992
If you don't comply, we will open fire.

950
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:46,656
Shut off your engines
immediately!

951
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:50,462
- Maybe we should stop, Dad.
- No, don't stop!Just go faster.

952
01:06:50,535 --> 01:06:52,560
What do you want to do,
get us killed?

953
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:54,901
- Dad, they're gonna shoot us!
- Turn off your engines now!

954
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:58,773
- Shut off your engines.
- He's right on top of us.

955
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:02,473
Look!

956
01:07:02,547 --> 01:07:05,107
Check it out!
It's the news dudes!

957
01:07:05,183 --> 01:07:10,416
Whoo, yeah!
I told you to be positive.

958
01:07:10,488 --> 01:07:15,619
Ain't no way they're gonna shoot us
on national TV. We're gonna be famous!

959
01:07:32,477 --> 01:07:34,342
You havin' fun yet?

960
01:07:34,412 --> 01:07:37,904
- Hey, look what I found.
- What the-- Put that down.

961
01:07:37,982 --> 01:07:39,381
- No, no, no, no.
- Let it go, Kelly!

962
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,917
- Lay your weapon down!
- Let it go! Let it go!

963
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:43,010
You're gonna get us killed, you st--

964
01:07:43,087 --> 01:07:47,615
You're gonna get us killed,
girlfriend. Drop it.

965
01:08:04,976 --> 01:08:08,503
-Jump!
- Whoa!

966
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:13,046
- We could've died.
- Yeah, but you didn't. Swim.

967
01:08:19,257 --> 01:08:21,384
- This is gettin' ridiculous.
- Did you see 'em?

968
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:26,089
They had guns!
We could've been killed.

969
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:28,098
Why do you have
to be like this?

970
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:31,727
- Why can't we be just like a regular family?
- Oh, shut up!

971
01:08:31,803 --> 01:08:35,034
Why do you have to be like this?
Why can't you be like other people?

972
01:08:35,106 --> 01:08:37,904
What do you-- What do you think,
I want this? You think this is my idea?

973
01:08:37,976 --> 01:08:41,309
- This has been one big screwup.
- You're the one who took me off the van.

974
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:43,142
You said you wanted
to go home, kid.

975
01:08:43,214 --> 01:08:45,079
That's when I thought
you were my father!

976
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:48,209
Will you just shut up, all right?
We're gonna get caught.

977
01:08:48,286 --> 01:08:51,949
God!

978
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:56,360
What are you gonna do
when I'm gone

979
01:08:56,427 --> 01:09:00,625
Whose shoulder
are you gonna cry on

980
01:09:00,698 --> 01:09:03,826
What are you gonna do
on the day

981
01:09:03,901 --> 01:09:07,393
When I turn my head
andjust walk away

982
01:09:07,472 --> 01:09:11,067
Now, what are you gonna say
to your friends

983
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:14,578
When the talk
around town begins

984
01:09:14,646 --> 01:09:18,047
Will you tell them
how you treated me bad

985
01:09:18,116 --> 01:09:23,816
Will you tell them
how you made me so sad

986
01:09:23,888 --> 01:09:27,449
'Cause you make some people

987
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:31,086
Think that you love me a lot

988
01:09:31,162 --> 01:09:34,654
But theyjust don't know you

989
01:09:34,732 --> 01:09:37,929
And what they see
isn't what we've got

990
01:09:38,002 --> 01:09:41,199
We're happy
in the public's eye

991
01:09:41,272 --> 01:09:44,833
They think you're such
a wonderful guy

992
01:09:44,909 --> 01:09:48,208
But they don't know--

993
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:51,339
Whoa. Okay, everybody out.

994
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:56,844
C'mon, hurry. Let's go.
Thanks, man.

995
01:09:56,921 --> 01:09:59,287
- Which way?
- This way.

996
01:09:59,357 --> 01:10:01,791
- C'mon, Eddie.
- C'mon!

997
01:10:06,798 --> 01:10:08,891
Jerry?

998
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:12,469
- Yo,Jerry!
- What is this place?

999
01:10:12,537 --> 01:10:15,472
- Shut up.
- Whoa! Look at that!

1000
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,064
Shh!

1001
01:10:17,141 --> 01:10:19,575
Jerry!

1002
01:10:19,644 --> 01:10:21,635
Anybody home?

1003
01:10:22,513 --> 01:10:25,311
Yo!

1004
01:10:25,383 --> 01:10:27,317
Hello?

1005
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,288
- Freeze!
- Damn! Fuck!

1006
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,919
- What are you doin'?
-Jack, it's you.

1007
01:10:36,994 --> 01:10:40,452
- Yeah, it's me, you stupid--
- I-- I mean, you made it.

1008
01:10:42,567 --> 01:10:45,001
- Oh! Oh, God!
- I'm here, man.

1009
01:10:45,069 --> 01:10:47,799
I told ya! You've been
all over the news.

1010
01:10:47,872 --> 01:10:50,670
Yeah, I'm famous. I'm famous.

1011
01:10:50,742 --> 01:10:54,405
Ah! What are they doin' here?
Haven't you dumped them yet?

1012
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,142
- I'm workin' on it.
- Don't touch that!

1013
01:10:58,216 --> 01:10:59,877
Sorry.

1014
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:03,682
You guys go find somethin' to do and don't touch anything. Okay?

1015
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:06,189
Come on.

1016
01:11:06,257 --> 01:11:08,589
And I don't need grief
from you, all right?

1017
01:11:08,659 --> 01:11:12,151
What I need is a shower
and some whiskey. You got?

1018
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,892
- Aye.
- That's my man. C'mon.

1019
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:17,696
-Hello.
- Collect call from Jack Charles.
Will you accept?

1020
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:21,671
Yes, operator. I will.Jack,
I just talked to your lawyer.

1021
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:24,833
You're never gonna believe this.
We managed to make a deal for you.

1022
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:29,312
You did what? Oh, my God! That guy
couldn't deal his way out of a paper bag!

1023
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:32,281
You gotta understand somethin'.
I am this close to gettin' what I want.

1024
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:35,217
You, you, you,Jack! I'm sick
and tired of hearing about you!

1025
01:11:35,286 --> 01:11:37,049
For once in your life, why don't you
do something for somebody else...

1026
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:39,089
and come back here and
do something about this.

1027
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:42,285
- Something about what?
- Lazzaro and this whole foster care system.

1028
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,487
That's your job, girlfriend!

1029
01:11:44,562 --> 01:11:48,123
Well, I can't do it alone,Jack.
Now, I need someone to come forward.

1030
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:50,133
Look, get somebody else.
If I come back...

1031
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:53,034
it's gonna be ten years plus whatever
else I've racked up on this little trip.

1032
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:55,436
- I need you,Jack!
- Yeah, I can see it now.

1033
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:58,566
''Stickup man turns self in
to expose foster care system.''

1034
01:11:58,643 --> 01:12:01,874
- Yeah, something like that.
- Look, what's in it for me?

1035
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:05,609
Tell me this. I don't have a life like you
with major medical and pension plans.

1036
01:12:05,683 --> 01:12:07,844
What's in it for me?
Please tell me.

1037
01:12:07,919 --> 01:12:11,320
All right, look. They're
offering you a reduced sentence.

1038
01:12:11,389 --> 01:12:13,880
Two years and you're out.
Good behavior, 1 8 months.

1039
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:16,383
Get outta town, girlfriend.

1040
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:19,259
Jack, I know you think
the system is totally--

1041
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,798
What do you know about the system?
You live in an insulated...

1042
01:12:21,866 --> 01:12:23,458
middle-class little dream world.

1043
01:12:23,534 --> 01:12:26,230
You write about the system.
I live the system, sweetheart.

1044
01:12:26,304 --> 01:12:28,135
-And in case nobody's told you...
- I--

1045
01:12:28,206 --> 01:12:31,141
the system is broken, so I can't
believe you're asking me to do this.

1046
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:33,734
- I thought you were a friend
or at least understood.
- I am totally--

1047
01:12:48,893 --> 01:12:50,690
What are you packing?

1048
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:53,958
.38 snub-nosed, same as always.
My baby.

1049
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:56,932
- That's not a gun.
- Get outta my face, that's not a gun.

1050
01:12:57,001 --> 01:12:59,231
This is my baby.

1051
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:03,472
- Ta-da!
- Whoa!

1052
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:06,101
Whoa! What are you gonna do,
start a war?

1053
01:13:06,177 --> 01:13:08,304
- That, uh, automatic will get you killed.
- What?

1054
01:13:08,379 --> 01:13:10,506
- What about one of those
revolvers over there?
- Look!

1055
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:14,278
The black one there. Is that a .3 57?
What is that, a two-inch barrel?

1056
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:16,286
Let me see it.

1057
01:13:17,955 --> 01:13:19,820
Yeah, that's my kind of gun.

1058
01:13:19,891 --> 01:13:23,520
Now, nine times out of ten...

1059
01:13:23,594 --> 01:13:26,358
the last ferry from Algiers
is always empty.

1060
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,364
- So it's just us and them?
- Absolutely.

1061
01:13:28,432 --> 01:13:30,127
It's gonna be easy, right?

1062
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:31,964
Easy pickings.

1063
01:13:34,505 --> 01:13:37,065
I wanna rob Guzman.

1064
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:39,336
I want a new passport.

1065
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:43,244
And I want to live the life of ease
in Belize, where the ladies are lovely...

1066
01:13:43,314 --> 01:13:47,307
the beer is cold, and they ain't got no
extradition treaty with the U.S. of A.

1067
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:50,752
- That's what I want.
- Yeah.

1068
01:13:53,157 --> 01:13:56,684
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

1069
01:13:56,761 --> 01:14:00,595
Yeah. I sure hope so.

1070
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,874
Yo, Eddie.

1071
01:14:12,176 --> 01:14:14,406
Yo, Eddie!

1072
01:14:17,715 --> 01:14:19,842
Yo, Eddie!

1073
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:24,949
- Eddie!
- Yeah?

1074
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:27,889
- Where is your sister?
- Out.

1075
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:31,654
What'd you say?

1076
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:34,095
- She's out.
- Out?

1077
01:14:34,165 --> 01:14:36,725
What do you mean out?
Where'd she go?

1078
01:14:38,102 --> 01:14:40,195
She-- She went to see
her boyfriend.

1079
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:41,898
Boyfriend?
She ain't got no boyfriend.

1080
01:14:41,973 --> 01:14:44,373
Yes, she does. That's why
she wanted to come here.

1081
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:47,411
Let me tell you something. We are hot
in this town! People know we're here.

1082
01:14:47,478 --> 01:14:52,381
It's very dangerous for her to be walkin'
on the street! Now, tell me where she went!

1083
01:15:12,036 --> 01:15:13,970
So...

1084
01:15:15,473 --> 01:15:18,931
I've been readin' about you,
anyhow, and I saw you on TV.

1085
01:15:20,177 --> 01:15:23,146
Weird.

1086
01:15:23,214 --> 01:15:24,579
- Andy?
- Yeah?

1087
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:28,449
Back at the Bigs,
you were my best friend.

1088
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:34,689
- You were the best friend I ever had.
- Yeah.

1089
01:15:34,759 --> 01:15:37,159
That was pretty weird there,
wasn't it?

1090
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:41,521
I saw your picture
in the paper, you know?

1091
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,930
You're in a lot of trouble.

1092
01:15:47,872 --> 01:15:50,636
You know...

1093
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:53,768
when my dad told me that
he was comin' to New Orleans...

1094
01:15:53,844 --> 01:15:56,608
I made him take me with him.

1095
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:58,774
I really wanted to see you.

1096
01:15:58,849 --> 01:16:02,250
Kelly, look.

1097
01:16:05,122 --> 01:16:08,751
I was only trying
to be nice to you.

1098
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:11,818
I mean, come on. Hasn't anyone
ever been nice to you before?

1099
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:19,035
Thanks.

1100
01:16:23,474 --> 01:16:26,568
- Yo, hey.
- What are you doing here?

1101
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:28,976
Do you want me
to break his legs?

1102
01:16:29,046 --> 01:16:32,982
This is none of your business, okay?
This is my life, so just leave me alone!

1103
01:16:51,502 --> 01:16:55,438
Yes. Yeah!
Baby, baby, sweetheart.

1104
01:16:55,506 --> 01:16:58,873
- Who are you calling?
- Horoscope.

1105
01:16:58,943 --> 01:17:02,674
- Did ya get a good one?
- I sure did. Absolutely.

1106
01:17:02,747 --> 01:17:05,807
What if the guy you're robbing
has the same horoscope as you?

1107
01:17:10,254 --> 01:17:12,916
I told you to
think positive, kid.

1108
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,582
Yeah. Famous last words.

1109
01:17:14,658 --> 01:17:16,922
You know, I wish you weren't goin'.

1110
01:17:16,994 --> 01:17:19,724
Well, this is who I am.

1111
01:17:19,797 --> 01:17:22,857
This is what I do.
I ain't got no other profession.

1112
01:17:22,933 --> 01:17:26,699
We could run around the country
all we want and play little games
and have funny times...

1113
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:29,262
but that sure as hell
don't make us a family.

1114
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:32,605
Yeah, well what if
you don't come back?

1115
01:17:32,676 --> 01:17:34,871
Bad vibes, sweetheart.

1116
01:17:37,815 --> 01:17:41,114
I told UncleJerry
to give you my take.

1117
01:17:41,185 --> 01:17:45,747
UncleJerry? He's worse than you are. He'll
keep the money and throw us to the gators.

1118
01:17:46,657 --> 01:17:48,625
Probably will.

1119
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:51,217
Yeah, and what if UncleJerry
don't come back?

1120
01:17:52,096 --> 01:17:53,495
Well...

1121
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:59,936
then I guess
you're on your own.

1122
01:18:00,938 --> 01:18:03,270
I never made you no promises.

1123
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,638
That money
ain't gonna wait,Jack!

1124
01:18:05,709 --> 01:18:07,472
I'll see ya.

1125
01:18:07,545 --> 01:18:10,173
- C'mon.
- I'm comin'!

1126
01:18:11,882 --> 01:18:15,283
- He's not comin' back, you know.
- Yeah, I know.

1127
01:18:15,352 --> 01:18:17,286
Let's go!

1128
01:18:18,622 --> 01:18:21,182
- Did you get gas?
- Yeah, of course.

1129
01:18:21,258 --> 01:18:23,021
- Tank full.
- Well, that's a start.

1130
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,854
Look. What'd I tell ya, huh?
It's just sittin' waitin' for us.

1131
01:18:53,924 --> 01:18:57,189
It's so close, I can taste it.

1132
01:18:57,261 --> 01:19:00,492
- Huh?
- Well, be cool, man, 'cause it ain't over yet.

1133
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:54,908
Belize, here we come!

1134
01:19:54,985 --> 01:19:57,351
Yeah.

1135
01:19:57,421 --> 01:19:59,787
This is it, baby.

1136
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,459
- What's that?
- What? I don't hear nothin'.

1137
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:10,557
- Where's it coming from?
- What is it?

1138
01:20:13,003 --> 01:20:15,938
- It's coming from back there.
- No, no, no! Be cool, man. Be cool!

1139
01:20:16,006 --> 01:20:18,167
- Dad!
- Ah! What is he doing here, huh?

1140
01:20:18,242 --> 01:20:21,040
- Oh, my God! Stupid little--
- Let us outta here, Dad!

1141
01:20:21,111 --> 01:20:23,045
I gotta get 'em outta there.
You gotta just pop the trunk, man.

1142
01:20:23,113 --> 01:20:24,944
- Pop the trunk? Are you crazy? No, man, no!
- Pop the trunk.

1143
01:20:25,015 --> 01:20:26,380
- I'll be cool.Just pop it.
- If they see you, it's all over.

1144
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:28,509
Hey, listen to me, man.
Just pop the trunk. I gotta get--

1145
01:20:28,585 --> 01:20:30,610
- No! It's a quarter of a million
dollars, man. It's on the table.
- I'm callin' off the whole deal.

1146
01:20:30,688 --> 01:20:32,622
-Just keep your mind on the money, man.
- I ain't blowin' nothin'.

1147
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,521
- I ain't blowin' nothin'. It's my deal, too.
- No! No! No!

1148
01:20:34,591 --> 01:20:38,152
Listen, pop the trunk,Jerry!
Do it now.

1149
01:20:38,228 --> 01:20:40,992
I can't leave the kid in there.

1150
01:20:41,065 --> 01:20:42,965
Your priorities
are all screwed up,Jack.

1151
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:45,968
I ain't got nothin' screwed up.
Pop it now!

1152
01:20:49,106 --> 01:20:50,596
- Be cool.
- Yeah.

1153
01:20:50,674 --> 01:20:53,905
- Oh! My, that was a stupid idea.
- It was your idea!

1154
01:20:53,978 --> 01:20:56,947
- Get outta the car.
Get outta the car now! Now!
- I gotta go pee!

1155
01:20:57,014 --> 01:21:00,142
- Come on. Come on!
- It wasn't my fault.

1156
01:21:00,217 --> 01:21:02,185
- Listen. Listen to me.
What do you think this is? Listen.
- It was Kelly's idea.

1157
01:21:02,252 --> 01:21:04,880
- Don't blame it on me.
- What the hell is goin' on back there?

1158
01:21:04,955 --> 01:21:07,253
I don't know.

1159
01:21:07,324 --> 01:21:09,189
Something's wrong! Go! Go!

1160
01:21:13,497 --> 01:21:15,761
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

1161
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,301
- C'mon.
- This way. Let's go. C'mon. Let's--

1162
01:21:32,516 --> 01:21:34,916
Look out!

1163
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,747
Dad!

1164
01:21:52,069 --> 01:21:54,037
Dad!

1165
01:21:54,104 --> 01:21:56,629
- Get the other guy! Get that bastard! Hey!
- C'mon!

1166
01:21:56,707 --> 01:21:58,971
- Get that son-of-a-bitch!
- C'mon, let's go! Let's go! Run! Run!

1167
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:01,511
- Get him!
- Let's go!

1168
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,653
Get up!

1169
01:22:13,957 --> 01:22:16,084
Right behind ya.

1170
01:22:18,228 --> 01:22:21,095
- Let's try the topside.
- All right. Let's go!

1171
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:28,796
Over here!

1172
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:34,675
Cover me.

1173
01:22:51,762 --> 01:22:53,855
- You wait here.
- Where're you going?

1174
01:23:41,378 --> 01:23:44,870
Forget about him! We're docking!
Let's just get outta here.

1175
01:23:44,948 --> 01:23:46,108
We didn't get him, though.

1176
01:23:48,986 --> 01:23:51,511
What have you two done to me?

1177
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:55,887
So, where's the money?

1178
01:23:58,328 --> 01:24:00,262
Oh, shut up!

1179
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:11,469
No. No. I know those
charges have been made.

1180
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:16,536
But, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to assure you that nothing
of that sort has ever happened.

1181
01:24:16,613 --> 01:24:18,774
Kelly Charles was a runaway.

1182
01:24:18,849 --> 01:24:21,579
Her reason for running away,
it's come to our attention...

1183
01:24:21,652 --> 01:24:25,281
is that she developed an obsession
for a young summer intern--

1184
01:24:25,355 --> 01:24:28,620
Geez, will you come on! This Lazzaro
has been doin' his razzle-dazzle...

1185
01:24:28,692 --> 01:24:30,523
- I got this Lazzaro dude's number, okay?
- on some panel committee for--

1186
01:24:30,594 --> 01:24:32,528
- No, no, no. This is no joke,Jack.
- Let me ask you something.

1187
01:24:32,596 --> 01:24:34,928
- How many deals have you made for me,
and how many worked?
- Now, don't bring it up now.

1188
01:24:34,998 --> 01:24:36,795
-Just answer the question.
- We've been workin' our chops off for this.

1189
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:38,630
- This is a dumb idea.
- This is not a dumb idea.

1190
01:24:38,702 --> 01:24:40,169
Jack! You're late.

1191
01:24:40,237 --> 01:24:43,400
Kathleen Mercer,
the world-famous Jack Charles.

1192
01:24:43,473 --> 01:24:46,670
- You're not Irish.
- So I lied.

1193
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,310
What else did you lie about?
Is this deal goin' down or what?

1194
01:24:51,381 --> 01:24:54,077
Absolutely,Jack,
as long as you tell the truth--

1195
01:24:54,151 --> 01:24:56,346
the plain, simple truth.

1196
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,978
I always tell the truth.
Let's do it, girlfriend.

1197
01:24:58,055 --> 01:25:00,285
You better tell the truth.
Just keep it straight,Jack.

1198
01:25:00,357 --> 01:25:04,851
You see, this whole thing finds its origins in the fantasies of a disturbed child...

1199
01:25:04,928 --> 01:25:07,396
the arrogance
of a career criminal...

1200
01:25:07,464 --> 01:25:12,026
and a media circus ringmastered
by an irresponsible reporter.

1201
01:25:18,175 --> 01:25:21,144
Jack, she's right.
Just tell them the truth, huh?

1202
01:25:22,746 --> 01:25:26,512
Don't worry about it, man.
Relax. I got it down.

1203
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:29,211
So, there I was tryin'
to get my life straight...

1204
01:25:29,286 --> 01:25:32,483
tryin' to do the right thing, and put
my kids someplace decent, you know.

1205
01:25:32,556 --> 01:25:35,753
But I always
was thinkin' of the kids.

1206
01:25:35,826 --> 01:25:39,057
I never thought about anything else,
and then they're ripped from my arms.

1207
01:25:39,129 --> 01:25:42,724
So, naturally, like
any good father, I was upset.

1208
01:25:42,799 --> 01:25:46,394
But then like magic,
they come back into my life.

1209
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:49,803
And we're forced to try to cram
years into a few days, but we managed.

1210
01:25:49,873 --> 01:25:52,740
We got to go to Vegas.
We got to go to Hoover Dam.

1211
01:25:52,809 --> 01:25:55,642
The desert, some caves,
the mighty Mississippi.

1212
01:25:55,712 --> 01:25:59,671
You've, uh, had your difficulties with the law, isn't that right, Mr. Charles?

1213
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,719
- Uh, Madam Chairman, if I may--
- You may not!

1214
01:26:02,786 --> 01:26:05,880
Yo, yo, back. Sit down, man.
I got it under control. I'm cool.

1215
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:09,390
Uh, Your Hon--
Uh, Madam...

1216
01:26:09,459 --> 01:26:14,328
at least one of those convictions
was highly questionable.

1217
01:26:14,398 --> 01:26:18,425
But what about them? What did they
do wrong? Where's their crime?

1218
01:26:18,502 --> 01:26:22,029
The man kidnapped his children. Doesn't
that mean anything to anyone here?

1219
01:26:22,105 --> 01:26:24,903
You know, now look.
I don't know...

1220
01:26:24,975 --> 01:26:27,910
anything about the other homes
for kids around this city...

1221
01:26:27,978 --> 01:26:32,176
but I do know that in Bigelow Hall
these kids are being hurt.

1222
01:26:32,249 --> 01:26:35,616
Madam Chairman,
Bigelow is not on trial here.

1223
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:40,055
- Mr. Lazzaro, please!
- Maybe Bigelow Hall should be on trial here.

1224
01:26:40,123 --> 01:26:42,523
- Madam Chairman, I've got evidence.
- What evidence?

1225
01:26:42,592 --> 01:26:44,753
Gleaned from the minds
of disturbed children?

1226
01:26:44,828 --> 01:26:47,262
Look, these kids
did not hurt anybody...

1227
01:26:47,331 --> 01:26:50,630
and you had them
locked up like criminals.

1228
01:26:50,701 --> 01:26:52,760
Where's the justice in that?
I gotta ask you that.

1229
01:26:52,836 --> 01:26:55,464
I mean, handcuffin' ' em, abusin' 'em, makin' money off of' em.

1230
01:26:55,539 --> 01:26:58,440
There were no handcuffs.
There was no abuse!

1231
01:26:58,508 --> 01:27:01,875
What about Dolores and her baby?
What about Eddie?

1232
01:27:01,945 --> 01:27:04,743
Have you forgotten
about your friend Travis?

1233
01:27:04,815 --> 01:27:09,047
Whatever might have happened
with my staff, happened without
my consent and knowledge.

1234
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:13,215
That is a lie!
What about me?

1235
01:27:14,524 --> 01:27:18,051
You were there. You saw it!

1236
01:27:18,128 --> 01:27:22,963
You just walked away.
You just walked away.

1237
01:27:27,471 --> 01:27:29,496
Can I ask you somethin', sir?

1238
01:27:29,573 --> 01:27:34,476
What did she do
that was so wrong?

1239
01:27:37,114 --> 01:27:39,241
Tell me, please.

1240
01:27:43,987 --> 01:27:47,081
Being a kid is not a crime, man.

1241
01:27:47,157 --> 01:27:50,388
You can't get punished
for just being little.

1242
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:55,397
And she c-- She can be sassy. K-Kids think
they know everything, but they don't.

1243
01:27:57,367 --> 01:28:02,930
And, i-- It's scary because
you gotta watch 'em, man.

1244
01:28:03,006 --> 01:28:04,940
You gotta, you gotta
talk to 'em!

1245
01:28:05,008 --> 01:28:08,102
You g-- You--
You gotta raise 'em.

1246
01:28:08,178 --> 01:28:13,138
You can't just
throw 'em away because...

1247
01:28:13,216 --> 01:28:16,413
if you do...

1248
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:18,010
this is what you get.

1249
01:28:18,088 --> 01:28:21,888
Oh, please! The man has no idea
how to raise children!

1250
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:24,688
Look, maybe I wasn't worth beans
as a father...

1251
01:28:24,761 --> 01:28:28,197
and actually, maybe, I probably...

1252
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:32,167
was the worst father
that ever hit the planet.

1253
01:28:32,235 --> 01:28:36,194
And I didn't know my kids.

1254
01:28:36,273 --> 01:28:38,741
And I didn't never
do nothin' for 'em.

1255
01:28:38,809 --> 01:28:42,245
And maybe, I've, I-I don't know,
know-- Maybe I--

1256
01:28:42,312 --> 01:28:45,713
Maybe I should stop
the excuses, huh?

1257
01:28:47,684 --> 01:28:50,653
It all comes down to this:

1258
01:28:54,991 --> 01:28:57,721
I didn't know you.

1259
01:28:58,795 --> 01:29:01,229
I didn't know I had a son.

1260
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:05,361
I didn't know I had a daughter.

1261
01:29:05,435 --> 01:29:09,599
But now I do. Now I do.

1262
01:29:11,842 --> 01:29:14,333
I ju--

1263
01:29:14,411 --> 01:29:19,508
I just wish that
I could be your father.

1264
01:29:29,459 --> 01:29:32,895
This is outrageous!
He is not their father!

1265
01:29:32,963 --> 01:29:36,490
According to transfer form 33-1 1 ...

1266
01:29:36,566 --> 01:29:39,626
these children still belong to me.

1267
01:29:39,703 --> 01:29:41,295
- Could we have some order here.
- Leave me alone!

1268
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:44,033
- Get your hands off my children now!
- Could we please...

1269
01:29:44,107 --> 01:29:46,905
have some order here?

1270
01:29:46,977 --> 01:29:50,913
You touch my kids again,
I'll kill you. Sorry.

1271
01:29:52,082 --> 01:29:55,540
I pray that when
they put you away...

1272
01:29:55,619 --> 01:29:59,578
they put you where I am,
because we're gonna dance.

1273
01:30:15,906 --> 01:30:17,874
I love you, Kelly.

1274
01:30:23,713 --> 01:30:25,908
I love you, too, Daddy.

1275
01:30:28,184 --> 01:30:31,483
- Be good to yourself, okay?
- Sure.

1276
01:30:38,528 --> 01:30:41,463
Come here, little fella.
Gimme a hug.

1277
01:30:43,233 --> 01:30:46,566
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too.

1278
01:30:47,837 --> 01:30:50,101
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Think of it this way:

1279
01:30:50,173 --> 01:30:53,836
I'll get to make the license plates for your first car.

1280
01:30:56,846 --> 01:30:59,872
Jack? Jack!

1281
01:31:01,751 --> 01:31:04,481
I'm sorry. Come on.

1282
01:31:04,554 --> 01:31:07,045
We've gotta get goin'.

1283
01:31:16,533 --> 01:31:18,797
Will ya check in on 'em
every once in a while?

1284
01:31:18,868 --> 01:31:21,166
You know I will.

1285
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:28,641
- I'm proud of you,Jack.
- Thanks for everything.

1286
01:31:28,712 --> 01:31:31,010
Anytime.

1287
01:31:34,517 --> 01:31:38,419
- Deal, my ass!
- Oh, hey. Don't start.

1288
01:31:38,488 --> 01:31:40,183
I did the best I could,
and you know that.

1289
01:31:40,256 --> 01:31:42,383
Wa-wa-wa-- Why, why do I feel
like I've been here before?

1290
01:31:42,459 --> 01:31:44,518
- Because you have.
- Yeah.

1291
01:31:44,594 --> 01:31:46,721
You know what?
There's a difference.

1292
01:31:46,796 --> 01:31:49,230
-What?
-Now I Know where to find you.

1293
01:31:49,299 --> 01:31:51,062
You're a funny man.

1294
01:31:51,134 --> 01:31:53,227
Ah! You'll be out in no time.

1295
01:31:53,303 --> 01:31:55,794
- Dad!
- What?

1296
01:32:06,349 --> 01:32:11,286
You are so wonderful

1297
01:32:11,354 --> 01:32:17,384
Being near you
is all that I'm living for

1298
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:23,126
You've shown me more kindness
in little ways

1299
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,258
Than I've ever known

1300
01:32:25,335 --> 01:32:28,429
In all my days

1301
01:32:28,505 --> 01:32:31,269
Tell me we'll stay together

1302
01:32:31,341 --> 01:32:34,401
Let me love you forever

1303
01:32:34,477 --> 01:32:36,877
'Cause you're a wonderful one

1304
01:32:36,946 --> 01:32:39,346
You're a wonderful one

1305
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:45,444
In you there is a rare quality

1306
01:32:45,522 --> 01:32:47,513
Your love, baby

1307
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:51,526
It means the world to me

1308
01:32:51,594 --> 01:32:56,759
For me you're always concerned

1309
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:59,734
And you ask nothin; baby

1310
01:32:59,803 --> 01:33:02,237
In return

1311
01:33:02,305 --> 01:33:05,433
You're really more than I deserve

1312
01:33:05,508 --> 01:33:08,568
From my heart
I mean these words

1313
01:33:08,645 --> 01:33:13,582
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

1314
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:16,585
Oh,you're a wonderful one

1315
01:33:16,653 --> 01:33:19,121
Baby,you're a wonderful one

1316
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:21,953
Sweetheart,you're a wonderful one

1317
01:33:22,025 --> 01:33:24,926
My darlin; you're a wonderful one

1318
01:33:24,994 --> 01:33:27,861
Oh,you're a wonderful one

1319
01:33:27,931 --> 01:33:30,593
Ooh,you're a wonderful one

1320
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:33,431
Mm-mmm,you're a wonderful one

1321
01:33:33,503 --> 01:33:36,233
Baby,you're a wonderful one

1322
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:39,901
You're really more than I deserve

1323
01:33:39,976 --> 01:33:42,570
From my heart
I mean these words

1324
01:33:42,645 --> 01:33:47,708
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

1325
01:33:47,784 --> 01:33:53,689
Sometimes I'm up
Oh, sometimes I'm down

1326
01:33:53,757 --> 01:33:56,521
But your love

1327
01:33:56,593 --> 01:33:59,653
You're always around

1328
01:33:59,729 --> 01:34:04,359
Words of confidence you speak to me?

1329
01:34:04,434 --> 01:34:07,995
Baby, then you place
a tender kiss

1330
01:34:08,071 --> 01:34:10,369
On my cheek

1331
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:13,534
It makes my burden
a little bit lighter

1332
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:16,704
Makes my life
a little bit brighter

1333
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,975
'Cause you're a wonderful one

1334
01:34:19,048 --> 01:34:21,710
You're a wonderful one

1335
01:34:21,785 --> 01:34:24,618
Oh,you're a wonderful one

1336
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:27,520
Baby,you're a wonderful one

1337
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:30,991
You're really more than I deserve

1338
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:33,790
From my heart
I mean these words

1339
01:34:33,863 --> 01:34:38,800
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

1340
01:34:38,868 --> 01:34:41,735
Oh,you're a wonderful one

1341
01:34:41,805 --> 01:34:44,706
Baby,you're a wonderful one

1342
01:34:44,774 --> 01:34:47,140
Wonderful baby
