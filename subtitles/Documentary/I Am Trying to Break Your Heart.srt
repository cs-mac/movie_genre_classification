1
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:19,546
Are you ready?

2
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:23,863
Didn't think I'd be
this nervous...

3
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:30,936
Now or never.

4
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,124
Alright, papi, let's do this.

5
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:41,498
He's over there.

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,546
You must be Michael.

7
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:56,467
Your friend, Fernando, tells me
you can use my services today.

8
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:58,268
Very much so.

9
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:01,018
And I assume... thats the
other half of your team?

10
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:11,514
You look beautiful.

11
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:14,983
Thank you.

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,721
And it's my understanding
you'd like to keep this simple?

13
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:25,881
We've never actually manage
to keep anything simple...

14
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:27,719
You can try.

15
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,347
Well.
Let's begin then, shall we?

16
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,959
Family and friends,
we gather here...

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,842
To celebrate the union between
Michael Scofield and Sara Tancredi.

18
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,467
- Sorry to break up the party.
- What the hell's going on?

19
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:26,590
We have an arrest warrant.

20
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:28,139
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait.

21
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,640
We've talked to Agent
Paul Kellerman in D.C,

22
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:31,841
we've settle this with the feds.

23
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,741
We settle this with
the feds weeks ago!

24
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:34,542
Sir, back up!

25
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,271
- We were exonerated.
- Sir...

26
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:37,872
- We were exonerated!
- Back up!

27
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:40,673
We're not here for you.
We're here for her.

28
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:44,309
She didn't do anything.
She wasn't involved.

29
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:45,717
Don't make this escalate!

30
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,325
Sara Tancredi,

31
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:49,826
you're under arrest for the
murder of Christina Hampton.

32
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:51,905
What?
She didn't kill anyone!

33
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,949
Funny. Surveillance camera
footage says different.

34
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:58,027
Michael.

35
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:02,310
- Please, right this way.
- Michael. Michael!

36
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,580
- The Final Break -

37
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:13,581
Edited By:
.: thesurferguy :.

38
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,233
They'll not gonna
let me see her.

39
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,904
Why did Kellerman send you
if you can't do anything?

40
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,074
They're trying to break both of you.

41
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:26,394
Look, she has constitutional
right to reasonable visitation.

42
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:29,079
I'll draw up an order to show cause
and get it before the judge immediately.

43
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:30,069
What do you argue in?

44
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,470
- Do you argue in self defence?
- How?

45
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,184
Anything that might
help her is out of frame.

46
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:38,645
Security camera only shows Sara
stepping up and firing at the victim.

47
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,755
<i>- Pull the trigger, Michael.
- Drop... the gun!</i>

48
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:44,592
<i>Misfire.</i>

49
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,081
- She worked for the Company.
- To you.

50
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:53,083
To a jury, she's Christina Hampton,
Technology Consultant.

51
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:54,878
And because she was so good
at hiding her true identity,

52
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:55,948
we can't prove otherwise.

53
00:03:57,742 --> 00:04:00,825
Look, you all get exonerated
did not set well with law enforcement.

54
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:03,150
If they can make Sara
pay for it, they will.

55
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,065
How much time
is she looking at?

56
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:08,498
25 to life.

57
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,349
You.
Over here.

58
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,625
You.
Here.

59
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,380
You.
Here.

60
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:41,991
This one's yours.

61
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:46,421
- Am I supposed to be in a different facility?
- I don't think so.

62
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:50,092
I haven't been convicted of anything yet.
I'm supposed to be in a jail. This is prison.

63
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:51,898
Overcrowding and budget cuts, fish.

64
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:55,376
This is the jail.
That's the prison.

65
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,346
Was'sup homey?
You need some help?

66
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:13,032
You've got everything
you need over there?

67
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,633
<i>Why don't you go help
and make her bed?</i>

68
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,098
Don't let them spook you.
They just like to intimidate.

69
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:27,248
They are good at it.

70
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,092
Look.

71
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:32,220
This jail-prison hybrid thing's B.S.

72
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,190
Come on.
The other one's practically empty.

73
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:37,991
You can ride it out to
your court date there.

74
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:41,499
Thank you.

75
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:02,489
Here. This should be a little
bit more comfortable for you.

76
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,290
Okay.

77
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:11,343
What's going on?

78
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:13,712
You know...

79
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:17,177
At first, I couldn't place your name.

80
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,454
Tancredi.
It sounded so familiar.

81
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:23,103
But then, Haggs here, figure it out.

82
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,812
I remember your pretty
face from the papers.

83
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:32,507
You are not going anywhere, fish.
This is going to happen.

84
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:35,898
Half a dozen guards lost their jobs
and pensions at Fox River.

85
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:38,655
Another dozen were put on probation,
after you decided

86
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:42,180
to leave the door open for your boyfriend
and his seven convict pals.

87
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:45,663
And we... ain't gonna let anything
like that happen again.

88
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,785
Don't worry, we won't
hit the baby basket.

89
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,176
Looked like that welcome wagon
ran over your face.

90
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:16,432
It looks that way, huh?

91
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,343
Alright, well...

92
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,867
If you need something,
you just ask for me.

93
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,350
Everybody calls me "Daddy".

94
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,096
Special delivery.

95
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,705
You know, all we need is a little cash,
spread around in places.

96
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:05,027
I told you. The government's
exposing my assets.

97
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,658
You tellin' me you can't get
your hands on the cash?

98
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:11,508
Unless, that's the least you can do.

99
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,705
Considering you're gonna
kill me not too long ago.

100
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,736
Goodbye, Theodore.

101
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:21,526
You ain't never been
incarcerated before,

102
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:24,027
and I never been
incarcerated here. Therefore,

103
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,154
Now let's just say
this handicapped connie

104
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,255
got the juicy hand back
in Fox River.

105
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:34,487
<i>Your pathetic existence here
can be ameliorated.</i>

106
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:36,687
<i>As can my life, all with</i>

107
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,734
a little "Roberto De Niro".

108
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,987
One of our friends has been
apprehended by the authorities.

109
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,706
<i>Looks like we've got
a new neighbour.</i>

110
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:51,149
I'm never gonna get out of
this prison alive. I know that.

111
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,453
I wanna bring my enemy down with me.

112
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,454
I want her...
Dead.

113
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,432
Either way, it's going to
require a capital.

114
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:08,516
A capital you no longer have.

115
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:11,376
My rainy day plan.
You know where it is.

116
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:14,862
Jonathan. I'd assume that
that would be use for your defense.

117
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,657
It's good money at the bad, Joe.

118
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,754
They're not gonna
let me out of here.

119
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:21,355
No matter how many shots that I have.

120
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:27,900
Get that. To our friend, in the
sister cells, across the compound.

121
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:12,659
Excuse me.

122
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,659
<i>Bad move.</i>

123
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,974
Last time someone touched her,
they got a crack kneecap.

124
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,260
You're much braver than
I gave you credit for.

125
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:46,767
Either that,
or you're amazingly nice.

126
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:48,068
Do I look like
I wanna talk to you?

127
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:52,260
I just say, a woman in your position
laid up for some protection.

128
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,817
Join the prison gang?
I don't think so.

129
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:56,407
Not a gang.
No.

130
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:58,308
A family.

131
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:01,743
They don't call her "Daddy"
for nothin'.

132
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:05,642
That's her wife.

133
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,243
And those are her kids.

134
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,712
- Are you okay?
- Stay the hell away from me.

135
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,068
I need the infirmary.

136
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,143
Can't go down to the infirmiary
without the release form.

137
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:25,259
I'm having muscle contractions on my throat.
And my jaws tightening up.

138
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:27,941
It's just--It's just could be indigestions,
I'm not poisoned.

139
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,180
No. That's government cheese.
You'll get used to it.

140
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:32,255
If I don't get to the hospital
in the next 15 minutes,

141
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:35,350
I will die and my baby will die.
Please.

142
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:37,803
<i>Boss.</i>

143
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:39,741
Why don't you let her
go see the doc?

144
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:46,254
Please.

145
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,509
This is Kaorla. We have an
inmate going into the infirmary.

146
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:01,107
We were able to administer
the charcoal ???

147
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:02,904
You and your baby
are gonna be okay.

148
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:08,667
You know the ??? didn't get into
my meatloaf all by itself, right?

149
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,820
Well then, you need to talk
to the warden about it.

150
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:15,982
Then how about talking
to me about your face?

151
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:17,819
You want to tell me
how that happened?

152
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:21,950
I caught an elbow
playing basketball.

153
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:27,069
We should discuss your...
situation.

154
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,819
As I'm sure you've ascertain this isn't
going to be a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

155
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:32,858
Can I deliver in here?

156
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:35,459
No. The day we're induced,
we'll secure you in an ambulance.

157
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,176
We'll take you to St. Lucia
down the road.

158
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:39,579
We'll cordone off a room.

159
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,180
There'll be 3 armed guards
in there with me,

160
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:41,981
when you give birth.

161
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:43,903
Do I get to see my baby?

162
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,512
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it away.

163
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,184
I've seen this process a dozen times.

164
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,943
After the mothers come back here,
the depression's almost unbearable.

165
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,022
My advice,

166
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:01,102
it's a lot less messy, if you'd just
think of yourself as a surrogate.

167
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:13,974
Yeah?

168
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,823
Michael, this Lou Phillips.

169
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,622
Your wife had an incident earlier today.

170
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:20,819
Someone tried to poison her.

171
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:22,817
What are you talking about?

172
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,299
Michael, I need you to focus.

173
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,900
<i>Do you have any idea
who might have done this?</i>

174
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:27,896
Michael?

175
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,708
Michael?!

176
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:32,427
<i>Go ahead, let him in.</i>

177
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:46,744
If I had a list of all the people
who might come to visit me,

178
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,288
Your name will be at the bottom,
somewhere below

179
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,789
Jesus Christ and Scooby Doo.

180
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:55,354
- Someone tried to poison Sara today.
- Mercy--

181
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,027
Only you
would be depraved enough,

182
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,235
to think that killing an innocent woman
and an unborn child

183
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:04,179
will bring you some kind of peace
before your execution.

184
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:06,617
Sara is with child?

185
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:08,863
Congratulations!

186
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:12,464
This is like the 4th of July and
Christmas day rolled into one.

187
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:13,626
I am asking you,

188
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,827
father to father,
to leave her alone.

189
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:19,793
You can kill me
if you want to kill me,

190
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:21,263
I'll trade my life for hers.

191
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:23,461
But leave Sara alone.

192
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:24,944
Michael,

193
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,528
If you were killed,

194
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,029
your pain will last a moment.

195
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:31,909
If Sara were killed,

196
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,110
your pain will last
the rest of your life.

197
00:14:35,303 --> 00:14:38,898
Now that's got to be appealing
to whoever who put out this hit.

198
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,075
But don't worry, Michael.

199
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:44,076
If I find out anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

200
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:48,663
<i>Prison life can be tough.</i>

201
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,101
If I remember correctly,

202
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:52,305
you have two missing toes
that can attest to that bag.

203
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:55,157
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

204
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:56,916
Please.

205
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:00,717
Please just approve the
transfer to another facility.

206
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,979
If I grant her a transfer,
everybody's gonna want one.

207
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,387
What about segregrated housing?

208
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,232
Is there something
that I should know about

209
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,233
the structural integrity of shoe?

210
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:10,714
I can see where this is going.

211
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:11,867
I know who you are.

212
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:14,718
And I'm not going to let you turn
my prison into the next Fox River.

213
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:17,868
All I'm trying to do,
is keep my wife alive.

214
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,752
You do know she's pregnant.

215
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:21,719
I don't care.

216
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:37,789
Here.

217
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,540
- Thanks.
-In case I haven't made myself clear--

218
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:43,540
Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

219
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:48,230
And you've made yourself perfectly clear.
Thank you for your time.

220
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,745
- What happened?
- The General wants Sara dead--

221
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,513
And the warden's just
gonna let that happen.

222
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:59,900
We gotta lure in her case and
needs to get her out, right?

223
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:00,779
Which is not enough time.

224
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,980
If she stays in that prison,
someone's going to kill her.

225
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,508
I guess we don't have a choice.

226
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:10,821
We're breaking her out.

227
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,630
<i>In my 16 years in the Bureau,</i>

228
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:25,431
I've worked cases under
43 different agents.

229
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,249
Alexander Mahone,

230
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,550
is the smartest,

231
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:31,951
bravest,

232
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,869
most honorable man, I've ever
had the pleasure of serving with.

233
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:41,545
As one of those 43 agents,
I can't help but feel a bit offended.

234
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:45,541
Because obviously, I am not as honoured
as this drive addicted murderer.

235
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:49,232
Alex has been clean and
sober for four months.

236
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,986
And he's been completely
exonerated of all crimes

237
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,987
associated with his
involvement with the Company.

238
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:57,311
That doesn't include the shooting
and the murder of one Oscar Shales

239
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,591
- and burying his body under his bird bath--
- That is just an allegation--

240
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:02,738
Let's move on, shall we?

241
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,539
All those in favor of
reinstating Alexander Mahone,

242
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:08,610
a Special Agent in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation--

243
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:10,411
Aye.

244
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,668
- All those oppose?
- Alright, alright, I've--

245
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,984
Thank you for the invite, Richard.

246
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:27,306
It's always a pleasure.

247
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:32,345
You know, Alex.
This ruling can't be revisited.

248
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,167
If you're able to
sufficiently demonstrate,

249
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:37,868
just how committed you
are to a life of service.

250
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,077
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi was arrested recently,

251
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,540
and is currently being house at
the Miami Dade State Penitentiary.

252
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,721
We have concerns that Michael Scofield
may have other plans for her.

253
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:53,828
So this-- this is why
you're invite me in here.

254
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,871
Well obviously, if Scofield were, to be able to
pull off this plot of another breakout,

255
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,982
the public embarassment will
be immensed to the Bureau.

256
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:06,094
So... having someone to get
us a credible information,

257
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,395
that would be worth something to us.

258
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,260
Agent Whitley is set up in Miami.
He will be your contact.

259
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:12,793
You're something else.

260
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:23,032
Now...

261
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,798
We both know...

262
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,899
How badly you want
that badge back.

263
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,950
Give me a reason to give it to you.

264
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,514
What's your plan after we break her out?
We're on the run again?

265
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:36,585
First thing first.
Let's get her out of there.

266
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:37,742
<i>Hey papi.</i>

267
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:40,543
The fed that arrested Sara,
is outside, staking us out.

268
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,428
Look, if you're worried about
getting into trouble again,

269
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:47,029
go back to Chicago,
go back to your family.

270
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:48,713
I'll understand.

271
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:49,980
Are you kidding me?

272
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:51,820
After all the crap we've been through,
I'm just going to leave you here

273
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:52,721
and Sara in there?

274
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:54,956
You shut up and
don't bring it up again.

275
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,876
- What's all that?
- Newspaper clippings--

276
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:02,230
Covering 7 different escape attempts
from Miami Dade's State Pen--

277
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,779
over the last 60 years.
None of them--

278
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,880
None of them successful.

279
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:09,034
So we weigh them all,
and we learn what not to do.

280
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,469
Well the prison officials learned a lot,

281
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,190
They re-evaluated,
they retrofitted,

282
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:14,464
The prison's pratically escape-proof.

283
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:16,831
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine--

284
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,910
I guess so if we can't go through,
what if we go down?

285
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,654
Like down into the prison?
We--we parachute in.

286
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:24,755
Yeah.

287
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:27,436
- Yeah. You parachute in, we find her--
- Are you kidding?

288
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,034
- I'm serious--
- That's suicide!

289
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,442
Newspapers clippings only
going to get us so far.

290
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,387
We need some more
information about the prison.

291
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:35,988
So let's do some recon work.

292
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:40,074
Camera, electronic tape measure,
dry ice. What's this?

293
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,620
It's a shopping list.

294
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:48,240
You need to come with me, doc.

295
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,986
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy in a few minutes.

296
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:51,387
It'll wait.

297
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,542
In here.

298
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:57,512
Hold it.

299
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,542
I don't know what you want,

300
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,234
but I promise you,
I won't go down and fight it.

301
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:12,722
Damn baby, I ain't gonna hurt you.

302
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,033
Hell, I ain't even gonna touch you.

303
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:23,471
See, I run the motor
pool detail in here.

304
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:26,621
And I was thinkin' if you want to
get yourself a little fresh air,

305
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,156
and not have to worry about
getting stab in the back,

306
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,077
then you could come in,
work with me...

307
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,515
You're the fed from my wedding.

308
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:29,237
Yeah, you can call me Agent Whitley.

309
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:30,673
I could call you a lot of things.

310
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:31,876
- Where are you headed?
- Sea World.

311
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:33,732
Sea World?
There isn't one in Miami.

312
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:36,033
- My loss.
- No. What really be your loss,

313
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:38,519
is getting your wife killed,
by doing something stupid.

314
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:41,318
- Are you threatening Sara?
- No, no. Not at all--

315
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,871
I'm just saying that if you gonna try
and revoke her sentence.

316
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:45,472
Bullets fly, Michael.

317
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,546
And if she'd get hurt,
that'll be on you.

318
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:50,546
Funny hearing that from the guy who
put her in prison in the first place.

319
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,032
No, I didn't put her in prison.
State of Florida did.

320
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,878
It's just my job to make sure
that she stays there.

321
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,687
So ah...

322
00:21:58,388 --> 00:21:59,388
where's all your little buddies?

323
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,187
Alright. Drop in some more dry ice.

324
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:26,242
Fence line is 4 feet...
from the road.

325
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:36,395
And 32 feet...
from the east camera.

326
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:39,957
- Hurry up. They're gonna see the laser.
- I'm going as fast as I can, papi--

327
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:46,955
- He followed you?
- Yeah, but he's gone now--

328
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:48,670
You guys almost done?

329
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:53,747
- Almost.
- Great. I'll meet you back at the loft--

330
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:14,902
Well, you're just a natural.

331
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:18,792
I bet you are a hell of a surgeon.

332
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:23,970
Handing out condoms to cons
were makin' you no damn surgeon!

333
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,254
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

334
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:28,228
- You ain't even ask me if she can come...
- One day, for real!

335
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:30,662
Can we go one day without
your mouth? One!

336
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,095
Let it be today.

337
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,453
I'm sorry. You've got to
forgive my old lady, she's--

338
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,711
You just a little bit
easy on eyes, you know?

339
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:51,612
She's just the jealous type.

340
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,100
Crazy is the type she's more like it.

341
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:57,476
What? You're gonna
watch your tone, Agatha.

342
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,377
Sorry--

343
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:01,734
- Or you want me take off my belt?
- Sorry--

344
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:06,969
Kids.

345
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,532
It's rough.
It's hard running a family.

346
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,432
It's important though that, uh--
That you have one--

347
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,433
I have a family.
I have a husband.

348
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:22,941
Oh, you've got a husband?
Is he here?

349
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:26,323
They let you bring it in here,
with you, when you came?

350
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:28,524
No.

351
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:30,896
Yeah, I had a husband too.

352
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,971
18 years is a long time to wait.

353
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,787
So, you know.
If this ain't for you,

354
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:43,988
that's cool.

355
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:50,136
Then you pick up that nasty oil,

356
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:52,337
take it out and put it
in the repository.

357
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:54,138
Okay.

358
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,173
We gotta go, bro.

359
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:27,176
- Take your hands off me.
- When I'm good and ready.

360
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:30,101
What's Burrows doing at the fence?

361
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,383
Please don't make me
ask you again, Sara.

362
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:57,328
Nobody here that'll help you but yourself.
Are you going to answer me?

363
00:25:58,218 --> 00:25:59,219
You tried to kill me.

364
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,382
Line it up, cons.
Go back inside.

365
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:05,510
You, get back to your detail.
Now!

366
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,252
I want you to pass along
an offer to your boy.

367
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:31,146
What he's paying his people to
dust that Tancredi chicken bitch pop,

368
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:33,891
my woman are good for a cut rate.

369
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,335
Just what kind of discount
are you proposing here?

370
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:39,790
Tell him uh--

371
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:43,591
if he's offering a 100 grand,
my girl will take 30.

372
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,744
No, 40. 40.

373
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:49,095
Perfect.

374
00:26:50,297 --> 00:26:51,298
I'll tell him.

375
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,861
Hey, five stars.

376
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,739
So you have no cash,
whatsoever...

377
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,502
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over
the sound of that broken record.

378
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,376
Got it.
I won't ask again.

379
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:34,516
Oh, to what do we
owe the honor?

380
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:36,817
I've been thinking...

381
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:40,821
Well, no need to be uh, shy.
Just spit it out.

382
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,611
I've change my mind.

383
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:45,894
No, well maybe Daddy
change her mind.

384
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,054
Maybe she don't want you
here no more.

385
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:54,380
Sports right. I recently rolled up
my welcome mat. Peace.

386
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:03,660
- Please.
- Please, what?

387
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:08,260
Please, may I be a part
of your family?

388
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,175
Take a walk.

389
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,612
Take a walk!

390
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:24,067
I would love that. I would--
Sit down. I really would.

391
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,949
You see, its not that easy.
It's just saying "I do".

392
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:36,862
See, in order to make a commitment...
to a family,

393
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:47,232
It's something you gotta prove.

394
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:49,506
That's right, we all did it.

395
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,152
It's a commitment...
to the family code.

396
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:05,867
It's a code you gotta wear.

397
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:27,254
Alex!

398
00:29:28,504 --> 00:29:31,257
- What's up?
- How are you doing, man?

399
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:32,660
What's going on?

400
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:34,816
We gotta talk.

401
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,301
Alright.

402
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:38,738
They're watching you.

403
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,825
- We know. We gotta a fed on us.
- No. Not just one.

404
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,582
The whole department.

405
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:46,183
Sounds a lot like inside
information, Alex.

406
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:48,436
What you do?
Make a deal with the feds?

407
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,378
They offered me my old job back,
if I came down here to spy on you.

408
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:56,601
Now the fed you're talking about,
his name is Whitley.

409
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:57,702
He's running point.

410
00:29:58,051 --> 00:29:59,052
So now we know.

411
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,579
So if you really gonna do this,

412
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,380
you gotta do it right.

413
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:05,382
And I'll help you
if you need me.

414
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:09,973
What else do you get?

415
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:12,699
Sara's working the motor pool
today at 4 o'clock.

416
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,503
Motor pool is here.

417
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:17,904
This hold by two security cameras,
along the perimeter of the prison.

418
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:22,147
- What about secondary entrances?
- No loading dock, no personnel entrance--

419
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:22,870
Fences?

420
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,671
15 feet high,
covered with rave wires.

421
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:27,514
- Electrified?
- No. Why?

422
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,747
If Sara can get herself
back to motor pool,

423
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,262
I think we can find
a way inside.

424
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:35,558
With all the different retrofits over
the years, the fence line is widened.

425
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:38,622
But security cameras remain
exactly where they've always been.

426
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:40,543
They've never accounted for the difference.

427
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:43,946
- There's a blindspot.
- Yeah. Right here --

428
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,340
If Sara can get back to that spot,
we can breach the fence.

429
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:47,506
It's risky, Michael.

430
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:49,505
That's all we've got.

431
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:51,693
How much time to tell Sara
where we going to meet her?

432
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:54,380
How? We've got no visitations,
no phone calls.

433
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:04,590
It's clean.
Take it to Tancredi.

434
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,309
<i>Remember when I taught
you about flowers?</i>

435
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,102
<i>I wish I was with you now.</i>

436
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,513
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

437
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:39,185
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

438
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,592
<i>Tomorrow. PM.
Seven. Oil dump.</i>

439
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:20,539
- Sure looks like you've been busy.
- Do you have a warrant, Agent Whitley?

440
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,590
A warrant?
No, I don't need one.

441
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,788
My testimony will be
your brother let me in.

442
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:29,233
Once inside, saw all this evidence,
right in plain sight.

443
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:31,539
What judge gonna take
your word over mine?

444
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,640
What evidence?

445
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:34,670
Those pictures were taken
from public property.

446
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,459
That prison, was paid for
by the taxpayers.

447
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:38,884
So all you have evidence of,

448
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:41,585
is an exonerated citizen,
standing on a public road,

449
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:43,186
taking pictures of a public building.

450
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,620
Last I checked,
it's not a crime.

451
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:48,027
What if I said that I
could get you on attempt,

452
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:50,028
just for having all these stuff?

453
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,261
What if I told you that all this
was peace offering?

454
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,666
The warden won't let me see my wife.

455
00:32:55,428 --> 00:32:57,749
So I figured, if I found a
few lapse in the security,

456
00:32:58,053 --> 00:32:59,873
pointed them out as a
gesture of good faith,

457
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,538
she might change her mind?

458
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:04,184
Is that so?
Find anything yet?

459
00:33:04,662 --> 00:33:06,459
No.
Looks airtight.

460
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,528
Well thank goodness for that.

461
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,829
You guys will let me know
if anything comes up, right?

462
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:14,308
You'll be the first to know.

463
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:33,948
On the outside, I was known
for getting the job done.

464
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:35,227
No matter what.

465
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:36,903
I got paid well for it.

466
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,385
Now I'm broke.
But I still need things.

467
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,067
- Like what?
- A favor.

468
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:45,268
I don't do favors for cons.

469
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:48,265
Really? It's not what it
says on the bathroom walls.

470
00:33:49,023 --> 00:33:52,789
As I understand, you'd do favors
for those who reciprocate.

471
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:58,586
Is that true?

472
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:10,235
This is bullshit, Boss!
I'm a veteran around here.

473
00:34:12,945 --> 00:34:14,424
Ain't no reason to toss me!

474
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,227
You low leaf!

475
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,260
Looky, looky here.

476
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:25,826
No! That brown ain't mine, boss.
You know this!

477
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,059
I do no drugs!

478
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:28,821
Who put that in here?!

479
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:33,587
You ugh--! Take your hands off me.
I know where the hold is.

480
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:35,587
What y'all looking at?

481
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:39,391
I do no drugs!
Somebody is going down there!

482
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:40,665
I love you too.

483
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:44,590
Sofia's making arrangements
in Central America.

484
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,821
Once we break Sara,
we're on the boat, we're gone.

485
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:50,712
- Hey.
- It's Lou.

486
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,113
Just got a decision from the court.

487
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:54,671
They're ordering the warden
to allow supervised visitations.

488
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,344
- Where are you going?
- They're letting me Sara.

489
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:00,745
<i>Pera, pera, pera, pera--</i>

490
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,623
If you going to be listening to every word
you say, you gotta be careful about this.

491
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,698
If she understood my letters,
she'll find a way to tell me.

492
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:10,105
How? She's going to blink
the Morse code?

493
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,181
Oh my God!

494
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:39,305
Oh my God!
Who did this to you?

495
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:41,419
I'm okay.
Baby's okay.

496
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,870
Sara, I'm so sorry.
You're in here because of me.

497
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:51,625
I'm sorry.
This is hard.

498
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,982
<i>- I miss you so much</i>
- No touching--

499
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:00,385
<i>I miss you too.</i>

500
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,597
You just have to
hang in there, okay?

501
00:36:06,384 --> 00:36:08,955
I'm trying.
But my protection's gone.

502
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,596
- Did you get my letter?
- I did.

503
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,229
I know sometimes it's hard for me
to express what I want to say.

504
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:22,718
But I hope you understood...
what I meant to tell you.

505
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:25,019
I did.

506
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:28,949
Isn't he cute?

507
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:33,622
You were there for me.
And I will be there for you.

508
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,386
- Okay.
- Alright, that's it.

509
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:39,948
Time's up.

510
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:43,037
See you soon.

511
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:50,745
Bye.

512
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:11,152
Michael.

513
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,393
I was thinking a lot.

514
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:19,194
About the photos and the mock-up
that you showed me at the loft.

515
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:20,986
And I ran a few tests.

516
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:23,427
Lo and behold,
I've found a blindspot.

517
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,676
Right along the fence line over here,
due to our retrofit.

518
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:31,421
You didn't know about this, did you?
No, no of course not.

519
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,184
Because you would've told me or the warden
about it if you did, right?

520
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:38,417
Well, it's a good thing I found this when
I did, in case anyone tries to escape.

521
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:55,105
Well if we can't go through the fence,
then that leaves under or over.

522
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:58,258
Look, how she gonna climb that
fence without being seen? Huh?

523
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:01,156
I'm guessing there's no telephone
wire for her to climb across.

524
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:04,230
- Then she's gotta go under.
- Alright, lets get some shovels--

525
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:06,594
What was that you were
saying about parachutes?

526
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:07,395
Parachutes--

527
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:11,391
Guys, come on.
You can be ser-- Parachutes?

528
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,386
Couple of thoughts on that.
A - We don't have a plane,

529
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:14,387
B - We don't have a pilot.

530
00:38:15,464 --> 00:38:18,831
- Have you ever worn a parachute?
- Don't worry, I think I've got a plan.

531
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,988
But we're gonna need some
help from an old friend.

532
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:23,689
Who?

533
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,313
- You want a favor from me.
- Just hear me out.

534
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,172
Of course. I mean,

535
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,473
when you and Michael send
me back to that prison,

536
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,674
you did give me
a piece of chewing gum.

537
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,521
I mean what kind of man will I be
if I don't quit your pro-quote?

538
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,522
Look,

539
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,109
All you gotta do is sound off
the fire alarm, in here

540
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,878
Tomorrow night
at 7:30.

541
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:44,512
That's it.

542
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:47,908
- You're breaking her out.
- Krantz has put a hit on her,

543
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:50,243
that's a one shot,

544
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:53,144
of keeping her alive.

545
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,824
Well you're on a pivoted
kind of damn, Lincoln.

546
00:38:56,028 --> 00:38:58,826
We'll put 5 grand on your cake
once this whole thing jumps off.

547
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:02,831
The love of Michael's life
is only worth of $ 5,000?

548
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,106
That's the best we can do.

549
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:06,980
- I need six figures.
- That's all we got--

550
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,345
Alackaday for you, I know somebody
who does... the general's man.

551
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,241
He's got the payout for Sara's hit.

552
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:22,592
You wire that money to me by 7pm
tomorrow, and we're in business.

553
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:23,700
What is his name?

554
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:25,601
It's your brother to you
that agony is.

555
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:29,316
- Come on, you gotta give me more than that.
- Tomorrow. 7pm. Go on, fetch.

556
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:44,192
You should have seen the
look on Michael's face.

557
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,753
When he saw me fixing that fence
and installing that camera.

558
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:49,700
You did a great job.

559
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:52,751
Job's over now.

560
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:57,748
If Michael has this misguided belief
that Sara's life is in danger,

561
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,903
he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

562
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,883
Your job will be over until
you give us enough evidence

563
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,315
to put him back behind bars.

564
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,110
So what's the latest?

565
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:09,853
There's nothing concrete.

566
00:40:10,554 --> 00:40:11,954
But I'll let you know
when I get something.

567
00:40:12,698 --> 00:40:14,984
Alright.
Good man.

568
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:41,706
Tough going alone.

569
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:45,039
I know he's breaking you out.
I'm coming with you.

570
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,821
Relax.
Krantz sent me to kill you,

571
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:56,674
but after what he's put me through,
I'm done taking orders from him.

572
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,601
You're sitting next to me at
the mess when I was poisoned.

573
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:00,986
You'd think you would've lasted
this long if I wanted you dead?

574
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,520
I want you dead.
You're still alive.

575
00:41:03,592 --> 00:41:05,753
Don't you think it's hard to stay alive
when you know who's coming after you?

576
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:11,033
There's 200 women in this prison.
Bet do you even get to Gen Pop?

577
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:17,895
I'm coming with you.

578
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:19,396
Or nobody's going.

579
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:51,621
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.

580
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:53,822
Because that means you're safe.

581
00:42:02,514 --> 00:42:05,392
- How does he think he's gonna do this, bro?
- He's going to jump out of the plane.

582
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:07,345
I know he's gonna jump.
The question is, can he land?

583
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:08,885
Not without getting caught.

584
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,350
And how is he going to get
out of cell block, even if T-Bag--

585
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:14,627
It's a big "if".
Trusting T-Bag is... crazy.

586
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:19,219
Michael, we uh--
we really have to re-think this.

587
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,320
I have.
And there's no other way.

588
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,599
Okay.

589
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,990
I'm going to drop down
into this outer area here.

590
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,594
And I cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

591
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:29,987
They're going to be
right on your ass.

592
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:32,316
I can hide behind this building,
wait for a window.

593
00:42:32,622 --> 00:42:33,828
Then I'll make my way over here.

594
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:37,921
That's the chapel. Well hopefully uh--
Sara will be waiting.

595
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:38,822
Why the chapel?

596
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:42,127
During the riot in '88, prison employees
escaped through the administration building.

597
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,696
They wound up here,
outside the fence.

598
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:47,773
The administration building,
is connected to the chapel.

599
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:49,912
Which means that
somewhere in that compound,

600
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:51,513
there is a subterranean exit.

601
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,583
If we can get through it,

602
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:55,584
you can meet us there.

603
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:58,979
- How's Sara gonna get to the chapel?
- She'll have to find a way.

604
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:02,659
Look, we're doing this at 7pm tonight,
just like we've planned.

605
00:43:03,016 --> 00:43:04,688
- Where have you been?
- What did I missed?

606
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,172
I need you to find a plane
and a pilot.

607
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,415
And you two,
to take care of T-Bag.

608
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,658
Find out exactly who has this money,
and where they're keeping it.

609
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:15,584
- And then we have to get it.
- By 7pm tonight.

610
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:20,253
Or Sara's going to die in there.

611
00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:22,689
Is everybody onboard?

612
00:43:24,578 --> 00:43:25,579
Okay.

613
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:31,179
Tell me, you've completed
your assignment.

614
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:36,020
Well, I got the cash. But there'll
may be some delay in final delivery.

615
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,375
The woman we hired is having trouble
getting near Sara Tancredi.

616
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:41,740
Then hire somebody else.
Call it open season.

617
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,896
<i>Put a bounty on her head.
I don't care how you do it.</i>

618
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:47,097
<i>I want Sara Tancredi</i>
dead by the end of the day.

619
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:51,861
<i>Open cells!
One hour!</i>

620
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,773
We're about to play cards,
do you want in?

621
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:07,052
I'm okay.
Thanks.

622
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:08,580
You should.

623
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:11,455
With Daddy gone,
you're gonna need your backup.

624
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,252
Hell, we all did.

625
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:21,038
- I've got uh-- a pre-natal thing.
- It's cool.

626
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:21,939
Thanks.

627
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:24,300
Not too smart though, for a
girl with a bounty on her head.

628
00:44:27,502 --> 00:44:28,503
Aren't you heard?

629
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:32,777
Tancredi, you have a visitor.

630
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:37,462
Say hello to your husband for me.

631
00:44:49,893 --> 00:44:50,894
What's wrong?

632
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,292
Look, um...

633
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:58,660
I know you don't have any control
over what's happened here, but uh--

634
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:02,133
Things aren't working out.

635
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,503
Okay.

636
00:45:06,252 --> 00:45:10,871
I'm trying to find a way to--
To do... this.

637
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:15,225
But from where we're standing
right now, there's only one option.

638
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:18,121
Do you need more time...
to think?

639
00:45:19,322 --> 00:45:21,222
<i>No. No, it's not
about that.</i>

640
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:26,102
<i>I've made up my mind. Cause there's
nothing you could do about it.</i>

641
00:45:27,455 --> 00:45:30,583
Except...
pray for us tonight.

642
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:32,737
Pray for us?

643
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:35,180
You can pray for us
to be together.

644
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:37,771
Maybe I'll do the same.

645
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:45,262
How can I rob someone if
I've no clue who he is?

646
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:49,213
The logbook outside says that
Krantz had one visitor yesterday.

647
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,614
A Joe Daniels.

648
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:54,943
Well if he was in the power deduction,
I'd say, Daniels is your bagman.

649
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,896
You know how many Daniels live Miami?
Thousands. I need more.

650
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:01,611
Well you better get crackin', cause
if I ain't get that money by 7 o'clock,

651
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,022
you ain't got your fire,
you ain't got your fire alarm.

652
00:46:04,222 --> 00:46:06,099
And that means Pretty
ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

653
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:08,970
Listen my friend, you're in
no position to makin' demands--

654
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:09,971
Okay, shh--

655
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,904
I ain't talking about
backing out the deal.

656
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:16,105
I put my ear on the ground
and come up with some details.

657
00:46:16,378 --> 00:46:17,379
Good.

658
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:19,613
And now, fetch.

659
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,255
We've got a pilot.

660
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,746
There's a guy I'd busted 20 years ago,
running drugs across the Gulf.

661
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:34,104
Went legit.
Went to charter business now.

662
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,029
He must've jumped
out of a few planes, huh?

663
00:46:36,222 --> 00:46:39,589
Yes, several. Some for sport.
Some necessity.

664
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,896
It's a big difference, Michael.

665
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:44,692
It's not easy hitting the X,
especially at night.

666
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:47,101
Don't worry.
I can go alone.

667
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,457
- What do you got?
- It's a test.

668
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,058
See, the prison was built
in the mid-80's,

669
00:46:53,736 --> 00:46:55,059
so that exit in the
administration building

670
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,060
is probably protected
by an electronic code of lock,

671
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,024
modified by a security card.

672
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:04,182
Those locks don't have power protection,
which means you can overwrite them.

673
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:07,268
Then you can't just go to the building,
shut it and blow it out?

674
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:08,169
No.

675
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,054
1200 volt power surge will
just set off the other alarms.

676
00:47:12,862 --> 00:47:14,261
Not to mention
that it'll kill you.

677
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,894
- So we have to find another way.
- Yeah--

678
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,401
Yeah.

679
00:47:37,402 --> 00:47:38,902
Talk to me, Mahone.
What have you got?

680
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:41,744
- Nothing yet.
<i>- I don't need updates on the hour.</i>

681
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:43,977
I need evidence, intent.
It's not crap.

682
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,121
<i>Call me when he's in the
process of committing a crime.</i>

683
00:47:46,122 --> 00:47:46,622
Yeah.

684
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,942
I'm not going to let him walk
away from me like he did from you.

685
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:51,098
<i>It's going down if I've
got to shoot him in the back.</i>

686
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,021
Sorry.

687
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:11,585
Are we friends now?

688
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:13,898
Get out of the way!
What happened here?!

689
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:14,975
I didn't see anything, sir.

690
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:16,582
Move!

691
00:49:27,896 --> 00:49:28,942
Bad news.

692
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,741
Agatha Warren is dead.

693
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:42,589
- Who did that?
- No one's talking.

694
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:47,333
But I hear it says fish.
Tancredi and Morgan.

695
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,381
No!

696
00:49:51,303 --> 00:49:52,747
No!

697
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:55,132
There he is.

698
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:58,180
If you don't like this guy,
we can still find someone else.

699
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,461
Good to see you, Sni.

700
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:03,188
What you get into here, Mahone?

701
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:05,945
Jumping off 1500 feet
ain't going to be easy.

702
00:50:06,178 --> 00:50:07,444
You've gone back
on your word already?

703
00:50:07,445 --> 00:50:09,345
Let's not forget who's
doing who a favor here.

704
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:10,346
Favor?

705
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:13,337
Favor that I bust your old lady
for traficking. No, I did not.

706
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:18,107
If anyone asks,
I was flying tourists to the Keys,

707
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:21,384
- And it's not my fault they jumped.
- Sounds good to me.

708
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,029
If you don't like this guy,
we'd take a day

709
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:33,702
- We come up with a new plan.
- No, there's no time, Alex.

710
00:50:35,178 --> 00:50:38,022
-It's not just Sara's life at risk.
- I understand that.

711
00:50:39,132 --> 00:50:42,101
I know you do. That's why I also
know I can ask for your help.

712
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:46,418
- Yeah. What do you need?
- If I don't make it--

713
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:50,101
I want you to make sure Sara and
my brother get out of the country alive.

714
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,029
I need to know
they're gonna be okay.

715
00:50:53,538 --> 00:50:56,314
And I'm gonna trust that you'll do
everything you can to make that happen.

716
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:02,945
Take this.

717
00:51:09,944 --> 00:51:11,104
I trust you, Alex.

718
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:14,492
Remember that.

719
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:45,980
Special delivery.

720
00:51:46,492 --> 00:51:48,869
- What is it?
- I don't exactly know.

721
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:51,424
It came via messenger from uh--
the lady side.

722
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:56,059
"My man on the outside needs to know
who to call for the birthday present."

723
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,304
Who's birthday is it?

724
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:07,597
Well see to it that it gets back
to the same place.

725
00:52:07,598 --> 00:52:08,698
Will do.

726
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:15,983
So this is Joe Daniels number, right?

727
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:18,878
Is that enough information or you need
a social security number too?

728
00:52:19,024 --> 00:52:20,264
- That'll do.
<i>- Remember--</i>

729
00:52:20,664 --> 00:52:23,189
I want that money wired to
the account number specified.

730
00:52:23,258 --> 00:52:24,464
No wire, no fire.

731
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:25,809
You boys do me wrong,

732
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,110
I have no qualms at all about singing
it loud and clear, you understand?

733
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,386
You know what?
Just be ready.

734
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:33,469
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

735
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:35,179
That was Sofia.

736
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:37,902
She'll meet you at San Andreas harbor
in Dominican Republic and then

737
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:39,822
- you guys can fly to Costa Rica.
- Cool.

738
00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:41,383
I know where Daniels is.

739
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,448
And after we rob him, I'll take
the money to Quik Green and uh--

740
00:52:44,976 --> 00:52:45,977
wire to the bank.

741
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,190
- You will meet us at the airstrip, right?
- Might give a shot now.

742
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:50,191
Okay.
This is it.

743
00:52:51,899 --> 00:52:52,900
We're ready.

744
00:52:56,102 --> 00:52:57,103
Thanks, buddy.

745
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,260
For everything.

746
00:53:01,336 --> 00:53:03,588
Good luck, papi.
See you on the other side.

747
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,666
Nobody's talking, huh?
Girl's dead. No one's said any?

748
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,822
I made it in the workshop.

749
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:25,313
Want to give to my daughter Emily
a birthday gift on her actual birthday.

750
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:27,466
So I need to get out of here.

751
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:32,744
- You're never sentimental.
- Oh, I'm not. It's just for her.

752
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:41,468
We need to get to the chapel.

753
00:53:44,306 --> 00:53:45,269
We?

754
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,470
There's no way out of here right now.
I'm gonna need you.

755
00:54:03,879 --> 00:54:04,812
Yeah?

756
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:07,313
Mr. Daniels, American Paint Company
<i>here for the job.</i>

757
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:11,032
Well, this is Mr. Daniels but
I didn't order any painters.

758
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:15,990
<i>It's Wednesday, sir.
I believe you did.</i>

759
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:18,546
Hold it right there.
I'm calling the police.

760
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:35,308
Get out!

761
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:42,183
This is it.

762
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,824
I'll be right back.
Gotta get that parachute.

763
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:02,620
Michael!

764
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:05,542
Come here.

765
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,981
There's a better way.

766
00:55:14,058 --> 00:55:16,595
<i>Mess!</i>
Mess, half hour.

767
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:22,597
<i>Little faster.
We don't have all day.</i>

768
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:25,745
<i>Let's go!</i>

769
00:55:31,822 --> 00:55:32,823
Got any ideas?

770
00:55:33,182 --> 00:55:35,855
Yeah. Keep your head down and follow me.
I'll think of something.

771
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:43,136
You better think of something fast,
'cause we have company.

772
00:56:05,058 --> 00:56:06,753
I hope you're ready
for a fight, princess.

773
00:56:07,182 --> 00:56:08,262
This one's to the death.

774
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:14,593
Do you think you can overpower her?

775
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,623
Yeah. I don't think it's her
you have to worry about.

776
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,384
Just be ready.

777
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:37,190
- Hello?
- It's me.

778
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:39,991
I've got the message
about the birthday present?

779
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,597
- Was the gift earned?
- What in the hell are you talking about?

780
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:46,315
- The birthday present!
- Birthday present?

781
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:48,787
Two guys showed up at my house,
they took the money and they beat

782
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:50,188
<i> the crap out of me.</i>

783
00:57:01,029 --> 00:57:02,030
Howdy, General.

784
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,865
I just thought of let you know
how I came up with some green.

785
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:12,473
My personal preference is two
Zegna bars and a copy of the Times.

786
00:57:13,622 --> 00:57:15,192
So I see you in the AM?

787
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:19,469
You worthless son of a whore.
Go to hell!

788
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:21,394
Careful I don't get there first.

789
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:24,990
Unless I become the
king of that prison, too.

790
00:57:33,138 --> 00:57:35,789
Alright, from takeoff, the
prison's gonna come up real fast.

791
00:57:36,138 --> 00:57:38,387
So whatever you gotta do
to get ready, do it now.

792
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,188
You get it.

793
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:42,266
We've got the money.

794
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:44,867
Sucre's just dropped me off
on the way to wire it.

795
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:47,028
Good.
That means T-Bag's set.

796
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:49,314
I'm goin' to see how long it's
gonna take and we get going.

797
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:55,142
- You sure that thing's gonna hold you up?
- Yes, it'll be fine.

798
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:57,185
What about you?

799
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,856
This is not my first time
inside a prison.

800
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:02,989
But hopefully...
Will be my last.

801
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,959
Think about all the amazing stories
that you're gonna tell your kid.

802
00:58:19,138 --> 00:58:21,265
You're gonna be the type
of father our dad never was.

803
00:58:22,388 --> 00:58:23,503
Someone to look up to.

804
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,118
Take care, Michael.

805
00:58:32,623 --> 00:58:34,248
<i>Unless you've got details,
I'm hanging up.</i>

806
00:58:34,549 --> 00:58:36,549
And you can forget about
getting your badge back.

807
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:38,750
He's got a plane.
He's got a parachute into the yard.

808
00:58:38,826 --> 00:58:40,191
- What?
- I swear to God,

809
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:42,428
he's gonna be over
<i>prison airspace at 7 o'clock.</i>

810
00:58:49,186 --> 00:58:51,950
Call in reinforcements.
I want 20 armed COs in the yard.

811
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,827
And be ready to turn off
all exterior lights.

812
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:56,033
Scofield won't see what's coming,
until it's too late.

813
00:58:57,185 --> 00:58:58,504
And bring me Sara Tancredi.

814
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:06,467
Wait, wait.

815
00:59:07,216 --> 00:59:09,423
What do you think happened with
Agatha, it's not what happened.

816
00:59:09,592 --> 00:59:11,150
I need to make this
right with you, okay?

817
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:12,851
Go ahead.

818
00:59:14,186 --> 00:59:15,471
I was hoping I'd see you here.

819
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:19,430
You know I still owe you
one big juicy favor.

820
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:21,192
Later, blue eyes.

821
00:59:21,264 --> 00:59:24,472
I swear to God she wanted to kill me
and I was just defending myself.

822
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:27,187
- You remember that?
- Yes, I do.

823
00:59:27,623 --> 00:59:28,624
My momma gave me that.

824
00:59:30,702 --> 00:59:32,829
Told me I was going to give it
to one of my kids one day.

825
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:37,395
Not only did I get knocked up,
but the girl in the family...

826
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:42,318
And I practically raised Agatha
and she was no killer.

827
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,861
Now I can say
that much for myself.

828
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:49,790
You didn't know
what I had in mind yet.

829
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:53,189
Okay, listen, you're right.
Agatha isn't a killer.

830
00:59:53,264 --> 00:59:56,779
She was just a-- real bitch with
a bit of more than she need to.

831
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:01,859
Skittles.

832
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,600
Okay.

833
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:08,040
We cool. We cool.
We cool, whoa, whoa, whoa.

834
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:12,706
<i>Kaorla. She'd want you to
bring Tancredi to her office.</i>

835
01:00:14,062 --> 01:00:15,188
A'ight? Okay.

836
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,751
Son of a bitch!

837
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,033
They coming right
through here, okay?

838
01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:49,682
Federal agent Todd Whitley.
I need to get inside right now.

839
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,274
Emergency team takes priority, sir.

840
01:00:51,344 --> 01:00:53,596
I'm the leader of the emergency team.
Now let me inside.

841
01:00:53,672 --> 01:00:56,709
- Sorry. Strict orders.
- Go talk to your supervisor. Come on!

842
01:00:57,907 --> 01:00:59,955
<i>No weapons!
Let the suburban through.</i>

843
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:10,831
The plane should be overhead
any minute.

844
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:13,425
Hey, fellas!
Kill the lights.

845
01:01:23,548 --> 01:01:25,789
As soon as he hits the ground,
I want one of you to start firing.

846
01:01:31,032 --> 01:01:32,033
Standby.

847
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:38,595
We're standing by.

848
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:42,118
Easy now.
Hold your fire.

849
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,111
Standby!

850
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,141
Now!

851
01:01:56,378 --> 01:01:57,902
Let's go.
Move in, men!

852
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:16,936
Where the hell's Scofield?

853
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:29,302
<i>Emergency team takes priority, sir.</i>

854
01:02:29,376 --> 01:02:32,209
<i>I'm the leader of the emergency team.
Now let me inside right now.</i>

855
01:02:32,298 --> 01:02:34,493
<i>I've strict orders.
No one gets inside at this point, sir.</i>

856
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:36,456
<i>I don't know what your orders are.
Go talk to your supervisor.</i>

857
01:02:58,205 --> 01:03:00,025
<i>Why isn't Tancredi
in front of me right now?</i>

858
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:03,304
We've just got the situation under control.
We're looking for her right now.

859
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:05,487
Oh my God!

860
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,534
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. It was Morgan.

861
01:03:09,768 --> 01:03:11,542
Check the kitchen.
They might be in the kitchen.

862
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:48,381
I'm not gonna make it on my own.

863
01:03:51,736 --> 01:03:54,182
Either leave me with tools here
or make up your damn mind.

864
01:04:12,847 --> 01:04:16,021
- Are you gonna be able to make it?
- Yeah.

865
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:17,582
Okay.
It's now.

866
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,301
Alright, hold up.

867
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,661
Nah, I think we're good.

868
01:05:03,848 --> 01:05:04,849
<i>Don't move!</i>

869
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,282
- Stood on the dark, now!
- Please, I just ...

870
01:05:15,283 --> 01:05:17,183
On the ground!

871
01:05:25,614 --> 01:05:26,615
You're here alone?

872
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:30,539
Damn it, con. When I ask
you a question, you answer.

873
01:05:30,613 --> 01:05:32,308
Is there anyone else here?

874
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,021
Yes.

875
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:36,942
Who?

876
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:41,975
- God.
- Excuse me?

877
01:05:43,332 --> 01:05:44,412
He's always here.

878
01:05:46,128 --> 01:05:48,130
I was worried about my little girl
on the outside.

879
01:05:49,175 --> 01:05:53,691
So I came to pray.
See if someone would watch over her.

880
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:00,130
Go check it out.

881
01:06:21,536 --> 01:06:23,822
<i>The stove mess is open.
Need support right now!</i>

882
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:25,466
<i>I've got to get
these animals lockdown!</i>

883
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:26,772
We better head over there.

884
01:06:33,896 --> 01:06:34,716
<i>I hope that daughter of yours</i>

885
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:37,617
- is hell a lot smarter than you.
- So do I.

886
01:06:56,537 --> 01:06:57,538
Are you ready to go?

887
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:06,263
Nobody gets in or out of this prison.

888
01:07:06,334 --> 01:07:08,276
I don't care if it's the President
having to take a piss,

889
01:07:08,277 --> 01:07:09,577
you tell him to turn the hell around.

890
01:07:09,975 --> 01:07:10,976
Get a team.

891
01:07:11,053 --> 01:07:14,022
I want every inch of that fence line
checked for points of compromise.

892
01:07:14,178 --> 01:07:15,179
Yes, sir.

893
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:21,262
Michael said this is where
they're gonna come out.

894
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,948
You think Sucre make the drop on time?

895
01:07:27,302 --> 01:07:28,303
I don't know.

896
01:07:38,411 --> 01:07:39,696
No, no, no.

897
01:07:45,178 --> 01:07:47,032
<i>Please enter your account number.</i>

898
01:07:49,243 --> 01:07:51,185
9248. #

899
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:57,265
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

900
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,618
<i>If you would like to
access another account--</i>

901
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,064
9248. #

902
01:08:04,897 --> 01:08:09,140
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

903
01:08:10,663 --> 01:08:13,029
What the hell you thinking you're
doing, fish? We're in lockdown.

904
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:13,909
What for?

905
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,210
Something's going on in
bitch block. I don't know.

906
01:08:17,662 --> 01:08:19,266
What's it worth to you
to find out?

907
01:08:26,459 --> 01:08:27,460
We're going to get through here?

908
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:30,627
On the other side is a kind of an
escape patch for the administrators.

909
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:32,028
In case of a riot.

910
01:08:32,382 --> 01:08:34,054
If this is the same system
they have in Fox River,

911
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,424
that door can only be open
remotely from the Centre Control.

912
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:38,698
That's why we've gone
and ask for help.

913
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,383
T-Bag.

914
01:08:44,694 --> 01:08:45,820
Tell them what you told me.

915
01:08:47,102 --> 01:08:49,423
Michael Scofield is about
to stage a prison break.

916
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:53,620
And I know <i>exactly</i>
how he's gonna do it.

917
01:08:56,694 --> 01:08:58,571
Exactly what did
Scofield asks you to do?

918
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,741
Just light a fire in my cell.

919
01:09:00,742 --> 01:09:03,542
And the rest...
the rest will just take care of itself.

920
01:09:04,616 --> 01:09:07,221
A fire alarm. If that goes off,
what's your protocol?

921
01:09:07,336 --> 01:09:08,860
State law, mandatory evac.

922
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,674
Hell, he won't go break, I was
goin' to get you and escort her out.

923
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:13,312
- Shut up!
- Get him outta here.

924
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,822
Alright, the evacuation's only
going to get him out in the yard.

925
01:09:18,102 --> 01:09:21,310
Whatever he's up to, he needs noise
and he needs chaos.

926
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,421
Deactivate the smoke detection system,
the fire alarm,

927
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:25,777
and while you're at it,
kill the horn.

928
01:09:26,133 --> 01:09:28,947
If anybody so much as bends a
blade of grass in this place,

929
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,548
I want him to be able to hear it.

930
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:39,672
- Why are we waiting for?
- We made a deal.

931
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:43,931
With the right price,
T-Bag will set off the fire alarms.

932
01:09:55,383 --> 01:09:56,543
That's what we're waiting for.

933
01:10:09,774 --> 01:10:10,934
- Michael, there's a--
- It's okay.

934
01:10:11,696 --> 01:10:14,699
See, there's only one thing you can count on
when you're dealing with T-Bag.

935
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,337
He's a rat.

936
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:20,625
Anything?

937
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:22,626
So far just a female inmate
loose in the yard.

938
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,857
- Tancredi?
- No, Morgan. First name, Gretchen.

939
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,465
- Over by the chapel.
- Alright.

940
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:36,665
Alright.

941
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:41,260
Great.
Let's go.

942
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:50,389
Okay, down there.

943
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:07,921
Okay.

944
01:11:08,775 --> 01:11:11,346
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

945
01:11:12,025 --> 01:11:13,310
On the other end of that, is Linc,

946
01:11:13,384 --> 01:11:14,109
and after that,

947
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:17,310
there's a boat mounted
for the white sands and blue water.

948
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:24,336
A power surge to the system, will override
the reader, for just a few seconds.

949
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,143
Just long enough for you
to open that, so get ready.

950
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,701
3, 2, 1.

951
01:11:36,696 --> 01:11:37,697
One more time.

952
01:11:39,134 --> 01:11:40,931
3, 2, 1.

953
01:11:48,854 --> 01:11:50,105
I was afraid this might happen.

954
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:52,371
It's okay.
It's alright.

955
01:11:52,372 --> 01:11:54,272
We're going to keep moving and
we're gonna find another way out of here.

956
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,037
I know what I have to do.

957
01:12:14,214 --> 01:12:17,468
I need units to the chapel.
Now!

958
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:28,532
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

959
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:29,833
They should've been here by now.

960
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:36,667
The battery wasn't
generating enough power.

961
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:38,933
We have to blow up the system
for the whole building.

962
01:12:43,746 --> 01:12:45,145
Okay.
What do you want to try?

963
01:12:47,744 --> 01:12:48,824
This is the main fuse.

964
01:12:48,902 --> 01:12:49,765
If I yanked that,

965
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,066
everything will go dark
for a second.

966
01:12:53,105 --> 01:12:54,629
I reconnect these two cables...

967
01:12:57,214 --> 01:12:58,624
If I reconnect these two cables,

968
01:12:59,136 --> 01:12:59,903
there'll be a lot of noise,

969
01:13:00,704 --> 01:13:02,504
every light bulb in this place
is going to blow.

970
01:13:02,574 --> 01:13:04,394
As soon as that happens,
you need to open that hatch.

971
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:06,580
And I want you
to start running.

972
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,114
Okay.
What about you?

973
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:16,417
Michael?

974
01:13:17,855 --> 01:13:18,856
Sara...

975
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,427
Someone has to stay here,

976
01:13:23,328 --> 01:13:24,828
and someone has to
open the hatch.

977
01:13:25,933 --> 01:13:27,343
And that someone's gotta be you.

978
01:13:27,746 --> 01:13:29,668
Okay. So I'll leave it
open for you.

979
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:31,699
You don't understand.

980
01:13:32,698 --> 01:13:33,824
This is the only way.

981
01:13:40,105 --> 01:13:42,187
I'm not leaving unless
you're coming with me.

982
01:13:45,105 --> 01:13:46,265
But I am coming with you.

983
01:13:53,746 --> 01:13:54,747
I love you.

984
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:57,423
God, I love you too.

985
01:14:03,059 --> 01:14:04,060
Go!

986
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:07,218
Go, Sara.
Go.

987
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:11,419
Downstairs.

988
01:15:30,263 --> 01:15:31,264
Where's Michael?

989
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,551
Sara, where is he?
Where's Michael?

990
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:38,498
Where is he?

991
01:15:52,934 --> 01:15:53,992
He's not coming back.

992
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:01,546
He's not coming back.

993
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,427
What do you mean, he's not coming back?
What do you mean by that?

994
01:16:08,904 --> 01:16:09,905
He's not coming back.

995
01:16:16,498 --> 01:16:17,499
He'll be here.

996
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:21,702
He's gone, Lincoln.

997
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:30,858
Linc, we've gotta go.

998
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,061
We've gotta go.

999
01:16:54,218 --> 01:16:55,219
We've gotta go.

1000
01:17:32,218 --> 01:17:36,507
Why am I being punished?!
I'm the guy through the window!

1001
01:17:36,624 --> 01:17:38,785
You aided and abetted
an escape, Mr. Bagwell.

1002
01:17:38,858 --> 01:17:41,634
And as far as the authorities are
concerned, you're an accomplice.

1003
01:17:43,344 --> 01:17:44,629
Scofield!

1004
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:47,681
Scofield!

1005
01:17:51,391 --> 01:17:54,588
Scofield!

1006
01:18:17,188 --> 01:18:19,270
Michael asked me to give you this,
if he didn't make it out.

1007
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,548
He said it would help you understand
why he did what he did.

1008
01:18:27,438 --> 01:18:28,996
It's his bloodwork.

1009
01:18:52,672 --> 01:18:53,832
This is the General's money.

1010
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:58,549
I was supposed to wire it down to
Costa Rica for you to pick up but uh--

1011
01:19:00,262 --> 01:19:01,422
I ran into some trouble.

1012
01:19:03,544 --> 01:19:04,545
I'm sorry.

1013
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,910
You take care of that baby, okay?

1014
01:19:10,295 --> 01:19:11,398
You take care yours.

1015
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:40,111
This is for you.

1016
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,300
He never said anything to me.

1017
01:19:45,423 --> 01:19:46,469
Why didn't he just tell me?

1018
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:49,869
'Cause he knew you'll try
to stop him.

1019
01:19:50,672 --> 01:19:52,401
He knew you do anything
to protect your family.

1020
01:19:53,064 --> 01:19:54,065
But I didn't.

1021
01:20:00,298 --> 01:20:01,798
<i>Well...</i>

1022
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:04,034
You will soon.

1023
01:20:07,909 --> 01:20:08,910
Take it easy.

1024
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,221
Sara.

1025
01:20:21,548 --> 01:20:22,549
Thank you.

1026
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:26,190
Yeah.

1027
01:21:05,534 --> 01:21:07,058
<i>Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.</i>

1028
01:21:08,052 --> 01:21:09,258
<i>Because that means you're safe.</i>

1029
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:14,292
<i>And that's all I ever wanted.</i>

1030
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,746
<i>I wish I could...
be there with you.</i>

1031
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,902
<i>But as you probably know now,</i>

1032
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,853
<i>I wouldn't have much
time anyway, so--</i>

1033
01:21:27,456 --> 01:21:29,272
<i>I've made my choice,
and--</i>

1034
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:31,973
<i>I don't regret it.</i>

1035
01:21:35,331 --> 01:21:37,379
<i>Anyway,
not too long from now,</i>

1036
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,780
<i>there's going to be another
Scofield running around.</i>

1037
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:41,794
<i>And Linc,</i>

1038
01:21:42,595 --> 01:21:43,995
<i>I want you to promise me,</i>

1039
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:45,296
<i>no matter what,</i>

1040
01:21:45,924 --> 01:21:48,336
<i>they're going to grow up knowing
their uncle is never far away.</i>

1041
01:21:50,768 --> 01:21:51,577
<i>And Sara,</i>

1042
01:21:52,478 --> 01:21:54,978
<i>I want you to promise me that
you're gonna keep an eye on Linc.</i>

1043
01:21:56,096 --> 01:21:58,382
<i>As you may have notice, he has
the tendency to get in trouble.</i>

1044
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:06,969
<i>You know we spend
so much of our lives,</i>

1045
01:22:08,016 --> 01:22:09,768
<i>not saying the things
we want to say.</i>

1046
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,175
<i>The things we should say.</i>

1047
01:22:13,924 --> 01:22:16,244
<i>We speak in codes,
we send little messages.</i>

1048
01:22:16,845 --> 01:22:18,045
<i>Origami.</i>

1049
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:22,103
<i>So now, plainly,
simply,</i>

1050
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:25,655
<i>I want to say that
I love you both.</i>

1051
01:22:29,206 --> 01:22:30,207
<i>Very much.</i>

1052
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,486
<i>And I want you to promise me,</i>

1053
01:22:35,687 --> 01:22:37,287
<i>that you're gonna tell my child,</i>

1054
01:22:39,926 --> 01:22:43,293
<i>that you're gonna tell my child
how much they're loved every day.</i>

1055
01:22:44,535 --> 01:22:46,389
<i>and remind them
how lucky they are,</i>

1056
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:48,690
<i>to be free.</i>

1057
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:51,412
<i>Because we are.</i>

1058
01:22:53,284 --> 01:22:54,576
<i>We're free now.</i>

1059
01:22:56,077 --> 01:22:57,177
<i>Finally.</i>

1060
01:22:59,777 --> 01:23:00,777
<i>We're free.</i>
