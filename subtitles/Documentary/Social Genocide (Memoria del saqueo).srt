1
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:59,682
A SOCIAL GENOCIDE

2
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:41,844
To those who resisted

3
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,555
during all those years

4
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,327
To their dignity and their courage

5
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,124
Argentina, October 2001:

6
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:58,645
The government of the Alliance
loses the legislative elections.

7
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:02,920
President De la Rúa
refuses to change his policies.

8
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,119
In 2 years of power,

9
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:14,843
his progressive program was replaced
by the plans of the IMF,

10
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,437
a continuation
of the policies of Carlos Menem.

11
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,562
The recession deepens

12
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:35,239
Millions are poverty-stricken
and unemployed

13
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,924
Massive flight of capital

14
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:48,680
Bank-accounts are blocked

15
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:55,396
The crisis worsens

16
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,486
December 19, 2001

17
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:04,565
<i>In view of the situation,</i>

18
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:06,605
<i>I have decreed a state of siege</i>

19
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,405
<i>for the entire country,</i>

20
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,718
<i>and informed Congress of it.</i>

21
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,765
<i>Our country is going through</i>
<i>a difficult period...</i>

22
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:47,078
Kick 'em all out!

23
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:49,363
Every one of them!

24
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,725
The government must resign

25
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,760
Together, we'll never be defeated!

26
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,758
<i>After many years</i>

27
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,641
<i>of apathy in the country,</i>

28
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,239
<i>the insurrection exploded.</i>

29
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,999
<i>This spontaneous revolt</i>
<i>of "faceless" people</i>

30
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,761
<i>meant saucepans were being banged</i>

31
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:23,559
<i>in every neighborhood,</i>

32
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:26,924
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the city's vital centers.</i>

33
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:31,597
People took to the streets,

34
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,445
without getting any orders.

35
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:36,519
I've been out of work
for six weeks,

36
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,996
and I've slaved away
my whole life.

37
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,084
I don't want a state of siege,

38
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,035
or to be a pawn
of the International Monetary Fund.

39
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,158
It's an outdated economic model.

40
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:50,603
De la Rúa must resign,
and all the swindlers with him.

41
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,518
December 20, 2001

42
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,996
We're dying of hunger!

43
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,757
"In glory we shall die!"

44
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,566
"In glory we shall die!"

45
00:06:56,567 --> 00:07:01,118
"This square belongs to the Mothers,

46
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,525
"not to cowardly others!"

47
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,444
"This square belongs to the Mothers,

48
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,359
"not to cowardly others!"

49
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:35,841
You bastards!

50
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:42,005
We're not in a dictatorship anymore!

51
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,964
Bunch of idiots!

52
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,004
Armed baboons!

53
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,797
Who ordered you out?

54
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,645
Can you kill a woman?

55
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:03,402
Can you kill a whole nation
because you're ordered to?

56
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,400
Repression fails to empty
the Plaza de Mayo

57
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:47,443
Hundreds of citizens
rally to the movement

58
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:50,485
"The people won't clear out!"

59
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,882
<i>And the people don't clear out.</i>

60
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:05,486
<i>They're workers, housewives,</i>

61
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:08,999
<i>employees, pensioners, students,</i>

62
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,685
<i>the heirs of those who,</i>
<i>for decades,</i>

63
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:16,802
<i>defied the dictatorships</i>
<i>and the persecutions,</i>

64
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,323
<i>put up with</i>
<i>the policies of austerity,</i>

65
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:21,000
<i>and were betrayed</i>

66
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,119
<i>by democracy.</i>

67
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,565
<i>What happened in Argentina?</i>

68
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:34,483
<i>How was it possible</i>
<i>that in so rich a country</i>

69
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,726
<i>so many people were hungry?</i>

70
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:46,403
<i>The country had been ransacked</i>
<i>by a new form of aggression,</i>

71
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,204
<i>committed in time of peace</i>
<i>and in a democracy.</i>

72
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:55,078
<i>A daily and silent violence</i>

73
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,797
<i>that caused</i>
<i>greater social disruption,</i>

74
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:06,242
<i>more emigration and death,</i>

75
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,367
<i>than the terrorism</i>
<i>of the dictatorship</i>

76
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,836
<i>and the Falkland Islands war.</i>

77
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:26,121
THE NEVER-ENDING DEBT

78
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,837
<i>Ever since Independence,</i>
<i>almost 200 years ago,</i>

79
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:36,119
<i>Argentina's foreign debt</i>
<i>has been a source</i>

80
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:39,199
<i>of impoverishment and corruption</i>

81
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:42,245
<i>and the biggest scandals.</i>

82
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:49,836
<i>Since the first loan</i>
<i>negotiated by Rivadavia in 1824</i>

83
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:53,120
<i>with the British bank</i>
<i>Baring Brothers,</i>

84
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,599
<i>the debt was used</i>
<i>to enrich Argentinean financiers,</i>

85
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,359
<i>to control the finances</i>

86
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,837
<i>and empty the country</i>
<i>of its wealth.</i>

87
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:11,163
<i>This foreign debt always</i>
<i>went hand in hand with big business,</i>

88
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:15,115
<i>and with the complicity</i>
<i>of nearly every government,</i>

89
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:20,043
<i>from Miter and Quintana,</i>
<i>to Menem and De la Rúa.</i>

90
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:29,923
<i>The policy of indebtedness</i>
<i>gave rise in Argentina</i>

91
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:33,875
<i>to generations</i>
<i>of technocrats and bureaucrats,</i>

92
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:39,155
<i>who favored banks</i>
<i>and international corporations</i>

93
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:41,238
<i>over their own country.</i>

94

<i>Educated at Harvard, Chicago,</i>
<i>Oxford or Buenos Aires,</i>

95
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:52,035
<i>their portraits hang</i>
<i>in the official galleries.</i>

96
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,479
<i>There you can see</i>
<i>19th century lobbyists,</i>

97
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,321
<i>like Manual García and Beláustegui,</i>

98
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:05,162
<i>or the latest heads</i>
<i>of the public banking system,</i>

99
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,479
<i>Pedro Pou,</i>
<i>Macarrone and Colombo,</i>

100

<i>administrators of a debt</i>

101
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:16,005
<i>that was born in the 1970s</i>

102
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,443
<i>under the military dictatorship.</i>

103
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:25,126
<i>We have turned the page</i>

104
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:29,162
<i>of government interventionism...</i>

105
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,200
<i>The present debt</i>

106
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,198
<i>was the illegitimate offspring</i>

107
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,517
<i>of the military dictatorship.</i>

108
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:42,119
<i>Even though the Courts</i>
<i>demonstrated its fraudulent origins,</i>

109
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:46,596
<i>the pressure of the Establishment</i>
<i>won the day.</i>

110
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:50,919
<i>From then on,</i>

111
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:53,562
<i>it dictated national policies</i>

112
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,366
<i>and depleted the public heritage.</i>

113
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,923
<i>All this is perfectly symbolized</i>

114
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:07,479
<i>by the statue of George Canning,</i>
<i>an advocate of colonial policies,</i>

115
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:13,002
<i>that was donated</i>
<i>by the British Government in 1857,</i>

116
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:17,237
<i>in recognition of the debt.</i>

117
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:30,241
American defeat in Vietnam

118
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,881
Conservatives return to power

119
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,681
Crisis and rising oil prices

120
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,962
Petrodollars flood the world

121
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,761
Banks offer credit at 3%

122
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,925
Birth of the Third-world debt

123
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,043
Interest rates reach 16%

124
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,597
Bankruptcy of indebted countries

125
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:24,798
<i>An alliance of foreign banks</i>
<i>and multinationals</i>

126
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,925
<i>comes to power in Argentina.</i>

127
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,479
<i>After 7 years</i>
<i>of neo-liberal policies,</i>

128
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:36,966
<i>the dictatorship leaves a country</i>
<i>bled dry, with a foreign debt</i>

129

<i>of 45 billion dollars,</i>

130

<i>23 billion</i>

132

<i>Cogasco, Celulosa and others.</i>

144
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:37,521
<i>An excessive private debt</i>

<i>Domingo Cavallo.</i>

147

The police protects the thieves,
Mr. Solanas.

154

The world's turned upside-down.

155
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:28,041
Now people must
demonstrate peacefully

156
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:31,916
to defend their savings,
that were confiscated by the banks

with government complicity.

158
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:37,725
The State
should guarantee citizens' rights,

159
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,605
not steal them.

160
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,643
Thieves!

161
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,360
A dollar at a time,

162
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:57,440
I saved during
the 25 years I worked,

163
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:01,077
so I could live decently
when I retired,

164
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:02,839
not on a State pension.

165
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,163
Why don't the banks
treat us

166
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,841
like their foreign customers?

167
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:11,955
I chose private banks,
I didn't trust ours.

168
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:14,960
I already got swindled in 1989.

169
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:17,118
But I must be stupid.

170
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:21,076
What do they want? A bomb?
That's not my style,

171
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,602
that's why
I'm banging on my pan.

172
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,837
I used to cook with it
for my kids.

173
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:31,002
Every time I look at it,
I'll be reminded of those scoundrels,

174
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,839
but I'll know I fought
for my rights.

175
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:36,279
I'm the oldest newsvendor
in Avellaneda.

176
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:39,007
For 65 years I've sold newspapers.

177
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,727
All my savings
are in Citibank.

178
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,277
The manager of the agency
says they'll return them to me,

179
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,199
it's a lie!

180
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:51,879
Everything I saved by making
sacrifices is in their hands.

181
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:55,205
In fact, the foreign banks

182
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,279
owe money to the Argentineans.

183
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,365
In a way,
it's a reversed debt.

184
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:05,361
The parent companies must be
responsible for the deposits.

185
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:09,846
That was decided by law
in Argentina in 1971,

186
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:12,123
in the well-known Swift Deltec case,

187
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:16,838
which established that
parent companies were responsible

188
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,801
for the debts of their subsidiaries.

189
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,926
It's a swindle
to make the government responsible

190
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:26,282
for the debts of the banks.

191
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,478
What about our foreign debt?

192
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:31,445
In many ways,
that debt is illegitimate.

193
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,802
In a fundamental way:

194
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,164
It's illegitimate
to repay the banks

195
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,636
with 18 million people
poverty-stricken

196
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,763
and 9 million paupers.

197
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:43,804
There's a human priority.

198
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:48,726
Then the banks
charged usurious interest rates.

199
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:55,156
If they'd charged
normal interest rates,

200
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:59,400
the foreign debt
would have been paid off by 1988.

201
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:01,000
What was this swindle?

202
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:04,284
The parent companies
made loans to their subsidiaries,

203
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,961
so these were internal movements.

204
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:10,757
These loans
were assigned to the foreign debt,

205
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,885
when in fact
they were internal to the companies.

206
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:19,201
Dollars were bought here, and placed
in accounts in the United States.

207
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,803
With this deposit as collateral,
you got a loan

208
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,959
to purchase more dollars
and so on,

209
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:28,687
because of the difference
in interest rates.

210
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:32,317
It's what's known
as "bicycling" funds,

211
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:33,920
and many got rich on it.

212
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:37,762
The main beneficiaries
were the big conglomerates,

213
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,883
as usual.

214
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:43,926
<i>At the end</i>
<i>of Alfonsín's presidency,</i>

215
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:48,797
<i>the foreign debt</i>
<i>was close to 54 billion dollars.</i>

216
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:54,999
<i>Menem let the creditors</i>
<i>determine what they were owed.</i>

217
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,556
<i>The Congress</i>
<i>never debated on the debt,</i>

218
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,718
<i>neglecting the Constitution</i>

219
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,606
<i>and a decision by the law courts.</i>

220
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,359
<i>Ten years later,</i>

221
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:08,042
<i>the debt reached</i>
<i>130 billion dollars.</i>

222
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:12,486
<i>People have a false idea</i>
<i>of the debt.</i>

223
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:13,915
<i>You get into debt,</i>

224
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,123
<i>then you say it's bad.</i>

225
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,276
<i>But indebtedness</i>
<i>is what enables credit.</i>

226
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,762
<i>Indebtedness is beneficial.</i>

227
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:25,602
<i>We are going to develop credit</i>
<i>for everyone...</i>

228
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,837
<i>Owing money is fine.</i>

229
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,481
A good example

230
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:37,403
is what the North Americans
invented around 1898,

231
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,001
at the time they occupied Cuba.

232
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,964
Some Spanish banks

233
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:45,437
had granted loans
to the colonial government of Cuba.

234
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,245
The North Americans said:

235
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:53,676
If the Cuban people
didn't benefit from these loans,

236
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,519
there's no public debt.

237
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,718
In 1923,

238
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:01,200
a British bank,

239
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,483
the Royal Bank of Canada,

240
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:07,681
lent a petty tyrant of Costa Rica,

241
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,485
called Tinoco,

242
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:13,686
a sum that he used
for personal goals.

243
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:17,920
The Royal Bank of Canada
asked Costa Rica for repayment.

244
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:20,203
There was a lawsuit,

245
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:24,360
of which the arbitrator was
an ex-president of the United States,

246
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:26,483
President William Taft.

247
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:29,957
President Taft
ruled in the litigation, saying:

248
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,442
It's about a private debt,

249
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,962
not a public debt.

250
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,120
You can't have
a public debt without a "public",

251
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:42,916
with the public
as the beneficiary of the debt.

252
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:47,441
These operations
never benefited the public,

253
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,245
quite the contrary.

254
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:54,322
It's the person
who shops in a supermarket

255
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:57,047
and pays VAT

256
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,596
who ends up paying

257
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:03,965
for the private debts
of big enterprises,

258
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:05,765
or of very rich people.

259
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,279
The problem of private debts,

260
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:14,286
that were illicitly nationalized

261
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,800
by Mr. Cavallo,

262
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,765
must absolutely be reexamined.

263
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:21,201
What is this theory?

264
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:24,040
It's the theory
of the Odious Debt.

265
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:28,765
A director of the IMF,
Karen Lissakers,

266
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,487
representing the United States,
said:

267
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:35,799
"If we applied
the theory of the Odious Debt,

268
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:39,562
"the Third World's debt
would no longer exist."

269
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:46,715
A CHRONICLE OF TREASON

270
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,046
<i>Democracy was re-established</i>

271
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:55,199
<i>with the Radical Raúl Alfonsín</i>

272
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,485
<i>and his social-democrat approach.</i>

273
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:01,962
<i>He promised</i>
<i>to defend human rights,</i>

274
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:04,561
<i>to fight poverty</i>

275
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:09,926
<i>and to show that in a democracy</i>
<i>"you get education, care, and food".</i>

276
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:17,523
<i>We have the huge responsibility</i>

277
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,201
<i>of guaranteeing democracy</i>

278
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:25,883
<i>and respect for human dignity</i>
<i>in Argentina.</i>

279
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,122
<i>As we've said,</i>

280
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:32,841
<i>this means that the State</i>

281
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:36,801
<i>cannot bow</i>
<i>to international financial groups,</i>

282
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:41,919
<i>or to privileged local groups...</i>

283
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,839
<i>But the State was bankrupt,</i>

284
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:45,839
<i>and had to make a choice.</i>

285
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,365
<i>Economy minister Grinspun,</i>
<i>suggested repudiating the debt</i>

286
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:54,246
<i>and favoring growth.</i>

287
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:58,645
<i>Alfonsín won't go along,</i>
<i>and yields to financial power.</i>

288
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:02,476
<i>The only solution</i>
<i>is a policy of austerity,</i>

289
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,598
<i>that will be very hard</i>

290
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:07,361
<i>and require great efforts</i>
<i>by everyone.</i>

291
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:11,436
<i>It's called,</i>
<i>my dear compatriots,</i>

292
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:14,202
<i>an economy of war.</i>

293
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:17,996
<i>We must all learn from it.</i>

294
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:25,202
<i>This drastic measure</i>
<i>is called "Plan Austral".</i>

295
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:26,801
<i>Once more,</i>

296
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,162
<i>huge public funds</i>

297
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:32,285
<i>are transferred to the banks</i>
<i>and big corporations.</i>

298
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:36,125
<i>Alfonsín says two things at once:</i>

299
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:38,199
<i>He promises to repudiate the debt</i>

300
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:43,117
<i>but orders the president</i>
<i>of the Central Bank to legitimize it.</i>

301
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:48,395
<i>He favors prosecuting Army officers</i>

302
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,797
<i>for their crimes</i>
<i>during the dictatorship,</i>

303
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,283
<i>but two years later,</i>

304
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:57,242
<i>the "Due Obedience" laws</i>
<i>exonerate crimes committed</i>

305
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,005
<i>on orders of a superior.</i>

306
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,236
<i>Laws that resulted</i>
<i>from the insurrection</i>

307
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:07,444
<i>of the rebel</i>
<i>"painted face" officers.</i>

308
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:11,042
<i>People took to the streets</i>

309
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:13,243
<i>and defied the tanks...</i>

310
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,765
<i>We've had enough of jackboots!</i>

311
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:23,358
<i>Alfonsín amnesties the rebels.</i>

312
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:25,438
<i>Dear compatriots,</i>

313
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,718
<i>Happy Easter!</i>

314
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:34,080
<i>The insurgents...</i>

315
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:38,285
<i>have put down their weapons.</i>

316
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,364
<i>Among them,</i>

317
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:46,243
<i>were heroes of the Falklands war,</i>

318
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,555
<i>who had strayed...</i>

319
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:55,322
<i>The electoral defeat</i>
<i>of the Radical party</i>

320
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,843
<i>accelerates the crisis.</i>

321
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:02,042
<i>Stockmarket instability</i>
<i>and hyperinflation</i>

322
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:05,119
<i>lead to runs on the supermarkets.</i>

323
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,237
<i>I've decided to resign</i>

324
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:11,719
<i>from the job</i>
<i>of President of Argentina...</i>

325
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,558
<i>Alfonsín has to resign</i>

326
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:20,117
<i>6 months before the end</i>
<i>of his mandate.</i>

327
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:36,242
<i>The neo-Peronist Carlos Menem</i>

328
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,718
<i>becomes President</i>

329
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:41,401
<i>after having,</i>
<i>for many years, governed</i>

330
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,842
<i>the province of La Rioja,</i>

331
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,242
<i>one of the poorest in the nation.</i>

332
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:51,165
<i>His lightning rise</i>

333
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:54,604
<i>coincided</i>
<i>with the fall of the Berlin wall</i>

334
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:57,520
<i>and the ideas</i>
<i>of the "Consensus of Washington".</i>

335
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:03,283
<i>With his frankness</i>
<i>and his preacher's gestures,</i>

336
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:07,276
<i>he promises a Productivist Revolution</i>
<i>and big wages.</i>

337
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:15,198
<i>He has long sideburns</i>
<i>like the old rebel Facundo Quiroga,</i>

338
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:17,836
<i>the "Tiger of the Plains".</i>

339
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:25,641
<i>For every Argentinean, standing,</i>

340
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,641
<i>for poor children who are hungry,</i>

341
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:31,480
<i>or who are sad,</i>

342
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:33,956
<i>for our brothers without work,</i>

343
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:36,402
<i>for the homes without a roof,</i>

344
00:27:36,647 --> 00:27:38,877
<i>for the tables without bread,</i>

345
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:40,765
<i>for our homeland,</i>

346
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,805
<i>I ask you to follow me,</i>

347
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:45,440
<i>follow me,</i>

348
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,677
<i>I won't betray you,</i>

349
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:49,963
<i>I won't betray you...</i>

350
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,437
<i>As God is my witness,</i>

351
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,357
<i>and facing</i>
<i>the judgment of History,</i>

352
00:27:57,887 --> 00:27:59,957
<i>let me proclaim:</i>

353
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:04,326
<i>Argentina, get up and walk!</i>

354
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,644
<i>Sisters and brothers,</i>

355
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:10,517
<i>in a single voice</i>
<i>I say to the world:</i>

356
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:13,607
<i>"This is the advent</i>

357
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,362
<i>of a new and glorious Nation."</i>

358
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:25,000
<i>This is the era of the theory</i>
<i>of the "End of History",</i>

359
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:29,756
<i>of the single-mindedness</i>
<i>of globalization</i>

360
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:34,359
<i>and of neo-liberal democracies</i>
<i>in Latin America.</i>

361
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:39,082
Long live Carlos Saúl Menem!

362
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:44,440
<i>A few days later,</i>

363
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:48,441
<i>he abandons his sideburns</i>
<i>and his promised reforms,</i>

364
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:51,075
<i>and betrays his voters:</i>

365
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:56,557
<i>His program becomes that</i>
<i>of the liberal conservative minority,</i>

366
00:28:57,287 --> 00:29:00,836
<i>directed by the former rebel officer</i>
<i>Alvaro Alsogaray.</i>

367
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:04,483
<i>Everything has changed now,</i>
<i>there's a new relationship</i>

368
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:07,362
<i>between conservatives</i>
<i>and Peronists.</i>

369
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:10,316
<i>We appear to be the same,</i>

370
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,717
<i>but a fundamental change</i>

371
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:14,918
<i>amongst us has occurred.</i>

372
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,647
<i>Historically, it's only fair,</i>

373
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:21,083
<i>that a neo-Peronist president</i>
<i>should bring this about...</i>

374
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,917
<i>No one before Menem</i>

375
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:29,238
<i>had dared to carry treason so far,</i>

376
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,996
<i>or undertaken so cynically</i>

377
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:35,127
<i>actions that harmed the Nation.</i>

378
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,319
<i>The two-faced game</i>
<i>of the new leader</i>

379
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:43,479
<i>will pulverize 50 years</i>
<i>of popular resistance:</i>

380
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:48,246
<i>He imposes allegiance</i>
<i>to the global model,</i>

381
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:50,682
<i>amnesties the leaders of the junta,</i>

382
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:53,122
<i>and betrays millions of workers</i>

383
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,682
<i>who lived through the repression.</i>

384
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:00,475
<i>He abandons</i>
<i>popular anti-imperialism</i>

385
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:04,162
<i>and non-alignment</i>
<i>extolled by Perôn and Evita</i>

386
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:08,161
<i>and initiates a "physical relationship"</i>
<i>with the United States.</i>

387
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:14,198
<i>His policies will be dictated</i>
<i>by the World Bank and the IMF.</i>

388
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:24,803
<i>But Menem</i>
<i>is not the only one who betrayed.</i>

389
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,360
<i>Many of the political</i>
<i>and union leaders</i>

390
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,876
<i>dumped overboard</i>
<i>a whole life of resistance.</i>

391
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,880
<i>Many of them</i>
<i>accepted arrangements</i>

392
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,038
<i>and opted for indemnifications.</i>

393
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,479
<i>Others climbed</i>

394
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:46,364
<i>onto the bandwagon</i>
<i>of privatizations.</i>

395
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,560
Senator Cafiero,

396
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:07,878
you are a historic leader
of the Peronist party.

397
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:10,197
How do you explain
Menem's treason?

398
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:14,117
It happens frequently

399
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:18,200
in the political life
of every nation.

400
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:22,838
There's a small French book,
"In Praise of Treason",

401
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:25,726
where they prove

402
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:28,999
that treason
is part and parcel of politics.

403
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:32,000
To succeed, you have to lie.

404
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:36,240
If you say what you think,
no one will vote for you.

405
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:39,046
That's what happened
in Argentina,

406
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:42,324
but much more intensely,
let's face it,

407
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:44,318
when Menem was in power.

408
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:48,719
He even admitted
he hid his goals to get elected.

409
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:52,085
Of course, in my opinion,

410
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,366
it's politically unethical,

411
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,404
but that's the reality.

412
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:01,480
Then, some international
parameters changed...

413
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,606
And the model gradually
exhausted itself.

414
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:08,398
How do you explain

415
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,042
the existence
of a real "mafiocracy"?

416
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:15,795
Economic power,
banks and the political class...

417
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,685
On that, Pino,

418
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:22,077
I won't pass judgment...

419
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:26,917
how can I put it...
in an absolute way.

420
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,961
My long experience

421
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:32,721
has taught me
that things are relative.

422
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,525
It's not all black or white,

423
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,757
things aren't corrupt or pure.

424
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:40,078
Argentinean society as a whole

425
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:42,044
can't call itself pure

426
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,244
and assign corruption
to the ruling classes.

427
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:49,161
The ruling classes
come from that society.

428
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,927
On one hand,
we politicians have been a failure,

429
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,317
and I'll assume
my part of responsibility.

430
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,598
But on the other hand...

431
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:01,717
many of the ruling circles
let us down,

432
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:04,879
and to reach a verdict on everyone,

433
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:07,686
I'd say we're all in Dante's hell.

434
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:11,883
Undoubtedly,

435
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:15,042
treason is very effective.

436
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:23,242
Treason
has phenomenal political power,

437
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:26,076
precisely because it's treason.

438
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,403
It's insidious,

439
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:33,082
it sneaks up behind you,
without warning,

440
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:35,477
where you least expect it.

441
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,115
Otherwise it wouldn't be treason.

442
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:42,285
In this sense,
the neo-Peronist party

443
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:49,165
was the most brilliant
representative

444
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,318
of Cafiero's point of view.

445
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:56,160
If you ask Argentinean society
to choose

446
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,160
between San Martín
- our national hero - and Spiderman,

447
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:01,318
it'll vote for San Martín.

448
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:04,479
But between
Spiderman and Superman,

449
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:08,959
how can you fault society
for the consequences of that choice?

450
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,766
So we have...

451
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,722
a society with a weakened role,

452
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:18,763
a party that betrays its historic ideas
and surrenders to the enemy,

453
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:23,762
a working-class movement
eroded by de-industrialization,

454
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:25,758
infested with traitors...

455
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:31,361
Law courts
that pay lip-service to all that,

456
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:35,236
Opposition parties
without much room to maneuver...

457
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,045
and the result of it all is...

458
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:41,805
THE REPUBLIC DETERIORATES

459
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:56,277
<i>Menem's neo-liberal model</i>

460
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:01,562
<i>is inseparable from the deterioration</i>
<i>of the republic and corruption.</i>

461
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,959
<i>His political plan</i>
<i>needs a biased Supreme Court</i>

462
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:10,766
<i>and federal law courts</i>
<i>under his control,</i>

463
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:15,603
<i>and for special powers</i>
<i>to be delegated by Parliament.</i>

464
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:22,680
<i>In one month,</i>
<i>he got his Law of Laws passed,</i>

465
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,724
<i>the Reform of the State,</i>

466
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:28,118
<i>that opened up for him</i>
<i>the door to privatizations.</i>

467
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:31,399
<i>Today the Senate is debating</i>

468
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:34,725
<i>a fundamental law for the country.</i>

469
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:37,357
<i>For the first time,</i>

470
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,365
<i>we are going to attack head on</i>

471
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,961
<i>the structural weaknesses</i>

472
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:46,957
<i>of the State as a whole,</i>

473
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:51,438
<i>notably of its public corporations.</i>

474
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,438
<i>We must be grateful</i>

475
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:56,042
<i>to the President of the Republic,</i>

476
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,721
<i>because this law is the beginning</i>

477
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:01,355
<i>of the Productivist Revolution.</i>

478
00:36:06,927 --> 00:36:11,557
Democracy was ridiculed
by Parliament

479
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:13,683
during the Menem era.

480
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:17,357
He gave Ministries
extraordinary powers,

481
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:21,156
absolute powers,
total public power.

482
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:24,006
He gave Ministries the power

483
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,886
to privatize State enterprises,

484
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:29,117
without inventories, balance sheets,

485
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,642
without verifying beforehand

486
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:36,164
if these enterprises
generated profits or losses.

487
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,444
Meaning that this vote

488
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:43,441
was the starting point
of the plunder of State property.

489
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:44,762
Who voted for it?

490
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:47,077
The neo-Peronists,

491
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,283
the Radicals, very obligingly...

492
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:53,123
I remember very well
the Radical Jaroslavsky

493
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:55,755
ordering many of his congressmen

494
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:57,883
to withdraw from the House

495
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:01,676
so that the neo-Peronists
could pass these laws.

496
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:04,556
Rarely does everything enable

497
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:07,321
a minority to come to power

498
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,076
without throwing a bomb,

499
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:13,317
or firing a shot.

500
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:17,442
Yet that's
what the conservative Alsogaray got

501
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,598
for the Reform of the State.

502
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:23,646
This reform gave Menem,

503
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:25,604
absolute, dictatorial powers,

504
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,725
that even the dictator Videla
never had.

505
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:32,084
- Alsogaray said it openly.
- What did he say?

506
00:37:32,247 --> 00:37:33,885
He told the neo-Peronists

507
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:37,278
that they were taking part
in an extraordinary moment,

508
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:39,764
that they'd have total power.

509
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,999
But now,
this ostensibly democratic power

510
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,158
was going to be held

511
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:48,797
by those who once censored,
executed and slaughtered.

512
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,641
That's what Alsogaray brought about.

513
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:56,802
How far would they go?
What were they capable of?

514
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,320
Of a lot more.

515
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:00,364
And they kept it up.

516
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:03,517
There were denunciations

517
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:07,965
over the privatization
of the national oil company YPF.

518
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:11,358
A congressman denounced
the remittance to senators

519
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,961
of a bribe of 8 million dollars,

520
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,640
then denied it hours later.

521
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,524
<i>Of 130 congressmen present,</i>

522
00:38:19,687 --> 00:38:22,520
<i>114 voted "Yes",</i>

523
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,078
<i>10 voted "No",</i>
<i>with 1 abstention.</i>

524
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,681
<i>We should be delighted</i>

525
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:32,237
<i>that the House</i>
<i>was able to perform its duties.</i>

526
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:36,036
<i>For Argentina,</i>
<i>this is a day of jubilation.</i>

527
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:37,242
<i>From now on,</i>

528
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:39,597
<i>the oil belongs to the provinces,</i>

529
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:43,442
<i>YPF will be quoted</i>
<i>on the stockmarket</i>

530
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,438
<i>and benefit</i>
<i>from private investment.</i>

531
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:47,563
<i>Thanks to this, old-age pensioners,</i>

532
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:51,117
<i>will benefit</i>
<i>from billions of dollars...</i>

533
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:53,204
<i>These fine words</i>

534
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:56,883
<i>hid one of the most odious acts</i>

535
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,481
<i>that Parliament committed.</i>

536
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,879
<i>With the help of bribed congressmen,</i>

537
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:07,082
<i>it voted the privatization</i>
<i>of YPF and Gas del Estado,</i>

538
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:11,877
<i>the two biggest</i>
<i>Argentinean companies.</i>

539
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,757
<i>The country lost enterprises</i>

540
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:19,243
<i>that financed its infrastructures,</i>

541
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:22,240
<i>and of course</i>
<i>old-age pensioners and workers</i>

542
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,557
<i>got swindled.</i>

543
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:31,365
<i>The opposition couldn't prevent it,</i>

544
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>though dissident Peronists</i>
<i>formed</i>

545
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:36,846
<i>the "Group of Eight".</i>

546
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,480
<i>Reforming the State</i>

547
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:40,000
<i>doesn't mean privatizing it.</i>

548
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,123
<i>In an emergent country,</i>

549
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:45,245
<i>you don't begin with layoffs.</i>

550
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:49,196
<i>Other opponents</i>
<i>of the oil company plunder</i>

551
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,962
<i>were threatened or attacked.</i>

552
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:54,642
<i>In May 1991,</i>

553
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:59,726
<i>for having filed charges</i>
<i>against Menem</i>

554
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,957
<i>for dismantling the YPF,</i>

555
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:06,326
<i>I got 6 bullets in my legs.</i>

556
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:11,476
<i>The privatization of YPF</i>
<i>is madness.</i>

557
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:13,319
<i>It's an outrageous theft.</i>

558
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:17,283
Of course there was corruption!
It's a fact.

559
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,722
It goes hand in hand
with privatization.

560
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:22,560
Just look at the heritage
of those who voted for it.

561
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:26,083
I mean the leaders.
Look at them...

562
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:31,039
There's no evidence...

563
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:35,118
Nobody saw suitcases
full of dollars.

564
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,686
Yet it was never denied.

565
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:42,045
There were so many lobbies,

566
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:46,001
so much money to be made,
again and again,

567
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:48,806
so many deals made on the quiet...

568
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,835
while the media praised

569
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:55,477
the advantages of privatization.

570
00:40:55,647 --> 00:40:58,241
Like the TV journalist Neustadt.

571
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:02,842
He had high ratings.

572
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:04,805
Not only the politicians,

573
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:08,960
we reporters and the media,
also played a role.

574
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:11,800
How long must we put up
with this idiocy?

575
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:15,482
TV and radio
in the hands of idiots,

576
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,605
for a nation of idiots?
How long?

577
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:24,239
<i>The Congress</i>
<i>of this mafioso decade,</i>

578
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:28,601
<i>that voted such disgraceful laws</i>
<i>against the Nation,</i>

579
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,762
<i>needed the police to protect it.</i>

580
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:37,842
<i>The people were so outraged</i>

581
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:41,842
<i>that each week</i>
<i>brought its share of protests.</i>

582
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:48,441
<i>Pensioners, teachers,</i>
<i>civil servants,</i>

583
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:51,483
<i>students, workers,</i>

584
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:53,803
<i>and the unemployed</i>
<i>from every profession.</i>

585
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:01,481
<i>It was the beginning of a dark era:</i>

586
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:05,236
<i>The national budget</i>
<i>had to be approved in Washington</i>

587
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:07,477
<i>before it was by our Congress.</i>

588
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:10,798
<i>The government</i>
<i>asked for people's understanding,</i>

589
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:14,164
<i>because the country</i>
<i>was on its knees...</i>

590
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:35,360
<i>"We were called the hand-raisers</i>

591
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:40,238
<i>"We were devoted, committed</i>

592
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:44,645
<i>"We voted with our eyes closed</i>

593
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:49,881
<i>"As the party asked us to</i>

594
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:53,836
<i>"We were called the hand-raisers</i>

595
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:58,599
<i>"We legislated without remembering,</i>

596
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:03,323
<i>"And our voters, we betrayed</i>

597
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:08,515
<i>"And we didn't hear their boos..."</i>

598
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:19,041
THE ECONOMIC MODEL

599
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:25,962
<i>The instrument</i>
<i>used to apply the neo-liberal model</i>

600
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:29,166
<i>was the Convertibility Plan</i>

601
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:34,525
<i>that liberalized imports</i>
<i>and was based on a lie:</i>

602
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:37,596
<i>One peso equaled one dollar.</i>

603
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,923
<i>It managed to stop inflation,</i>

604
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:45,079
<i>but left our nation's industries</i>
<i>defenseless.</i>

605
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:49,883
<i>Until then, the country</i>
<i>produced 95% of what it consumed</i>

606
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,402
<i>and exported machine-tools,</i>

607
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:54,797
<i>trains,</i>
<i>and household electrical goods.</i>

608
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,003
<i>Henceforth, it imported fabrics,</i>

609
00:43:58,207 --> 00:44:01,802
<i>meat, dairy products,</i>
<i>fruit and pasta...</i>

610
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:18,197
<i>The country was "dollarized":</i>

611
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:22,203
<i>You could pay for anything</i>
<i>in pesos or dollars.</i>

612
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:26,283
<i>But with zero inflation rate,</i>

613
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:28,682
<i>credit outfits and banks</i>

614
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:33,523
<i>lent at usurious rates</i>
<i>of 50% per year,</i>

615
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:37,686
<i>when in the U.S. And Europe,</i>
<i>the rates were 7%.</i>

616
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,639
<i>The euphoria</i>
<i>of peso/dollar parity</i>

617
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:46,479
<i>made tradesmen and small businesses</i>
<i>unable to compete</i>

618
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:48,842
<i>and bankrupts them.</i>

619
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:54,876
<i>Hundreds of factories</i>
<i>and workshops disappeared:</i>

620
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:58,164
<i>In textiles, metallurgy,</i>
<i>automobile spare parts,</i>

621
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:01,364
<i>consumer goods</i>
<i>and many other areas.</i>

622
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:15,604
<i>These were the years of flaunting</i>

623
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:18,759
<i>illegally acquired wealth.</i>

624
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:21,641
<i>Let's try not to steal for 2 years.</i>

625
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,081
<i>Bribes and swindles are permitted.</i>

626
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:28,247
<i>If you put your hand in the till,</i>

627
00:45:29,007 --> 00:45:29,837
<i>do it discreetly!</i>

628
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:32,322
<i>Life is privatized and walled in.</i>

<i>... and of pizza with champagne.</i>

634
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:51,276
The media
as the driving force of change

635
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:54,437
<i>Meddling with the YPF,</i>
<i>with oil,</i>

636
00:45:54,607 --> 00:45:56,165
<i>was sacrilege.</i>

637
00:45:56,327 --> 00:45:59,558
<i>It was like offending</i>
<i>the tango or the flag.</i>

638
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,361
The State meant corruption
and bureaucracy.

639
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:06,162
<i>Oil underground</i>
<i>is no good to anyone.</i>

640
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:08,642
Private ownership
is modern and efficient

641
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:10,966
<i>Everyone has the right</i>

642

<i>Your lover-boy image</i>

644
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:21,718
<i>The opposite: It helps me.</i>

645
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:26,406
Politics become a spectacle

646
00:46:26,647 --> 00:46:29,081
<i>My love, it's really hot here...</i>

647
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,438
<i>He's so cute!</i>
<i>Politicians are handsome now.</i>

648
00:46:39,527 --> 00:46:41,882
<i>I'm thrilled</i>
<i>by this economic model.</i>

649
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:43,036
<i>It's a lie,</i>

650
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:45,041
<i>a total lie,</i>

651
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:46,959
<i>that it creates poverty.</i>

652
00:46:50,927 --> 00:46:53,361
We've lived here a long time:

653
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:56,644
The politicians
always make promises.

654
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,441
But our local representatives,

655
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:02,440
never did anything for us.

656
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:04,485
So we, who live here,

657
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:07,599
decided to block the road,

658
00:47:08,127 --> 00:47:12,598
so that they'd understand
what our daily life is like.

659
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:15,725
Kids can't get to school.

660
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:18,881
Patients can't be moved,

661
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,237
as ambulances can't get through.

662
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:24,444
We want to live decently,
we deserve it.

663
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:26,837
We're poor, humble,

664
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:28,804
but we're not fooled

665
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:31,481
when they offer us a meal, clothing,

666
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:33,638
booties for babies...

667
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,484
We wanted them to build drainage.

668
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:42,115
There was money,
everything that was needed.

669
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:45,438
But they kept the money.

670
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:49,563
When it comes to stealing,

671
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:52,685
they are the masters.

672
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:55,156
They teach people how to steal.

673
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:01,636
We're no longer just teachers,

674
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:05,279
now we're also social workers.

675
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:07,604
Moms come and ask

676
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:10,440
if we don't have extra sneakers...

677
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:12,598
We take care
of the whole community.

678
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:16,043
When there's flooding,
we become the emergency shelter.

679
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:18,442
We put up the students,

680
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:20,757
when the roof of their house
blows away,

681
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:22,804
when they have nowhere to sleep.

682
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,640
The kids are worried
for their families,

683
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:27,923
and want to take home

684
00:48:28,087 --> 00:48:31,363
any remaining sandwiches.

685
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:34,121
We can't make them concentrate,

686
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,118
their minds are on other things.

687
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:39,639
Sometimes, they faint.

688
00:48:39,807 --> 00:48:41,399
Then we ask them:

689
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:45,037
"What did you eat yesterday?
And this morning?"

690
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:47,846
They answer: "Soup, tea..."

691
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,355
They faint very often.

692
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,757
We've got used to it.

693
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:58,764
But it's shameful.

694
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:06,963
<i>The Convertibility Plan</i>

<i>Menem doesn't know it yet,</i>

<i>"Nothing belonging to the State</i>
<i>will remain in its hands."</i>

<i>or how much it cost,</i>

<i>or how and why it was sold.</i>

<i>these privatizations</i>

Non-execution of works

for the non-execution of works.

737
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:50,122
Rates were raised

to make the users
pay for the investments.

739

No new capital was needed.

740

The more you risk,
the more you earn.

741

Outstanding profitability

<i>Just to suppress 80000 jobs!</i>

785
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,124
Billions in subsidies

786
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,358
Privatizations were supposed

787
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:55,245
to end the payment of subsidies

788
00:54:55,447 --> 00:54:58,803
that supposedly led
to the public deficit.

789
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:03,959
The irony today, is that
most of the privatized companies,

790
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,119
are subsidized.

791
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:10,077
Just for
the national highway system,

792
00:55:10,247 --> 00:55:12,681
the subsidy was
1,1 billion dollars.

793
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:16,119
And as the 980 million
for acquiring them weren't paid,

794
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:18,357
they stole a total
of 2 billion dollars!

795
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:20,798
They never paid the fee

796
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,645
You have to pay a fee

797
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:26,482
to use public property
belonging to a country.

798
00:55:26,647 --> 00:55:27,841
They never paid it.

799
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:29,400
- Who didn't pay?
- No one.

800
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:31,922
Not for the roads,
the postal system, the airports...

801
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:34,324
Impunity

802
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:37,764
Legal protection always favored

803
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:39,804
the conglomerates.

804
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:43,124
No one negotiated for the consumers.

805
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:48,278
Why such impunity?

806
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:50,719
Politics.

807
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,082
Big business
and political scheming.

808
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:56,602
The big conglomerates

809
00:55:58,247 --> 00:56:02,843
<i>Privatizations were planned in</i>
<i>the interest in the big conglomerates.</i>

810
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:08,485
<i>They were the ones who financed</i>
<i>all the election campaigns,</i>

811
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:10,365
<i>all the governments,</i>

812
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:12,518
<i>all the coups d'état,</i>

813
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:16,316
<i>all the major public-works</i>
<i>undertakings.</i>

814
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:23,916
<i>No other sector</i>
<i>benefited from such privileges:</i>

815
00:56:24,207 --> 00:56:27,165
<i>Protected markets,</i>
<i>astronomical subsidies,</i>

816
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:31,117
<i>fiscal advantages,</i>
<i>rate-overcharging,</i>

817
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,359
<i>exoneration of penalties</i>
<i>for non-performance of work,</i>

818
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:36,199
<i>extensions of concessions,</i>

819
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:39,643
<i>and conversion into pesos</i>
<i>of debts in dollars.</i>

820
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:45,724
<i>They failed to honor</i>
<i>their contracts with the State,</i>

821
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:49,323
<i>swindled it</i>
<i>and then sued it for damages.</i>

822
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,035
<i>Among these were:</i>

823
00:56:52,807 --> 00:56:55,116
<i>Macri's Socma and Sideco,</i>

824
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:57,557
<i>Bulgheroni's Bridas,</i>

825
00:56:57,767 --> 00:57:00,235
<i>Fortabat's Loma Negra,</i>

826
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:02,722
<i>Pérez Companc's Pecom,</i>

827
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:04,804
<i>Rocca's Techint,</i>

828
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:08,801
<i>Benito Roggio, Pescarmona,</i>
<i>and others.</i>

829
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:20,635
<i>Unemployment</i>
<i>is spreading like a plague,</i>

830
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:23,446
<i>contaminating the whole society.</i>

831
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:28,123
<i>The lines of dole seekers</i>
<i>get longer everywhere.</i>

832
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:32,726
<i>Unemployment has gone from 11%</i>
<i>to more than 20%,</i>

833
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:35,276
<i>not counting the temps.</i>

834
00:57:35,527 --> 00:57:37,995
What's the situation
of the workers?

835
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:40,078
They've lost their salaries,

836
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:42,158
their social benefits,

837
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:44,841
their unemployment insurance,

838
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:48,602
their accident
and sickness coverage.

839
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:52,680
More than half of them
are moonlighting,

840
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:55,202
a social situation

841
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:58,086
that only prevails in the most
under-developed countries.

842
00:57:58,247 --> 00:58:02,126
People don't dare resist,
they fear layoffs,

843
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:04,319
and that the next day

844
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:07,559
there may be no solution at all.

845
00:58:07,727 --> 00:58:10,400
So they agree to salary cuts,

846
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,797
deteriorating work conditions,

847
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:15,845
working in unsanitary surroundings.

848
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:18,880
Losing your job
means ending in a void,

849
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:21,925
joining an army of beggars,

850
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:24,687
the army of the excluded.

851
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:29,520
It leads to depression,
to anxiety...

852
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,246
<i>In the Latin-American country</i>

853
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:35,956
<i>where social rights</i>
<i>were once most advanced,</i>

854
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:38,118
<i>thousands of destitute people</i>

855
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:41,285
<i>flock to the church</i>
<i>of San Cayetano,</i>

856
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:43,403
<i>patron saint of work,</i>

857
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,478
<i>asking for help.</i>

858
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:51,444
THE LIQUIDATION OF OIL

859
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:55,642
Argentina is a unique case

860
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:57,320
in the world and in Latin America.

861
00:58:57,687 --> 00:59:00,759
No other country gave up

862
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:04,158
its gas and oil
without losing a war.

863
00:59:04,687 --> 00:59:08,077
The country was truly betrayed

864
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,804
by the ruling class.

865
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:13,925
Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela

866
00:59:14,087 --> 00:59:16,521
never privatized their oil.

867
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:20,566
Why was the sale of YPF
such an atrocity?

868
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:25,039
Because of the role that YPF played

869
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:26,686
in the country,

870
00:59:26,887 --> 00:59:29,685
and in the world oil-market.

871
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:32,082
You have to remember
that when Mosconi

872
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:35,842
created YPF, the first
State enterprise in the world,

873
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:39,636
oil was considered
to be very strategic,

874
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:43,846
and the sale of fuel
to be of national interest.

875
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:46,123
If the international price rose,

876
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:49,324
YPF kept the price low,

877
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:52,684
according to its costs
and not the market price.

878
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:57,518
<i>YPF was created in 1923</i>

879
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:00,360
<i>on orders of General Mosconi.</i>

880
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:06,005
<i>In 1907, oil had been discovered</i>
<i>in Patagonia.</i>

881
01:00:08,487 --> 01:00:10,045
<i>In spite of its detractors,</i>

882
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,446
<i>the oil company was developed</i>

883
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:16,121
<i>without the need for foreign funds,</i>

884
01:00:16,287 --> 01:00:19,040
<i>and became a model</i>
<i>for Latin America.</i>

885
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:24,365
<i>It expanded so rapidly</i>

886
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:28,042
<i>that it earned as much for the country</i>
<i>as the province of Buenos Aires.</i>

887
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:32,917
<i>Its reserves were estimated</i>
<i>to be worth 200 billion dollars.</i>

888
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:42,885
To privatize it, they had
to commit many irregularities.

889
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:46,006
Actually, if the law was applied,

890
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:48,635
most private concessions
would be invalid.

891
01:00:48,967 --> 01:00:52,846
Argentina could soon rebuild
its national oil company,

892
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:56,199
if it had true political motivation.

893
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:00,359
The strategic reserves,

894
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:02,205
where the greatest sums
were invested,

895
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,086
were awarded for 25 years,

896
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:08,159
for a price equivalent
to 9 months of production.

897
01:01:08,927 --> 01:01:11,395
They were so poorly sold

898
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:15,162
that Menem
had to deal with it personally.

899
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:19,084
$19 for shares
that were worth $38...

900
01:01:19,247 --> 01:01:22,876
350 million shares at $19,
is a gigantic swindle.

901
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:27,446
They even hired
the McKinley company

902
01:01:27,607 --> 01:01:30,360
to underestimate the reserves.

903
01:01:30,527 --> 01:01:35,123
A year later, the reserves reappeared
in the accounts at their real value.

904
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:37,636
So they sold, say,
a reserve for 100,

905
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:40,765
when it was worth 140.

906
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,477
A cartel of four multinationals

907
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:48,437
applied the highest rates
on earth to us

908
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:51,360
and paid the lowest royalties.

909
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:55,076
Who checks up?
They pump as much they want?

910
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:57,681
They make a declaration
under oath.

911
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:58,643
Meaning?

912
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,240
By a declaration under oath,

913
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:04,559
informing the Argentineans
how much they pumped.

914
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:09,795
The reserves, the facilities,
were sold for a pittance.

915
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:11,766
They didn't have to do anything.

916
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:15,761
The site was there,
with the staff and the facilities,

917
01:02:15,927 --> 01:02:20,478
and everything
needed to transport the oil.

918
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:26,684
A high quality infrastructure
that belonged to YPF.

919
01:02:27,207 --> 01:02:31,359
They didn't have to do anything,
because a concern like YPF

920
01:02:31,527 --> 01:02:33,677
had completely planned

921
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:36,924
its future 20 years ahead.

922
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,805
Now they were exploiting it,

923
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:41,720
benefiting
from their State acquisitions,

924
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:45,641
in terms of oil
and gas infrastructures.

925
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:48,037
That's the reality of Argentina.

926
01:02:51,087 --> 01:02:54,966
<i>You can't understand</i>
<i>industrial development in Argentina</i>

927
01:02:55,367 --> 01:02:56,720
<i>and Patagonia,</i>

928
01:02:56,887 --> 01:02:59,355
<i>without knowing about YPF.</i>

929
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:01,918
<i>It had developed pipelines,</i>

930
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,206
<i>steel plants, roads and factories,</i>

931
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:08,725
<i>and given birth to dozens of towns,</i>

932
01:03:08,887 --> 01:03:12,277
<i>geared to the social needs</i>
<i>of their inhabitants.</i>

933
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,004
<i>In particular:</i>

934
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:18,320
<i>Comodoro Rivadavia, Caleta Olivia,</i>

935
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:21,206
<i>Cutral-Cô and Plaza Huincul,</i>

936
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:24,120
<i>which was the first oil-town</i>

937
01:03:24,727 --> 01:03:26,922
<i>in the province of Neuquén.</i>

938
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:32,559
All these empty,
walled up buildings,

939
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,485
lying neglected,

940
01:03:34,687 --> 01:03:36,279
were Camp 1,

941
01:03:36,487 --> 01:03:38,318
the administration block,

942
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,279
the heart of YPF.

943
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:42,883
When it was privatized,

944
01:03:43,047 --> 01:03:46,278
people had to leave
to look for another livelihood.

945
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,439
They abandoned their homes,

946
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:51,802
in search of new horizons.

947
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:54,364
Were you adequately paid?

948
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:57,286
The wages? No problem...

949
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:02,684
Here, no one was ever needy.

950
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:06,321
What happened was a crime,
a murder.

951
01:04:06,487 --> 01:04:10,116
No one ever imagined
this could happen.

952
01:04:12,487 --> 01:04:17,083
Privatizations were done
almost without inventories.

953
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:20,996
YPF left behind lots of things
that disappeared.

954
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,477
Large motors, for instance...

955
01:04:23,647 --> 01:04:27,117
Vehicles, new equipment,

956
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:30,524
drilling bits, tools, clothing...

957
01:04:30,927 --> 01:04:35,205
No track was kept of many items
that were never found.

958
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:38,157
You can dismantle a hangar

959
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:40,483
without anyone asking questions.

960
01:04:40,687 --> 01:04:42,405
This is what's left of PEXSE,

961
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:45,604
a company created
by the oil-workers union SUPE

962
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:50,397
to make the workers believe
they could be entrepreneurs.

963
01:04:50,927 --> 01:04:54,522
The company went bankrupt,
owing us money.

964
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,677
The SUPE executives
were in on the fraud.

965
01:04:58,847 --> 01:05:02,635
They knew very well
that YPF would be dismantled.

966
01:05:08,407 --> 01:05:11,160
People accepted
$40 or $50000 dollars

967
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:13,238
and agreed to get fired.

968
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:16,877
They were paid to take
a training course in pastry-making,

969
01:05:17,127 --> 01:05:21,200
data processing, anything,
for a year.

970
01:05:21,927 --> 01:05:26,762
They accepted privatization
and layoffs without a struggle

971
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,599
because they had money
in their pockets.

972
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:30,837
Then they spent this money,

973
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:35,080
bought a car, enlarged their home,
started a business.

974
01:05:35,407 --> 01:05:37,079
Did it create many unemployed?

975
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:40,523
Between 5000 and 7000,
maybe more.

976
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,123
There are no reliable figures,

977
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:46,842
but it's known to be
in the thousands.

978
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,204
There were thousands
of us semi-employed,

979
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,244
trying to get by.

980
01:05:55,847 --> 01:05:59,362
<i>The unemployed</i>
<i>weren't all from YPF.</i>

981
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:03,118
<i>Thousands of others came</i>

982
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:05,363
<i>from the factories and businesses</i>

983
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:07,199
<i>that also had to close.</i>

984
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:09,359
<i>Some years later,</i>

985
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,203
<i>during the winter of 1996,</i>

986
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:16,156
<i>there was a revolt in Cutral-Cô.</i>

987
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:19,765
<i>We're starving!</i>

988
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:23,516
<i>We give them gas,</i>
<i>oil, electricity!</i>

989
01:06:23,927 --> 01:06:26,521
<i>Unable to find work,</i>

990
01:06:27,007 --> 01:06:31,080
<i>thousands of unemployed</i>
<i>blocked the main highway</i>

991
01:06:31,247 --> 01:06:33,522
<i>for days and nights,</i>

992
01:06:33,687 --> 01:06:36,599
<i>in freezing temperatures,</i>

993
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:40,876
<i>and facing</i>
<i>the charges of the state police.</i>

994
01:06:51,047 --> 01:06:52,400
<i>That single victory</i>

995
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,886
<i>created the "piquetero" movement</i>

996
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:58,561
<i>with its "roadblocks".</i>

997
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:05,277
<i>I cannot rule on this.</i>
<i>The police and I are withdrawing.</i>

998
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:09,326
<i>This judge ordered</i>
<i>the state police to withdraw.</i>

999
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,916
<i>The people has won!</i>

1000
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:33,045
Natural-gas field of Loma de la Lata

1001
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:36,998
Gas del Estado
was the pride of the Argentineans.

1002
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:41,046
It was a showpiece
for companies all over the world.

1003
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:42,322
Why?

1004
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:46,447
It managed the extraction of gas,

1005
01:07:46,607 --> 01:07:49,280
despite of the remoteness
of the deposits,

1006
01:07:49,447 --> 01:07:51,802
like clockwork.

1007
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:56,279
Europeans copied it,
and even some North Americans.

1008
01:07:57,927 --> 01:07:59,280
In 50 years of existence,

1009
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:03,406
it provided natural gas
to 5 million Argentineans,

1010
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:06,286
whereas in 90 years
of British companies,

1011
01:08:06,447 --> 01:08:09,757
only 300000 Argentineans
got high-priced imported gas.

1012
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:14,881
The Petrobras company
estimated that Gas del Estado

1013
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:17,083
was worth 25 billion dollars.

1014
01:08:17,607 --> 01:08:21,316
After being appraised
by international consultants,

1015
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:24,924
it was sold
for 2,5 billion dollars.

1016
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:27,157
- Ten times less?
- Precisely.

1017
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:34,683
<i>Repsol polluted the area</i>
<i>to such an extent</i>

1018
01:08:34,847 --> 01:08:36,360
<i>that the Mapuche Indians</i>

1019
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:40,156
<i>lodged a complaint</i>
<i>with international organizations.</i>

1020
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:44,838
Here, a member of our community

1021
01:08:45,047 --> 01:08:46,605
built a home

1022
01:08:46,767 --> 01:08:48,803
but couldn't move in.

1023
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:52,084
When he dug a well to pump water,

1024
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:54,681
he realized that in fact,

1025
01:08:55,087 --> 01:08:57,078
it was gasoline

1026
01:08:57,247 --> 01:08:59,317
that was coming out.

1027
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,679
This is the pipe...

1028
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:06,202
installed by my father in 1995,

1029
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,759
so he could pump water to drink

1030
01:09:11,487 --> 01:09:13,205
and irrigate.

1031
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:15,835
You'll see what he got...

1032
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:18,643
It's gasoline.

1033
01:09:18,927 --> 01:09:20,155
I'll show you,

1034
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:24,486
It's pure gasoline.

1035
01:09:26,487 --> 01:09:29,047
Seven years ago, supposedly,

1036
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,675
Repsol decontaminated this area.

1037
01:09:31,847 --> 01:09:35,999
What you pump out
is almost hi-octane gas.

1038
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:45,923
Not only on these 55 hectares.

1039
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:48,885
The whole ground water
is contaminated,

1040
01:09:49,127 --> 01:09:50,560
to the very bottom...

1041
01:09:50,727 --> 01:09:54,163
Where the ground water begins.

1042
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:58,881
CORPORATISM

1101
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:08,600
<i>respect of others</i>
<i>and social friendship</i>

1102
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,481
<i>are so damaged</i>

1103
01:15:11,647 --> 01:15:13,524
<i>or discredited...</i>

1104
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:26,156
Eat what?

1105
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,763
I have 7 children, no work...

1106
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:32,798
I have nothing.

1107
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:35,322
No mattress, no blanket.

1108
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:37,958
We're totally indigent.

1109
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:51,484
Come see my shack.

1110
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:54,559
Come see it.

1111
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:00,206
See how I live.

1112
01:16:00,407 --> 01:16:02,921
Everything's wet.
No one helps us.

1113
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:07,838
They must think we're dogs,
us and our kids.

1114
01:16:08,127 --> 01:16:09,446
I never got help.

1115
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:13,122
I have no right to anything,
I'm not paid anything.

1116
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:17,166
I give my youngest some boiled maze
or boiled rice.

1117
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:19,557
I have nothing, that's the truth.

1118
01:16:19,727 --> 01:16:23,402
I have no way to get another home.

1119
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:26,957
They promised,
they put down my name, that's all.

1120
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:29,163
The same as for others.

1121
01:16:29,847 --> 01:16:31,838
Mariela, come see...

1122
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,523
My sister tells me:
"Go to the doctor,

1123
01:16:36,247 --> 01:16:39,398
"you're not well, you're so skinny."

1124
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:41,643
I can't take it anymore.

1125
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:44,765
It's intolerable.
There's no work,

1126
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:48,442
I can't feed my little girl
and that hurts.

1127
01:16:48,967 --> 01:16:52,084
She asks when we're going to eat,

1128
01:16:52,247 --> 01:16:54,044
but there's nothing.

1129
01:16:54,207 --> 01:16:58,166
A child can't understand,
but you have to tell the truth.

1130
01:16:58,367 --> 01:17:02,758
It hurts to have to say
I have nothing, but it's true.

1131
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:07,682
MAFIOCRACY

1132
01:17:08,887 --> 01:17:14,166
<i>The mafiocracy unites businessmen,</i>
<i>politicians and magistrates,</i>

1133
01:17:14,327 --> 01:17:16,636
<i>traffickers and bureaucrats,</i>

1134
01:17:16,807 --> 01:17:19,605
<i>union leaders and media moguls.</i>

1135
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:23,399
<i>Their complicity was only matched</i>

1136
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:26,001
<i>by their hypocrisy.</i>

1137
01:17:27,127 --> 01:17:30,164
The commission
on money-laundering

1138
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:32,085
showed how

1139
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:35,762
the dirty money
from drugs and corruption

1140
01:17:35,927 --> 01:17:38,919
left Argentina
via dummy companies

1141
01:17:39,127 --> 01:17:42,403
located mainly in Uruguay,

1142
01:17:42,607 --> 01:17:45,485
where they were managed,

1143
01:17:45,647 --> 01:17:48,764
toward relay-banks
in the U.S. Or in Switzerland.

1144
01:17:48,967 --> 01:17:50,446
Money-laundering

1145
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:54,276
We investigated
Citibank, Credit Suisse,

1146
01:17:54,447 --> 01:17:56,836
Trainers Bank, JP Morgan...

1147
01:17:57,087 --> 01:18:00,477
Argentina was the center
of their illicit operations,

1148
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:02,838
via Citibank,
Banco República,

1149
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,117
and Monetta's Federal Bank.

1150
01:18:07,007 --> 01:18:08,759
Raúl Monetta: Menem's banker.

1151
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:10,446
Monetta owned

1152
01:18:10,647 --> 01:18:13,605
60% of the media in Argentina.

1153
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:16,156
Of the media? Like what?

1154
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:19,319
Like cable channels,
Telefé, Azul Televisión,

1155
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:23,560
Radio Continental, Editorial
Atlántida, Torneos y Competencias,

1156
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:26,924
provincial cable stations,
Cablevisión...

1157
01:18:27,087 --> 01:18:32,002
He was also the biggest shareholder
of Telefónica Argentina.

1158
01:18:33,647 --> 01:18:35,877
And on top of it well-connected

1159
01:18:36,487 --> 01:18:39,285
to political power
and the Supreme Court.

1160
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:42,359
The very same Supreme Court
that allowed

1161
01:18:42,527 --> 01:18:45,325
telephonic rates to be altered

1162
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:48,047
favoring France Telecom
and Telefónica

1163
01:18:48,207 --> 01:18:50,357
against international competition.

1164
01:18:50,527 --> 01:18:53,439
Curiously, it seems

1165
01:18:53,607 --> 01:18:55,677
that a member of the Supreme Court,

1166
01:18:55,847 --> 01:18:58,725
a cousin by marriage
of Monetta's lawyer,

1167
01:18:58,887 --> 01:19:02,277
received $800000 dollars

1168
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:04,438
sent to the Citibank of New York.

1169
01:19:04,767 --> 01:19:07,520
What are the global estimates

1170
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:10,326
of kickbacks
connected to privatizations?

1171
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:13,843
- Between 5 and 10 billion dollars.
- And who were the perpetrators?

1172
01:19:14,247 --> 01:19:17,045
Mainly Cavallo, Menem and Kohan,

1173
01:19:17,527 --> 01:19:19,404
in the last ten years,

1174
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:22,877
and for money-laundering,
the Banco General de Negocios.

1175
01:19:23,047 --> 01:19:25,766
We also discovered

1176
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,725
bribes paid
during Alfonsín's government,

1177
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:31,640
mainly to the central Bank,

1178
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:36,005
from the BCCI,
a bank that laundered drug-money,

1179
01:19:36,207 --> 01:19:39,119
that financed
80% of Menem's campaign.

1180
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:43,396
There is a definite complicity
between the political class,

1181
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:44,795
the narcotraffickers,

1182
01:19:45,007 --> 01:19:48,443
and encouragement of capital flight.

1183
01:19:49,087 --> 01:19:51,157
Kickbacks

1184
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:53,878
<i>Plunder of public funds</i>

1185
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:57,198
<i>via dividends</i>
<i>and rate-overcharging</i>

1186
01:19:57,407 --> 01:20:00,843
<i>was the norm</i>
<i>for government contracts.</i>

1187
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:05,677
<i>Over 20% of government investments</i>
<i>is estimated</i>

1188
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,242
<i>to have vanished in "commissions".</i>

1189
01:20:08,407 --> 01:20:12,161
<i>Minister Manzano said,</i>
<i>referring to the President:</i>

1190
01:20:12,327 --> 01:20:14,682
<i>"I steal for the crown."</i>

1191
01:20:37,607 --> 01:20:41,236
<i>A major source of corruption</i>
<i>was the PAMI,</i>

1192
01:20:41,407 --> 01:20:43,841
<i>the pensioners' health-insurance</i>
<i>organization.</i>

1193
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:46,965
<i>The system of illicit contracts</i>

1194
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:50,676
<i>made with companies</i>
<i>owned by bureaucrats</i>

1195
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:53,236
<i>lasted during several governments.</i>

1196
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:05,200
A monument to corruption

1197
01:21:05,447 --> 01:21:08,086
The Yacyretá Dam, N.E. Argentina

1198
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:13,285
<i>Yacyretá is one of the biggest</i>
<i>earthfill dams in the world,</i>

1199
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:16,200
<i>with a retaining dam</i>
<i>on the river Paraná</i>

1200
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:19,086
<i>that is 67km long.</i>

1201
01:21:20,447 --> 01:21:23,757
<i>This huge worksite,</i>
<i>financed by Argentineans,</i>

1202
01:21:24,127 --> 01:21:26,925
<i>fed the country's slush funds,</i>

1203
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:29,478
<i>ever since the dictatorship.</i>

1204
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:34,841
How did corruption
at Yacyretá dam operate?

1205
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:38,325
Overestimation of costs,

1206
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:40,557
overdue work schedules.

1207
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:44,720
Today, the site,
is still not completed,

1208
01:21:44,887 --> 01:21:46,878
and still generates costs.

1209
01:21:47,047 --> 01:21:49,436
It has reached
13 billion dollars...

1210
01:21:49,607 --> 01:21:51,598
And we still don't know
when it will end.

1211
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:54,076
5 times the estimate?

1212
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:56,283
I'll give you an example:

1213
01:21:56,447 --> 01:21:58,836
In 1985,
there was a cost reappraisal

1214
01:21:59,007 --> 01:22:01,282
estimated at 30 million dollars,

1215
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:04,440
that was presented several times
to the World Bank

1216
01:22:04,607 --> 01:22:07,075
and the Inter-American Bank
of Development.

1217
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:10,876
It was finally signed in 1989

1218
01:22:11,047 --> 01:22:13,686
for 180 million dollars.

1219
01:22:13,927 --> 01:22:15,406
Many accepted it.

1220
01:22:15,567 --> 01:22:17,080
Some didn't.

1221
01:22:17,247 --> 01:22:20,603
They were excluded from Yacyretá
by the auditors.

1222
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:22,917
- You, among others?
- Yes.

1223
01:22:23,407 --> 01:22:26,797
- Who headed the auditing firm?
- Mr. Carretoni.

1224
01:22:28,967 --> 01:22:33,916
He was campaign-manager
for Alfonsín,

1225
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,157
then for Angeloz.

1226
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:38,124
A member of the Assembly?

1227
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:41,597
Yes, for the reform
of the Constitution in 1994.

1228
01:22:41,767 --> 01:22:46,682
Mr. Carretoni, owned the leading
auditing firm in Argentina,

1229
01:22:47,247 --> 01:22:52,196
and was the father-in-law
of the construction company's boss.

1230
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:53,356
Say that again...

1231
01:22:53,527 --> 01:22:55,119
Mr. Carretoni

1232
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:58,438
was the father-in-law of Mr. Risso.

1233
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:03,005
So the head of the audit cabinet
that had to control costs,

1234
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:05,920
completion date
and technical quality,

1235
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:08,760
was the builder's father-in-law?

1236
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,645
Precisely.

1237
01:23:18,127 --> 01:23:20,925
Arms smuggling

1238
01:23:21,127 --> 01:23:23,960
We sent arms to Ecuador,

1239
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:25,999
that was at war with Peru,

1240
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:30,479
when Argentina was guaranteeing
a truce between the two countries.

1241
01:23:30,647 --> 01:23:35,801
We also sent arms
to Croatia and Bosnia,

1242
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:38,083
violating UN dispositions.

1243
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:41,319
Those implicated
were the Army factories,

1244
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:45,116
the top army brass,
the Río Tercero factory,

1245
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:48,677
through which most arms passed

1246
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:51,839
coming from the North,
a free-zone.

1247
01:23:52,447 --> 01:23:53,357
What happened?

1248
01:23:53,527 --> 01:23:57,998
The Río Tercero factory
was blown up, causing 7 deaths.

1249
01:23:58,727 --> 01:24:01,002
As I started
a procedure in March, 1995,

1250
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:04,483
they tried to erase
all traces of the explosion,

1251
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:07,838
all documents,
inventories, fingerprints,

1252
01:24:08,327 --> 01:24:09,999
anything that could prove

1253
01:24:10,207 --> 01:24:12,402
that it wasn't an accident,

1254
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:15,923
but a planned act
to conceal their crime.

1255
01:24:16,967 --> 01:24:20,516
Who was part of this plot?

1256
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:23,961
Its leader was

1257
01:24:24,127 --> 01:24:26,925
an ex-president of the republic,
Carlos Menem,

1258
01:24:27,127 --> 01:24:30,836
but many others are implicated.

1259
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:34,795
Many other shady events occurred:

1260
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:36,241
"Suicides",

1261
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:37,766
accidental deaths...

1262
01:24:37,927 --> 01:24:39,406
A helicopter crashed

1263
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:42,440
opposite the race track,
on a polo field,

1264
01:24:42,647 --> 01:24:45,400
causing the death of a key figure...

1265
01:24:45,567 --> 01:24:47,319
<i>General Andreoli...</i>

1266
01:24:48,007 --> 01:24:51,920
The "suicide" with his wrong hand
of Captain Estrada,

1267
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:55,204
who had been part
of the "terror groups",

1268
01:24:55,367 --> 01:24:58,518
during the country's darkest hours.

Today,

1270
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:02,283
a question needs to be clarified:

1271
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:04,677
Where's the money they stole?

<i>Two unemployed youths</i>

<i>caused so many deaths</i>
<i>in such short time.</i>

1370
01:30:41,127 --> 01:30:44,278
SOCIAL GENOCIDE

1371
01:31:30,847 --> 01:31:33,964
Here, we foresaw exactly

1372
01:31:34,127 --> 01:31:36,766
the effects of the austerity plans

1373
01:31:37,527 --> 01:31:40,963
adopted by the country.
The well-known austerity plans,

1374
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:44,437
of the era of Alfonsín, of Menem...

1375
01:31:44,607 --> 01:31:48,282
These measures
meant the hospital would receive

1376
01:31:48,447 --> 01:31:51,245
a huge number
of underfed people,

1377
01:31:51,447 --> 01:31:54,200
underfed kids with their families.

1378
01:31:54,367 --> 01:31:57,279
We would say to each other:

1379
01:31:57,447 --> 01:32:00,962
"This one, in 2 or 3 months,
will need a bed."

1380
01:32:01,127 --> 01:32:04,597
An incredible number
of undernourished kids.

1381
01:32:05,487 --> 01:32:08,877
We said: Enough!
In 1982, we took to the streets,

1382
01:32:09,047 --> 01:32:12,084
formed a major movement,
that the press took up,

1383
01:32:12,247 --> 01:32:14,477
and reached the whole country.

1384
01:32:15,807 --> 01:32:18,162
But the policy continued.

1385
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:20,358
The policy of austerity...

1386
01:32:20,607 --> 01:32:24,122
Each time it was like a stab
in the back for us doctors.

1387
01:32:24,287 --> 01:32:28,360
We knew that
4 to 6 months later,

1388
01:32:28,527 --> 01:32:31,485
the kids born then
would be so poorly fed

1389
01:32:31,647 --> 01:32:36,118
that a huge amount of them
would wind up in here.

1390
01:32:36,887 --> 01:32:40,084
That's why we wrote
this text saying:

1391
01:32:40,247 --> 01:32:43,398
"Others decide,
but we see them dying."

1392
01:32:43,807 --> 01:32:46,560
When we started
to find out what to do,

1393
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:50,322
we translated books from English.

1394
01:32:50,527 --> 01:32:54,076
We found some solutions there
for balancing liquids,

1395
01:32:54,247 --> 01:32:56,966
salts, and proteins.

1396
01:32:57,287 --> 01:33:01,200
But we were so overcrowded,

1397
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:04,882
and then we read
a little Argentinean book,

1398
01:33:05,087 --> 01:33:07,555
by a man called Juan P. Garrahan...

1399
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:11,284
He wrote: "Undernourishment

1400
01:33:11,607 --> 01:33:15,236
"is a socio-economic
and cultural disease

1401
01:33:15,407 --> 01:33:19,958
that can be cured
by giving everyone a job."

1402
01:33:21,127 --> 01:33:26,759
He doesn't say:
"By giving food to everyone."

1403
01:33:27,047 --> 01:33:30,039
That triggered things off,
we got it...

1404
01:33:31,287 --> 01:33:35,121
Why send
an undernourished kid home?

1405
01:33:35,287 --> 01:33:37,039
What's the country doing?

1406
01:33:37,807 --> 01:33:40,196
We had a scientific approach,

1407
01:33:40,367 --> 01:33:43,643
but this year,
it's become exponential.

1408
01:33:44,207 --> 01:33:48,405
Before, we had
about 18% underfed kids.

1409
01:33:48,647 --> 01:33:52,322
Now it's close to 80%.

1410
01:34:30,927 --> 01:34:34,363
In garbage dumps,
all those abandoned children,

1411
01:34:34,527 --> 01:34:37,200
pregnant girls of 14 or 15,

1412
01:34:37,367 --> 01:34:40,006
the kids called "nobody's kids",

1413
01:34:40,607 --> 01:34:42,563
only eat every other day.

1414
01:34:42,727 --> 01:34:45,560
Should I tell a 14-year old mother:

1415
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:48,321
"To fight your baby's diarrhea,

1416
01:34:48,487 --> 01:34:52,116
"you need chicken,
polenta, milk,

1417
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:53,686
"clean water..."

1418
01:34:53,887 --> 01:34:56,242
It's totally unethical,

1419
01:34:56,407 --> 01:34:58,716
an inconceivable cruelty.

1420
01:34:59,047 --> 01:35:02,596
How can I say that,
if she's eating garbage?

1421
01:35:02,767 --> 01:35:04,678
These children live on garbage.

1422
01:35:05,087 --> 01:35:09,239
The survivors of the 3rd generation
of underfed people

1423
01:35:09,407 --> 01:35:11,682
are giving birth to these kids.

1424
01:35:12,687 --> 01:35:15,599
A lot of kids die.

1425
01:35:15,767 --> 01:35:17,325
Those that survive

1426
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:21,645
are smaller, weaker,
and have less intellectual capacity.

1427
01:35:22,487 --> 01:35:26,765
But they're people like any others,
with feelings.

1428
01:35:27,207 --> 01:35:29,516
To consider them...

1429
01:35:30,687 --> 01:35:34,236
as a sub-species of society,

1430
01:35:34,407 --> 01:35:35,886
is revolting.

1431
01:35:36,047 --> 01:35:38,686
They're people like you and me.

1432
01:35:38,847 --> 01:35:41,805
They have the same rights as others,

1433
01:35:41,967 --> 01:35:44,322
they suffer like others,

1434
01:35:44,527 --> 01:35:47,325
if their child dies or gets sick,

1435
01:35:47,487 --> 01:35:50,923
they have a right to a home,
with drinking water,

1436
01:35:51,087 --> 01:35:53,885
and food daily, and a job.

1437
01:35:55,207 --> 01:35:57,402
We speak of human rights...

1438
01:35:57,567 --> 01:36:00,286
What rights do these people have,

1439
01:36:00,447 --> 01:36:03,120
when they're put down this way?

1440
01:36:15,047 --> 01:36:17,322
I really feel

1441
01:36:17,487 --> 01:36:20,285
that a certain part of society

1442
01:36:20,447 --> 01:36:23,280
wants to get rid of these people.

1443
01:36:23,727 --> 01:36:26,560
As if they were bothered by them.

1444
01:36:26,727 --> 01:36:28,683
What part?

1445
01:36:29,407 --> 01:36:32,126
We know who:
Those who grabbed everything.

1446
01:36:32,327 --> 01:36:36,286
90% are paupers,
and 10% own everything.

1447
01:36:36,687 --> 01:36:39,155
That's not a system...

1448
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:42,478
I'm 54 and it's always the same.

1449
01:36:42,647 --> 01:36:44,444
That same old austerity.

1450
01:36:44,607 --> 01:36:47,644
They always go back
to the same things.

1451
01:36:47,887 --> 01:36:49,878
They don't give a damn.

1452
01:36:50,367 --> 01:36:51,686
And the kids

1453
01:36:51,847 --> 01:36:55,078
have no place at the table
and aren't fed.

1454
01:36:55,287 --> 01:36:58,279
The people we don't want to see
in this country

1455
01:36:58,567 --> 01:37:02,003
are those who are born,
who live and die

1456
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:05,284
without ID's,
without legal existence.

1457
01:37:05,687 --> 01:37:07,882
The other Argentina,
the hidden one.

1458
01:37:08,047 --> 01:37:10,800
Those who've been excluded,

1459
01:37:11,567 --> 01:37:13,842
for whom nothing is done,

1460
01:37:14,007 --> 01:37:17,795
who shouldn't be allowed
to reproduce,

1461
01:37:17,967 --> 01:37:20,083
who should be taken out
of circulation,

1462
01:37:20,567 --> 01:37:23,957
of whom no one dares say yet:
"Let's hide them."

1463
01:37:27,847 --> 01:37:30,156
<i>When our country</i>

1464
01:37:30,607 --> 01:37:33,917
<i>produces enough commodities to feed</i>

1465
01:37:34,127 --> 01:37:36,880
<i>300 million people,</i>

1466
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:39,797
<i>the level of poverty denounced</i>

1467
01:37:40,047 --> 01:37:42,402
<i>in the film</i>
<i>"The Hour of the Furnaces"</i>

1468
01:37:42,567 --> 01:37:44,603
<i>in the 1960s,</i>

1469
01:37:44,847 --> 01:37:50,160
<i>never foresaw the incredible</i>
<i>neo-liberal genocide of the 1990s.</i>

1470
01:37:54,407 --> 01:37:57,843
<i>Curable diseases</i>
<i>and undernourishment</i>

1471
01:37:58,327 --> 01:38:00,795
<i>cause every day in Argentina</i>

1472
01:38:00,967 --> 01:38:03,276
<i>the death of 55 children,</i>

1473
01:38:03,447 --> 01:38:06,484
<i>35 youths and adults</i>

1474
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,844
<i>and 10 elderly people.</i>

1475
01:38:09,647 --> 01:38:14,004
<i>An average</i>
<i>of 35000 people per year.</i>

1476
01:39:37,087 --> 01:39:40,682
The international organizations

1477
01:39:42,687 --> 01:39:44,643
<i>This country was held up</i>
<i>to the world</i>

1478
01:39:44,807 --> 01:39:46,638
<i>as a model to follow.</i>

1479
01:39:47,207 --> 01:39:48,481
<i>The IMF</i>

1480
01:39:48,647 --> 01:39:51,036
<i>applauded Menem in Washington</i>

1481
01:39:51,207 --> 01:39:53,926
<i>for the "Argentinean miracle."</i>

1482
01:39:55,887 --> 01:39:59,243
<i>President,</i>
<i>this photo will be great for me.</i>

1483
01:39:59,407 --> 01:40:02,285
<i>- For me, too.</i>
<i>- I don't know...</i>

1484
01:40:05,487 --> 01:40:09,275
<i>They say that a photo</i>
<i>with the devil is dangerous.</i>

1485
01:40:09,447 --> 01:40:11,199
<i>Come on...</i>

1486
01:40:14,647 --> 01:40:19,323
<i>Our government's responsibility</i>
<i>in social genocide</i>

1487
01:40:20,007 --> 01:40:24,080
<i>doesn't exonerate international</i>
<i>organizations, or their proxies,</i>

1488
01:40:24,647 --> 01:40:26,763
<i>the United States and Europe,</i>

1489
01:40:26,927 --> 01:40:31,318
<i>or the unfair North-South</i>
<i>commercial relationships.</i>

1490
01:40:32,447 --> 01:40:35,280
<i>These neo-racist programs</i>

1491
01:40:35,807 --> 01:40:39,516
<i>that generated huge profits</i>
<i>at the cost of segregation</i>

1492
01:40:39,687 --> 01:40:44,477
<i>and the premature death</i>
<i>of millions of people,</i>

1493
01:40:44,847 --> 01:40:49,238
<i>are peacetime crimes</i>
<i>against humanity.</i>

1494
01:40:49,967 --> 01:40:52,435
<i>Their authors</i>

1495
01:40:52,847 --> 01:40:54,963
<i>cannot go unpunished.</i>

1496
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:02,876
<i>A quarter of century later,</i>

1497
01:41:03,287 --> 01:41:06,643
<i>the economic results</i>
<i>are disastrous:</i>

1498
01:41:06,807 --> 01:41:11,198
<i>The public and private debt</i>
<i>rose from 7,8 billion</i>

1499
01:41:11,367 --> 01:41:15,155
<i>to 170 billion dollars,</i>

1500
01:41:15,327 --> 01:41:19,639
<i>and 150 billion more</i>
<i>were paid out for services,</i>

1501
01:41:19,807 --> 01:41:24,164
<i>and a similar sum</i>
<i>was sent abroad.</i>

1502
01:41:24,527 --> 01:41:28,839
<i>Argentina lost another 150 billion</i>

1503
01:41:29,007 --> 01:41:33,842
<i>because of agricultural subsidies</i>
<i>in Europe and the U.S.</i>

1504
01:41:34,687 --> 01:41:36,917
<i>Since 1999,</i>

1505
01:41:37,367 --> 01:41:39,676
<i>growth is non-existent,</i>

1506
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:42,964
<i>and the country</i>
<i>is heading toward devaluation</i>

1507
01:41:43,127 --> 01:41:45,004
<i>and bankruptcy.</i>

1508
01:41:48,127 --> 01:41:51,802
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1509
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:57,441
<i>Going over this memoir,</i>

1510
01:41:57,687 --> 01:42:02,556
<i>it may appear</i>
<i>that the reality can't be changed,</i>

1511
01:42:03,047 --> 01:42:06,676
<i>that the plunderers won the day,</i>

1512
01:42:07,007 --> 01:42:09,157
<i>and we are the losers.</i>

1513
01:42:13,287 --> 01:42:16,085
<i>It's closer to the opposite:</i>

1514
01:42:16,927 --> 01:42:20,522
<i>Neither the dictatorship,</i>
<i>Menem, or De la Rúa</i>

1515
01:42:20,727 --> 01:42:23,195
<i>brought their projects to fruition,</i>

1516
01:42:24,887 --> 01:42:29,358
<i>and the wealth they gave away</i>
<i>isn't lost forever:</i>

1517
01:42:29,607 --> 01:42:31,837
<i>It can be recovered.</i>

1518
01:42:41,887 --> 01:42:46,278
<i>The neo-liberal model</i>
<i>ended in a mass sell-off,</i>

1519
01:42:46,847 --> 01:42:50,442
<i>but those responsible</i>
<i>weren't able to sell everything:</i>

1520
01:42:51,407 --> 01:42:53,682
<i>Not the major public banks,</i>

1521
01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:56,566
<i>or the big</i>
<i>Río Santiago shipyards,</i>

1522
01:42:56,767 --> 01:42:59,804
<i>or the nuclear power plants,</i>
<i>or Yacyretá,</i>

1523
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,362
<i>or Salto Grande, or Epec.</i>

1524
01:43:20,807 --> 01:43:22,126
<i>Menem and De la Rúa</i>

1525
01:43:22,847 --> 01:43:26,886
<i>weren't able</i>
<i>to impose a repressive solution,</i>

1526
01:43:28,247 --> 01:43:30,317
<i>or to silence the protests</i>

1527
01:43:30,487 --> 01:43:33,479
<i>against mafioso and police crimes,</i>

1528
01:43:35,327 --> 01:43:39,161
<i>or to stop the persistent action</i>
<i>of the Mothers,</i>

1529
01:43:39,327 --> 01:43:42,876
<i>Grandmothers and Children</i>
<i>of the "disappeared".</i>

1530
01:44:00,007 --> 01:44:02,965
<i>A new spirit kept them at bay:</i>

1531
01:44:03,887 --> 01:44:07,243
<i>That of all the struggles,</i>
<i>the rallying to causes,</i>

1532
01:44:08,247 --> 01:44:12,365
<i>in the social movements</i>
<i>that grew during the decade:</i>

1533
01:44:13,447 --> 01:44:15,244
<i>The local organizations,</i>

1534
01:44:15,967 --> 01:44:19,357
<i>the "piqueteros", canteens,</i>
<i>and neighborhood assemblies,</i>

1535
01:44:20,247 --> 01:44:23,125
<i>the occupation of land</i>
<i>and settlements,</i>

1536
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:27,362
<i>the huge nation-wide march</i>
<i>and hundreds of other marches,</i>

1537
01:44:27,567 --> 01:44:29,319
<i>national strikes...</i>

1538
01:44:30,807 --> 01:44:32,763
<i>the CTA movement,</i>

1539
01:44:33,287 --> 01:44:35,278
<i>the factories</i>
<i>reclaimed by the workers,</i>

1540
01:44:36,447 --> 01:44:39,598
<i>the successive demos of pensioners,</i>

1541
01:44:40,687 --> 01:44:43,155
<i>the struggles of women farmhands,</i>

1542
01:44:43,407 --> 01:44:45,682
<i>students and bank depositors,</i>

1543
01:44:45,847 --> 01:44:48,441
<i>storekeepers, artists...</i>

1544
01:44:48,807 --> 01:44:53,323
<i>It all led</i>
<i>to the big December, 2001 uprising:</i>

1545
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:57,685
<i>As on October 17, 1945</i>
<i>and in Côrdoba in 1969,</i>

1546
01:44:58,367 --> 01:45:01,643
<i>Argentinean history was changed.</i>

1547
01:45:40,727 --> 01:45:42,797
<i>My heart has closed up tight</i>

1548
01:45:43,527 --> 01:45:45,836
<i>so it can survive</i>

1549
01:45:46,127 --> 01:45:48,243
<i>Living so I can save</i>

1550
01:45:48,647 --> 01:45:51,161
<i>my skin,</i>
<i>which is all I have left</i>

1551
01:45:55,367 --> 01:45:57,562
<i>My soul is wasting away</i>

1552
01:46:02,247 --> 01:46:04,841
<i>Don't think, don't protest</i>

1553
01:46:05,247 --> 01:46:07,636
<i>Don't even try, don't interfere</i>

1554
01:46:07,807 --> 01:46:09,763
<i>Anyway, nothing makes sense</i>

1555
01:46:10,527 --> 01:46:12,757
<i>Our lives are preordained</i>

1556
01:46:12,967 --> 01:46:15,879
<i>In this apocalyptic comedy</i>

1557
01:46:16,047 --> 01:46:18,720
<i>We're all headed</i>
<i>for the slaughterhouse</i>

1558
01:46:18,967 --> 01:46:21,322
<i>We're not eliminated</i>
<i>the same old way</i>

1559
01:46:21,487 --> 01:46:24,206
<i>Now we're told</i>
<i>to make ourselves disappear</i>

1560
01:46:24,367 --> 01:46:27,040
<i>Asking questions without answers</i>

1561
01:46:27,207 --> 01:46:29,926
<i>Protesting without hassling anyone</i>

1562
01:46:30,087 --> 01:46:32,601
