1
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,340
Bobby-boy,
stay while mommy picks up free cheese.

2
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,455
This will keep the sun out of your eyes

3
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,258
Be good.

4
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,376
Don't you fucking move,
you little shit machine.

5
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,053
Mama's gonna try to score.

6
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,733
Excuse me, who's watching these babies?

7
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,090
The fat one's watching the little one?

8
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,290
Nice parenting.

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,695
Leave them out here like that
and see what happens.

10
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,890
Fuck you, you fucking square!

11
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,732
Yeah, keep on trucking.

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,249
Did you hear the fucking guy tell me
how to fucking raise you?

13
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,648
What a fucker man.

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,048
Who does he think he fucking is?

15
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,056
What's the worst
that could fucking happen to you

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,171
standing in front of a store?

17
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,375
Fuck!

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,652
Fuck.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,934
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,052
Fuck, fuck, mother-motherfuck-
mother-motherfuck-fuck.

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,057
Motherfuck, motherfuck- no inch,
no inch, no inch.

22
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,938
One, two, one-two-three-four.

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,613
No inch, no inch, no inch, no inch,

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,051
Smoking weed, smoking weed,
doing coke, drinking beers.

25
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,729
Drinking beers, beers, beers.
Rolling fatties, smoking blunts.

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,612
Who smokes the blunts?
We smoke the blunts.

27
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,938
Let me have a nickel bag.

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,689
Fifteen bucks, little man.
Put that shit in my hand.

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,409
If that money doesn't show,
then you owe me, owe me, owe.

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,055
My Jungle Love.
Oh-wee-oh-wee-oh!

31
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,609
I think I want to know you, know you.

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,049
What the hell are you singing?

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,778
You don't know "Jungle Love"?

34
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,214
That shit is the mad notes.

35
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,454
Written by God herself...

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,538
and handed down to
the greatest band in the world.

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,497
The motherfucking Time.

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,173
You mean the guys in that Prince movie?

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,170
Yeah, "Purple Rain."

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,138
That shit was so gay.
Fucking 80's style.

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,455
Don't never say an unkind word
about "The Time".

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,895
Me and Silent Bob modeled our
whole fucking lives...

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,175
around Morris Day and Jerome.

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,173
I'm a smooth pimp
who loves the pussy...

45
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,053
and tubby here is my black man-servant.

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,896
What?

47
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,130
What did tell you two about
dealing in front of the store?

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,650
Drop the kid and pedal your
wares someplace else, burn-boy.

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,778
And for the record,
"The Time" sucked ass.

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,573
Want to hear something fucked up
about him and that Quick-Stop boy?

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,379
Are you supposed to be here today?

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,899
Don't get me started.

53
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,971
Can't we do something
about those two stoners...

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,738
hanging around outside
the store all the time?

55
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,055
Why? What did they do now?

56
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,938
I'm trying to watch
"Clash Of The Titans"

57
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,651
and all I can hear is...

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,175
those two screaming about
Morris Day at the top of their lungs.

59
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,570
I thought the fat one
didn't talk that much.

60
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,815
What, am I producing
an A & E biography about them?

61
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,530
Two packs of wraps.
How is the service?

62
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,292
What service?

63
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,972
The one at the Unitarian Church
last week...

64
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,977
where you two got married to each other

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,499
What the hell are you talking about?

66
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,378
Jay said you guys had a
"Star Wars" theme wedding...

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,690
and you tied the knot
dressed like Storm Troopers.

68
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,930
And he says you're the bitch
and you're butch.

69
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,288
I'm the bitch?

70
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,933
If we were gay,
that's the way I'd se it.

71
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,936
Will you shut up?

72
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,335
Holy shit, dude-the honeymoon's over.

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,933
That does it.

74
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,290
I am gonna do something about
these two stoner fucks...

75
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,178
I should've done a long time ago.

76
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,972
What the fuck, Serpico? What'd we do?

77
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,450
We got a report of two guys hanging
around a store selling pot.

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,173
We don't smoke pot.

79
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,979
No pot? What do you use this for?

80
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,012
I have a wiping problem,
I stick those little pieces of paper...

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,893
over my brown eye and bam!
- No shit stains on my undies.

82
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,618
You don't believe me? I'll show you.

83
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,776
Check this out.

84
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,050
Just spread my cheeks and
you can see the stink nuggets.

85
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,210
Pull up your fucking pants, sir.

86
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,257
Now!

87
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,619
Let's go.
We're going down to the station.

88
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,299
What, is it a crime to fart?
Motherfucker

89
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,733
No fucking way!

90
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,579
Dante and Randal slapped you
with a restraining order?

91
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,378
Ain't that about a bitch?

92
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,058
Are you gonna abide by
the court's ruling...

93
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,216
or are you gonna go bandit,
Reynold's style?

94
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,575
Judge said if we go within
a hundred feet of the store...

95
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,219
we get thrown into County.

96
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,972
You know what they make you do
in County?

97
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,091
Toss the salad.

98
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,096
If you guys really wanted to hang out
in front of a convenience store...

99
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,899
you could buy your own with all that
money you guys made.

100
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,051
Hell, yeah, bitch.

101
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,408
Wait a second-what money?

102
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,219
The money from the Bluntman
And Chronic movie.

103
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,970
Oh my God,
don't tell me you have no idea...

104
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,011
that there's a movie being made of
the comic...

105
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,131
you two were the basis for?

106
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,450
What? Since when?

107
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,249
Here's the pulse.
And this is your finger...

108
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,378
far from the pulse,
jammed straight up your ass.

109
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,179
Would you like
a chocolate covered pretzel?

110
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,777
If you read Wizard, you'd know
that it's the top story this month.

111
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,333
Check it out.

112
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,973
When the fuck did this happen?

113
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,937
After-X-Men hit at the box office...

114
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,210
all the studios started buying
every comic property...

115
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,416
they could get their dirty
little hands on.

116
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,975
Miramax optioned Bluntman And Chronic.

117
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,577
Miramax?

118
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,935
I thought
they only made classy pictures...

119
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,050
like The Piano, or The Crying Game.

120
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,053
Once they made She's All That,
everything went to hell.

121
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,138
You're saying you haven't gotten
a monetary cut of the movie?

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,052
Didn't Holden McNeil
and Banky Edwards...

123
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,772
used to pay you likeness rights
for the comic book?

124
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,289
We haven't seen a fucking dime
for no movie.

125
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,338
I'm no lawyer,
but I think Holden and Banky...

126
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,173
owe you some of that proverbial
"fat cash".

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,296
If I was you guys,
I'd find Holden McNeil...

128
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,058
and ask for my movie check.

129
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,535
Shit, yeah, we gots to get paid!

130
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,095
And on that note, we cue the music.

131
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,139
Look at these morose motherfuckers
right here.

132
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,010
Smells like somebody shit
in their cereal. Bunngg!

133
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,412
Come on in.

134
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,774
What brings you two dirt merchants
to my neck of the woods?

135
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,210
I'll tell you what our necks are
doing in your woods.

136
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,097
Where's our motherfucking movie check?

137
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,937
You heard about that, huh?

138
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,731
I got nothing to do with it.

139
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,452
That's Banky's deal.

140
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,211
He owns the property now.

141
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,019
I sold my half of the Bluntman and
Chronic rights to him years ago.

142
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,051
Why the fuck would you do
a thing like that?

143
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,610
Why in Gods' name would I want to
keep writing about characters...

144
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,056
whose central preoccupation is weed
and dick and fart jokes.

145
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,336
You gotta grow, man.

146
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,815
Don't you want anything more
for yourself?

147
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,095
I know this poor hapless son of
a bitch does.

148
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,737
I look into his sorry, doe eyes and
I see a man crying out.

149
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,333
He's crying out "When, Lord?"

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,730
When the fuck can your servant...

151
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,374
ditch this foul mouthed
little chucklehead...

152
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,929
to whom I am a constant victim of
his folly.

153
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,290
So much so that it prevents me
from ever getting a girl.

154
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,893
Fuck! When, Lord, when?

155
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,891
When's gonna be my time?

156
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,175
He knows.

157
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,693
I'm the chucklehead?

158
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,049
You're the fucking dumb ass...

159
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,135
who gave your comic away.

160
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,495
Now you don't get no
fucking movie check neither.

161
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,013
When you're right, you're right.

162
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,051
I wish I'd held on to a little piece
of that thing because...

163
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,292
if the buzz is any sign, that movie's
gonna make some huge bank.

164
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,813
What buzz?

165
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,055
The internet buzz.

166
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,250
What the fuck is the internet?

167
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,695
The internet is a communications
tool used the world over...

168
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,618
where people can come together
to bitch about movies...

169
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,656
and share pornography.

170
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,892
Like this-Movie Poop Shoot-dot-com.

171
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,618
Poop shoot, yeah.

172
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,455
This is a site populated
by militant movie buffs.

173
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,930
Sad, pathetic little bastards living
in their parents' basement...

174
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,257
downloading scripts and what
they think is inside information...

175
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,928
about movies and actors that
they claim to despise yet...

176
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,135
can't stop discussing.

177
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,098
Okay, this is about Bluntman & Chronic.

178
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,530
"Inside sources tell me Miramax is
starting production this Friday..."

179
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,772
"on their adaptation of underground
comic fav Bluntman & Chronic."

180
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,696
Friday? Shit.

181
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,492
Does it say who's playing us
in the movie?

182
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,536
No, but it's Miramax,

183
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,895
so I'm sure
it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

184
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,334
They put them in a bunch of movies.

185
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,012
Who?

186
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,051
Those kids from "Good Will Hunting".

187
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,216
You mean that fucking movie
with Mork from Ork in it?

188
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,216
I wasn't a big fan either.

189
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,689
But Affleck was the bomb in "Phantoms".

190
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,454
Word, bitch.
"Phantoms" was a motherfucker!

191
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,449
Here we go.

192
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,655
This is the shoot back section.

193
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,971
This is where the people get to
chime in with their two cents.

194
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,536
Here's a guy with
the chick-magnet name "Wampa One"...

195
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,260
opining on what he thinks about
Bluntman & Chronic.

196
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,057
He says...

197
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,216
"Bluntman & Chronic and their stupid
alter egos Jay & Silent Bob...

198
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,291
"only work in small doses, if at all."

199
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,291
"They don't deserve their own movie."

200
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,051
He's got a point.

201
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,619
Fuck him. What's the next one say?

202
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,611
This is entitled
"Fuck Them Up Their Stupid Asses".

203
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,374
"Bluntman & Chronic is the
worst comic I ever read."

204
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,571
"Jay & Silent Bob
are stupid characters."

205
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,089
"A couple of stoners who spout
dumb ass catch phrases..."

206
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,415
"like a third rate Cheech & Chong,
or Bill & Ted."

207
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,495
"Fuck Jay & Silent Bob!
Fuck them up their stupid asses!"

208
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,378
Who the fuck said that shit?

209
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,373
He calls himself Magnolia Fan.
Check this one out.

210
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,218
"Jay & Silent Bob are one-note jokes
that only stoners laugh at."

211
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,218
"They are fucking clown shoes."

212
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,975
"If they were real I'd beat the shit
out of them for being so stupid."

213
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,534
"I will be boycotting this movie.
Who is with me?"

214
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,895
Then there's fifty more posts
of people...

215
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,698
who are joining this guy's boycott.

216
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,374
I'm gonna kill all these fucks.

217
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,928
Let it go.
They're not talking about you guys.

218
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,732
They're talking about
Bluntman & Chronic.

219
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,089
But they said Jay & Silent Bob.

220
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,215
They used our real names.

221
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,291
It doesn't matter
if there's a comic version...

222
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,213
because no one knows we're real
in real life.

223
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,055
And all the people reading that
shit think the real Jay & Silent Bob...

224
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,370
are a couple of jerk-offs
because of what these dick-heads...

225
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,610
are writing about
the comic Jay & Silent Bob.

226
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,170
Maybe one night me and lunch-box
are making some chick and she says...

227
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,412
"Oooh, I want to suck your dicks off.

228
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,019
What're your names?"

229
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,013
And I say
"Jay & Silent Bob. Recognize."

230
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,096
And she says
"I read on the internet that..."

231
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,377
"you guys were a couple of
little fucking jerk-offs."

232
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,054
And then she goes and sucks
two other guys dicks off instead.

233
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,898
Fuck that!

234
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,698
We got to put a stop to
these fucking hateful...

235
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,539
sons of bitches before they ruin
our good names.

236
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,418
First of all, I don't know
how good your names are...

237
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,014
and second, there's not much you can do
about stopping this bile.

238
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,573
The internet has given everyone
in America a voice...

239
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,049
and everyone in America
has chosen to use that voice...

240
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,010
to bitch about movies.

241
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,368
As long as
there's Bluntman & Chronic movie...

242
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,612
the net nerds are gonna have
something negative to say.

243
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,775
Wait a second.

244
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,375
If there wasn't
a Bluntman & Chronic movie...

245
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,775
then those fuckers wouldn't be saying
shit about Jay & Silent Bob.

246
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,409
They're not saying anything
about you now.

247
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,894
They're talking
about fictional characters.

248
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,449
Fictional characters.

249
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,532
Am I getting through to you at all?

250
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,458
So all we gotta do is stop
the fucking movie from getting made.

251
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,732
And forego the hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

252
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,891
that you two would be entitled to
in the process.

253
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,288
Are you fucking retarded?

254
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,054
I don't think I'm alone in the world...

255
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,933
Greedo shooting first.

256
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,376
A Jay & Silent Bob movie?

257
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,213
Who'd pay to see that?

258
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,290
But, since it appears inevitable,
I recommend that you...

259
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,770
go hunt Banky down and get
your mother fucking movie check...

260
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,494
as you succinctly put it,
because that's what's important, right?

261
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,220
No, Holden McNeil.

262
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,735
The important thing here
is a bunch of mother fuckers...

263
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,534
we don't even know calling us
assholes on the internet...

264
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,214
to teenagers and guys
who can't even get laid.

265
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,053
Putting a stop to that is the most
important thing we could ever do.

266
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,614
When is this movie getting made?

267
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,008
They start this Friday.

268
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,139
So, if today is Tuesday,
that gives us...

269
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,413
eight days.

270
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,332
Three by my count, but close.

271
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,092
My bad.

272
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,377
Three days to stop that fucking
stupid movie from getting made.

273
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,259
C'mon, Silent Bob-
we're going to Hollywood.

274
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,057
Tickets?

275
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,336
Since when did they start charging
for the bus?

276
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,572
Didn't we used to ride that shit to
school every morning for free?

277
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,370
This sucks balls, man.

278
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,417
How come we ain't getting no rides?

279
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,495
Because you're doing it all wrong.

280
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,249
You gotta give
the driver a little incentive.

281
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,654
Like how?

282
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,935
Like this.

283
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,613
But what happens when they pick
you up and you don't...

284
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,979
make with the head?

285
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,539
Don't they kick your ass to the curb?

286
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,260
Sure, if you don't make with the head.

287
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,496
Yeah. If it'll get me a couple
hundred miles across the country...

288
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,890
I'll take a shot in the mouth.

289
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,493
But we ain't gay.

290
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,935
Don't be so suburban.

291
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,334
It's the new millennium.

292
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,492
Gay, straight- it's all the same now.

293
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,696
There are no more lines.

294
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,053
There's a line,
and on the side of it we ain't gay.

295
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,774
All the hitchers do this.

296
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,897
Why do you think people pick us up?

297
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,016
If you get a ride, it's expected.

298
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,335
I don't care who the driver is.

299
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,412
It's the first rule in the book.

300
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,013
What book?

301
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,893
The unwritten book of the road.

302
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,455
Follow the rules of the book...

303
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,650
and you'll get
where you're going in no time.

304
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,458
Excuse me.

305
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,939
You both don't have to sit back there.

306
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,574
Why doesn't one of you come sit
next to me?

307
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,568
Where are you boys from?

308
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,025
New Jersey.

309
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,288
But we're on our way to Hollywood.

310
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,213
Hollywood, huh? That's far away.

311
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,416
Thank God you picked us up.

312
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,936
Do unto others-
that's what the book says.

313
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,375
Wait a second- you follow the book too?

314
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,491
I live my life by it.

315
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,417
- You?
- Of course.

316
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,538
So you live by the book, too?

317
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,050
You picked us up, didn't you?
I have to.

318
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,769
That's good to hear...

319
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,131
but it's a lot easier to say
you live by the book...

320
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,530
than to actually do it.

321
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,534
Can you do it?
All right.

322
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,254
I can't believe this shit.

323
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,614
Five hours and not a single ride.

324
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,056
Every day people hitch to Hollywood...

325
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,058
but when you and me try it's like
we're trapped in a fucking cartoon.

326
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,058
Zoinks.

327
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,051
Now we can finally solve the mystery
of the hitchhiking ghouls.

328
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,410
Pull off their masks and let's see
who they really are.

329
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,975
I don't think they are masks.

330
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,739
And I don't think
they're hitchhiking girls, either.

331
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,056
Ghouls, you fucking moron, not girls.

332
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,609
I wish they were hitchhiking girl.

333
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,055
Sexy, hitchhiking girls.

334
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,970
Let's kick them out.

335
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,419
We have a mystery to solve.

336
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,730
The only mystery here is
why we take our cues...

337
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,056
from a dick in a neckerchief.

338
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,936
Keep it up, beatnik.

339
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,254
I'll feed you to the fucking dog.

340
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,014
I can't take all this fighting.

341
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,135
You guys need to turn those
frowns upside down.

342
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,296
And I got just the thing for that.

343
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,692
We call it...

344
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,731
doobie snacks.

345
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,336
Hi, Jay and Silent Bob.

346
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,579
I think they passed out.

347
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,089
Great. What do we do with them now?

348
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,490
Let's cut out their kidneys
and sell them on the black market...

349
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,493
and leave them in
a seedy motel bathtub full of ice.

350
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,816
You see something?

351
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,373
Anything?

352
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,690
I had a horrible dream.

353
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,250
Man, I'm hungry.

354
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,212
Where can we get some breakfast?

355
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,815
Yeah.

356
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,018
Check that shit out.

357
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,050
The internet.

358
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,613
Let's see if those fucks wrote
something new about us...

359
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,054
or that stupid-ass flick.

360
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,650
"Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob
are gonna lick balls..."

361
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,050
"because they both, in fact,
lick balls."

362
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,488
Mother fucker.

363
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,252
It's time we wrote something back.

364
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,330
Type this shit down.

365
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,776
All you mother fuckers are gonna pay.

366
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,097
You are the ones
who are the ball lickers.

367
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,694
We're gonna fuck your mothers
while you watch and cry...

368
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,219
like little whiny bitches.

369
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,619
One we get to Hollywood...

370
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,930
and find those Miramax fucks
who are making the movie...

371
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,370
we're gonna make them eat our shit-
then shit out our shit...

372
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,532
and eat their shit that's made up
of our shit that we make them eat.

373
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,538
And then all you mother fucks are next.

374
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,409
Love, Jay & Silent Bob.

375
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,299
That'll show those fucks.

376
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,614
Now we can eat our Egga-Mooby Muffin

377
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,374
then get back on the road,
go to Hollywood and stop those fucks...

378
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,768
from making that movie.

379
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,538
No more hairy bush nuns, no more dogs.

380
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,292
We keep our eye on the prize.

381
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,972
And let nothing...

382
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,216
and I mean nothing distract us.

383
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,255
Holy shit!

384
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,410
Oh, my God.

385
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,332
Do you get free refills with that?

386
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,491
This? No, I use this for protection.

387
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,936
So that no guys try to grab my shit
or anything.

388
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,213
Hi, I'm Justice.

389
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,492
And I am so fucking yours.

390
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,135
I mean- hi, I'm Jay.

391
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,895
And this is my hetero life-mate,
Silent Bob.

392
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,049
It's nice to meet you.

393
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,336
Justice, huh? That's a nice name.

394
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,537
Jay and Justice sitting in a tree...

395
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,339
f-u-c-k-i-n-g.

396
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,456
So you come around here often?

397
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,576
I'm not from around here.

398
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,531
My friends and I are on a road trip.

399
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,655
Friends, huh?

400
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,650
Where are they at?

401
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,369
Out there by that van.

402
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,810
Hi.

403
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,580
Dude, I think I just filled the cup.

404
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,656
Ladies, ladies, ladies -
Jay and Silent Bob are in the house.

405
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,256
Who the fuck are these guys?

406
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,054
This is Jay and Silent Bob.

407
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,614
Guys, this is Sissy, Missy and Chrissy.

408
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,896
Where the fuck did they come from?

409
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,697
I met them inside.

410
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,650
They're gonna hitch a ride.

411
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,210
I don't know if that's such a good idea

412
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,052
Sure it is, Jugs.

413
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,738
Oh, my God!

414
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,373
He just called Sissy "Jugs".

415
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,178
- I'm on it.
- Chrissy, no!

416
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,409
We're in the middle of suburbia.

417
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,735
Let's try and act like it.

418
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,616
What's with the knife?

419
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,729
We having cake or something?

420
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,168
Shit.

421
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,455
He's retarded to boot.

422
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,576
She called you retarded.

423
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,054
What is wrong with you, Justice?

424
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,739
You do remember where
we're going, don't you?

425
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,299
And we have a job to do.

426
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,659
They're just gonna tag along for
a few miles.

427
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,094
They won't get in the way, I swear.

428
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,689
I swear I don't know what's going on
in your fucking brain lately.

429
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,259
Please?

430
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,978
Fine, they can ride with us.

431
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,330
But they are so out of here
before we get to Boulder.

432
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,330
Honest injun.

433
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,456
- Honest injun.
- Shut up.

434
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,377
I can't believe what a pushover you are

435
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,054
And I can't believe fine-ass
bitches like yourself eat that shit.

436
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,211
Don't you know fast food
makes girls fart?

437
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,735
What's all this talk about farting?

438
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,932
Hi, Brent.

439
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,978
This is Brent. He's with us, too.

440
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,739
Brent, tell these sillies that
girls don't fart.

441
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,135
Of course they don't.

442
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,535
Only skeevy stoners fart.

443
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,014
What up, homies?

444
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,291
Wow, three guys, four girls.

445
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,291
What's the count, boys?

446
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,575
Let's rock.

447
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,809
Dear Mr. Science guy...

448
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,818
don't spray that aerosol in my eye.

449
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,373
I don't really want to die.

450
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,610
I'm a noble rabbit.

451
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,657
What are you guys,
a cover band or something?

452
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,209
We're the Kansas state chapter of SAAC-

453
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,211
Students Against Animal Cruelty.

454
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,690
We're on our way to Colorado to give
Provasik a piece of our minds.

455
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,652
What the fuck
are you bitches babbling about?

456
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,209
Hey! Watch the language, little boy.

457
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,655
There are females present.

458
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,574
Provasik Pharmaceuticals is
a medical lab where they perform...

459
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,332
gross experiments on animals.

460
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,175
What kind of animals
are we talking about? Bears, Rhinos?

461
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,699
No!

462
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,569
More like dogs, cats, rabbits,
muskrats, beavers.

463
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,378
Heck, even monkeys.

464
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,735
If we don't speak up for them, who will?

465
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,975
Right, Jussy?

466
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,613
Right, Brent.

467
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,174
Brent, can I talk to you over here
for a second?

468
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,415
Be honest, you're down with this
for the fine-ass pussy, right?

469
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,056
I'm down with this
because I love animals, stupid.

470
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,015
Even sheep?

471
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,056
Of course.

472
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,296
Sheep are beautiful creatures.

473
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,098
They are beautiful, aren't they?

474
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,732
Oh God, yes.

475
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,058
So that means you'd fuck a sheep, right?

476
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,057
What is your damage, little boy?

477
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,336
You have a sick
and twisted world perspective.

478
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,731
You're misunderstanding me,
Prince Valiant.

479
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,976
I mean if you were another sheep.

480
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,773
Would you fuck a sheep
if you were another sheep?

481
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,408
Since you put it that way...

482
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,496
you bet your ass I would.

483
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,296
I thought so.

484
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,374
This mother fucker ain't one of us.

485
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,371
He said he'd fuck a sheep.

486
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,053
Now who's stupid,
you dirty sheep fucker?

487
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,619
- What the fuck are we gonna do?
- Shut up, I'm thinking.

488
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,058
Is Hollywood near where we're going?

489
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,892
Is that where you guys are from?

490
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,731
Yeah, right.

491
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,777
Jersey represent.

492
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,652
Oh, a Jersey boy.

493
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,811
What brings you all the way out here?

494
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,339
We couldn't hang around
the Quick-Stop no more...

495
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,699
because of the restraining order.

496
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,935
Which sucks ass...

497
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,528
because it's been mine and Silent Bob's
home since we were kinds.

498
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,009
Silent Bob even busted his cherry there

499
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,255
You did?

500
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,736
I bet she was a lucky girl.

501
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,337
Fuck that fat fuck!

502
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,616
I'm trying to tell a story.

503
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,054
Sorry.

504
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,051
We were talking to Brodie...

505
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,972
and he told us about
the Bluntman & Chronic movie...

506
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,176
so we went to see Holden McNeil
and he showed us the internet...

507
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,450
and that's where we found all
those little fucking jerk-offs...

508
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,456
talking shit about us.

509
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,655
So we decided to go to Hollywood...

510
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,378
and stop the movie from getting made.

511
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,973
And now we're here.

512
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,692
I have no idea what you just said.

513
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,338
I get that a lot.

514
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,819
So, you like animals, huh?

515
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,009
Sure.

516
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,573
That's cool. Even snakes?

517
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,174
You can't exclude an animal just
because they're not cuddly.

518
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,659
Of course I like snakes.

519
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,697
How about trouser snakes?

520
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,658
What's a trouser snake?

521
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,017
What the fuck are you waiting for.

522
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,011
She went for the set-up...

523
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,778
reach in your pants
and pull your cock out, bitch.

524
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,136
Girls like that kind of shit.

525
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,611
Right here is where the angel
is supposed to show up...

526
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,054
and tell you not to pull your dick out,

527
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,774
but we bitch-slapped that mother fucker
and sent him packing...

528
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,618
so it's smooth sailing.

529
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,532
Let him rip, boy.

530
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,618
"Jesus loves the little children".

531
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,054
Sorry I'm late.

532
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,296
What's the deal?

533
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,290
Oh, shit-don't tell me you're thinking
of whipping your dick out...

534
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,809
at this fine piece of woman, are you?

535
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,449
Look over at Silent Bob and
see if he thinks it's a good idea...

536
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,611
to whip your dick out.

537
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,258
That's it. Put the dick down.

538
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,614
You got to go from heart.

539
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,568
No little perv bullshit is gonna work
for this one.

540
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,777
Be smooth. Be Don Juan De La Nooch.

541
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,213
I gotta go beat the shit out of
two sucker punching little bitches.

542
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,417
Remember- don't pull your dick out
until she asks.

543
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,896
Or until she's sleeping.

544
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,816
Don't ask.

545
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,373
So what can a smooth pimp-daddy
like me...

546
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,813
do to help the animals?

547
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,615
You really don't want to help us.

548
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,496
What are you talking about?

549
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,811
Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.

550
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,049
I mean youse guys-
I 'd do anything for youse guys.

551
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,699
Because of the lift and shit.

552
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,416
Okay. Let me talk to the other girls
and get back to you.

553
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,729
You do that.

554
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,419
I'll be right here waiting.

555
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,576
Fuck you, fatty.

556
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,419
You guys want anything from inside?

557
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,615
No, we're cool.

558
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,218
It just isn't the same, is it?

559
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,893
This place licks balls compared to
the Quick-Stop.

560
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,494
Speaking of licking balls-
how about that Justice chick?

561
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,979
She is too fine.

562
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,409
And she smells so fucking pretty.

563
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,052
She has a nice voice, too.
And that body!

564
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,613
Fucking smoking.

565
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,499
She didn't tell me to fuck off once
when I was talking to her...

566
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,491
or pull out the pepper spray.

567
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,335
You know,
lunch box-she could be the one.

568
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,294
- Smooth move, Justice.

569
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,893
- Nice going, four eyes.

570
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,089
Why did you let that stoner throw Brent
out of the van?

571
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,450
If I had to listen to one more of
those stupid songs...

572
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,218
I was gonna throw him out myself.

573
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,813
We needed Brent.

574
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,339
He was our patsy, remember?

575
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,814
We'll just find someone else.

576
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,090
Besides, I didn't see you try to
stop Jay from throwing him out.

577
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,057
I didn't want to blow our cover.

578
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,818
Cover? You all hated his songs, too.

579
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,055
Not as much as I hate you.

580
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,051
We have a very simple gang.

581
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,216
I'm the brains, Chrissy's the brawn
and Missy's the tech girl.

582
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,213
But lately I'm can't figure out
what you're doing here.

583
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,052
Your name doesn't even fit
the rhyme scheme.

584
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,329
Since you let our patsy slip away...

585
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,014
you have to convince the little kid
and the fat guy to take his place.

586
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,057
They've gotta break into Provasik now.

587
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,772
You'll do it or you're out of the gang.

588
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,891
Just use the little one's crush on you
to convince him...

589
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,415
since he's so fucking in love with you.

590
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,059
Jay? No, he's not.

591
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,209
Am I blind?

592
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,779
He wasn't kissing your hand
in the van...

593
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,732
like he was Lord Byron?

594
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,135
Maybe he has manners?

595
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,817
You ever had your asshole licked
by a fat man in an overcoat?

596
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,973
We've got about two hours
before we get to Boulder.

597
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,772
That'll give you plenty of time
to work on him.

598
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,412
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Why the fuck not?

599
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,491
Because he's just so innocent.

600
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,570
Look at him.

601
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,498
Who's it gonna be?

602
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,053
Him or us?

603
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,700
Steal a monkey? No problem.

604
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,652
It's not stealing a monkey.

605
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,129
It's liberating it. It's-

606
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,574
Wait a second.

607
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,968
Did you say "no problem"?

608
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,056
Yeah, we steal monkeys all the time.

609
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,097
Right, lunch-box?

610
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,137
It's not like it's a bad thing.

611
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,256
It's for a good cause.

612
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,536
It's for the best cause, mon cheri.

613
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,690
The cause of love.

614
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,173
Snoogens.

615
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,529
What the heck is that?

616
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,254
- What?
- Snoogens, I believe.

617
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,694
What the fuck do you think it means?

618
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,731
It means I'm kidding.

619
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,010
That's too bad.

620
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,331
I can't believe I'm gonna get some
pussy for stealing a monkey.

621
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,289
If I'd known that earlier...

622
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,213
I'd have been stealing monkeys
since I was seven.

623
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,979
Don't, mother fucker-
don't you ruin this for me.

624
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,131
Me and Justice
are gonna get married some day...

625
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,136
so don't be giving me no look like
we ain't gonna steal the monkey.

626
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,932
I'm Morris Day, you're Jerome, bitch!

627
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,459
Don't forget that.

628
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,692
That girl- that girl is in love with me

629
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,379
They're gonna do it.

630
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,529
Good.

631
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,611
They do their part and we'll do ours.

632
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,415
Remember- we meet back here
when you're done.

633
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,890
Are you sure you're okay with this?

634
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,733
Sure as I am that you're the hottest
bitch I've ever seen.

635
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,168
Easy...

636
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,012
What's twisting this bitch's tit?

637
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,337
Maybe it's because women don't
like to be called bitches, Jay.

638
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,218
They don't?

639
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,938
How about "fine piece of ass"?

640
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,175
How about not.

641
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,739
What the fuck am I supposed
to call you?

642
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,612
Something sweet, you big goof.

643
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,374
Something nice.

644
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,496
Boo-boo kitty fuck?

645
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,289
Okay, that's a start.

646
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,336
Jay, before you go...

647
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,929
could you say something into the camera
about the clitoris?

648
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,290
- You are such a bitch!
- Shut up, Justice.

649
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,014
She's a little embarrassed.

650
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,449
We're making a documentary for
a human sexuality class...

651
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,418
and we need a male perspective
on the clitoris.

652
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,059
The female clitoris?

653
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,414
Yeah.

654
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,933
Jay, you don't have to do this.

655
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,208
It's cool.

656
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,412
There's a few things
I could say about the clit...

657
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,969
that I'd like you to hear.

658
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,535
I am the master of the clit.

659
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,497
Remember this fucking face.

660
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,292
Wherever you see clit,
you'll see this fucking face.

661
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,939
I make that shit work.

662
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,613
No one rules the clit like me.

663
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,730
Not this little fuck.

664
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,976
None of you little fucks out there.

665
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,256
I am the clit commander.

666
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,490
When it comes down
to business this is what I do.

667
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,811
I pinch it like this-
Oh, you little fuck.

668
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,895
And then I rub my nose-

669
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,620
Awesome. Knock 'em dead, tiger.

670
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,610
I will.

671
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,690
Girls.

672
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,698
Do you think I could get a little kiss
for good luck?

673
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,215
Do you think I could get
a little blow job for good luck?

674
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,050
No. Go.

675
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,978
Get off my Kool-Aid, mother fucker.

676
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,172
Jussy, come on.

677
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,930
- Are they in?
- You could say that.

678
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,059
Time to shine. Let's go.

679
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,254
You are so gay.

680
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,495
Once we get upstairs
I want complete silence.

681
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,811
Missy whipped this up-
it counts our decibel level.

682
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,692
If it goes into the red- alarm,
we're dead.

683
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,972
So that means not even
the slightest noise, you got that?

684
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,215
Got it.

685
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,809
Justice, move your ass.

686
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,733
Check this shit out, lunch-box.

687
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,929
Animal tranquilizers.

688
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,779
This shit fucks you up- like percosets.

689
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,691
Keep this, so later me and Justice
can shoot each other with it...

690
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,130
and fuck like stoned test-bunnies.

691
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,613
Suzanne.

692
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,176
Boo-yah.

693
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,654
Holy fuck! The little stoner was right!

694
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,213
Boom-box.

695
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,816
I can't believe it.

696
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,497
Months of planning...

697
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,059
and it's all blown by a fart.

698
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,130
We can't just leave them here.

699
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,972
That alarm will bring the cops
any minute.

700
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,653
That's always been the plan.

701
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,179
They take the heat off us long enough
'til we can get out of town.

702
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,613
Ka-boom! You little stoner fucks.

703
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,492
Let's go!

704
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,128
What are you looking at?

705
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,374
There ain't no snacks here.

706
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,537
We got what we came for.

707
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,219
Let's get outta here.

708
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,616
I know it's sad.

709
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,771
But what are we supposed
to do about it?

710
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,618
Justice, open the door!

711
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,815
Oh, shit!

712
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,572
Drop the bag-now!!!

713
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,051
Justice!

714
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,891
You mind if I lean that there?

715
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,659
My, oh my, oh my.

716
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,536
Who let the cats out?

717
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,690
Wait-is that-??

718
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,572
Excuse me, who the hell are you?

719
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,535
Federal Wildlife Marshall.

720
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,736
This investigation is now
under my jurisdiction.

721
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,577
Really? Why is that?

722
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,493
Because someone let a whole mess of
animals out of their cages, sir.

723
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,252
We believe that was just
a diversionary tactic used...

724
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,173
to call attention away from
the real heist at the Diamond Exchange.

725
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,609
Yeah, right.
That's a believable scenario.

726
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,969
Sounds more like something out of
a bad movie.

727
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,137
The Provasik people say
they've rounded up all their animals...

728
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,178
except for one-an orangutan.

729
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,051
The most dangerous animal known to man.

730
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,539
Sir,
this was just delivered to the station.

731
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,053
What is it?

732
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,016
It's a tape from the terrorists who
claim responsibility for the break-in.

733
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,971
Do you have a VCR?

734
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,692
I am the clit commander.

735
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,299
Oh, my God!

736
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,333
Blafsky, it's Willenholly.

737
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,298
I need you to get me on
the national news, pronto.

738
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,098
Why?

739
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,898
Because we may be dealing with...

740
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,096
the two most dangerous men on
the planet.

741
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,939
This is Jussy's monkey.

742
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,256
Justice died for you,
you little monkey fuck!

743
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,294
Do something, tons of fun.

744
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,095
Is that thing waving at us?

745
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,213
It understood us.

746
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,175
Maybe it's some kind of supermonkey?

747
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,053
You're my bitch!

748
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,135
You get my back.

749
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,495
Don't go taking
this fucking chimp's side.

750
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,769
What if there are more
super monkeys up at that lab?

751
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,096
Maybe they're making an army of
them up there?

752
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,979
Holy shit!

753
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,335
Maybe it's a conspiracy,
like in the "X-Files"...

754
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,208
Roswell style?

755
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,699
This little monkey can be
the fucking damn dirty apes

756
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,972
responsible for fall of
the human race

757
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,212
and this world got mad
we won't spank the monkey

758
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,575
The monkey will spank us.

759
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,209
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

760
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,610
Eaten alive.

761
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,930
Then these monkey fucks
will start wearing our clothes...

762
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,699
and rebuilding the world in their image

763
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,328
And only those...

764
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,660
as super smart as me will be left alive
to bitterly cry...

765
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,049
You maniacs!

766
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,494
Damn youse!

767
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,892
God damn youse all to hell!

768
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,691
Not on my watch, mother fucker.

769
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,095
Die, you super-monkey fuck!

770
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,134
Alright, you can live. For now.

771
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,536
You see that shit. Bitches love me.

772
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,050
Let's get something to eat.

773
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,093
We ain't hiding in the woods no more.

774
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,459
We gotta get to Hollywood.

775
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,778
Besides, we're in the clear.

776
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,492
It's not like anyone knows
we stole the monkey.

777
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,049
I'm Reg Hartner with an exclusive
News Now bulletin.

778
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,418
A Provasik animal testing facility
in Boulder was the focus of an attack

779
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,219
by a terroristic primate rescue
syndicate calling themselves...

780
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,975
The Coalition for Liberation of
Itinerant Tree Dwellers...

781
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,375
or simply C.L.I.T.

782
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,650
In a videotape sent to
authorities this morning...

783
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,970
credit for the liberation of
an orangutan from the lab last night...

784
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,059
is taken by these men, identified
in literature that accompanied the tape

785
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,337
as Jay and Silent Bob.

786
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,456
In this chilling clip, they make it
very clear that they...

787
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,498
are in control... of the C.L.I.T.

788
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,459
We are the C.L.I.T.
None of you are safe.

789
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,815
Now tremble before
my remorseless leader.

790
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,250
I am the clit commander.

791
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,375
Terrifying.

792
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,970
Here to help us explain this footage...

793
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,455
is Federal Wildlife
Marshall Willenholly.

794
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,059
Marshall, thanks for joining us.

795
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,053
At this point, what can you tell us
about the C.L.I.T?

796
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,933
From the intelligence we've been
gathering, we've discovered...

797
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,689
that the C.L.I.T. Is actually
a tiny offshoot of the L.A.B.I.A.

798
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,458
The Liberate Apes Before
Imprisoning Apes movement.

799
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,058
Exactly.

800
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,738
The two men that you saw in the video

801
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,615
go by the obvious code names
of Jay and Silent Bob.

802
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,289
If anyone out there should come
across them or any other Clitties...

803
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,735
please exercise extreme caution.

804
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,056
I told you that restraining order
was a good idea.

805
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,170
What response do you hope to elicit...

806
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,695
by putting this kind
of pressure on the C.L.I.T?

807
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,055
It's a difficult situation.

808
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,454
You don't want to rub the C.L.I.T.
The wrong way.

809
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,215
Nights like this,
I miss dating a lesbian.

810
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,215
Is that your cell phone, sir?

811
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,895
Blavsky, give me a frigging break.

812
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,776
I'm on my way.

813
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,129
We've got them. They're in Utah.

814
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,737
Citizens of Utah, stimulation of
the C.L.I.T. Is not recommended.

815
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,495
Your plan worked.

816
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,732
The news is all about Jay
and your C.L.I.T.

817
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,453
With almost no mention of
the diamond heist.

818
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,013
I told you those two
were the perfect patsies.

819
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,175
Don't you have any regret?

820
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,813
Jay and Bob don't deserve this.

821
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,976
They were really sweet.

822
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,897
The only thing I regret is not gutting
that trout-mouthed prick...

823
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,699
like a fish and playing twister
with his vitals.

824
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,735
I don't get you, Justice.

825
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,050
You used to be all about
this girl stuff.

826
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,056
Stealing, boning, blowing shit up.

827
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,017
Now you're this little priss
with a conscience.

828
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,493
It's really a fuckin' drag.

829
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,893
We all have to grow up sometime.

830
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,654
If moping around over some boy
you're crushing on is growing up...

831
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,380
then pass me my Wonder-Woman Underoos.

832
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,533
Marvelous Pizza coming through.

833
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,577
You the gals who ordered the pizza?

834
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,173
This dopey bitch ordered a large plain,

835
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,935
but I could go for some hot,
thick Sicilian.

836
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,379
No charge, lady.

837
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,529
Hurry.

838
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,248
I'm sorry, Jay.

839
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,051
Justice died trying to save this monkey

840
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,619
so maybe we should keep it around.

841
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,690
They way...

842
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,936
we could honor her memory.

843
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,456
Now ain't you glad we came here to eat?

844
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,532
And you were all scared we'd get busted
by the cops or something.

845
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,209
You know what I say?

846
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,330
Fuck the Police.

847
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,054
Fuck-Fuck-Fuck the Police!

848
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,216
Yo, fuck-fuck the Police!

849
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,693
Yo, fuck-fuck the Police!

850
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,179
Yo, fuck me!

851
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,615
This is the Utah State Police.

852
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,296
Boys, we know you're in there.

853
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,735
Come on out with your hands in the air

854
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,693
and surrender the orangutan.

855
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,777
Think they're talking about us?

856
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,050
Sorry. Don't shoot. Hold your fire.

857
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,729
Who the hell are you?

858
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,493
Federal Wildlife Marshall.

859
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,689
Is the monkey in there?

860
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,372
The ape.

861
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,057
What?

862
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,733
Orangutan is a member of
the great ape family.

863
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,611
It's not a monkey.

864
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,611
Who's the Federal Wildlife
Marshall here?

865
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,895
Me or you?

866
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,049
That's what thought.

867
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,055
Can I use your-

868
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,973
Jay and Silent Bob-
Your C.L.I.T. Doesn't stand a chance.

869
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,899
Anyone not harboring a fugitive monkey
in there should hit the deck.

870
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,175
We are going to open fire.

871
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,649
What are you waiting for?

872
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,333
Get out there and give them the monkey.

873
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,372
Maybe it ain't so bad at that lab?

874
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,058
Maybe they experiment on them...

875
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,097
by making them fuck a bunch of
different good-looking monkeys?

876
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,415
We don't know.

877
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,289
You stay out of this,
you weepy little chimp.

878
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,770
Fuck, you're the guy
who makes the blueprints.

879
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,255
I don't have the fucking smarts of
a little...

880
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,413
kid.

881
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,774
Do not shoot!

882
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,931
We're just trying to take our son
out of this hostile environment.

883
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,379
Their son?

884
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,973
Maybe they're one of those gay couples?

885
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,931
Yeah, we're gay.

886
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,692
And this is our adopted love child.

887
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,259
We're not from around here.

888
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,731
Don't makes us go back to
our liberal city home...

889
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,336
with tales of prejudice
and bigotry from the heart of Utah.

890
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,934
This is the last thing I need.

891
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,289
Uppity homosexuals shooting
their mouths off to the...

892
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,135
liberal media that the Federal Wildlife
Office persecutes gays.

893
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,291
Are you fucking crazy?
They may be gay...

894
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,336
but that's not their son-
that's the ape!

895
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,809
I think I would recognize an ape
if I saw one.

896
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,056
And the only thing
I do recognize right now...

897
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,337
is a political fiasco that
I'm about to avoid...

898
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,809
by letting
this butt-fucking Brady bunch go.

899
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,650
You are free to leave, sirs.

900
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,413
Yes, you, sirs.

901
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,779
So we can just go?

902
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,571
Yes, sir.

903
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,174
Please accept my apology for
detaining you and your...

904
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,730
unorthodox but constitutionally
protected family unit.

905
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,138
Un-fucking-believable.

906
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,009
I might add, that is one fine
looking young boy you're raising.

907
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,732
That's because he's from my sperm.

908
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,172
K knocked up this hot,
woman friend of ours...

909
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,695
who fuck on the side so as not to be
all-the-way gay.

910
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,932
But my tubby husband-
He's one hundred percent queer.

911
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,419
He loves the cock.

912
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,257
He certainly looks insatiable.

913
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,454
Bye-bye.

914
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,055
It's not my way, but I'll be damned
if that isn't one happy family.

915
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,735
Alright, gang-let's just shoot
some tear gas into the diner...

916
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,329
and when the guys come out
with the monkey-

917
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,819
Fuck beans!

918
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,128
That was them, wasn't it?

919
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,177
I said you love the cock.

920
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,254
I have to be the craftiest
mother fucker alive.

921
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,774
Flee, fat-ass, flee!

922
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,292
Head for the sewer!

923
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,249
You fat fuck!

924
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,370
Fire a warning shot
into his bulbous ass.

925
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,290
Suck it in. Think thin!

926
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,459
One rectal breach coming up.

927
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,692
Suck it in!

928
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,298
Incoming!

929
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,768
Just like Winnie the Pooh.

930
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,655
That was an incredibly daring escape.

931
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,899
Here's the deal.

932
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,334
You and your men stay up here.

933
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,100
When I corner him, I'll call for backup.

934
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,216
I'm counting on you, Sheriff.

935
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,015
You've taught me so much.

936
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,296
Fuck this asshole.

937
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,054
Let's go back to the station and
cornhole us a drunk.

938
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,139
The whole fucking 
world's against us dude...
I swear to God.

939
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,056
Put the monkey down and your hands up!

940
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,813
Let's go, misters.
You want to get shot?

941
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,612
I didn't think so.

942
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,499
She doesn't want to go back to the lab.

943
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,094
And for the record...
I ain't gay.

944
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,490
And for the record,
while we're on the subject...

945
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,049
I knew that wasn't a real little boy.

946
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,493
For one more record- he loves the cock.

947
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,177
On your knees, Texas Pete.

948
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,096
Let's go.

949
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,730
You see- he's lining us up like
fucking circus seals.

950
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,416
I'm going first.

951
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,616
I don't want a mouth full of
monkey spit...

952
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,054
if I gotta blow this G-man.

953
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,249
What are you talking about?

954
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,536
No one's gonna get blown here-

955
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,174
Shit!

956
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,659
These guys are good. Very good.

957
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,572
Hey, law-dog.

958
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,250
See you in Hell, cock-smoker.

959
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,973
Oh, Fuck me.

960
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,094
Get the fuck off her-
that's my ex-girlfriend's monkey.

961
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,058
Hey, that monkey don't belong to you.

962
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,018
Who the fuck just steals a monkey?

963
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,569
Oh, yeah.

964
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,650
This blows.

965
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,493
We have one more day to stop
these fucks from shooting this movie.

966
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,970
They took the one thing I had left
from the one woman I loved enough...

967
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,250
not to stick my hand down her pants.

968
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,495
Go after the monkey?

969
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,093
How do we know where that car is going?

970
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,450
Don't just point.

971
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,616
What, you gotta take a shit?

972
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,209
No, you gotta take a salad.

973
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,014
What the fuck are you trying to say?

974
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,256
Say it!

975
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,130
Don't make me ask twenty questions.

976
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,178
You could always tell that
stupid Amy story all the time...

977
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,053
but you can't spit out
"Jay, I disagree," or...

978
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,216
"those are some good cheese fries".

979
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,898
Just fucking say it!

980
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,100
The sign on the back of the car...

981
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,814
said "Critters of Hollywood"...

982
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,813
you dumb fuck!

983
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,568
Say it, don't spray it.

984
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,935
And might I add, that is
one fine-looking boy you are raising.

985
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,934
If it isn't the wildlife expert.

986
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,298
Your office faxed this over.

987
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,135
The guy said it was a post from
an internet chat board...

988
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,375
signed by a Jay & Silent Bob.

989
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,535
"All you mother fuckers are gonna pay."

990
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,254
"You are the ones who are ball lickers"

991
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,092
"We're gonna fuck your mothers
while you watch and cry..."

992
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,492
"like little bitches.
Once we get to Hollywood, we're-"

993
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,419
They're going to Hollywood.

994
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,376
It's not like cheating.

995
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,019
Justice blew up.

996
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,015
Here's the plan.

997
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,256
First we find out
where they're shooting this movie.

998
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:54,776
And after we bust that shit up,
we can start looking for the monkey.

999
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,095
But before we do any of that,

1000
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,091
we gotta find a mother fucker
in the know.

1001
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,488
Someone like the Mayor of Hollywood.

1002
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,979
Crack. Want some crack.

1003
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,095
Get you high.

1004
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,932
No, but do you want some weed?

1005
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,253
Are you on the job?

1006
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,014
Yeah. Jersey local 404.

1007
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,208
Pumpkin Escobar, Los Angeles local 305.

1008
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,694
- What up?

1009
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,179
- Man, it's a small world.

1010
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,455
Let me ask you a question.

1011
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,690
You dudes getting medical out
there in Jersey?

1012
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,334
No.
We might have to strike in September.

1013
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,298
Norma Rae like a mother fucker.

1014
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,290
Maybe you can help us out?

1015
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,212
You know where they're shooting
a movie around here?

1016
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,177
You ask me a question like that
in Holly-weird?

1017
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,059
You got to come a little
more specific than that.

1018
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,050
It's a Miramax flick.

1019
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,175
We gotta bust it up...

1020
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,052
so people stop calling us names
on the internet...

1021
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,579
even though they're not really
talking about us...

1022
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,419
but characters based on us,
and at the same time...

1023
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,697
find my ex-girlfriend's, who was killed
in a car explosion, monkey.

1024
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,050
Man, I don't know what the fuck
you just said, little kid...

1025
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,211
but you're special.

1026
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,529
You reached out...

1027
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,055
and you touched a brother's gear.

1028
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,889
I'm gonna give you some directions.

1029
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,936
Give me the map, Scott.

1030
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,609
Give me the map, Scott!

1031
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,249
You know where Miramax is?

1032
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,899
Miramax accounts for 78%
of my business out here.

1033
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,216
Is Hollywood ready for
Jay and Silent Bob?

1034
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,013
A source at a Federal Wildlife
Marshall's office tells us...

1035
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,018
that a posting was pulled off
an internet movie chat board...

1036
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,530
allegedly written by
the two domestic terrorists themselves.

1037
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,009
It's sending a shock-wave
through Hollywood.

1038
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,255
Jules Asner is on the scene at
Miramax Studios. Jules-

1039
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,969
Steve, the tenor of Tinsletown is
one of terror today...

1040
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,660
after the Federal Wildlife Marshall's
Office has learned that...

1041
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,210
hot new terrorists Jay and Silent Bob
have targeted Miramax studios...

1042
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,055
for their next campaign of blood,
violence and monkey theft.

1043
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:45,138
In a posting pulled off of Movie
Poop-Shoot. Com...

1044
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,732
the gruesome two-some threatened,
and I quote...

1045
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,819
"Once we get to Hollywood and find
those Miramax expletive deleted..."

1046
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,931
"who are making the Bluntman &
Chronic movie..."

1047
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,574
"we're gonna make them eat
our expletive deleted..."

1048
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,218
"then eat their expletive deleted
which is made up of..."

1049
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,816
"our expletive deleted that
we made them eat." Unquote.

1050
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,931
So far we've been unable to
get a statement...

1051
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,539
from anyone here at the Studio.

1052
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,373
But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?

1053
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,569
None whatsoever.

1054
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,930
But to be fair, no one is a
hundred percent sure...

1055
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,050
what Jay and Silent Bob
exactly look like...

1056
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,375
so for all we know they could
already be on the lot.

1057
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,293
OK, he's got a pass.
Let him in.

1058
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,613
We gotta play this just right.

1059
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,731
You don't have a pass!

1060
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,692
I hate how fake Hollywood is.

1061
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,535
Where do you think you're going?

1062
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,257
Echo base, I've got a 1007-
Two unauthorized on the lot.

1063
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,614
Requesting back-up.

1064
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,213
I thought that was a 1082.

1065
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,371
No, sir,
a 1082 is disappearing a dead hooker...

1066
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,053
from Ben Affleck's trailer.

1067
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,135
Oh, that Affleck.

1068
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,449
Back-up on the way.

1069
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,655
I'll make you a deal.

1070
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,209
This guy will suck your
dick off if you let us go.

1071
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,654
Contrary to what you believe...

1072
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,573
not everyone in the industry
is a homosexual.

1073
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,089
How about this deal?

1074
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,415
He'll suck my dick while you
watch and jerk-off?

1075
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,170
Alright.

1076
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,210
Make it fast-and sexy.

1077
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,049
It's either this or jail.

1078
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,213
And you know
what they do to you in jail.

1079
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,935
I was a guard.

1080
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:14,575
And after it's all over you say,
"Ooh, what a lovely tea party."

1081
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,819
What the fuck you waiting for, bitch?

1082
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,339
Start sucking.

1083
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,170
Worth a shot.

1084
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,217
Like a shot in the fucking mouth,
you gay bitch.

1085
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,530
Dude,
you were gonna really suck my dick.

1086
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,259
Remember what I said.

1087
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,136
Do not look at Ben or Matt directly
in the eyes or you will be fired.

1088
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,097
Does everybody understand that?

1089
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,488
Thank you.

1090
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,531
You frosted your hair.

1091
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,176
Yeah, I frosted my hair,
but it looks good.

1092
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,528
This has got to be the Bluntman flick.

1093
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,696
There are those two fucks
from the Mork movie.

1094
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,776
Lips-Teeth time or Lion Face?

1095
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:22,576
Lion face! Lemon face!

1096
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,729
Break it down.

1097
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,578
Where we taking it from, Gus?

1098
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,410
I'm busy.

1099
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,939
You're a true artist, Gus.

1100
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,095
Let's just take it from
"it's a good course".

1101
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,129
You're the director now?

1102
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,130
Shove it, "Bounce"-boy.

1103
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,050
Let's remember who talked who...

1104
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,938
into doing this shit in the first place

1105
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,539
Talking me into "Dogma" is one thing,
but-.

1106
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,295
I'm sorry I dragged you away from
whatever gay serial killers...

1107
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,371
who ride horses and like to play golf

1108
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,172
touchy-feely picture
you're gonna do this week.

1109
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,256
I take it you haven't seen
"Forces Of Nature".

1110
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,057
You're like a child.

1111
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,050
What do I keep telling you?

1112
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,654
You gotta do the safe picture-
then you do the art picture.

1113
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,378
And then sometimes you have to
do the payback picture...

1114
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,451
because your friend says you owe him.

1115
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,092
Then sometimes you have to
go back to the well.

1116
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,698
And then sometimes you do
"Reindeer Games."

1117
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,816
That's just mean.

1118
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:06,769
All we gotta do is figure out
how to get closer to them.

1119
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,531
Get over here.

1120
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,576
You stand here,
your buddy's right here.

1121
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,173
Just stand here and react.

1122
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,695
Don't say anything. Especially you.

1123
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,057
That's pretty funny.

1124
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,296
Lock it up, people,
we're going for picture.

1125
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,209
Make it happen, guys.

1126
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,529
- Get you fucking hands off me.

1127
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,815
- Fuck off!

1128
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,737
On the count of three,
we rush these fucks and...

1129
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,259
beat the shit out of them,
because if they're all fucked up...

1130
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,733
they can't make that movie.

1131
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,133
Ready? One... two... three!

1132
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,656
"Good Will Hunting Il: Hunting Season."
Scene 16 Take 5.

1133
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,131
Think about the paycheck.
OK.

1134
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,969
Action, Gus?

1135
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,533
Jesus, Ben, I said I'm busy.

1136
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,815
I do remember the class.

1137
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,175
But elementary.

1138
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,898
I remember that class.

1139
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,574
It was just between recess and lunch.

1140
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,970
Are we gonna have a problem- again?

1141
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,649
I was still just hoping you might
be able to give me a little insight...

1142
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,890
into the Southern Colonies.

1143
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,179
Wood says...

1144
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,773
What did I say?

1145
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,050
You'd be back in here
regurgitating Gordon Wood.

1146
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,060
But you forget about Vickers.

1147
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,812
No, I just read Vickers.

1148
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,339
So I'm up on "Inherited Wealth".

1149
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,493
But you're no longer the angry,
brilliant, young mind you once were...

1150
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:37,375
just itching to vent your frustrations.

1151
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,735
You stopped hitting the books
with a vengeance...

1152
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:44,889
and now I've read shit you haven't
even heard about yet.

1153
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,254
Face facts, my friend.

1154
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,490
You're just no longer that good...

1155
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,695
Will Hunting.

1156
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,299
Now how do you like them apples?

1157
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,735
I don't like the sound of them apples,
Will.

1158
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,339
What're we gonna do?

1159
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,091
- Chuckie-

1160
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,415
- Yeah?

1161
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,417
Chuckie- it's hunting season.

1162
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,579
Apple sauce, bitch.

1163
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,372
Sorry to interrupt, but we've
got a 1007 on our hands.

1164
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,019
Oh, Jesus. Again, Ben?

1165
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,289
Bullshit!

1166
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,371
Cause I wasn't with a hooker today.

1167
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,296
There they are!

1168
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,130
Affleck,
you were the bomb in "Phantoms".

1169
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,891
Alright, you bastard,
let's see who you really are.

1170
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,491
Fucking Miramax! Cut!

1171
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,568
Shannen, usually I say "Cut".

1172
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,093
A monkey, Wes?

1173
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,296
You guys aren't even trying anymore.

1174
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,971
The market research
says people love monkeys.

1175
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,573
We love this monkey.

1176
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,979
See.

1177
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,533
Here they are.

1178
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,052
Punch it!

1179
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,689
Fuck!

1180
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,337
Those are some magical guys.

1181
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,338
Dude, I fucking knew it.

1182
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,210
You love that shit, don't you?

1183
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,097
Holy shit, that I looked like it hurt.

1184
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,091
Are you guys alright?

1185
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,493
Let's get you guys on your feet.

1186
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,173
Wait a second- aren't you the guy
that fucked the pie?

1187
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,931
You see, man - you see!

1188
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:02,052
It's never, "Hey, you were in
Loser, weren't you?"

1189
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,899
Or "Dude, you rocked in Boys And Girls"

1190
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,500
It always comes back to
that fucking pie. I'm haunted by it.

1191
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,332
- You put your dick in a pie.
- Enough!

1192
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,409
I'm Jason Biggs.

1193
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,731
Did you really get to 3rd base with
that Russian chick like in the movie?

1194
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,295
You mean Shannon?

1195
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,250
No.

1196
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,734
She is fucking fine.

1197
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,931
If I was you, I would've been like-

1198
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,056
You like that?

1199
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,450
What, you never did one of these?

1200
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,697
I've done plenty of that, my friend.

1201
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,050
Holy shit, you're the Dawson.

1202
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,812
James- James Van Der Beek.

1203
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,056
What's up with Pacey stealing
Joey away from you?

1204
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,216
If I was you, I would have
drowned his ass in the creek.

1205
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,373
Yeah, for Joey. She is too fine.

1206
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,491
Ever get to 3rd base with her?

1207
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,692
There was this one time- Wait a minute,
who are you guys?

1208
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,049
They're our stunt doubles, dumb ass.

1209
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,529
- Right?

1210
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,418
- Of course.

1211
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,653
Stunt doubles for what?

1212
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,811
For the move that we're shooting
in about fifteen minutes.

1213
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,658
Bluntman & Chronic Strike Back.

1214
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:12,050
You're doubling me, obviously,

1215
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,973
I'm playing Bluntman, A. KA. Silent Bill

1216
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,453
- Bob.
- Right.

1217
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,770
And he's playing Chronic.

1218
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,459
A. KA. Ray.

1219
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,655
Jay. Fuck!

1220
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,413
Biggs, did you even read the script?

1221
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:24,257
There's a script?

1222
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,734
Hey, pie-fucker,

1223
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:28,738
you would only last a day on
"The Creek".

1224
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:30,737
Wait second, we'll be right back.

1225
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,214
Fuck you and your "Dawson's Crack".

1226
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,018
Go to hell, Pacey.

1227
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,615
These are the fucks that are playing us

1228
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,772
You take 'em out, bam!, no movie.

1229
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,130
Useless little ape.

1230
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,258
What's with the weird,
gay huddle going on over there?

1231
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,569
Let me put my arm over yours.

1232
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,729
What's gay about it?

1233
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,975
It's two guys talking in a corner.

1234
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,137
Why are you such a homophobe?

1235
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,695
You're always like "That's gay,"
or "Look at that gay huddle..."

1236
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,009
"look at that gay dog."

1237
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,010
Dude, that is so gay-

1238
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,368
Yeah, see.

1239
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,134
- I love gay people.

1240
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:03,937
- I'm sure you do.

1241
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,051
Look at the monkey.

1242
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,972
Now you're gonna tell me
the monkey's gay.

1243
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,330
How do you know
he doesn't smoke monkey pole?

1244
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,575
He's so cute.

1245
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,419
You go in there and start swinging,
don't stop until these young...

1246
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,933
Hollywood fucks are out of commission.

1247
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,208
Ready? Break!

1248
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,057
That's one funky monkey.

1249
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,810
Mr. Biggs, Mr. Van Der Beek,
this is Security.

1250
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,050
There are two intruders on the lot.

1251
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,211
They crashed through a window
we believe might be yours.

1252
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,377
Yeah, they're in here.

1253
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,333
Do they have you held hostage?

1254
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,733
Should we call your publicist?

1255
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,497
No.

1256
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,174
We kicked those guys assess bad.

1257
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,296
Real bad.

1258
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,018
Great job, sirs.

1259
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,937
If you'll let us in,
we'll take over from here.

1260
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,257
No,
me and Jason Biggs are naked in here.

1261
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:59,052
Butt-naked. Together.

1262
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:05,172
Okay. Well, we'll wait out here
until you clean up.

1263
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,694
How are we gonna get out
without them seeing us?

1264
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,290
You've got the wrong guys.

1265
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,257
Doesn't anybody watch the WB?

1266
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,978
I'm a teen idol, dammit!

1267
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,169
Don't you recognize me?

1268
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,779
Look at me.

1269
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,173
I'm the pie-fucker!

1270
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,898
In prison, he'll be the pie.

1271
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,688
This was a good idea, lunch-box.

1272
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,219
In these outfits...

1273
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,534
we're totally incognito.

1274
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,179
Mr. Biggs, Mr. Van Der Beek-

1275
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,018
Great, you've changed costumes already.

1276
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,095
Let's get you to the set.

1277
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,579
The director doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

1278
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,174
Look at all these crackers.

1279
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,059
70 million dollars
and I can't even get a black grip.

1280
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,011
It's a shame. It's a damn shame!

1281
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,699
Here's your coffee, sir.

1282
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,932
- You spit in this?
- I didn't spit in it.

1283
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,328
Any boogers in it?

1284
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,689
There's no boogers in it, sir.

1285
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,929
You went to film school, didn't you?

1286
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:11,177
Must piss you off to see a black man
run a big production like this.

1287
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,778
Go to the school.

1288
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:17,131
Does your daddy know that
you give a nigger his coffee?

1289
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,779
It would kill him, wouldn't it?

1290
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,172
- There's no boogers in it, sir.
- Ten taste it!

1291
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,210
Taste the booger flavor.

1292
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,574
I know it's in there.

1293
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:27,411
It's all good, sir.

1294
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,615
No it ain't all good.

1295
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,689
Clean that shit up.

1296
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,094
Get me a white boy.

1297
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:34,730
Get me a blond haired,
white boy so I can enjoy that shit.

1298
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,378
- You're the man, sir.

1299
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,491
- No, you're the man
and that's the problem.

1300
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,689
Chaka-I'm Banky Edwards,
the creator of Bluntman & Chronic.

1301
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,055
We met a few weeks back.

1302
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,534
I'm the executive Producer.

1303
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,895
Oh, you're the Executive Producer.

1304
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:49,813
Why don't you executive produce me
a latte- de-crackernated.

1305
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,055
Okay, Fuck it?

1306
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:51,692
- It's Banky.

1307
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,253
No, its' Fuck it!

1308
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:55,536
I just want you to know that
I respect your work as an artist.

1309
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,133
I 'm something of an artist myself.

1310
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,813
I was the inker on the comic book.

1311
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,533
You're a tracer, okay?

1312
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,133
Nobody got the heart to tell you.

1313
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:02,618
You trace.

1314
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:03,337
You go around the lines.

1315
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,013
You are a tracer!

1316
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,459
You think Fat Alber had a tracer?

1317
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:07,092
No.

1318
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,813
Bill Cosby did the whole thing
with a roller.

1319
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,089
And it was excellent.

1320
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,729
Crack, crack, cracker?

1321
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,373
Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the set,
Chaka.

1322
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,819
I don't see them!

1323
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,011
Where are the stars of
this piece of shit?

1324
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,539
Damn, this must've set them back
a couple hundred bucks.

1325
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:42,658
Look at this.

1326
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,619
A gay hood ornament
and the color purple.

1327
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,610
Who the fuck are you?

1328
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,371
Who the fuck am I?

1329
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,053
I'm the director, Chaka Luther King.

1330
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,135
That's who the fuck I am.

1331
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,090
Wait a second.

1332
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,739
I though Banky and Holden
created this shit.

1333
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,213
And I 'm stealing it.

1334
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:56,052
I'm taking it back for the black man...

1335
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:59,411
to make up for all the shit you
mother fuckers have taken from us.

1336
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,810
Do you know that I came up for
the idea for "Sesame Street"?

1337
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,578
I came up with it before PBS.

1338
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,809
The white man stole it.

1339
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,978
I was gonna call it
NWP- Niggers With Puppets.

1340
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,898
Catchy, ain't it?

1341
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,254
Enough of this small talk.

1342
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,250
Let's shoot.

1343
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,095
Aren't you gonna direct us?

1344
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,216
I will start directing you to the
unemployment line...

1345
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,137
if you don't stop back-talking me,
cracker.

1346
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:20,730
We don't know what we're doing.

1347
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,690
We didn't read the script.

1348
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:22,491
It ain't hard.

1349
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,378
I film the mother fucker.

1350
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,609
Then I yell "Cut!"

1351
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,055
And run the fuck out of here
and go to my trailer...

1352
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:31,929
cause I got more white girls there than
the first lifeboat on the Titanic.

1353
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,618
And they all want a party in my movie,

1354
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,452
and I got just the part for them.

1355
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,530
So are you ready to do this?

1356
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,258
Let's roll with the new.

1357
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,970
Quiet on the set, everyone.

1358
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,811
I got your new coffee sir, booger-free.

1359
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,132
You guys look pretty bad-ass.

1360
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:52,494
"Bluntman & Chronic Strike Back",
scene 37, take 1.

1361
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,176
What're you waiting for?

1362
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,534
Action!

1363
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:08,410
Um... snoochy-boochies.

1364
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,817
What the fuck?

1365
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,696
You thought I'd never find
your precious Bluntcave...

1366
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,936
did you, Hemp Knight?

1367
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:32,258
But now, you and your sidekick...

1368
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:36,452
are finally
in the grasp of Cock-Knocker!

1369
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,409
Why do they call you Cock-Knocker?

1370
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,332
Actually,
there's a funny story behind that.

1371
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:45,772
You're gonna love it.

1372
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,089
True story.

1373
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,937
Avenge me... Hemp-Knight.

1374
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,209
I think George Lucas
is gonna sue somebody.

1375
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:07,051
Any last words before I bust
your balls, Bluntman?

1376
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,735
Duck, pie-fucker.

1377
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,379
Damn, these white boys can't fight.

1378
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,251
Don't fuck with a Jedi master, son.

1379
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,939
Yo! Bitch-fists!

1380
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,731
Call me Darth-balls.

1381
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,968
Good Lord.

1382
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,534
That wasn't in the script.

1383
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,135
So this is Hollywood?

1384
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:55,088
Then lights, camera, action,
Jay and Silent Bob.

1385
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,291
Freeze, you terrorist sons of bitches!

1386
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,970
...My God...

1387
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:11,368
Sorry, everyone.

1388
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,814
That was supposed to be a warning shot.

1389
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,976
I'm obviously on the wrong set.

1390
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,413
Is he gonna be okay?

1391
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:19,936
Not good.

1392
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,489
You are not upstaging me, Van Der Beek.

1393
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,816
This movie's gonna make "House Party"
look like "House Party 2".

1394
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,970
- Or "House Party 3".

1395
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,089
- Shut the fuck up.
- Yes, sir.

1396
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,253
Chaka, call off Dawson, will you?

1397
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,651
Can I get a "cut!" here?

1398
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,169
Not again.

1399
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,136
Now who's balls have been busted, bitch

1400
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:04,969
That's it! I'm out of here.

1401
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,453
Chaka, I'll be in my trailer.

1402
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,136
What the fuck?

1403
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,336
The C.L.I.T. Stops here,
Jay and Silent Bob.

1404
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,371
Another white boy in this movie? Damn!

1405
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,979
Federal Wildlife Marshall.

1406
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,578
Everyone stay cool.

1407
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,412
Go back to making your adult movie.

1408
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,178
These men are the leaders of
a terrorist organization...

1409
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,296
wanted for the abduction of
a little monkey.

1410
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,018
They didn't really steal that monkey.

1411
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,132
It was just a diversion so
that we could steal these.

1412
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,528
And they're not the leaders of
the C.L.I.T.

1413
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,059
The C.L.I.T. Is not real.

1414
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,176
Oh no, the C.L.I.T. Is real.

1415
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,369
It's real.

1416
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,969
It's the female orgasm- that's the myth

1417
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,414
You know what I 'm talking about?

1418
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:40,049
Are you guys alright?

1419
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,330
I thought you blew up,
Boo-Boo Kitty-fuck.

1420
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,060
You remembered.

1421
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,455
It was a frame-up, Jay.

1422
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:51,738
Missy, Sissy, Chrissy and I
are international jewel thieves.

1423
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,089
We were setting you up to be a patsy...

1424
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,377
but I couldn't go through with it
because I...

1425
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,495
because I love you.

1426
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,057
Yeah?
That means you're gonna fuck me, right?

1427
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:00,771
Of course.

1428
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,456
If she does
it'll be considered necrophilia.

1429
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,451
Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.

1430
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,216
Jussy, did we get you at a bad time?

1431
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,729
You should've just let these guys
go down.

1432
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,373
I wanted to go down,
but this angel popped on my shoulder...

1433
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:14,899
and said "Listen" and I was like
"What's up?"

1434
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,051
Shut the fuck up before I shoot you
where you stand...

1435
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,699
in you pansy red booties.

1436
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,138
Holy shit,
I am wearing pansy red booties.

1437
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,052
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

1438
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,768
Let's have those diamonds, Justice.

1439
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,254
I can't do that, Sissy.

1440
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,729
Then lover-boy gets one
in the fucking brain.

1441
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,895
Yo! Lovely ladies!

1442
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,732
Would any of you like
a private audition to be in my movie.

1443
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,532
Bring that ass over. C'mon!

1444
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,049
Cray crackers with guns.

1445
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,653
Time to get my black ass outta here.

1446
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,614
You really let me down, Justice.

1447
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,288
Throwing it all away for a little
stoner with bad pronunciation.

1448
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,615
What's it gonna be, Sissy?

1449
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,055
Which fighting style do you want me
to kick your ass in?

1450
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,499
Are you kidding me?

1451
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:13,974
I taught you all your moves myself.

1452
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,250
There's no style you can bust
that I can't defend against.

1453
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,138
You're no match for my Shaolin Monk.

1454
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,972
But I'll bury you
with my Crouching Tiger.

1455
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,328
A little Venus Fly-trap?

1456
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,060
I'll counter with Dragon Queen.

1457
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,614
How about a little "Bitch, my man
ain't your baby's daddy"?

1458
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:27,735
Bring it on.

1459
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,898
I hope one of them rips off
the other one's shirt...

1460
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:38,052
and we see some titties flopping
around in the air.

1461
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,811
Mr. Biggs, Mr. Van Der Beek-
I just wanted to say hi. I'm-

1462
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,248
Banky-fucking Edwards!

1463
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,411
Just the mother fucker we came to see.

1464
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:49,048
What the fuck are you guys doing here?

1465
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,053
Why the hell are you shooting at me?

1466
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,050
Two reasons.

1467
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,331
One- we're walking-taking
bad girl clichs.

1468
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,252
And two- because you're a man!

1469
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,458
Only on the outside.

1470
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,937
Stop the movie? Are you crazy?

1471
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,818
All these assholes on the internet
are calling us names...

1472
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,812
because of this fucking stupid movie.

1473
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:14,375
That's what the internet is for-
slandering others anonymously.

1474
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,657
Stopping the flick
isn't gonna stop that.

1475
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,129
This isn't fair.

1476
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,097
We came to Hollywood, I fell in love.

1477
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,694
We stole a monkey, we got shot at...

1478
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,175
and I got punched
in the motherfucking nuts...

1479
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,376
by a guy named Cock-knocker.

1480
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,610
I feel for you boys, I really do.

1481
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,736
But Miramax - you know, Miramax films...

1482
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:39,374
paid me a shitload of money for
Bluntman & Chronic.

1483
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,532
So it occurs to me that people
bad-mouthing you on a website...

1484
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,578
is none of my fucking concern!

1485
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,657
Oh, but I think it is.

1486
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,817
We had a deal with you on the comics-
for likeness rights?

1487
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,897
And as we're not only
the artistic basis

1488
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:57,539
but also the character basis...

1489
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,975
for your intellectual property,
Bluntman & Chronic...

1490
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,898
when said property was optioned
by Miramax films...

1491
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:05,653
you were legally obliged to
secure our permission...

1492
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,095
to transfer the concept
to another medium.

1493
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,455
As you failed to do that, Banky...

1494
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,616
you are in breach of
the original contract.

1495
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,094
Ergo, you find yourself...

1496
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,929
in a very actionable position.

1497
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,168
You guys are gonna ruin my movie career

1498
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,450
We want something
for our mental anguish.

1499
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,491
Tell you what-
we'll settle this monetarily.

1500
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,173
I'll give you half of what I make.

1501
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,170
Half?

1502
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:30,931
Half's not good enough?

1503
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,812
Fine. I'll give you two thirds.

1504
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:34,294
Fuck you, you already said half.

1505
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:36,291
You can't take it back.

1506
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:37,449
Done.

1507
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,336
Your shit is so tired, Justice.

1508
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:49,619
Call me Boo-Boo-Kitty-fuck... Bitch!

1509
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,408
Hello? Truce?

1510
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,818
I think I killed both of them.

1511
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,728
I am an excellent marksman.

1512
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:09,730
I've always-

1513
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,049
C'mon, you guys, it's over.

1514
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,053
Are you alright, Boo-Boo-Kitty-fuck?

1515
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,296
I was just about to jump in
and get your back.

1516
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,051
The cops!

1517
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,772
We gotta get out of here.

1518
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,378
I'm tired of running.

1519
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,260
Marshall... are you awake?

1520
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,612
Wake up.

1521
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:39,614
My God! I'm paralyzed.

1522
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:42,340
That monkey shot me in the ass
and paralyzed me.

1523
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,575
Oh, sweet irony!

1524
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:46,331
You're not paralyzed.

1525
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,458
It was just a tranquilizer.

1526
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,252
Jesus.

1527
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,096
Tranqued by a little monkey.

1528
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,933
My friends in the Bureau will
never let me hear the end of this.

1529
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,458
You have friends in the FBI?

1530
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,690
They all made it in
but I failed the exam.

1531
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,494
Why else do you think I became a
Federal Wildlife Marshall?

1532
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,979
I'll tell you why, because I'm a joke!

1533
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,413
Maybe not.

1534
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,972
I can make you a deal
that'll get you into the FBI...

1535
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,533
regardless of test scores.

1536
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,898
What kind of deal?

1537
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:18,016
You get the charges dropped
against Jay and Silent Bob...

1538
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,493
and say you never found the ape.

1539
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,696
In exchange I will give you
the diamonds we stole...

1540
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,817
and turn in Missy, Chrissy,
Sissy and myself.

1541
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,493
But I want a reduced sentence.

1542
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,412
You'd be willing to do that?

1543
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:34,093
For him, I'd be willing to do anything.

1544
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:43,411
I'm a international jewel thief
who's facing a jail sentence.

1545
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,651
That's alright.
I'm a junkie with a monkey.

1546
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,731
If I go to prison will you wait for me?

1547
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,134
I don't know.

1548
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,291
Will you fuck me when you get out?

1549
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:58,611
Don't change the subject.

1550
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,338
Will we fuck when you get out?

1551
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,013
Snoogens.

1552
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:12,369
There's a lot of love in the room.

1553
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:16,290
Regardless of what you may here heard,
I do not kiss guys.

1554
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:17,935
Okay.

1555
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,095
Play it cool, hotshot.

1556
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,528
Sorry, Justice. We have to go.

1557
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,174
And stop stealing monkeys.

1558
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,096
- Fuck you!

1559
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,773
- Fair enough.

1560
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,179
Wait for me.

1561
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:40,693
What? Here?

1562
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:56,170
Well, boys- you're rich, in love-

1563
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,249
You're in love-

1564
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,098
And to top it off
you've got your own monkey.

1565
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,177
What more could two guys from
Jersey possibly want?

1566
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,056
To have these fucks stop talking
shit about us on the internet.

1567
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,091
What've I been telling you?

1568
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,818
There's not much you can do
to stop that.

1569
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,978
Short of showing up at their house
and beating the shit out of them.

1570
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:23,448
All the money we're making could
buy a lot of plan tickets.

1571
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:29,937
Yeah?

1572
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:33,058
Do you post as Magnolia Fan
on Movie Poop Shoot. Com?

1573
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,933
Yeah!

1574
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:39,735
Did you write
"Fuck Jay and Silent Bob."

1575
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:42,329
"Fuck them in their stupid asses"?

1576
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,172
Yeah, a while ago. So?

1577
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:57,618
On Movie Poop Shoot.com did
you say Jay and Silent Bob are...

1578
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,294
quote, "fucking clown shoes
and if they were real...

1579
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,491
"I'd kick the shit out of them for
being so stupid"?

1580
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,974
- Yeah.
- Really?

1581
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,368
That's right. That's it.

1582
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:37,249
Right. That's right.

1583
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,172
That's beautiful, man.

1584
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:03,490
That was worse than Clash Of The Titans

1585
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,651
I can't believe Judy Dench played me.

1586
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,812
Remind me to renew
that Restraining Order.

1587
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:09,492
Why?

1588
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,691
I am gonna blast that
flick on the internet tonight.

1589
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,500
Why can't Hollywood ever makes
a decent comic book movie?

1590
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,025
Tell me, Steve-Dave.

1591
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,379
Would you stop saying that?

1592
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:20,293
That was just another paean
to male adolescence...

1593
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,052
and its refusal to grow up.

1594
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,609
Yeah, sis,
but it was better than Mall Rats.

1595
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:27,578
At least Holden had the good
sense to keep his name off of it.

1596
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,971
Why wouldn't Miramax option his
other comic instead?

1597
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:34,570
The one with you and him
and your relationship.

1598
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,696
Chasing Amy?

1599
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:38,618
That would never work as a movie.

1600
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:40,975
I'm so fucking embarrassed.

1601
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,294
Honey, you should be.

1602
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,410
They took your characters...

1603
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:46,048
and turned them into one
90-minute long gay joke.

1604
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,778
It was like watching Batman
and Robin again.

1605
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:51,052
Thank, that means a lot coming from
the guy who pretends be "Shaft"...

1606
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:53,574
as opposed to the guy who takes shaft.

1607
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,770
I don't hear you complaining nightly.

1608
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,970
I don't get out to the movies much,
but I have to say...

1609
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,614
Bluntman & Chronic was blut-tastic.

1610
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,094
Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

1611
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,615
Don't make me shoot you, Justice.

1612
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,894
The party's across the street featuring
the greatest band in the world...

1613
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,408
Morris Day and the Time.

1614
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,772
I...

1615
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:34,811
I... I been watching you.

1616
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,329
I think I want to know you.

1617
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,053
I said... Im a little dangerous.

1618
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:45,496
Girl I'd love to show you...

1619
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:48,618
my jungle love.

1620
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,771
I'd be like, "What, you don't know
fucking Jay and Silent Bob...

1621
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,540
the fucking mack-daddies of
fucking Jersey"?

1622
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,736
And she'd be like "Oh, I read on
the internet that you guys..."

1623
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:06,090
"are a couple of little fuck-holes!"

1624
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,817
I got a bear skinned rug.
Y'all sing it.

1625
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,570
I got a fireplace. I can't hear you.

1626
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,131
We're all the way live in L.A.

1627
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,168
Oh, the things I could do to you.

1628
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:46,336
END
