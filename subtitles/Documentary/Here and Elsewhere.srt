1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,528
<i>Have you ever had a secret...</i>

2
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,692
<i>... that you couldn't</i>
<i>live with keeping?</i>

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,337
<i>And you think about it so much...</i>

4
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,808
<i>... you begin to think</i>
<i>that people can tell your secret...</i>

5
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:25,675
<i>... just by looking at you?</i>

6
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,784
<i>Hi, this is Janet.</i>

7
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:41,828
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>
<i>Leave a message. </i>

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,364
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

9
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:47,867
<i>Hey, sweetie.
It's been a long time.</i>

10
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,630
<i>That's okay, though.</i>

11
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,502
<i>I know we'll talk when you're ready.</i>

12
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:55,405
<i>You've always done things</i>
<i>at your own speed.</i>

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,411
<i>Ever since you were a little baby.</i>

14
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:02,950
<i>I guess I still think of you that way.</i>

15
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:06,007
<i>Well, you just give a call when</i>
<i>you're ready. I'll be waiting.</i>

16
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,211
<i>Deleted.</i>

17
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:53,286
You should stop smoking.

18
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:56,750
It makes me mysterious.

19
00:03:56,858 --> 00:04:01,386
It makes you all wrinkly,
and your breath smells like ass.

20
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:05,226
You are such a Girl Scout.

21
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,268
They should give you
the Golden Virgin Merit Badge.

22
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,280
- What's up, Sarah?
- Hey, Chris.

23
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,975
Where's Jillian at?

24
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:26,553
She's in back.

25
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:28,781
Hey, J, come on out a sec!

26
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,983
J, I want to talk to you!

27
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,525
Hey, hey!
There's no shouting in here.

28
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,555
What a life.

29
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:38,154
Isn't there a bag of reefer
someplace with your name on it?

30
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,233
Jillian, would you get out here?

31
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:42,167
I can't get any work done
with these guys...

32
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,794
Just stand still.

33
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:48,035
Ooh, Mr. P.
I love a man who takes control.

34
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:49,268
Seriously, J,

35
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,504
is there anything with two legs
that you <i>wouldn't</i> rub up on?

36
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:54,275
Yeah, Billy. You.

37
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:02,712
What do you want, Billy?

38
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:05,952
Oh, I just came by to, uh,
invite you to a little party

39
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,324
that we're throwing tomorrow night
over at Chris' garage.

40
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:09,453
You should come, too.

41
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,322
Ooh.

42
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:15,493
A group grope
at the garage... classy.

43
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:18,003
Well, you always liked them before.

44
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:19,698
When I was younger.

45
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,707
I've grown up.
I'm more mature now.

46
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,208
Huh.

47
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,609
Well, something on you
has definitely matured.

48
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:31,918
Too bad that's not the case
with your little dick.

49
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,715
Ooh!

50
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,346
That's funny.
I never heard you complain.

51
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:37,890
I didn't have time.

52
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,960
You know what, J?

53
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:41,187
I just came by to be nice...

54
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:44,924
...you know, show you
no hard feelings.

55
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:50,801
But you are being such a bitch.

56
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:54,102
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

57
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,279
Seriously, you could be
a little nicer.

58
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,334
You are so gonna get fired.

59
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,139
<i>Sarah?</i>

60
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:34,177
Your mom called,

61
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:37,547
and she said that she has to work late
and you should pick up dinner.

62
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,517
Again?

63
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:42,918
Yeah. Thanks.

64
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,822
To parents...

65
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:52,955
What?

66
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:55,994
You want some?

67
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:58,264
Come on.
Don't be such a pussy.

68
00:06:58,372 --> 00:06:59,430
Leave her alone.

69
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:11,847
So, do you want to go?

70
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:12,885
To what?

71
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,750
The garage?

72
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:16,881
Why?

73
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,721
Oh, my God!
You're into Chris?

74
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:23,429
Take it from me... you don't
want to hang with those guys.

75
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,463
You do.

76
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:25,827
I know how to handle them.

77
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,332
So come with me, then.

78
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,062
Protect me.

79
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,797
I can't.

80
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:33,271
I have a previous engagement.

81
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:36,571
I thought you were done
with local boys.

82
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:37,439
Who is it?

83
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:41,111
My cyber-boyfriend.

84
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,682
Come on. Cut the shit.
Who is it?

85
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:45,548
Seriously.
We met on the Internet.

86
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,681
- Ser... Jillian?
- What?

87
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,356
You've got to step into the future.

88
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,518
There's like
50 million people doing it.

89
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,961
Besides, the local talent pool
is way too fucking shallow.

90
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:59,362
- Still...
- "Still" what?

91
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,697
Are you afraid I'm gonna end up
like Janet Melville?

92
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:03,632
Just vanish one night,

93
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:06,206
leaving the Goshen soccer moms
without their favorite babysitter?

94
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:09,572
The Goshen soccer moms
would be psyched if you left town!

95
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:11,603
Yeah. No shit, right?

96
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:14,647
It'd be safe
to let their sons out again.

97
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:32,389
What is this about?

98
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,195
Could we use the computer
at your place?

99
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:37,032
Well, we can, but Big Brother's
gonna be watching.

100
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,038
You don't have a brother.

101
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,074
I mean my mom put this spyware
on the computer that...

102
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:43,769
Screw that.

103
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:49,338
Wait a minute.

104
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:51,884
I think we have our answer.

105
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:54,316
No, Jillian. Don't.

106
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:55,650
Don't be so weird. Don't...

107
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:56,381
Hey!

108
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,422
<i>Jasper!</i>

109
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:58,851
Come here.

110
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,657
Time to take one for the team.

111
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,227
Hello, ladies.

112
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:11,202
We're having
some technical difficulties.

113
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:13,273
Let me take a look at that.

114
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:18,367
Oh, yeah.

115
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:21,243
Yeah, you can't log onto this site
with the library computers anymore.

116
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:22,145
Why not?

117
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,741
Some parents' group
created all this drama over it

118
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:27,286
and said it was like
a grocery store for child molesters.

119
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:29,549
You know,
"too much mature content."

120
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,884
But I bet... you have the password.

121
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:33,790
Well, of course.

122
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,859
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

123
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:37,191
Look, I could get fired.

124
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:40,126
Come on, Jas. Please?
Just this once?

125
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,828
Please?

126
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:46,504
You can't tell anyone.

127
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:52,511
There. And please, don't let
anyone see what you're doing.

128
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:53,944
Thanks, Jas.

129
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,310
Yeah, thanks, Jas.

130
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,417
Oh! Excuse me.

131
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:58,917
<i>You're so...</i>

132
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,612
<i>You're such a bitch.</i>
No, he doesn't.

133
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,348
What? He so totally does.

134
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,686
Trust me, all right?
I have a knack...

135
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,852
...for men.

136
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,930
Okay, if that's
what you want to call it.

137
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:11,794
What are you looking at?

138
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:12,888
Nothing.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,194
Bullshit.

140
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,306
- Oh, my God! Is that you?
- Shh!

141
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:23,434
Holy shit! That <i>is</i> you!

142
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:25,478
- Jillian, what are you doing?
- <i>Would you keep it down?</i>

143
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,206
You look like such a slut!

144
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,782
What the fuck?
Would you keep it down?

145
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,180
Are you even wearing anything?

146
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:31,444
Sort of.

147
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:33,782
Oh, my God! That's crazy!

148
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,480
Oh, please. This is nothing.

149
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,524
I've seen pictures of guys,
like, totally grabbing their dicks

150
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,116
and chicks like showing their bush.

151
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,457
Dude, why are you doing this?

152
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:44,690
I told you.
To meet men.

153
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,030
Well...
It looks like it's working.

154
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:49,295
What is this?

155
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:51,200
You love to snowboard?

156
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:54,069
I would if I had the chance.

157
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:55,972
Besides, men don't care
if you lie to them,

158
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:58,568
as long as they like
the lie that you're telling.

159
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:00,907
Oh, my God.
Look at this guy.

160
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:04,746
The "dumb show"? Yeah, he hits
my inbox like a couple times a week.

161
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,181
And that, seriously,
doesn't freak you out?

162
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,051
All these random guys
can just look at you half-naked.

163
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:10,418
That's the point.

164
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:13,253
Besides, it's not
like they know who I am.

165
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:15,386
And once you spend
enough time on this thing,

166
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,761
you can tell pretty quickly who's
being real and who's just a player.

167
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:21,969
- Oh, come on.
- Come on. I'm bored.

168
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:23,331
Want to get out of here?

169
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:26,065
- No. I have to train.
- Oh.

170
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:27,037
You want to come?

171
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,472
Um...

172
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:31,977
Track star...

173
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,240
...porn star.

174
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,747
No way.

175
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:57,937
<i>Hey, hon.</i>

176
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:01,273
What a day.

177
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,106
What's for dinner?

178
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:06,770
From the Point.

179
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,782
Penguin Point.

180
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:16,385
How was your day today?

181
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,185
It was fine.

182
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,790
Sarah...

183
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:23,056
...I know I haven't been
around a lot recently,

184
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:25,962
but as soon as this case is finished,
I'm gonna have more time.

185
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,864
Mmm-hm.

186
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,901
Speaking of which...

187
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:37,273
I have to finalize my travel plans
for the deposition next week.

188
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,312
You sure you're gonna be okay
staying by yourself?

189
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,904
Mom, I'll be fine.

190
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,920
Your father said he could take you.

191
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:50,556
Dad's, like, three hours away.

192
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,558
I'm old enough to take care of myself.

193
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,256
I guess that's what scares me.

194
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,715
<i>Oh, you and Chris</i>

195
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:22,846
<i>make such a cute couple.</i>

196
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:32,625
What's going on?

197
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:35,167
Batty Patty Melville strikes again.

198
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:38,830
So, I was thinking, you know,
just in case she stopped by

199
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:41,134
to have one of those
things she loved,

200
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,301
one of those...
oh, whatchamacallem... those...

201
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,640
Malteds, Patty.
She liked the malteds.

202
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,475
Yeah, the malteds.
She loved those.

203
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:51,142
Anyways, I thought maybe if you put
one next to the register when she...

204
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:55,552
Janet hasn't been in here
in over 5 years.

205
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:56,884
Yeah.

206
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:02,223
Anyways, I, I, I just thought
just in case she gets a craving...

207
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:05,229
...if you put one...
- All right. All right. I'll take it.

208
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,924
But then you have to go!

209
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:20,036
What's wrong with her?

210
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:23,048
Losing a child
does things to a person.

211
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,280
If you ask me, the booze did it to her
a long time before that.

212
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:30,289
Oh, my. I've got to get
back to the bank.

213
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,018
So soon?

214
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:37,993
Honey, I'll see you tonight.

215
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:39,531
Here, will you get rid of this thing?

216
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,294
That picture always
gives me the creeps.

217
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,029
La, la, la la!

218
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:14,396
- Candi! I want to use the computer!
- Good afternoon, Ma'am.

219
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:15,399
My name is Margaret,

220
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:18,266
and I'm a certified
lifestyle counselor with Endura Life,

221
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:21,398
a company dedicated
to enhancing your everyday life

222
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:23,476
with all-natural herbal products.

223
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:24,976
According to our database,

224
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,015
you've expressed interest in our
Megaboost Bust Enhancement...

225
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:33,316
And fuck you, too,
you flat-chested bitch!

226
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,785
We want to use the computer.

227
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,389
How many times do I got to tell you

228
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:41,427
not to come charging in here making
your noise when I'm on the phone?

229
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:42,495
We want to use the computer.

230
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,389
And I want a daughter
who can follow a few simple rules,

231
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:50,902
but don't look like neither one of us
is gonna get what we want.

232
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:54,896
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

233
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,704
Hold on there a second, Sunshine.

234
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,143
We've got a little matter
of last month's phone bill to discuss.

235
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:03,276
Don't you roll your eyes at me.

236
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,819
You went over $300 last month
on text messages.

237
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:12,187
What in the fucking world do you
have to say that is worth $300?

238
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:13,419
I've got lots of stuff.

239
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:15,518
Well, I've got lots to say about that!

240
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,688
Every penny
you spend on that phone

241
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:20,926
is a penny that don't go
towards our bills.

242
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,299
My disability
only goes so far, Jillian.

243
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:26,066
Well, then stop watching
all them pay-per-views.

244
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,900
I make my own money!
I pay my own bills! So fuck you!

245
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,001
You ungrateful little bitch!

246
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:38,248
Hello. Endura Life.

247
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:42,083
This is certified lifestyle counselor
Margaret speaking.

248
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,831
Did you read my journal, you beast?

249
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:59,804
<i>I tried,</i>
<i>but your handwriting is for shit!</i>

250
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:02,273
She's such a fucking bitch.

251
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:03,410
I hate her.

252
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,273
I hate it here!

253
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:08,405
Fuck it! I just...
I, I fucking hate it.

254
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:20,489
It's such a fucking dump.

255
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:34,231
You want to know a secret?

256
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,384
Is this my old suitcase?

257
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:50,119
Found it in the trash.
I figured you didn't need it.

258
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:51,452
What do you need it for?

259
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:53,788
Getting out.

260
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,896
Going elsewhere.

261
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,633
As in anywhere else but here.

262
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:13,002
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It sucks here.

263
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:17,209
What do you know
about sucks, Girl Scout?

264
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:23,418
You've got a great home.
Your mom's great.

265
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:29,021
You're set.

266
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,796
How do you get that stuff, anyway?

267
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:04,624
Same as everyone else.

268
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:07,097
It's my mom's.

269
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:12,264
It's "medicinal,"
for her "disability."

270
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:17,066
Yeah, what exactly <i>is</i> her disability?

271
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:21,446
It changes a lot.

272
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:26,247
What is that?

273
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:29,914
Is that new?
Oh, come on. Let me see.

274
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:31,782
What is that?

275
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,561
It's like a totally hard-core,
goth-rocker snake.

276
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:40,229
- I think it's cool as shit.
- Where did you get it?

277
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,069
Did you steal it?

278
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:47,333
No.

279
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:49,500
It was a present.

280
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,204
From who?

281
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:56,575
Oh, come on! Don't give me
any of that "secret admirer" bullshit!

282
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,207
What?

283
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:01,811
Fuck. Fine, suit yourself.

284
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,721
What's his name?

285
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:07,986
I call him "Mr. X."

286
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:10,993
- What?
- Gross!

287
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:14,067
Well, if I knew all about him, he
wouldn't be a very "secret" admirer.

288
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,464
Do you know anything about him?

289
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:17,560
He's romantic.

290
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,269
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

291
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,070
What are you girls doing tonight?

292
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:25,667
- Nothing.
- Really?

293
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:30,113
Looks like we're doing
a little drinking and...

294
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:34,679
...smoking contraband.

295
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,949
- It's medicinal.
- What's your disease?

296
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,422
Stupidity?

297
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:42,257
All right.
Both you girls on your feet.

298
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:44,125
We're going to the station.

299
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,634
Take it easy, Patrick.

300
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,459
Do I know you?

301
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,798
Not yet.

302
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:54,601
But I know you, Officer Gunshow.

303
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:00,505
Nice tattoo.

304
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:05,042
Now, let me see if I remember...

305
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:08,984
You only listen to classic rock
'cause Emo's for pussies,

306
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,580
<i>Point Break</i> is your favorite movie,

307
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:17,494
and you think my body
is so freakin' hot.

308
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:19,429
Right.

309
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:26,798
Well, maybe we can
make this problem go away.

310
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:29,273
Really? What did you have in mind?

311
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:32,471
An arrangement.

312
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:33,944
An arrangement?

313
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:39,518
Exchange a night in you
for a night in jail.

314
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:53,832
Gross!
I don't think so.

315
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,698
No, I have a better idea.

316
00:21:57,804 --> 00:22:00,773
You forget you ever saw us here,

317
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:03,968
and I'll forget to tell Kathy
about your "exchange"

318
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:06,635
when I see her tomorrow.

319
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:18,716
I'm gonna let you two off
with a warning.

320
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:24,928
I'll be watching you.

321
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:33,530
I live for my fans, Pat!

322
00:22:56,963 --> 00:22:58,225
Hi, Mr. Tod.

323
00:22:58,331 --> 00:22:59,559
Oh, hi.

324
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,928
Looking sharp today.

325
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:04,830
Well, thank you.

326
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,240
- Oh, excuse me.
- Bless you.

327
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:10,036
Oh, yeah, thanks.

328
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:12,839
That's, uh, strong perfume
you have on there.

329
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,041
It's Negligence.

330
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:15,978
Do you like it?

331
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,574
Daddy's allergic to smelly things.

332
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:22,212
Cigarette smoke, cheap perfume.

333
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,311
Huh, Daddy?

334
00:23:23,423 --> 00:23:26,221
Well, if the Lord had wanted us
to smell like flowers,

335
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:28,988
he'd have given us petals.

336
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:31,630
I think we'd better go, don't you?

337
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:33,359
- Yep. All set.
- Okay.

338
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:35,628
Where are you going?

339
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:38,671
Oh, every year we rent a cabin up
at the lake with my uncle's family.

340
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,433
You should come up sometime.

341
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,632
You'd really love it.

342
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:45,838
Oh, yeah. We have
lots of room and bunk beds. It's nice.

343
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:48,671
Okay.

344
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:55,583
Lucky.

345
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,418
You get to be bunkies
with the mole girl.

346
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:59,515
Yeah, shut up.

347
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,116
Maybe her daddy will tuck you in.

348
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,423
You're twisted.

349
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:07,196
Oh, man.

350
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,168
This place is so dead.

351
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,068
Will you close up without me?

352
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:13,935
I want to go get ready.

353
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,339
For what?

354
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:19,503
Oh, right.

355
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:23,105
Tonight's the big night, and
that's why you're wearing perfume.

356
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:25,650
It's his favorite.

357
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:26,684
Come on.

358
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:30,313
Come on! Let me go!
Please?

359
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:34,325
- Okay, fine. Fine.
- Thank you. Thank you.

360
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:38,955
Oh... And a piece of advice...

361
00:24:44,704 --> 00:24:47,969
don't.

362
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:52,977
Oh, and one more thing...

363
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,078
What is this for?

364
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:58,708
<i>So that he'll ask you</i>
<i>to go for a walk.</i>

365
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:29,714
Spare us some change
to prevent teenage delinquency?

366
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:34,186
Well, thank you for your support.

367
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:45,255
Hey, Chris.

368
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:47,731
Hey.

369
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,098
Hey, Sarah.
What's going on, girl?

370
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:52,330
- You're looking good tonight!
- Thanks!

371
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,066
Yeah, I almost didn't even come.

372
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,438
Well, I am glad you did.

373
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:58,340
You can never have enough
hot chicks at a party, right?

374
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:02,012
Especially around here.

375
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:05,209
Some of the girls in this town
make the livestock look tempting.

376
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,718
- Have another beer, Jonas.
- Don't mind if I do.

377
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:11,484
Cheers!

378
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,426
What's that fool doing here?

379
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,054
Hey!

380
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:22,532
Hey, Ass-per!
What's up?

381
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,570
Did you bring your, uh,
Computer Club buddies with you?

382
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:25,797
No. No, I didn't.

383
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:29,034
Did you bring your brain,
Cro-Magnon?

384
00:26:30,143 --> 00:26:32,202
Yeah. Hey, cheers.

385
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:37,848
Uh, what are you gonna be,
like, a junior this year?

386
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:38,645
Senior.

387
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:40,947
Senior. Nice.

388
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:43,545
So, does that make you, uh, legal?

389
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:47,625
That depends.

390
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:48,659
On what?

391
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:52,292
On what you want to do.

392
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:59,870
Uh...

393
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,270
...let's go for a walk.

394
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:21,456
All gone.

395
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:26,462
I can give you some of mine, but I
never share my beer on the first date.

396
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,431
First date?

397
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:31,299
Well, I invited you,
you came.

398
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:33,634
Sounds like a date to me.

399
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,437
You want to know why I invited you?

400
00:27:37,544 --> 00:27:39,842
Because I think you're
the best-looking girl in town.

401
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:41,174
Come on!

402
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:42,908
Seriously.

403
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:48,648
You're much better-looking
than all your friends. No doubt.

404
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,206
Come on!

405
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:15,909
Your hands are cold.

406
00:28:16,016 --> 00:28:19,042
Then let's warm them up.

407
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:21,010
Come on!

408
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,383
- You'll like it.
- Stop.

409
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:23,513
I promise.

410
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:25,113
Like what?

411
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:25,953
The party?

412
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,289
It's fuckin' raging, isn't it?

413
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:29,794
Get out of here, Ass-per.

414
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:31,921
Hey, hey.
And where are your drinks?

415
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:33,431
You want to share mine?

416
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,101
Sorry.

417
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:42,074
This is way too much work
to get laid.

418
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,434
...fucking manipulated!

419
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:48,742
You like seeing mad in me?
You're fucking evil!

420
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:50,941
And I'm fucking worth it!
Fuck you!

421
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:52,848
You know what?
I actually gave a fuck about you!

422
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:54,613
I actually cared about you!

423
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,746
You're fucking begging me!

424
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:58,016
J...

425
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,755
You want to be a fucking bitch, huh?

426
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:04,590
Listen to me.
Look at me, look at me.

427
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:05,487
Look at me.

428
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:06,565
What the fuck
are you gonna do, huh?

429
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:09,065
Oh!
- Asshole!

430
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:12,138
Ouch. Oh, what was that about?

431
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:14,331
Hey, why did you run off like that?
Are you okay?

432
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:15,066
Oh, yeah.

433
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:18,269
Ugh!
- I'm fine.

434
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:20,846
Um...

435
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:22,812
...thank you.
Thank you for doing that.

436
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:24,440
Yeah, sure. No problem.

437
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:20,529
<i>Shh, shh, shh.</i>

438
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:43,153
You are such a Girl Scout.

439
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:46,096
...a child does things to a person.

440
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,839
<i>Hi. You've reached the bitch.</i>

441
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:33,174
<i>Leave it at the beep, freaks.</i>

442
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:42,652
Hey, Sarah.

443
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:43,983
Tell your friend when she wakes up,

444
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,356
she doesn't get paid for the day
if she doesn't work.

445
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:00,201
<i>Hi. You've reached the bitch.</i>

446
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:03,036
<i>Leave it at the beep, freaks.</i>

447
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:15,080
<i>That's right.
It was the best.</i>

448
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:18,282
<i>The manufacturers</i>
<i>have decided to make this...</i>

449
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:21,952
What the hell do you want?

450
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,631
<i>... 7 or 8,000. Not 5 or 6 or 4.</i>

451
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:28,701
<i>Not even 3,000.</i>
<i>Can you guess how many?</i>

452
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:32,938
<i>This edition is gonna</i>
<i>be limited to only 2,500.</i>

453
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,633
<i>That's right. Those 2,500...</i>

454
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:39,769
You looking for Miss Sunshine?

455
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,744
Well, she sure as hell ain't here!

456
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:47,176
Hasn't been around here
since Friday.

457
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:48,754
Figured she was holed up
at your place.

458
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:50,823
Always seemed to prefer it anyways.

459
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:54,455
So you don't know
where she is at all, then?

460
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:59,055
Don't know. Don't care.

461
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,358
She sent me a message...

462
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:06,234
"I'm fine. Don't bother coming
looking for me," or some such shit.

463
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:10,900
Couldn't even bother to speak
to me herself, the little... bitch.

464
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:17,809
Mind shutting that door?
You're putting a glare on the tube.

465
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:23,913
Next time you talk
to that little tramp...

466
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:29,825
you tell her she better pray
my cable don't get disconnected.

467
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:34,090
I was talking all this shit...

468
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,532
you know, like, "Oh, I've been
paintballing for, like, seven years"

469
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:37,261
or whatever.

470
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,462
Got out there, right?

471
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:39,799
He had no clue what he was doing.

472
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:43,840
- We fucking lit him up...
- Hey, Billy?

473
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:46,207
...and he totally deserved it because
he was such a pussy, this guy.

474
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:48,405
- Hey, Billy?
- Just like "pop, pop, pop, pop"!

475
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:49,344
Billy.

476
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:53,280
What?

477
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:54,944
I want to ask you a question.

478
00:33:57,623 --> 00:34:00,683
Yeah, well, as you can see,
I'm with my customers right now,

479
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:02,021
so you have to come back
another time.

480
00:34:02,128 --> 00:34:04,653
When was the last time
you saw Jill?

481
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:05,855
You know, I don't,

482
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:07,830
I don't really keep track
of the bitches. Sorry.

483
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:10,999
Oh, and Chris called.

484
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:14,471
He said he had a <i>really</i> good time
with you on Friday.

485
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:15,905
You know, if I got
my ass kicked by a girl,

486
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:17,373
I'd probably want
to forget about it, too.

487
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:27,852
You guys want to do me a favor
and come back for these tomorrow?

488
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:29,080
Thanks.

489
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,651
So, I saw her at the party.

490
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:37,059
So what?

491
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:38,926
So, nobody's heard from her since.

492
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:42,592
Yeah, well,
I really couldn't give a shit.

493
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:43,726
Come to think of it...

494
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:47,937
...why do you?
- She's my best friend.

495
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,670
Hmm. J doesn't have friends.
She has victims.

496
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,440
Hey, you know, J always
talked a lot of mess about you.

497
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,518
Did you know that?

498
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:02,019
She said you were gonna bail out
on her the first chance you got.

499
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,645
That is so not true.

500
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:05,654
You're just pissed
because she dumped you.

501
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:07,817
Oh, ho, yeah.
For, uh, who was that?

502
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:10,862
Oh, Mr. X, her imaginary friend?

503
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:12,761
What?

504
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:15,891
Do you think you're the only one
she told that little fairy tale to?

505
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:17,560
Why would she
tell you that stuff, anyway?

506
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,898
To be a bitch.

507
00:35:20,606 --> 00:35:22,972
Look, I couldn't really
begin to understand

508
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,372
how that girl's mind works,

509
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:26,274
and I don't care to.

510
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:29,439
She's gone, and I'm glad.

511
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:49,126
Hey, Darla?

512
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:52,961
Can I show you something?

513
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:10,378
What the heck was that?

514
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:13,291
Jill sent it to me
the night of the party,

515
00:36:13,392 --> 00:36:16,418
and I haven't heard from her since.

516
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:19,965
And I know that it's not like
she hasn't taken off before,

517
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:22,591
but something really
doesn't feel right, you know?

518
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,226
I mean, we talk every day.

519
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:28,437
What about that bus?
Have you ever seen that before?

520
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:30,941
No.

521
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:36,604
She is the type, isn't she?

522
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:39,379
That goes missing?

523
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:41,385
Like Janet Melville.

524
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:42,852
But, Darla,
nothing happened to Janet.

525
00:36:42,955 --> 00:36:45,685
They just say that stuff to scare us
away from doing anything fun.

526
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:51,391
Daddy said she probably ran off with
one of those guys she was sitting for.

527
00:36:51,497 --> 00:36:53,692
He said she had a reputation.

528
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:59,495
That's why no one
bothered much to look for her.

529
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,402
<i>The mailbox belonging</i> to...

530
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:37,499
<i>the bitch...</i>
<i>is full and cannot...</i>

531
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,623
- Creepy.
- Right?

532
00:37:56,729 --> 00:37:58,754
Look at this one.

533
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:03,892
"Don't worry. Everything fine.
Call soon. Jillian."

534
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,968
Yeah, what's so weird about that?

535
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:06,095
She signs her name.

536
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:09,501
Jillian hates her name.
She never signs with it.

537
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,270
That really doesn't prove anything.

538
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:12,901
I mean, someone
could just be messing with you.

539
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:16,945
What about that bus?
Have you ever seen that?

540
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:18,482
No. No.

541
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:19,551
What does this mean?

542
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,914
I don't... I don't know.

543
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:26,621
Hold on a sec.

544
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,591
What are you doing?

545
00:38:29,695 --> 00:38:30,923
I'm decoding your message.

546
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,157
No, Jasper, we didn't write in code.

547
00:38:33,265 --> 00:38:35,563
Maybe not intentionally.
You know, Mom does this all the time.

548
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:36,828
She sends me text messages

549
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:39,131
thinking she's using
the enriched-text function.

550
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:42,341
The T9 function?

551
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:44,874
Like, when she really isn't,

552
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:46,774
so what you end up with
aren't words you can read,

553
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:48,847
but a jumble
of letters and numbers instead.

554
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:52,782
So what I would do is write down
the letter combinations...

555
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:56,651
...and then see
what words it would spell.

556
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:05,928
What?

557
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:16,336
Now do you believe me?

558
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:18,842
You've got
to go to the cops with this.

559
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:35,718
So?

560
00:39:37,196 --> 00:39:39,289
- "So" what?
- So, what do we do now?

561
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,964
We don't do anything.

562
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,537
But if her parents want to,

563
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:49,039
they can come on down and fill out
a missing-person's report.

564
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:51,803
Is her mom aware
that she's missing?

565
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:53,811
Well, she's the one
you ought to be talking to.

566
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:54,709
That's it?

567
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:59,381
What about that message?
It says, "Help me."

568
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:01,919
This is coincidence,
pure and simple.

569
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:06,182
You look hard enough, you can
see the Virgin Mary in a tortilla.

570
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:10,285
Look, you do a job like this
as long as I have,

571
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:12,193
you come to find
that good police work

572
00:40:12,298 --> 00:40:13,788
is about keeping your eyes open.

573
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,467
Your dog ends up dead.

574
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:18,867
Ask the neighbor
he kept up all night with his barking.

575
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:20,666
Money missing from the register...

576
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:24,470
ask the cashier
with the expensive new shoes.

577
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:26,670
Cause and effect.

578
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:30,237
The world ain't as mysterious
as you think it is when you're a kid.

579
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:32,476
I'm not a kid.

580
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:37,784
My point is that a girl with a prior
history for running away...

581
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,324
...who tells her friend...
- Her best friend!

582
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:45,764
Who tells her best friend
that she's thinking on running away,

583
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:47,890
even shows her the suitcase...

584
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,525
...has probably done just that.
- I know Jill.

585
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:51,830
This isn't like her.

586
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:55,338
I've seen this happen
a hundred times before.

587
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:59,468
Girl gets to be a certain age,
she feels pinched,

588
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:02,638
like she's outgrown this place,
these people...

589
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:04,010
You don't outgrow your best friend!

590
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:08,951
That's all you have to say?
Come on!

591
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:11,181
You don't think
there's something weird going on?

592
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,190
Weird isn't a crime.

593
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:18,195
If it were, I'd happily
put every one of you kids in jail.

594
00:41:22,935 --> 00:41:25,403
Well, what about rape?

595
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,140
Isn't sex with a minor
still considered rape?

596
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:31,709
I mean, what
was going through your head

597
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:33,335
when you were writing her
all those e-mails?

598
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:35,936
Better watch your tone, girl.

599
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:37,743
You're preparing to jump
in the deep end.

600
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,752
You don't have to run away
to the big city to find trouble.

601
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:43,845
There's plenty right here.

602
00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:20,147
Tell me again why I'm risking

603
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:22,625
my future full-ride scholarship
to Stanford to do this.

604
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:24,525
Because the story
that Jillian ran away is bullshit,

605
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,258
and you know it and I know it
and I need you to help me prove it

606
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:28,697
and you like me.

607
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,307
No shit!

608
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:42,209
"Durtygrrl" was Jillian?

609
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:45,643
What?
Everyone checked out her profile.

610
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,345
She's the patron saint
of the Computer Club.

611
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:50,615
Anyway, what does this have
to do with her going missing?

612
00:42:50,723 --> 00:42:53,191
The night she disappeared, Jill was
supposed to meet this cyber guy,

613
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:54,725
and I think she met him here.

614
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:59,230
Oh, if this really is the suspect,
you've got a huge job ahead of you.

615
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:07,603
Hey, I didn't know, okay?

616
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:09,697
Besides, you know how many hot girls
you have to hit up on here

617
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:13,005
before you find one
that will actually add you?

618
00:43:15,214 --> 00:43:17,478
Looks like she was
everybody's friend.

619
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,710
Or nobody's.

620
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:23,413
Look, she hasn't logged in
since last Friday.

621
00:43:23,522 --> 00:43:25,717
The night of the party.

622
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:28,725
Hey, check her e-mail!

623
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,658
Maybe her middle name or her pet's.

624
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:34,164
No, it wouldn't be something obvious.

625
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:39,260
Her mom was always into her stuff,
so she wouldn't want her reading it.

626
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:45,337
Where are you going?

627
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:13,200
<i>... Tri-state area...</i>

628
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:20,509
<i>Thanks again for being here.</i>
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

629
00:44:34,093 --> 00:44:35,856
<i>Is that actually what they said?</i>

630
00:44:38,998 --> 00:44:42,661
<i>What is it? That's crazy!</i>
<i>What's wrong with this world?</i>

631
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,668
<i>John, let's get a picture</i>
<i>up there, shall we?</i>

632
00:44:45,904 --> 00:44:46,802
<i>Okay. And the number please.</i>

633
00:44:46,905 --> 00:44:49,499
<i>Thanks. Thank you.</i>
<i>If you see Chelsea out there, folks,</i>

634
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:52,441
<i>if you see her</i>
<i>or someone who looks like her,</i>

635
00:44:52,544 --> 00:44:55,172
<i>call that number anytime,</i>
<i>day or night.</i>

636
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,044
<i>It's an anonymous number.</i>

637
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,015
<i>But please, report,</i>
<i>whether or not you see her.</i>

638
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,748
<i>Let's just get this little girl home.</i>

639
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:05,617
<i>She really is a beautiful girl, Kelly.</i>

640
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:08,725
<i>Folks, if you see Chelsea out there,</i>

641
00:45:08,827 --> 00:45:10,920
<i>you can call that number</i>
<i>anytime, day or night...</i>

642
00:47:34,706 --> 00:47:36,901
Hello?

643
00:47:38,977 --> 00:47:40,604
Hello!

644
00:48:16,348 --> 00:48:17,747
<i>You've reached the bitch.</i>

645
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:20,943
<i>Leave it at the beep, freaks.</i>

646
00:48:21,053 --> 00:48:23,180
<i>Jill, this is all</i>
<i>getting really weird.</i>

647
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:25,518
<i>Why won't you just call me back?</i>

648
00:48:25,624 --> 00:48:28,388
<i>If you're in some kind of trouble...</i>

649
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:30,654
<i>Where are you?</i>

650
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:39,265
Log on. I think I found it.

651
00:48:47,546 --> 00:48:48,843
Jesus!

652
00:48:48,947 --> 00:48:51,381
I don't think I've gotten 500 messages
my entire life!

653
00:48:51,483 --> 00:48:52,575
You don't have boobs, Jasper.

654
00:48:52,684 --> 00:48:53,708
Can you just look...

655
00:48:55,254 --> 00:48:57,950
...at the messages
she got on Friday?

656
00:48:58,056 --> 00:49:01,617
Yeah, that
whittles it down to, like, 200.

657
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:04,287
Let me see.
It could be any one of these guys.

658
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:07,091
Or none of them.
Half these guys are anonymous.

659
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,134
There's not much to go on.

660
00:49:12,237 --> 00:49:15,638
Maybe we can get them
to tell us what the profiles don't.

661
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:19,438
Can you send them <i>all</i> a message?

662
00:49:19,544 --> 00:49:23,412
Um... write,

663
00:49:23,515 --> 00:49:25,642
"Durtygrrl knows what you are."

664
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:31,485
Nice... flirtatious, yet threatening.

665
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,251
Just send it.

666
00:49:37,529 --> 00:49:39,463
I don't know.
Do you think it will work?

667
00:49:39,564 --> 00:49:43,432
I mean, if I just did something shady,
I would be way on the D.L.

668
00:49:43,535 --> 00:49:45,833
Maybe.

669
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:47,700
But you'd have to be curious.

670
00:49:47,806 --> 00:49:51,298
Wouldn't you want to know
if you got away with it?

671
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:58,640
You know, we really
haven't had much time to talk...

672
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,514
...recently.

673
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:10,862
I guess I feel a little strange
leaving you by yourself.

674
00:50:10,962 --> 00:50:13,487
I'm a big girl.
I'll be fine.

675
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,229
God damn it!

676
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:21,864
Honey, can you make sure the
raccoons aren't in the garbage again?

677
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:49,163
Take it easy, now. Take it easy.

678
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:51,462
You struggle too much,
you're liable to get hurt.

679
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:55,139
<i>That's better.</i>

680
00:50:57,109 --> 00:51:01,011
Got a message from your friend.

681
00:51:01,113 --> 00:51:04,139
Seems like she's alive and well.

682
00:51:04,316 --> 00:51:09,413
Now, I don't know
what you think your game is,

683
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:12,115
but you might
want to keep this in mind...

684
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:16,859
A man's family is his castle.

685
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,557
Invade his castle,
well, that's an act of war.

686
00:51:25,437 --> 00:51:28,770
Sarah? Everything okay?

687
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:33,004
Sarah?

688
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:36,013
I'll be watching you.

689
00:51:37,582 --> 00:51:39,641
Sarah?

690
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,810
Sarah?

691
00:51:57,569 --> 00:51:58,695
Honey, time to get up.

692
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,368
Come on! Get your clothes on.

693
00:52:02,474 --> 00:52:05,568
You have to drive me
to the airport, remember?

694
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:06,870
I'm surprised
your phone didn't wake you.

695
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:08,502
It's been beeping all night.

696
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:37,501
<i>When you guys finish,</i>

697
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:39,042
<i>I need someone up here on the floor.</i>

698
00:52:39,144 --> 00:52:40,941
Okay.

699
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:44,742
Well, what do you
want to do with these?

700
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:00,227
I thought you were
morally opposed to cigarettes.

701
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:02,994
Daddy says they are a dirty habit.

702
00:53:06,638 --> 00:53:08,469
What's it like
just living with your dad?

703
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:13,333
It's all right.

704
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:15,504
It used to be more fun
before Mom died.

705
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,446
What happened?

706
00:53:20,852 --> 00:53:24,310
Complications in childbirth.

707
00:53:26,157 --> 00:53:27,181
With my baby brother.

708
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:29,658
After that, Dad got really strict,

709
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:33,697
and now I have lots of rules on...

710
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:37,632
...the Internet and makeup and stuff.

711
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:38,862
Yeah.

712
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:43,865
Oh, heck!

713
00:53:43,975 --> 00:53:45,408
There's my dad. He's coming.

714
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,634
Don't panic. Don't panic.
It's fine.

715
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:48,975
- Um, spray some of this on.
- No! I can't wear perfume!

716
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,980
Darla, do you want your dad
thinking that you're wearing perfume

717
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:51,810
or smoking?

718
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:56,579
Uh, okay, hit me...

719
00:53:57,122 --> 00:53:58,316
Vince!

720
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:01,256
Darla, ring up your dad, will you?

721
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,348
Take it easy.

722
00:54:03,495 --> 00:54:06,589
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

723
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:08,824
Hi, Sarah.

724
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:10,925
I notice you've been down
to the library quite a bit lately.

725
00:54:11,036 --> 00:54:12,833
Are you in summer school?

726
00:54:12,938 --> 00:54:16,203
No, um... It's like
a personal research project.

727
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:19,404
- Oh.
- These are $5.30.

728
00:54:19,511 --> 00:54:21,843
- Okay. All right. There you go.
- Thank you.

729
00:54:22,514 --> 00:54:25,711
- Have you heard from your friend?
- My friend?

730
00:54:25,817 --> 00:54:30,413
Yes, the, uh, the young lady
who was working here. Jillian?

731
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:33,183
No, uh, not yet.

732
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:36,554
I'm sure she'll turn up.
Thanks.

733
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,795
All right. Bye, honey.

734
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,731
You're not wearing perfume, are you?

735
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:45,803
Oh, no, um, that's me.

736
00:54:45,904 --> 00:54:50,773
I think I, I think I was standing
next to her when I sprayed it on.

737
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,639
Okay.

738
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:56,043
All right.
I'll see you later tonight.

739
00:54:57,182 --> 00:54:57,876
Hey, Daddy?

740
00:54:59,384 --> 00:55:02,182
I invited Sarah over to our house
for my birthday.

741
00:55:05,557 --> 00:55:07,889
Good! Good!

742
00:55:07,993 --> 00:55:09,984
Well, we'll have
a good time, won't we?

743
00:55:10,095 --> 00:55:13,189
It'll be a nice party.
Okay.

744
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:19,732
Thanks for covering for me!
You will come, won't you?

745
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:21,328
This Sunday.

746
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:23,839
I'm sorry about telling him
about the Jillian thing.

747
00:55:23,942 --> 00:55:25,671
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Oh, it's okay.

748
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:29,873
Um, yeah, of course I'll come.
It'll be really fun.

749
00:55:40,025 --> 00:55:41,117
Any bites?

750
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,985
Are you gonna read all those?

751
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:48,396
Well, better get started!

752
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:18,128
Thought you could use a boost.

753
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:21,289
- Just hook up an I.V.
- What, boring?

754
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:22,930
Let me give you a sample.

755
00:56:23,702 --> 00:56:25,499
"I know that you're
the girl of my dreams.

756
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:27,468
Hit me back. Let's hook up."

757
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:28,937
He misspelled "girl".

758
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,770
It just goes on and on.
It's like that or worse.

759
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:35,710
Like every cheesy little perv-boy
on the Internet was her friend.

760
00:56:36,848 --> 00:56:42,218
She gets these messages from Peru
and Bangladesh and France.

761
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,378
This girl never left Goshen.

762
00:56:48,426 --> 00:56:50,018
Slide over.

763
00:56:50,128 --> 00:56:51,356
It's dead in here.
I'll take a shift.

764
00:57:21,392 --> 00:57:24,327
Sarah, why are we doing this?

765
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:25,919
She's my best friend.

766
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,624
Yeah, I know. I know. I get that.

767
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:30,724
But this...

768
00:57:30,835 --> 00:57:33,599
This is like above
and beyond best friends.

769
00:57:33,705 --> 00:57:37,402
I guess it's because
I know if I got into trouble

770
00:57:37,509 --> 00:57:40,842
I would always
have my mom and dad.

771
00:57:40,945 --> 00:57:41,877
And I think that most people

772
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,949
have somebody who cares
about what happens to them.

773
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:47,279
And the only person Jill has is me.

774
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:54,351
I don't know what I'm doing.

775
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:57,185
I have to open tomorrow.

776
00:57:57,295 --> 00:57:59,388
Yeah. I should lock up.

777
00:57:59,497 --> 00:58:00,964
Oh!

778
00:58:07,405 --> 00:58:11,034
Hey! What did you say
Jillian was calling this guy?

779
00:58:11,142 --> 00:58:12,234
A "Mr. X."

780
00:58:12,343 --> 00:58:13,674
You'd better check this out.

781
00:58:14,746 --> 00:58:15,735
Here. Look.

782
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:17,542
Look at the name.
- Mr. eXperience?

783
00:58:17,649 --> 00:58:19,014
Mr. X! How did I miss that?

784
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:20,175
He's still online.

785
00:58:39,003 --> 00:58:40,664
- Do you think this is our guy?
- I'm trying to find that out.

786
00:58:43,508 --> 00:58:46,375
Hey, he's logged off.

787
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:51,743
What the hell does that mean?

788
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:09,093
Jillian?

789
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:15,139
Jillian?

790
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:43,256
Jillian?

791
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,014
<i>Sarah.</i>

792
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,054
<i>Up here.</i>

793
01:00:27,512 --> 01:00:28,410
Jillian?

794
01:00:47,131 --> 01:00:48,291
Patty?

795
01:00:58,543 --> 01:01:00,408
Oh!

796
01:01:01,446 --> 01:01:03,641
I know what you are, too.

797
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,057
Now...

798
01:01:21,165 --> 01:01:23,497
...how long you say
your friend's been missing?

799
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:28,436
- A couple of weeks.
- Couple of weeks?

800
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:34,607
My Janet was gone three years
before I realized.

801
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:39,641
Me and her old man,

802
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:42,720
we didn't get on so well...
I'm sure you've heard the stories.

803
01:01:45,156 --> 01:01:48,353
Day doesn't go by
that I don't hate myself

804
01:01:48,459 --> 01:01:52,520
for leaving her
with that son-of-a-bitch.

805
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:54,029
Her "Daddy."

806
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,761
By the time I faced up to him,

807
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:01,862
she was gone
and he didn't know where.

808
01:02:01,973 --> 01:02:04,134
Is that when you started
putting up flyers?

809
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:07,075
Being a lowlife has its advantages.

810
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:10,976
People underestimate you,
but I'm focused.

811
01:02:11,082 --> 01:02:17,214
I traveled, looked under a lot
of rocks, lived under a few, too.

812
01:02:20,892 --> 01:02:24,225
I've heard some stories.

813
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:25,886
Like what?

814
01:02:25,997 --> 01:02:31,731
Children... disappearing.

815
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:38,901
The kind of kids <i>nobody's</i> looking for.
The kind of kids <i>they</i> call "trash."

816
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:44,277
"Runaway."
Like... Brenda Stills,

817
01:02:44,382 --> 01:02:46,179
Cindy Marker,

818
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,581
Debbie Hope.

819
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:51,346
Like your Jillian.

820
01:02:51,456 --> 01:02:54,357
Like my Janet.

821
01:02:58,529 --> 01:02:59,996
All lost.

822
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:02,889
They're all lost.

823
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:11,236
Sometimes when I...

824
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:12,969
...feel her slipping away from me,

825
01:03:13,077 --> 01:03:17,207
I call her just to listen
to her voice on the message...

826
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:21,684
...so I don't forget what she...

827
01:03:21,786 --> 01:03:24,983
...sound like.

828
01:03:28,726 --> 01:03:30,250
Where did you get that?

829
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:32,761
- It's Jillian's!
- Jillian's?

830
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:37,195
It's The Serpent himself!

831
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:38,529
The serpent?

832
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:43,206
- The devil.
- Patty, I don't know what that means.

833
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,601
You can't see it in the flyers
because the copies are for crap,

834
01:03:46,711 --> 01:03:48,645
but on the original...

835
01:03:48,746 --> 01:03:50,839
...it's clear as day.

836
01:03:50,948 --> 01:03:53,382
Holy shit!

837
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:03,791
Come on, Jasper. Pick up.
Come on.

838
01:04:07,765 --> 01:04:09,562
Come on, Jasper.

839
01:04:16,174 --> 01:04:16,640
Shit.

840
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:28,642
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

841
01:04:28,753 --> 01:04:30,345
Jasper!

842
01:04:33,224 --> 01:04:34,589
Look.

843
01:04:37,161 --> 01:04:37,957
Fuck!

844
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:39,684
He just went in back.

845
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:43,351
Well, right on schedule.
Every day at 2:00 Billy hits the glue.

846
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:45,929
Yeah, give him a couple of minutes.
You'll see.

847
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:48,396
And you know this how?

848
01:05:48,499 --> 01:05:50,433
I collect model trains, all right?

849
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:54,265
Have you ever tried to buy miniatures
from a stoner? It freaks them out.

850
01:05:54,372 --> 01:05:56,306
You sure it was Billy last night?

851
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:59,103
The guy has tortured me
my entire life.

852
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:02,145
I think I can recognize his voice.

853
01:06:02,246 --> 01:06:06,148
Okay. Let's get him.

854
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:38,745
<i>Um...</i>

855
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:41,340
<i>... hold on a second.</i>

856
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:48,685
Agh!

857
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:50,317
What the fuck?

858
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:52,896
Ah! Oh!

859
01:06:52,997 --> 01:06:54,828
- Hey, Billy!
- Oh, man!

860
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:56,524
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

861
01:06:56,634 --> 01:06:58,659
I'm on fucking duty any day...

862
01:07:01,572 --> 01:07:04,598
First question...
when you jumped Jasper last night,

863
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:07,337
you said, "I know who you are, too."

864
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:09,274
How did you know
we sent that message?

865
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,177
You tell me.
You're the honor student.

866
01:07:11,282 --> 01:07:12,840
Ugh!

867
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,247
Ow!

868
01:07:14,352 --> 01:07:17,321
Well, I can guess the first part,
that you knew Jillian was Durtygrrl.

869
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:19,651
It's the connection to Jasper
that I'm missing.

870
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:23,523
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

871
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,322
I knew...

872
01:07:25,429 --> 01:07:28,159
... how you think
you're such a genius, Ass-per.

873
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:30,331
Nobody's heard from J in weeks.

874
01:07:31,135 --> 01:07:33,729
And all of a sudden
she's sending me messages

875
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:36,102
with your ugly face
all over her profile.

876
01:07:36,207 --> 01:07:39,699
You'd never make Jay's Top 8.

877
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:42,074
You'd never even
make her Top 800.

878
01:07:43,047 --> 01:07:45,880
I bet that really
pissed you off, right?

879
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,315
That Jillian had a profile like that
to meet men.

880
01:07:48,419 --> 01:07:51,320
Yeah, and we all know you
do stupid things when you're angry.

881
01:07:51,422 --> 01:07:54,084
Yeah, it pissed me off.
That was the point, wasn't it?

882
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:56,386
To piss me off.

883
01:07:56,494 --> 01:07:58,553
Jay was always doing stupid shit.

884
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:00,926
She was always
playing games with me,

885
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:03,192
telling me how many guys
wanted to fuck her.

886
01:08:04,635 --> 01:08:07,297
I never thought
she was serious, though.

887
01:08:10,408 --> 01:08:11,375
What do you know, Billy?

888
01:08:13,077 --> 01:08:14,601
Now you've got a choice.

889
01:08:14,712 --> 01:08:17,078
Face or nuts?
You can't cover them both.

890
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:20,014
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Fuck you.

891
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:23,980
Okay, I followed her...

892
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:26,022
...okay, after the party.

893
01:08:27,758 --> 01:08:31,717
I thought it was part of the,

894
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:33,592
part of the game.

895
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:36,632
You know, she'd get me all mad,
and then I'd...

896
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:38,827
...you know.

897
01:08:38,936 --> 01:08:40,699
I followed her downtown.

898
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:43,163
And then I saw her get into a...

899
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:44,639
...a car.

900
01:08:44,975 --> 01:08:47,535
She was laughing.

901
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:50,008
Well, who was driving?

902
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:52,412
I don't know.
I was too far away and couldn't see.

903
01:08:52,516 --> 01:08:53,744
What kind of car was it?

904
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:57,047
I don't know!
It was a piece of shit!

905
01:08:57,154 --> 01:08:58,553
It looked like a rental!

906
01:08:58,656 --> 01:08:59,782
You want to know
who she was with?

907
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,790
Ask your friend, the mole girl.

908
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:02,984
No, no, no. I'm serious.

909
01:09:03,093 --> 01:09:05,721
I mean Darla. Darla. Ask Darla.

910
01:09:05,896 --> 01:09:07,090
She was there.

911
01:09:07,264 --> 01:09:08,288
Bullshit!

912
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,629
Why would Darla care
about what Jillian was doing?

913
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:12,292
I don't freaking know!

914
01:09:15,206 --> 01:09:18,733
Come on. Let's go.

915
01:09:37,127 --> 01:09:39,357
- Do you believe him?
- I have to.

916
01:09:39,463 --> 01:09:41,863
Billy's too stupid to lie that well.

917
01:09:41,966 --> 01:09:43,763
Well, what do we do now?

918
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:47,634
I'm going to wish Darla
a happy birthday.

919
01:10:28,879 --> 01:10:32,576
Oh, Sarah. Hello.

920
01:10:32,683 --> 01:10:35,777
Okay. Well, everybody's here.
Let's...

921
01:10:37,254 --> 01:10:39,119
...start the party.

922
01:10:39,223 --> 01:10:41,191
Dear Father, we thank You

923
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:43,317
for us to be seated
at this table tonight

924
01:10:43,427 --> 01:10:46,191
eating this meal with good friends.

925
01:10:47,498 --> 01:10:51,298
Good friends
who are like family to us.

926
01:10:51,402 --> 01:10:53,870
- Amen.
- Amen.

927
01:10:53,971 --> 01:10:55,165
Amen.

928
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:07,313
- Should I blow out the candles?
- Sure.

929
01:11:16,327 --> 01:11:17,453
<i>... when God created man and woman</i>

930
01:11:17,561 --> 01:11:23,329
<i>and God graced them in the garden</i>
<i>and things, things were good.</i>

931
01:11:23,434 --> 01:11:24,867
<i>But then ol' Lucifer comes along...</i>

932
01:11:24,969 --> 01:11:26,596
Darla.

933
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:28,228
I need to ask you a question.

934
01:11:29,473 --> 01:11:32,374
- And I need you to tell me the truth.
- What is it?

935
01:11:32,476 --> 01:11:34,444
Darla?

936
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:36,012
Darla, honey,

937
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:37,205
could you feed the dogs?

938
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:39,782
Their barking's driving me crazy.
I'll take over for you. Go on.

939
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:41,043
<i>... guard themselves</i>

940
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:44,143
<i>if they're taking of the fruit</i>
<i>from the Tree of Knowledge.</i>

941
01:11:44,254 --> 01:11:47,553
<i>Now, we all know Lucifer,</i>

942
01:11:47,658 --> 01:11:51,059
<i>just as in the nature of birds</i>
<i>to sing and the bees to make honey,</i>

943
01:11:51,161 --> 01:11:54,858
<i>so it is the nature</i>
<i>of the Devil to tempt...</i>

944
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:58,264
Glad you were able to come tonight.

945
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:03,170
She, uh, ahem,
doesn't have a lot of friends.

946
01:12:03,273 --> 01:12:05,173
<i>... for God cannot be tempted,</i>

947
01:12:05,342 --> 01:12:07,071
<i>nor does He kid anyone.</i>

948
01:12:08,712 --> 01:12:09,804
Oh! Sorry.

949
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:13,474
- I think my necklace is caught.
- You need some help with it?

950
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:17,076
Uh, sure.

951
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:19,417
<i>... once desire has taken root...</i>

952
01:12:19,523 --> 01:12:22,356
Just a second.

953
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:24,689
I used to be pretty good at this.

954
01:12:24,795 --> 01:12:25,784
Let me just...

955
01:12:25,896 --> 01:12:27,386
<i>... I want to read for you</i>
<i>from the Book of...</i>

956
01:12:28,298 --> 01:12:29,663
Oh!

957
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:31,234
<i>... at the window of my house,</i>

958
01:12:31,335 --> 01:12:34,896
<i>I witnessed among him</i>
<i>a youth who lacked judgment...</i>

959
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:35,994
What is this?

960
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:37,334
An unusual piece.
Where did you get that?

961
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:41,400
- It's a friend's.
- Oh.

962
01:12:41,512 --> 01:12:43,309
Ow!
Damn it!

963
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:45,980
Ow!

964
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:49,651
Tie this!

965
01:12:49,753 --> 01:12:51,846
Come here, would you, and tie this!

966
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:53,547
Tie it off!

967
01:12:53,657 --> 01:12:55,522
Come on!

968
01:12:55,926 --> 01:12:57,154
Give me it!

969
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:14,209
Um, I actually need to go.

970
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,753
Come on.

971
01:13:33,964 --> 01:13:36,956
- Is something wrong with your car?
- Yeah, um...

972
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,500
No. It's, uh...

973
01:13:38,602 --> 01:13:41,196
- I can just call my friend.
- Daddy?

974
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,648
You won't tell, will you?

975
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,224
I thought you were allergic.

976
01:14:03,894 --> 01:14:06,829
Well...

977
01:14:06,997 --> 01:14:11,798
...we don't always
love what's good for us.

978
01:14:11,902 --> 01:14:15,998
Poe called it
"the imp of the perverse."

979
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:22,174
Take your friend, uh, Jillian.

980
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:26,113
I bet she's the type of girl runnin'
around with all the wrong boys.

981
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:29,913
The kind of boys that will
get her into trouble, you know,

982
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:36,323
give her a reputation.

983
01:14:36,426 --> 01:14:38,986
You still searching for her?

984
01:14:43,033 --> 01:14:44,967
No. I kind of gave that up.

985
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:49,069
She doesn't strike me as the type of
person to stay in one place too long.

986
01:14:58,282 --> 01:15:00,182
You're different.

987
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:04,118
You have a better sense
of self-preservation.

988
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,981
Kids around here
just don't have that.

989
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:14,291
They're just brought up
too comfortable,

990
01:15:14,398 --> 01:15:15,831
just too safe.

991
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:26,335
You still, uh, jog on the River Run?

992
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:31,247
No. Not so much.

993
01:15:31,348 --> 01:15:35,045
That's a beautiful trail,
the River Run.

994
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:39,952
You feel like you're
the only person left in the world

995
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:42,958
when you're out there.

996
01:15:59,343 --> 01:16:00,833
Do you want me
to walk you to the door?

997
01:16:00,944 --> 01:16:03,970
No, thanks.

998
01:16:04,081 --> 01:16:05,708
All right, then.

999
01:16:05,883 --> 01:16:12,186
I'll just wait here
till you get in all right.

1000
01:16:12,623 --> 01:16:17,322
# <i>For you're bound to die</i> #

1001
01:16:17,427 --> 01:16:23,525
# <i>For you're bound to die</i> #

1002
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:01,516
Jillian?

1003
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:04,219
<i>She doesn't want you looking for her!</i>

1004
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:05,259
Who is this?

1005
01:19:05,362 --> 01:19:06,727
<i>She's moved on.</i>

1006
01:19:06,897 --> 01:19:08,364
<i>She has a new life.</i>

1007
01:19:08,465 --> 01:19:09,796
<i>She doesn't need you.</i>

1008
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,026
Why can't she tell me that?

1009
01:19:11,134 --> 01:19:13,068
<i>She has!</i>

1010
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:15,536
<i>She's happy with her new life.</i>

1011
01:19:15,639 --> 01:19:18,107
<i>She wants to be left alone.</i>

1012
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:20,574
Are the others happy, too?

1013
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:23,271
Is Janet Melville happy?

1014
01:19:26,716 --> 01:19:27,307
Hello?

1015
01:19:27,417 --> 01:19:29,977
<i>Don't tempt me.</i>

1016
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:35,320
<i>I'm not the one who should be afraid.</i>

1017
01:20:22,772 --> 01:20:25,536
Nobody here.

1018
01:20:26,443 --> 01:20:29,935
Now, what did he want?

1019
01:20:33,183 --> 01:20:34,548
Holy shit!

1020
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:36,585
I think he wants us to stop.

1021
01:20:36,686 --> 01:20:38,153
He makes a good point!

1022
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:40,314
We can't quit. Not now.

1023
01:20:40,423 --> 01:20:42,152
We can't? Watch this.

1024
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:46,161
Hey, look, a tall, fucking psycho just
staked a snake to your basement door!

1025
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:47,457
I quit!

1026
01:20:47,564 --> 01:20:49,259
- See? It's easy!
- You don't think I'm scared, too?

1027
01:20:52,068 --> 01:20:55,868
I am so fucking scared.

1028
01:20:55,972 --> 01:21:00,636
But somebody did this because they're
hiding something really horrible.

1029
01:21:00,744 --> 01:21:02,974
And my best friend is a part of it.

1030
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:08,576
So that's why I can't quit, you know.

1031
01:21:08,685 --> 01:21:10,710
And that's why you can't quit.

1032
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:12,685
She wasn't my friend.

1033
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,519
Yeah, but you're mine.

1034
01:21:19,196 --> 01:21:21,289
And I can't do this without you.

1035
01:21:31,474 --> 01:21:32,304
All right.

1036
01:21:35,845 --> 01:21:38,541
All right.

1037
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,845
But if I get killed
and lose my scholarship,

1038
01:21:41,952 --> 01:21:43,715
<i>you</i> have to explain to my mom.

1039
01:21:45,722 --> 01:21:47,212
Deal.

1040
01:21:50,927 --> 01:21:53,919
And one other thing...

1041
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:55,657
Can you spend the night tonight?

1042
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,759
Well, I don't know.

1043
01:22:24,861 --> 01:22:27,523
He wouldn't be the first guy
to swear after hurting himself.

1044
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:30,691
Well, yeah, but it isn't what he said.
It's how he said it, you know?

1045
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,767
If you ask me,

1046
01:22:31,868 --> 01:22:35,429
living way out here
would make anyone strange.

1047
01:22:55,025 --> 01:22:57,585
All right. Give it a try.

1048
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:00,928
Nice!

1049
01:23:01,031 --> 01:23:02,396
What did you do?

1050
01:23:06,336 --> 01:23:08,634
Nothing.

1051
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:39,053
You scared me.

1052
01:25:39,155 --> 01:25:40,452
What are you doing here?

1053
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:41,615
Where's Jillian, Darla?

1054
01:25:42,859 --> 01:25:46,056
- What?
- Where's Jillian?

1055
01:25:48,031 --> 01:25:49,965
- I don't know.
- Stop lying to me.

1056
01:25:50,066 --> 01:25:52,330
Darla, you have her clothes.
You've been dressing up like her.

1057
01:25:52,435 --> 01:25:53,595
Where is she?

1058
01:25:53,703 --> 01:25:55,694
I found her clothes
in her locker at work.

1059
01:25:55,805 --> 01:25:57,534
What about this?

1060
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,074
I <i>know</i> she didn't leave this behind.

1061
01:26:00,176 --> 01:26:01,837
Darla, please.

1062
01:26:01,945 --> 01:26:04,345
Where did you get this?

1063
01:26:04,447 --> 01:26:07,848
You left it for me to find.
You wanted me to have it. Why?

1064
01:26:08,017 --> 01:26:10,485
If you don't tell me
and something bad happens to her,

1065
01:26:10,587 --> 01:26:12,145
it's gonna be your fault.

1066
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:15,554
It was supposed to be
a family vacation!

1067
01:26:22,799 --> 01:26:25,324
Have you ever had a secret...

1068
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:28,734
...that you couldn't
live with keeping?

1069
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,331
And you think about it so much,
you begin to think

1070
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:37,402
that people can tell your secret
just by looking at you?

1071
01:26:37,514 --> 01:26:40,574
And you begin hoping that it's true,

1072
01:26:40,683 --> 01:26:43,743
that maybe someone
<i>will</i> tell your secret for you

1073
01:26:43,853 --> 01:26:45,480
and you don't have to?

1074
01:26:45,588 --> 01:26:47,021
Darla, I need more than that.

1075
01:26:47,123 --> 01:26:51,719
It was supposed to be
a family vacation.

1076
01:26:53,596 --> 01:26:57,123
But at the last minute,
he had to leave.

1077
01:26:57,233 --> 01:27:00,202
Something came up.

1078
01:27:00,303 --> 01:27:04,603
I don't know why it made me so mad.
It's the same thing every year.

1079
01:27:04,707 --> 01:27:08,643
But this time,
I took my cousin's car back into town,

1080
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:11,302
and I saw him with her.

1081
01:27:14,317 --> 01:27:17,252
She was laughing at him.

1082
01:27:17,353 --> 01:27:19,116
Darla, did you get this necklace
from your dad?

1083
01:27:20,557 --> 01:27:21,489
Darla?

1084
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:25,453
Is someone here with you?

1085
01:27:25,562 --> 01:27:26,961
I thought I heard someone talking.

1086
01:27:27,063 --> 01:27:29,896
I... I was speaking to myself.

1087
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:32,627
Honey, what's wrong?

1088
01:27:32,735 --> 01:27:36,398
There were some things
said at church today.

1089
01:27:36,506 --> 01:27:41,205
Sometimes that stuff
can get so depressing.

1090
01:27:42,378 --> 01:27:45,245
Come here.

1091
01:27:45,348 --> 01:27:50,149
Sometimes those stories are meant
to teach us what's right and wrong,

1092
01:27:50,253 --> 01:27:53,051
and they're not always easy to hear.

1093
01:27:53,623 --> 01:27:56,524
I know, Daddy.

1094
01:27:59,829 --> 01:28:02,730
I'm glad you take them to heart.

1095
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:09,704
Smile.

1096
01:28:12,642 --> 01:28:15,133
All right?

1097
01:28:22,085 --> 01:28:24,485
Are you sure there's not something
you want to tell me?

1098
01:28:24,587 --> 01:28:26,555
No.

1099
01:28:30,526 --> 01:28:32,790
Okay.

1100
01:28:47,644 --> 01:28:50,613
Darla, please.

1101
01:28:50,713 --> 01:28:52,237
The necklace.

1102
01:28:52,348 --> 01:28:56,876
Where did you get this necklace?

1103
01:28:59,422 --> 01:29:03,290
I found it...

1104
01:29:03,393 --> 01:29:05,054
...in the bus.

1105
01:29:06,095 --> 01:29:11,328
He keeps things there.

1106
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:17,224
Whoa!

1107
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:44,023
Shit.

1108
01:30:44,627 --> 01:30:45,685
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

1109
01:31:16,492 --> 01:31:18,460
That's it.

1110
01:31:18,561 --> 01:31:22,053
We're not going in there, are we?

1111
01:31:22,165 --> 01:31:25,566
I am.

1112
01:31:25,668 --> 01:31:29,399
You keep an eye on the house.

1113
01:32:39,475 --> 01:32:40,464
<i>Gannon...</i>

1114
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,203
<i>... Girlscout.</i>

1115
01:33:19,548 --> 01:33:21,277
<i>Janet?</i>

1116
01:33:21,384 --> 01:33:23,409
<i>Janet, baby, is that you?</i>

1117
01:33:23,519 --> 01:33:24,417
Patty?

1118
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,181
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

1119
01:33:26,289 --> 01:33:27,847
It's Sarah.

1120
01:33:27,957 --> 01:33:30,255
<i>Sarah, what are you doing</i>
<i>with my baby's phone?</i>

1121
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:32,384
Patty... Patty, listen to me.

1122
01:33:32,495 --> 01:33:33,928
You have to call the police,
and you have to tell them

1123
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,622
to come to the Tod house right now.

1124
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:38,894
<i>Why the hell would I do that?</i>

1125
01:33:39,001 --> 01:33:41,970
Because I found your daughter
and the other missing girls.

1126
01:34:10,566 --> 01:34:11,726
<i>What?</i>
- You need to see this.

1127
01:34:13,302 --> 01:34:14,860
Please tell me
you didn't find anything...

1128
01:34:26,248 --> 01:34:27,647
Yeah. I think we're good.

1129
01:34:31,821 --> 01:34:34,051
Shit! Not good!
No, we are definitely not good!

1130
01:34:36,258 --> 01:34:37,555
Fuck!

1131
01:36:56,565 --> 01:36:58,590
Sarah?

1132
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:01,636
- What are you doing here?
- What did you do with her?

1133
01:37:03,072 --> 01:37:05,734
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

1134
01:37:05,841 --> 01:37:08,571
I have to think about Darla.

1135
01:37:08,744 --> 01:37:09,733
She's all I got.

1136
01:37:09,845 --> 01:37:11,312
What about the families
that you destroyed?

1137
01:37:11,413 --> 01:37:13,176
Do you think about them?

1138
01:37:13,282 --> 01:37:14,579
Now, let's be reasonable.

1139
01:37:14,683 --> 01:37:17,447
You can tell Patty Melville
to be reasonable!

1140
01:37:17,553 --> 01:37:18,952
And while you're at it,
you can tell the police,

1141
01:37:19,054 --> 01:37:20,453
because they're
gonna be here any second!

1142
01:37:20,556 --> 01:37:22,114
No, no, that's not gonna happen.

1143
01:37:23,192 --> 01:37:27,288
You can't comprehend
the sacrifices I've made!

1144
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:29,964
They were tempting me!

1145
01:37:30,065 --> 01:37:31,692
They were trying
to get me to do things,

1146
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,234
disgusting things!

1147
01:37:34,336 --> 01:37:35,894
They were trying to hurt my family.

1148
01:37:36,005 --> 01:37:38,371
The only thing
destroying your family is you!

1149
01:37:38,474 --> 01:37:39,964
Oh!

1150
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:44,341
You!

1151
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:38,621
Oh! Shit!

1152
01:39:38,727 --> 01:39:40,524
I thought...

1153
01:39:45,434 --> 01:39:46,833
Even though I walk through the valley

1154
01:39:46,935 --> 01:39:50,632
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil for thou art...

1155
01:39:50,739 --> 01:39:52,263
What is he doing?

1156
01:39:54,209 --> 01:39:55,836
He's praying.

1157
01:39:55,944 --> 01:39:58,412
Sarah?

1158
01:39:59,515 --> 01:40:01,176
Don't you fucking move!

1159
01:40:01,283 --> 01:40:06,243
The Lord knows my heart,
and <i>He</i> will judge me.

1160
01:40:07,022 --> 01:40:09,149
Like hell!

1161
01:40:09,792 --> 01:40:12,886
You'll never find the bodies.

1162
01:40:12,995 --> 01:40:14,963
You'll never know.

1163
01:40:15,064 --> 01:40:16,759
Daddy?

1164
01:40:18,534 --> 01:40:20,126
Daddy?

1165
01:40:24,973 --> 01:40:27,373
Come here.

1166
01:40:27,476 --> 01:40:28,773
Come down here.

1167
01:40:29,712 --> 01:40:31,270
What do you want?

1168
01:40:33,749 --> 01:40:36,912
I want to tell you...

1169
01:40:37,019 --> 01:40:38,111
...everything.

1170
01:40:40,756 --> 01:40:41,745
Sarah...

1171
01:40:55,304 --> 01:40:57,101
Closer.

1172
01:40:57,806 --> 01:41:00,536
Closer.

1173
01:41:23,999 --> 01:41:28,368
The last thing she said
was your name.

1174
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:36,333
Now do it.

1175
01:41:36,445 --> 01:41:39,903
Do it for me like I did it...

1176
01:41:40,015 --> 01:41:41,004
...for your friend.

1177
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:48,246
Just...

1178
01:41:48,357 --> 01:41:50,757
...stop my breath.

1179
01:41:55,063 --> 01:41:57,429
Sarah.

1180
01:42:03,639 --> 01:42:04,970
No.

1181
01:42:11,246 --> 01:42:13,976
No, Sarah.

1182
01:42:14,082 --> 01:42:15,242
What about Darla?

1183
01:42:17,386 --> 01:42:19,217
She's so innocent.

1184
01:42:21,557 --> 01:42:23,787
None of us are innocent.

1185
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:30,123
Daddy!

1186
01:42:35,137 --> 01:42:36,900
Daddy!

1187
01:44:50,811 --> 01:44:51,811
