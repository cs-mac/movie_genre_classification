Stanzas and children
as you bring to the world?

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,277
As on the beach
the shadows of corals converse you?

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,152
As of anguish the deep nightfall?

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,157
As one who splits
and scatters oneself?

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,628
As one who might kill you?

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,518
Or as one who shall never return to you.
JORGE DE SENA

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,030
"And so the Girl of the Sea
sat on the boy's shoulder and said:

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,274
"I'm so happy, so happy, so happy.

17
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,756
"l thought I'd never see you again.

18
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,838
"Without you the sea,
despite all its anemones,

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,871
"seemed sad and empty.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,990
"And I spent my entire days sighing
and didn't know what to do.

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,754
"Until one day the King of the Sea
gave a big party.

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,635
"He invited many whales, many
sharks and many important fishes.

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,718
"And he told me to go to the palace
and dance at the party.

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,349
"At the end of the banquet
the time came for me to dance,

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,751
" I entered the cave where the
King of the Sea was with his guests,

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,839
"sitting on his nacre throne
surrounded by sea-horses.

27
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,351
"And then the dog-whelks started
singing a very ancient song

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,429
"that was invented
in the beginning of the World.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,270
"But I was very sad and
so my dancing was very poor.

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,319
"Why is your dancing so terrible?,
asked the King of the Sea.

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,789
"Because I'm filled with longing,
I replied.

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,480
"Longing?, said the King of the Sea,
what's that all about?

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,309
"And he asked the octopus, the crab
and the fish what had happened.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,192
"They told him everything.

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,033
"And so the King of the Sea
felt sorrow for my sadness

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,312
"and felt sorrow for a ballerina that
didn't know how to dance anymore

37
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,472
"and said: come to the palace
tomorrow morning.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,434
"The morning of the next day,
I returned to the palace

39
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,717
"and the King of the Sea
sat me on his shoulder

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,150
"and took me up
to the surface of the waters.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,949
"He called a seagull, gave it a bottle
with an anemone filter

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,430
"and sent it looking for you.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,154
"And that's how I got you back.

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,000
"Now we'll never be apart again,
said the boy.

45
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,677
"Now you'll be strong as an octopus,
said the octopus.

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,749
"Now you'll be wise as a crab,
said the crab.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,072
"Now you'll be happy as a fish,
said the fish.

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,557
"Now your land is the sea,
said the Girl of the Sea.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,110
"And all five of them went through
forests, sands and caves.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,709
"The following day,

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,951
"there was another party
at the palace of the King of the Sea.

52
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,917
"The Girl of the Sea
danced all night long.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,715
"And the whales, the sharks,
the turtles and all the fishes

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,077
"were saying: we've never seen
such perfect dancing.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,670
"And the King of the Sea
sat on his nacre throne,

56
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,870
"surrounded by sea-horses, and his
purple robe floated on the waters".

57
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,518
Did you like it, Xavier?

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,674
Yes, but you could have
used a more natural voice.

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,518
A more natural voice?
How would that be?

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,675
A natural tone.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,152
- It's not yours!
- It's not mine?!

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,633
"The earliest thing I remember
is a bedroom facing the sea,

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,113
"inside of which, on top of a table,
there was an enormous red apple.

64
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
"From the shimmering of the sea
and from the redness of the apple

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,992
"there arose an irrefragable,
naked and unbroken bliss.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,515
"lt was not at all fantastic,
it was not at all imaginary:

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,432
" it was the very presence
of the real I was discovering.

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,234
" Later the work of other artists

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,597
"would confirm the objectivity
of my own gaze.

70
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,429
" In Homer I recognised
the same naked and unbroken bliss,

71
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,319
"that splendour
of the presence of things.

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,435
"And I also recognised it, intense,
alert and ablaze

73
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,354
"in the painting
of Amadeu de Souza-Cardoso.

74
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,753
"To say that the work of art
is part of culture

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,356
"is rather scholarly and artificial.

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,875
"The work of art is part of the real

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,477
"and it is destiny, fulfilment,
salvation and life.

78
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,233
He Who seeks a just relation
With the stone, With the tree,

79
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,077
With the river,
is necessarily led

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,079
by the spirit of truth
that inspires him

81
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,118
to seek a just relation
With Man.

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,109
He Who seeks the amazing
splendour of the World is,

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,831
by force of logic, led to see
the amazing suffering of the World.

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,075
He Who sees a phenomenon Wishes
to see the Whole phenomenon.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,588
It is simply a matter of attention,
sequence and rigour.

86
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,952
And that's Why
poetry is a moral act.

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,189
And that is Why the poet is driven
to search for justice

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,272
through the very nature
of his poetry.

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,796
Like Antigone,
the poet of our time says:

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,908
I'm the one Who did not learn
to yield to disasters.

91
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,590
Even While speaking merely
of stones and breezes,

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,957
the Work of the artist
Will alWays tell us this:

93
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,874
That We are not merely animals

94
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,152
sharpened by the struggle
for survival,

95
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,517
but that We are rather,
by natural right,

96
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,872
heirs to the freedom
and dignity of beeing.

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,395
Oh Sophia, if I were
to look back on my life,

98
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,638
in the end, the assessment I would
make is precisely the one

99
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,238
I have made many years ago when
I wrote The Coral, which is this:

100
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
I believe in the nudity of my life.

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,110
I don't believe in biography,
which is life told by others.

102
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,474
In the end, all there is,
the only biography I have

103
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,591
is the one in my poetry.

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,638
And, essentially, what I have sought
was that sense of nudity,

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,639
to put oneself
in the face of each thing,

106
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,109
as if it had never been seen

107
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,834
and start looking
from the first moment

108
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,433
as if it was the first day
of the world,

109
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,111
and, in essence, when I say
" I believe in the nudity of my life"

110
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,318
it's the same thing...

111
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,236
Oh I can't stand it, Xavier,
I can't, I can't, absolutely not!

112
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,953
Xavier, why all this?!

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,796
These people, Whose face is
at times luminous

114
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,076
and at times rough

115
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,478
here reminding me of slaves
there reminding me of kings,

116
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,237
rekindles my taste
for fighting and fraying

117
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,355
'gainst the vulture and the snake,
the pig and the fork-tailed kite

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,877
For the people Whose face is
chiselled by patience and hunger

119
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,156
are the very people on Whom

120
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,836
an occupied country
Writes its name

121
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,838
In the face of these people,
ever ignored and tramped on

122
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,630
Iike the stone on the ground
and, further than the stone,

123
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,791
humiliated and crumpled,

124
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,392
my chant reaWakens
and I resume the search

125
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,674
for a liberated country,
a pure life

126
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,797
and fair times

127
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,548
I'm not at all a nostalgic person.

128
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,830
For me, things,
the things I care about,

129
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,869
are those things that are still
actual, that are still alive,

130
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,719
that are still active.

131
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,514
If they ceased to be active it is
because they have ceased to exist,

132
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,238
it is because
they did not truly exist.

133
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,635
I deeply believe that we choose
eternity while in this world,

134
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,752
that is, it is here and now
that we build and create eternity.

135
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,832
And that which we will find later
is that which

136
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,036
we were capable
of finding here and now.

137
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,954
If we have not found it here, then
we will not be able to find it later.

138
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,789
It makes no sense to talk about
lsadora Duncan,

139
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,316
because nobody can understand
the kind of relationship that existed

140
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,437
betWeen her and my mother
from an early stage.

141
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,029
Even if they did,
it's not their business,

142
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,919
because the truth about a person
is not a spectacle

143
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,640
and the public is here
to be entertained.

144
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,269
Someone, do you recall
Who it Was that said

145
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,995
that first you have to decide
according to oWn mind

146
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,679
and your oWn taste

147
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,719
and afterwards have the time and the
courage to express all your thoughts

148
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,150
With regard to the chosen subject.

149
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,914
So, one must say everything
in simple Way,

150
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,954
setting as one's goal not seductions
but rather convictions.

151
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,959
All my life I recall seeing my mother
dancing when we were little.

152
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,276
All the time my mother would dance

153
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,040
and put flowers on her head
and do dance-steps,

154
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,478
while speaking to herself
as she walked down the corridors.

155
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,719
One of the funniest things
when we were kids

156
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,271
was that mother sometimes called us
and said she was going to make a film

157
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,513
and using the living-room
or bedroom lamp

158
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,356
she made animals appear
on the walls, huge shadows.

159
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,235
This is a rabbit, this is a wolf,
this is an animal,

160
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,751
and she would make up stories
in forests

161
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,918
through those animals that
she cast on the walls.

162
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,356
When I die I Will return to reclaim.
