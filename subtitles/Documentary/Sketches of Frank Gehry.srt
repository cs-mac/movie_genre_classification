1
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,634
Is starting hard?

2
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:17,322
You know it is.

3
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:24,174
I don’t know what you
do when you start, but I

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,690
clean my desk, I make a lot of

5
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:31,128
stupid appointments

6
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:34,179
that I make sound important.

7
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:40,408
Avoidance, delay, denial.

8
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:48,118
I’m always scared that I’m
not going to know what to do.

9
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:54,020
It’s a terrifying moment

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,776
And then when I start,
I’m always amazed.

11
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:06,602
So, that wasn’t so bad.

12
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:13,388
#SKETCHES OF FRANK GEHRY#

13
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,589
If you’re a complete layman and
not an architectural specialist,

14
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:33,973
what’s so hot about Frank Gehry?

15
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:36,422
What’s all the fuss about?

16
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:39,941
#CHUCK ARNOLDI - ARTIST#
He’s changed the look of a very,

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,067
conservative field.

18
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:47,670
He mixes the freewheeling-ness of art

19
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,496
with something that is really concrete
#ED RUSCHA - ARTIST#

20
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:53,427
and un-forgiving which
is the laws of physics.

21
00:01:53,528 --> 00:01:56,997
And you put up a building,

22
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,946
and man, that thing has got to stand.

23
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,605
And I believe that all of his
buildings have been standing.

24
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,064
He’s an architect who is also an artist.

25
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:14,106
He takes risks, and that’s what artists do
#MILDRER FRIEDMAN - WRITER CURATOR#

26
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:19,126
artists take risks, to do something
new that no one has seen before.

27
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:21,642
I look on him as a
‘hyphenate’

28
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,758
as a writer – director.
#MICHAEL OVITZ- ENTREPRENEUR, ART COLLECTOR#

29
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:26,466
Someone who sits down,
conceives of something,

30
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:29,950
thinks it up, which is the
blank peace of paper in front of him.

31
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,182
Then has the ability to
execute it into a visual image.

32
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:37,303
He’s the leading architect
in the world today.

33
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,625
#PHILIP JOHNSON - ARCHITECT#
It’s very easy to say.

34
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,710
If you say ‘Wow’ when you’re in a place,
there must be something happening.

35
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:46,873
The challenge is to get it
in two dimensions on film.

36
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:50,119
Oh! Hopeless!

37
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:53,077
You better give it up
and become an architect.

38
00:02:55,853 --> 00:03:00,656
You see how this unfolds and is
welcoming, and is carrying you in?

39
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:04,797
That facade is not frontal.
That curve leads right into it.

40
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,279
Well, let me just shoot that curve.

41
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,718
Frank’s got his own original, and,

42
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,924
sort of perverse way of doing things.

43
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,638
We’ve been friends for several years.

44
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:19,889
And we’ve spent a lot of time
together bemoaning the difficulties

45
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:23,382
of trying to find personal
expressiveness within

46
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:27,696
disciplines that make
stringent commercial demands.

47
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:33,289
Several people approached him with the
idea of making a documentary about him.

48
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:38,314
When he asked me if I’d do
it, I thought he was crazy.

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,849
It’s not just that I didn’t know
anything about making documentaries,

50
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,544
I didn’t even know
anything about architecture.

51
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:47,345
That’s why you’re perfect, he said.

52
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:06,932
#CRAIG WEBB - DESING PARTNER#

53
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,419
Pretty funny.

54
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:16,154
It’s weird.

55
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:24,298
Well, let’s look at it for a
while, be irritated by it,

56
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,759
and we’ll figure out what to do.

57
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,617
What don’t you like?

58
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:35,025
I don’t know yet.

59
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:40,095
It seems a little pompous,
a little pretentious.

60
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,946
This is the part I don’t
know how to put in words

61
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:46,213
Ah, but that’s the most
important part!

62
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,476
If one of these guys came
down, and this guy came down,

63
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:57,115
and this one became part of that,
then I would start to like it.

64
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:10,741
Now this guy starts to.

65
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,013
That's not a good one.

66
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:19,677
This side, I still don’t like
this side, Craig, I still don't like it.

67
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,775
I know why I don’t like it, you know.

68
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,289
I'll tell you why I don't like it.

69
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,826
This has to get crankier see?
- Crankier?

70
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:47,450
I know how to do it.

71
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,055
Just corrugate it.

72
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,350
Wanna try it?

73
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:13,322
Oh God.
Heaven help us!

74
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:18,544
You need one less corrugation.

75
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,323
Like that, flatter.
- Two?

76
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:30,481
Yeah, two is great.

77
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:38,610
See how it works?
- Yep.

78
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:44,091
That is so stupid looking
it’s great!

79
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,397
It’s so stupid looking?
- Isn’t it?

80
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,803
It’s just.
Eee. Yeaaah!

81
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:58,005
I always liked making
things with my hands.

82
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:01,893
I remember my grandmother

83
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:06,577
used to get a sack of
woodcuttings for the wood-stove.

84
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,925
She’d open the sack and throw
the stuff out on the floor.

85
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:17,080
And sit down on the floor with
me and start building things.

86
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,202
We made cities and freeways.

87
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:25,198
It was so much fun!

88
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,092
When I was struggling ’whaddya
want to be when you grow up?'

89
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:34,075
Somehow I kept remembering sitting
on the floor with the blocks.

90
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,281
I thought, ‘maybe I could
do something like that’.

91
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,379
Do you remember the first
time you met Frank, Ed?

92
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:46,311
In the early 60s.

93
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,674
he was completely aligned
with artists and I found

94
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:53,786
that interesting somebody who was always

95
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:59,904
at art exhibits and parties with artists

96
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,452
not too many architects
mixed with artists.

97
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:06,344
My colleagues who were
doing architecture,

98
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:11,368
were making fun of what I was doing.

99
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,451
So I didn’t have much
of a support system,

100
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:18,862
I had a kinda blank stare.

101
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:24,281
And here were these funny artists
that I just loved – their work.

102
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,008
Were treating me like
I was part of the team.

103
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:30,112
the artists weren’t wed to tradition.

104
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:32,663
They could do whatever they want
and they’d respond on a gut level.

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,690
I don’t think they’re
heavy intellectuals.

106
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,991
I’m not saying they were stupid.

107
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:40,367
But, they didn’t come out of a school.

108
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,599
So they did what felt right.
What looked right, they manipulate things.

109
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:47,903
And push the limits without the
feeling of tradition or history.

110
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:52,257
And I think Frank got to the
feeling about architecture, y’know,

111
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,463
‘Hey, you get an idea,
why don’t you try it!’.

112
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:00,936
Berta found the house.

113
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,250
It was comfy and had a little garden

114
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,117
and we could afford it.

115
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,599
I realized I had to do something
to it before we moved in.

116
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,607
I loved the idea of
leaving the house intact.

117
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:22,196
I came up with the idea of
building the new house around it

118
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:32,218
The idea was this
little bungalow would give

119
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:35,281
Frank a kind of laboratory.

120
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,381
We were told there were ghosts.

121
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:45,134
I decided they were ghosts of cubism.

122
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,560
The windows, I wanted to make them look
they were crawling out of this thing.

123
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,302
At night, because this glass is tipped

124
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,674
it mirrors the light in.

125
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:01,272
So when you’re sitting at this table

126
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:05,154
you see the moon in the wrong place.

127
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,544
it reflects here.

128
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:10,338
and you think it’s up there and you
don’t know where the hell you are.

129
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,688
Frank seems to live in the moment.

130
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,669
#DENNIS HOPPER - ACTOR#
#LIVES IN A HOUSE BUILT BY GERHY#

131
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,656
I’d like to think that I do, but Frank
really does creatively live in the moment.

132
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:20,633
He takes an idea that someone
says, and finds out and what

133
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:25,335
they think they want and then
suddenly, he’s creating it.

134
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:28,284
The kind of materials
that he chooses to use.

135
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:33,489
I like to think of them as
used as building factories,

136
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:38,461
or building something that
we don’t think of as a house.

137
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:41,700
Let me tell you how
he finished his house.

138
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,698
One day he went up to shave in
the bathroom, and there was no light,

139
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:52,011
so he picked up a hammer,
and knocked a hole in

140
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:56,929
the ceiling, into the California
sun, and then he shaved by it.

141
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:02,222
At the same time as I did this house,
I was building Santa Monica Place.

142
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,904
The night Santa Monica
Place opened, we had

143
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:08,404
a dinner here with the
president of the Company,

144
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:12,821
and he says to me,
‘What the hell is this?

145
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:17,616
I said, well I was experimenting,

146
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,887
He said ‘do you like it?
He said you must like it.

147
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,420
I said, ‘I do.'

148
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:27,979
He said, ‘Well if you like this,
you can’t possibly like that’,

149
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,410
and he pointed, towards
Santa Monica Place.

150
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,973
And I said, ‘you’re right, I don’t’.

151
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:35,547
And he said
‘So why did you do it'

152
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,273
I said ‘I had to make a living.'

153
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:43,348
And he said, ‘Stop it!’ don’t do that.

154
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,664
Now at that moment,
forty-five people in my office

155
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:51,309
were working on projects for him.

156
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,507
And he and I shook hands that night
and decided to quit everything.

157
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:59,341
It was like jumping off a cliff.

158
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,019
And I was so happy from then on.

159
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,224
I mean, even with all the stress
of it, it just made me very happy.

164
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:03,423
Your decision to say no.
How did you go about that?

165
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:06,836
How did you assume you
would generate projects?

166
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:11,048
You get work through other
architects and designers,

167
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:16,079
mostly people I’d worked with
before, that liked my work,

168
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,795
and would bring me into projects.

169
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:23,184
It was touch and go you remember
I was always going bankrupt.

170
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,595
I know you were going to say that.

171
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,582
I still feel that even
though it’s not true.

172
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,942
Yeah I know, I know.
I can remember that.

173
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:35,513
I always thought I was pretending
to be a director. - Really?

174
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,870
Well, then at some
point it just went away.

175
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:45,769
And I felt, ok I’m a director.
I guess I’m a director now.

176
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,306
People started coming around and
saying things like, that I was talented.

177
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,824
That something
was going on.

178
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:15,357
When I was a kid my father
used to draw with me.

179
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,321
That was something I just loved doing.

180
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:23,706
What did you draw?

181
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:27,087
The only thing I remember.
I was about 13.

182
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:30,688
I drew a picture of
Theodore Herzl when I was in

183
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,709
Hebrew school.

184
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,243
And I remember the Rabbi pinning

185
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,560
it up on the board, telling
my mother in Yiddish that

186
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,656
I had ‘Goldene Hänt’,
I had Golden Hands.

187
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,381
we used to go to a summer
place in Northern Ontario.

188
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:59,832
And my mother had this
lady analyze handwriting.

189
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,447
The lady analyzed my handwriting and

190
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:08,509
said that someday I was going
to be a famous architect.

191
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,986
I don’t think that you
and I have ever talked

192
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,263
about how the architecture started.

193
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,666
I took a class in perspective,

194
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:38,568
with Mr Workman, and I failed.

195
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:40,527
I got an F.

196
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:43,832
I couldn’t stand it so I went back
and took it again, and got an A.

197
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:48,471
Then I took a class at USC in ceramics.

198
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,553
The ceramic teacher said
‘I have a hunch you should

199
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:54,688
take an architecture class,
'I'm going to enroll you at night.

200
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,628
Every Monday night there's
an architecture class.'

201
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:59,952
Got an A in the class.

202
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:05,113
And they recommended I go
into Second Year Architecture.

203
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:09,960
Then in the middle of
Second Year my teacher said

204
00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:15,710
‘Frank this isn’t for you,
you should get out of here.

205
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:19,301
It didn’t mean shit to me. I didn’t.

206
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:24,606
Aw wait a minute, this guy says to you this
is not for you and it didn’t devastate you?

207
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:27,313
It devastated me, but I didn’t give up.

208
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,517
And that was just before
the name change so.

209
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:36,713
Y’know you could rationalize
it as anti Semitism.

210
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:38,813
When did you change the name?

211
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:41,696
Ah, 1954 I think

212
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:44,621
What made you change it?
- My wife, my ex wife.

213
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,735
When she wanted something she just

214
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:49,011
got it.

215
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,871
So I was pussy-whipped
more than...

216
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,789
And it was hard.

217
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,938
For five years I would be introduced

218
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:07,153
as Frank Gehry and I’d
say ‘My name was Goldberg’.

219
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:13,191
We're going to bring the walls
in tighter and make them pourous.

220
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,489
That means these can't be solid glass.

221
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:28,429
We work back and forth between
the planning and the models.

222
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:32,320
So you make a bunch of plans and

223
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,842
then you try it on the model.

224
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,407
And then you come back and regroup.

225
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,598
So it’s a give and take because if this

226
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:45,638
doesn’t work, that doesn’t work.

227
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:50,721
This is the Museum of
Tolerance building in Jerusalem.

228
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,879
This is the bookstore.

229
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:01,078
What’s the material?
- I don’t know yet.

230
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,343
Probably be metal.

231
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:06,443
This is the Grand Hall.

232
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,824
You can imagine the kind of,
character of the light, coming through

233
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,935
This is a smaller version?

234
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,878
I always work on two
or three scales at once.

235
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:25,821
Keeps me real. - By changing scale,
why does that keep you real?

236
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:29,204
Because in my head it keeps me
thinking of the real building.

237
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,326
I don’t get enamored with
the object, these things.

238
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:36,414
I see, and you could.
- Yeah, It could become jewellery.

239
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,929
This could become the object of desire.

240
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:43,782
We started with this.

241
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:57,802
And there’s where the
transition happened here

242
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,348
this would be enormously
expensive and looks chaotic

243
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:09,230
Now, here it is here.

244
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,204
Wow!

245
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,794
Everything begins with the models.

246
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,218
The problem is the world runs on paper.

247
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:30,081
So we’ve had to devise ways
of automating drawings, so that

248
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:32,317
we can continue to feed
building departments and

249
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:36,001
inspectors and agencies and contracts.
#JIM GLYMPH - PARTNER, SOFTWARE SPECIALIST#

250
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:40,639
And the legal system, that are all
aligned against doing it this way.

251
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:45,327
What we have done is
elaborate on ways of digitizing

252
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:48,370
those models to bring them
into the computer so that

253
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:52,247
we can go from the
three-dimensional model to

254
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,783
two-dimensional drawings.

255
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:58,506
What it did was embolden
Frank to go farther,

256
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,858
he could actually be
more sculptural with more

257
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:05,357
confidence and with more accuracy.

258
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,626
What was critical was to bring the

259
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:11,392
technology into Frank’s
process in a way that

260
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:14,351
didn’t change him, or his process.

261
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:19,391
In the old days when you try to

262
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,902
document the building in two dimensions,
#SVEN NEUMANN AND EDWIN CHAN#

263
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:24,905
with a plan, with a
section, with an elevation,

264
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:27,784
your understanding
and your way to be able

265
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,938
to describe the building
is very limited, and the

266
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,446
contractor and the people
who are building it have to,

267
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:37,305
there’s an element of
interpretation there.

268
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:40,438
Whereas with this particular
process the level of

269
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:44,337
precision allows the
designer more flexibility,

270
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:50,428
and freedom to explore the shapes and
forms and the geometry of the building.

271
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:54,247
This model would get
sent to the contractor.

272
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,629
And then they would take that information,
#TIM PAULSON - 3D MODELING MANAGER#

273
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:01,270
extract it into a computer file and
send that directly to the manufacturer.

274
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:05,959
So theoretically there
is no need for paper,

275
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,650
unless they wan't it as a veryfication.

276
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:12,788
Frank still doesn’t know how to use a
computer, except to throw it at somebody.

277
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:16,106
But, he understood that this was an amazing
#THOMAS KRENS - DIRECTOR, GUGGENHEIM FUND#

278
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:20,349
tool that was suited to

279
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,575
his ability to pick up this cup,

280
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:25,930
crumple it up, stick it
on top of this building

281
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,055
and say, ‘That’s an
interesting shape, let’s see

282
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:30,802
if we can take that shape
into some sort of design.

283
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:35,302
I love the shaping I can
do when I’m sketching.

284
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:40,016
And it never
occurred to me

285
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,565
that I would do it in a building.

286
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:48,268
The first thing I built of like that is

287
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:51,829
Vitrain in Germany.

288
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:56,348
I was in a band, touring Europe.
#BOB GELDOF - MUSICIAN#

289
00:21:56,843 --> 00:22:00,473
I was into the fifth
week and was in that,

290
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:06,226
twilight state that occupies
your days when on tour.

291
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,939
my head was banging
against the condensated

292
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:11,764
window of a mid December afternoon.

293
00:22:12,126 --> 00:22:15,820
And I was just looking out
at the fields of Germany.

294
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:20,381
And across a plain green
field, suddenly this alarming

295
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:24,536
structure reared up and
jolted out of this state.

296
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:31,915
We got to Freiburg and I asked
‘What was it I’d just seen,.

297
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:36,231
And they said,
‘Oh that must have been Vitra’.

298
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:41,914
#VITRA FURNITURE MUSEUM - 1989#
#WEIL AM RHEIN, GERMANY#

299
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:49,289
I started playing with the spiral stair.

300
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:53,063
I loved the way that curve

301
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,537
read against the rectilinear.

302
00:22:56,713 --> 00:23:00,282
I tried to draw it with
descriptive geometry.

303
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,964
But when the guy built it,

304
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:05,111
there’s a kink in it.

305
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:08,787
The drawing didn’t represent
what really happened.

306
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,309
I got frustrated and asked
the guys in the office,

307
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,384
isn’t there a better way
to describe these things,

308
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:20,249
because I like to play
with curved shapes.

309
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:24,482
If I could just describe them.

310
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,880
That’s what led us to the computer.

311
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:31,248
To my knowledge it’s
the first building where

312
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:33,905
that new freedom and
new movement came.

313
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,852
#ROLF FEHLBAUM - CHAIRMAN, VITRA#
The snake, for instance,

314
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:39,464
that staircase is a snake,
and that was something very new for me.

315
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:41,909
Because I come from Switzerland.

316
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:46,576
A very static country, a
very static architecture.

317
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:49,157
And I think that the attraction was that

318
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:53,298
there was something strange,
a bit messy, but in the

319
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:56,774
end, these forces
unleashed found a new order.

320
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:01,546
Architects have a lot to answer for,

321
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,991
in as much as it is shite
99% of the time, and,

322
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,930
depresses people on their way to work,

323
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:11,714
And I adhere to an
English writer’s dictum –

324
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,729
Auberon Waugh, the son of Evelyn Waugh –

325
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,692
who suggested that should you meet an

326
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:18,459
architect at a party,
the best thing one could

327
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:21,693
do is hit them! I go
along with this until I,

328
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,366
encountered Frank’s work.

329
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:27,010
I grew up in Canada.

330
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:30,062
I used to go to lectures on Friday
nights at the University of Toronto.

331
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:33,213
I went to a lecture when I was 16.

332
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:37,436
It was actually November,

333
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:40,107
1946.

334
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,629
I went back afterwards
to find out who the guy

335
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:47,281
was that gave the lecture.

336
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:51,328
There was a white haired man got up

337
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,499
and spoke about stuff he was doing.

338
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,341
that really appealed to me.

339
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:02,404
I’d never seen buildings like that.

340
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,246
I didn’t go home and decide
I wanted to be an architect,

341
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:09,004
that was just in my memory banks.

342
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:13,631
After I became an architect I realized
that must have been Alvar Aalto.

343
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,767
I would say that my work is closer to

344
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:21,013
him than any of the other
previous generations.

345
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,824
How many years have you
been seeing Frank?

346
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,197
Thirty-five years.
#MILTON WEXLER - GEHRY'S THERAPIST#

347
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:35,355
I met him as a patient.

348
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:38,174
Ed Moses, the painter, sent him over.

349
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:40,760
Milton took me in.

350
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,271
After the second thing he said

351
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:47,390
"You’re in limbo with your wife."

352
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:49,825
He said I’ll treat you if you.

353
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,324
make up your mind, for three

354
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:56,022
or four months, you
either commit to stay home,

355
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,559
and make it work, or
you leave right now.

356
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:04,324
So I left his place, and
I left, Got my clothes and

357
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,958
moved to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

358
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:10,038
I had two daughters and a wife.

359
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,716
He lacked confidence.

360
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:19,070
He was talking often
about being bankrupt

361
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,983
and he meant more than
just monetary bankruptcy.

362
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,752
He meant bankrupt in his
relationships, bankrupt in his

363
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:31,457
ability to get his clients
to accept what he was doing.

364
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:36,155
He was always fighting, as a Jew,
#CHARLES JENCKS - ARCHITECT#

365
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:40,627
He had to show ‘em
that he was a toughie.

366
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:44,693
I was angry but I wouldn’t express it,

367
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:50,029
So Milton got me into that group

368
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:56,153
And for two years I went
and never said a word.

369
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:59,179
One day they all pounced on me.

370
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:03,572
They said ‘You’ve been sitting here
for two years, judgmental as hell.

371
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:08,058
and I realized that they were right,

372
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:12,242
because all of them were saying
it, I couldn’t dismiss it.

373
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:16,598
He looked up to me as some
kind of mature, adult figure.

374
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,919
Whether true or not,
that’s how he saw it.

375
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:23,922
When he realized that our roles were

376
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,870
changing, that he in a sense
was becoming the teacher

377
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:33,013
cos I didn’t know very much
about art or architecture.

378
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:36,187
I think it helped him to,

379
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:39,378
take on the role of the adult.

380
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:44,796
And also instead of trying
to seduce his clients,

381
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:48,921
I think he took on more adult roles

382
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:51,297
in relation to his clients.

383
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:55,397
He began to teach them as
he was trying to teach me.

384
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:59,991
To tell them what they needed to
see, how they needed to see it.

385
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:03,977
I think in that sense, my naiveté

386
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,019
was a very valuable
asset in the therapy.

387
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:11,392
We go through early life,
pre-occupied about ourselves.

388
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,702
The world revolves around our butts.

389
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:16,809
And as you mature, you
expand into the rest of the

390
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:19,886
world and you become part
of a world culture and

391
00:28:19,943 --> 00:28:24,758
you, sort of, find out -
the hard way even - that the

392
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:29,207
world doesn’t revolve around your
butt, and that unless you play team.

393
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:33,657
A lot of people think that I made

394
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:37,629
Frank a great architect,
which is total nonsense.

395
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:42,997
Eh,I didn’t make him famous, he made
me famous – just the other way around!

396
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:48,291
Matter of fact, after some
of the publicity about Frank

397
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,160
came out, a number of architects
wanted to come in treatment with me.

398
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:55,779
I always said no.

399
00:28:55,937 --> 00:29:00,850
I said no because I knew damn well
I could not make them Frank Gehrys.

400
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:05,734
I can open up the floodgates, but
if there’s no flood back there.

401
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:10,978
This guy that I studied with,
this great teacher that I had,

402
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:15,775
used to say that talent
was liquefied trouble.

403
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:21,673
Y’know there are certain
people where the trouble

404
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:26,763
doesn’t seep out into another
part of the brain where

405
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,021
it can be transformed
into something else.

406
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:38,987
All of it is frustration
with something as

407
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,919
it exists that you’re
trying to improve on.

408
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:45,019
You won’t remember
this but years ago when

409
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,646
we first met, you talked
to me about filmmaking.

410
00:29:48,726 --> 00:29:52,875
I was struggling with

411
00:29:56,949 --> 00:29:59,675
a commercial world.

412
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:02,867
They weren’t interested
in what I was doing.

413
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:05,565
And I talked to you about it one night.

414
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:07,880
And you said that you faced the

415
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:10,078
same commercial world,
and that you made peace

416
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:15,128
with it by finding this small percentage

417
00:30:16,521 --> 00:30:18,485
of space in that commercial world

418
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,286
where you could make a difference.

419
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:23,618
Man, that was amazing to me, Sydney.

420
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:27,197
I have never forgotten that. If
you hear in my talks after that,

421
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:30,106
I always talk about it that
way, I say, ‘There’s a sliver

422
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:33,341
of space’ I almost use your words!

423
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:53,422
Basically, and it’s
still more important to me

424
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:56,381
than architecture, is
Frank’s interest in hockey.

425
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,549
My sons are hockey players.
#MICHEAL EISNER - FORMER CEO WALT DISNEY CO#

426
00:31:00,607 --> 00:31:04,793
I spent hours at hockey rinks from
midnight to six o’clock in the morning.

427
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:06,968
There were not that many around LA.

428
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:10,783
And I would bump into this
guy who was not 22 years old.

429
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:14,436
I just struck up this
relationship with this person.

430
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:22,716
I was looking for the
next generation of American

431
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:27,569
architects, he was on the list of
architects who were pushing the envelope.

432
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,120
We bought a hockey team.
We needed a practice rink.

433
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:36,494
He designed for us the hockey
rink in downtown Anaheim.

434
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:39,368
It is a piece of sculpture
sitting in this town.

435
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:41,477
#DISNEY ICE - 1995#
#ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA#

436
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:45,140
And I think that and Bilbao and a
couple of other things are his best work.

437
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,403
The inside is reminiscent of those hockey
rinks that Frank grew up with in Canada;

438
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,664
all wood, all trusses, looks very

439
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:59,039
traditional, looks like
you could be nostalgic for

440
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,022
being in Toronto in 1940-something.

441
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,713
It is a double rink.

442
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:09,972
The outside is two, like,
well, I dunno, breasts?

443
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:13,217
I dunno, they’re like this,
so it’s a strange woman!

444
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:18,390
You give Frank the,
the functionality.

445
00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:21,453
Make sure that in the hockey
rink you have the workout room

446
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:23,578
and the locker rooms,
and all that stuff.

447
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:27,901
And you’re on Frank that way.
And then he delivers the picture.

448
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:35,631
Do you ever think of architectural
shapes unrelated to a job?

449
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:38,323
No, well.

450
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:42,615
I mean if I’m sitting around the house and
I put some music on, and the music

451
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:47,976
will suggest some sort of movement,, and

452
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:50,104
I’ll start thinking of shots.

453
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:53,832
I’m just wondering if there’s any.
- Yeah, there is.

454
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,209
When I saw that painting, this one

455
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,740
So this is in the Sainsbury
Wing, British Museum.

456
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:10,934
It’s a Hieronymus Bosch.

457
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:13,976
If you look at it,
this is a composition,

458
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:17,486
and I start thinking of it them
as a composition of buildings.

459
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,891
This is the floor plan
of the Israeli project

460
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:24,687
and creating a composition.

461
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:28,543
Mm, that’s exactly
- Now it’s not literal.

462
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:31,083
But I just find those kinds
of inspirations, and they

463
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:34,548
you just file them away somehow,
you don’t even know you’re doing it.

464
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:37,254
It comes out, right?
- Yeah.

465
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:40,160
That’s exactly what I’m
talking about. Where

466
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,619
where it’s disconnected
from a specific job.

467
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,127
Once I saw this, that way.

468
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:49,096
I mean, I’d actually seen
this painting before, and never

469
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:51,765
connected with it like I did that day.

470
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:54,441
And I got to the painting
and it dropped me.

471
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:59,174
y’know, like I felt the, the
ground cut out from under my legs,

472
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:03,353
it was so powerful. And
I saw it as architecture.

473
00:34:05,682 --> 00:34:08,444
I think that’s what gives me confidence.

474
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:11,889
Once you get it embedded,
you do it, because

475
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,938
you’re confident that
it’s going to work.

476
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,843
And I think what some
of my colleagues do.

477
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:20,174
they think of architecture
in a hermetic way.

478
00:34:20,214 --> 00:34:22,227
It’s, it’s X.

479
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:24,651
And it’s not X plus, it’s not X minus.

480
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:28,704
It’s X. It’s got
restrictions, it’s got rules.

481
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:31,907
If you do this with it.

482
00:34:32,046 --> 00:34:34,021
It ain’t architecture any more.

483
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:42,100
Everything’s been done before,
in some way or another.

484
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:47,026
The only thing that
changes is the technology.

485
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:50,784
What bugs me are these goddamn rules

486
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:54,617
that my profession has, as to
what fits, and what doesn’t.

487
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:01,639
There is a certain threatening
aspect to taking the leap.

488
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:05,607
But once you try that.

489
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:10,393
Once you say, ‘Ok I have
a right’, you can’t stop.

490
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:14,606
#GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM BILBAO - 1997#
#BILBAO, SPAIN#

491
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,657
I understand what you mean that
everything has been done before,

492
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:26,564
but I haven’t seen a
building like Bilbao.

493
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:29,788
It’s gotten more sensual, and musical.

494
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:32,457
Where did all that come from?

495
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,115
I think it just evolved.

496
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:38,503
I was looking for a
way to express feeling in

497
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:41,729
three-dimensional objects.

498
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:47,500
You know, if you go back in history,
if you go into Chartres Cathedral,

499
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,930
it drops you to your knees.

500
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,542
He just let go.

501
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,500
He began to develop all
of the ideas that he’d been

502
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,839
beginning to work with
#MILDRED FRIEDMAN - WRITER, CURATOR#

503
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,847
and went the whole way there.

504
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:07,182
I don’t think there’s a building
that comes anywhere near it in

505
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,886
inventiveness in this
period of our history.

506
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,086
I swear I don’t know why,

507
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:17,578
it moved me just as much at
#PHILIP JOHNSON - ARCHITECT#

508
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:20,518
the end of two days as it
did when I first walked in.

509
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:24,889
Well he sees that the whole reason for

510
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,578
being an artist is that moment

511
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:31,042
in somebody’s eye when you’ve
reached them. - That’s it!

512
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:33,523
The most impressive cathedral at

513
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:35,547
the end of the 20th century is to
#NORMAN ROSENTHAL#

514
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:38,387
me, without question,
the museum in Bilbao.

515
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:41,895
You see it and you
gasp with astonishment!

516
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:45,008
It’s like a vision
of a kind of paradise.

517
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:48,460
I don’t even know him, I’m
not an intimate of his at all.

518
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,536
It has reminiscences of things.

519
00:36:51,672 --> 00:36:53,643
You walk down into the entrance and
#JULIAN SCHNABEL - ARTIST, FILMMAKER#

520
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:56,030
you feel like you’re in Luxor.

521
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:59,267
It has the scale of Egypt.

522
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,107
What’s important is to be satisfied
with what you and the light.

523
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,364
See, that’s the one thing that
Frank understands, is light.

524
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:12,306
See, it’s the shape of light as it hits

525
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:15,533
another shape.
oh boy oh boy.

526
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:18,381
And then, as you put
it, it’s peripheral.

527
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:20,925
Architecture is nothing but peripheral.

528
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:25,171
When Bilbao came up we moved
on a lightening track.

529
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:28,539
The Guggenheim would select
three architects: Frank Gehry,

530
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:31,082
Arata Isosaki and Coop Himmelblau.

531
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:33,725
Each firm would be given $10,000,

532
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:38,741
one site visit and three weeks
to come up with a concept.

533
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:42,721
I remember we rented a suite
of rooms, in Frankfurt.

534
00:37:45,718 --> 00:37:48,593
We flew up there on the 17th of July,

535
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,703
assembled all the models,
spent a day in deliberations

536
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,369
and when we emerged, Frank
was selected as the architect.

537
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:56,568
#JUAN IGNACIO VIDARTE
- DIRECTOR GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM BILBAO#

538
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,652
I think, eh, I don’t know who
said this, I think it was a British

539
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:02,757
journalist, but I think he said
that this looked like it was an

540
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:06,865
object from outer space but which
had landed here a century ago.

541
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:09,572
So it’s foreign in the sense that
it has nothing to do with any of the

542
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:11,748
buildings which are
around, but at the same time

543
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:16,571
there is a a quality of it which
makes it belong to its place.

544
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:18,712
You take this out of here and nobody

545
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:21,003
would understand the city now.

546
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,334
We have 350,000 inhabitants

547
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,409
in the downtown.

548
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:29,626
The first year we
received 700,000 visitors.

549
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,559
And then a kind of community
#NEREA ABASOLO - JOURNALIST, BILBAO#

550
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:37,094
self-esteem has increased so much.

551
00:38:37,152 --> 00:38:41,050
We have moved from admiring
the architect to be proud

552
00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:44,384
of being the clever ones
who did this project and

553
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:47,801
have chosen this architect,
and we have this building

554
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,980
which the whole world admires.

555
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,473
When I see a building like
the building that Frank made,

556
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:16,421
I want to stick my stuff in there.

557
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:19,801
It makes me feel encouraged,

558
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,961
it makes me feel like, Hey,
there’s somebody that’s, like,

559
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:25,114
setting up an arena where
something incredible could occur.

560
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:31,562
He threw down the glove

561
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:35,050
let’s put something
in here that can really

562
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:38,242
take somebody into that
transcendental state

563
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:40,529
that you feel when you’re making art.

564
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:51,376
We need some sort of naysayer
in this whole discussion,

565
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:54,063
and if that’s me, that’s fine.
#HAL FOSTER - PROFESSOR OF ART, PRINCETON#

566
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,535
But I am ambivalent about his work.

567
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:59,998
He has used the expanded field of art,

568
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:02,054
the expanded field of sculpture.

569
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:06,500
As sculpture and art in
general became bigger,

570
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:09,652
broader, moved out into

571
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,520
wider and wilder sites.

572
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,053
When it came time to make
a museum, Gehry used that

573
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:20,618
expanded scale as an
opportunity to trump it,

574
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:23,580
in effect, with a building that

575
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:26,331
really functions as a spectacle.

576
00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:29,268
So I’m not sure how well it serves art.

577
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:33,940
Either you believe in the white cube,

578
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:38,006
or you are Frank and you say that
artists want to be challenged.

579
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,419
I think museum people are very torn.

580
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:46,136
The great thing about
Bilbao is that it does both things.

581
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,598
What Frank calls the ‘stodgy
galleries’, the very very simple,

582
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,997
sort of old fashioned rooms.

583
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:58,625
And then he did a lot of spaces
that are really extraordinary.

584
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,543
For me, I like to have enough room.

585
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:05,987
I feel very comfortable in his spaces.

586
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,851
He understands scale.

587
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:13,928
And if it does compete with the art,
maybe that art isn’t good enough.

588
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,378
Everyone seemed to embrace

589
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:23,194
this building and this
architect as the great

590
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:27,905
new form, the great new
form-giver of our time.

591
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:31,765
And I just, I just don’t,
I just don’t see it.

592
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:36,080
There are moments where I think where
he has delivered the goods too quickly.

593
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:40,914
He has given his clients
too much what they want.

594
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:45,655
Kind of a sublime space that overwhelms
the viewer and a spectacular image

595
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:48,625
that can circulate through the media

596
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:51,807
and around the world as, as brand.

597
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:54,885
People have this idea, What
is the architect’s service,

598
00:41:54,906 --> 00:41:57,666
The service was to be appropriate, ok?
#HERBERT MUSCHAMP - THE NEW YORK TIMES#

599
00:41:57,742 --> 00:41:59,962
That was the big word.

600
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:03,903
Which means ‘blend in, nobody
notices, camouflage’.

601
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:08,268
Y’know, put up a new 70-storey
office building but make

602
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,157
it look like the little
art-deco thing right next door.

603
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:13,755
So, who gets anything out of that?

604
00:42:13,815 --> 00:42:16,730
You have to not only talk about the freedom
but you also have to talk about the courage

605
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,256
of an architect who had
the conviction to say,

606
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:22,313
‘Well that’s not what
architecture should be

607
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,475
doing and that’s not what
cities should be doing’.

608
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:27,144
I never expected Bilbao to be the,

609
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,178
kinda, hit it turned out to be.

610
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,307
In fact, when it opened I was
very self-conscious about it,

611
00:42:34,925 --> 00:42:39,837
and thought, ‘My God, what have I done?'

612
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:03,974
Somebody asked me once about
Frank’s ego, and I said, you shouldn’t

613
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:08,020
be put off by the
Columbo-like exterior the

614
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,276
crumpled raincoat and,
the self effacing manner,

615
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:15,083
I said, Frank’s got the
biggest ego in the business.

616
00:43:15,186 --> 00:43:17,872
And the reason that I know
this is that he also has

617
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:22,536
a perception of the process
that instead of reacting

618
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:26,661
negatively to a criticism,
he’ll basically say the

619
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:29,001
reverse of what you
might expect somebody with

620
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:32,200
a big ego to say, ‘Let’s just
rip it apart and start again’.

621
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,167
Because he knows that when
he does it a second time

622
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:38,206
he does it from a higher
plane of knowledge.

623
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:41,891
Now that’s real ego.

624
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:44,329
I act like nothing’s happening, y’know?

625
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:47,409
I’m ‘aw shucks. Bubby.’

626
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:51,881
Whereas inside
I’m ambitious, I’m eager,

627
00:43:53,686 --> 00:43:56,062
I’m, competitive as hell.

628
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:58,839
But I cover it up.

629
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:04,950
There is nobody that strives for

630
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,447
excellence that isn’t
competitive in some way,

631
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:14,138
But even if you and I are in different
business I probably compete with you.

632
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:17,679
I have this conflict
about that, that, I want to

633
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:21,695
be a nice guy, I don’t
wanna be in your face,

634
00:44:21,915 --> 00:44:24,601
and yet I am in your
face, I am ambitious.

635
00:44:24,684 --> 00:44:27,045
I think that’s the
same with the work, it’s

636
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,359
you know, when I got
to Bilbao and saw it for

637
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:35,620
the first time I got embarrassed.

638
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:38,255
I thought ‘Oh my God, how
did they let me do this?

639
00:44:38,296 --> 00:44:40,674
Well, you also have to consider
his wife, Berta.

640
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:42,855
She’s part of the whole equation too.
#ED RUSCHA - ARTIST#

641
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:47,807
Because, y’know, he had this,
eh, anger on the one hand.

642
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:52,740
And then his family life was stabilized,

643
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,841
and that’s probably kept him afloat.

644
00:44:55,897 --> 00:44:59,397
At first they had all kinds of
rough-edged conflict.

645
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:05,686
For example, Berta
wanted to be married.

646
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:09,735
Frank had been married and he
didn’t care about being married.

647
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:12,580
Then he decides, ‘Ok, I’ll get married.

648
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:15,123
He became this much
softer, much more accepting,

649
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,274
much more loving person.

650
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:21,075
Less defiant, less
uncertain, less angry.

651
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:24,903
He seems so calm and
together and sweet.

652
00:45:25,118 --> 00:45:27,507
And yet his architecture shows

653
00:45:27,587 --> 00:45:30,477
something completely
opposite.

654
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:38,672
There are sort of rules about

655
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,560
architectural expression.

656
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:47,066
Screw that!

657
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:50,428
I’m going to do what I do the best,

658
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,408
and if it’s no good, the
marketplace will deny it.

659
00:45:55,262 --> 00:45:57,530
#MILTON WEXLER - THERAPIST#
I think as he became more

660
00:45:57,611 --> 00:46:00,772
confident in his
relationships, I think that

661
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:03,270
he became more daring in the willingness

662
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:06,595
to fantasize far-out stuff.

663
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:10,255
I’m watching everything, y’know.

664
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:14,836
I can get excited about some fashion
thing, or some crystal chandelier.

665
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:20,153
I’m tempted to say it’s
Frank’s right brain.

666
00:46:20,232 --> 00:46:23,083
There’s something, in that right brain,

667
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:26,475
that allows him to take
those free associations,

668
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:29,097
and then make them practical realities.

669
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:32,145
If you asked me to simply
describe Frank’s work,

670
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:34,890
I’d call him a contemporary
Cubist sculptor.

671
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:39,303
Frank uses shapes and
forms unlike anyone has

672
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:42,190
ever used them in the
building of a structure.

673
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,964
Years ago a reporter asked
me how I get my inspiration.

674
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:51,440
Just intuitively I pointed
to the wastebasket beside me.

675
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,735
And I said, ‘Look in there, y’see.

676
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:56,522
think about the caverns and the spaces

677
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:59,776
and the textures in that waste basket’.

678
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:04,566
You know you can look
anywhere and find inspiration.

679
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:21,343
It was by accident that I
got into the fish image.

680
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:26,044
My colleagues were starting to
replay Greek temples.

681
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:30,078
Y’know in the post-modern thing, I
don’t know, when was that. the 80s.

682
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,596
And eh.

683
00:47:32,736 --> 00:47:36,110
That was hot, everybody
was re-doing the past.

684
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,573
I said, y’know,

685
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:41,654
Greek temples are anthropomorphic.

686
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:46,578
And three hundred million
years before man was fish.

687
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,806
If you wanna, if you gotta go
back, if you’re insecure about

688
00:47:49,886 --> 00:47:51,803
going forward,

689
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:56,385
dammit, go back three
hundred million years.

690
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:58,849
Why are you stopping at the Greeks?

691
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:01,943
So I started drawing
fish in my sketchbook.

692
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,114
and then, I started to realize

693
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:10,187
that there was something in it.

694
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:17,351
You know that story of his
famous Formica furniture?

695
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:21,079
Frank looked at this material,
which is the most pristine material

696
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,024
in the world, and it’s so
uptight, that he said to

697
00:48:25,063 --> 00:48:27,261
himself, ‘It’s not me,
y’know, I can’t do this.

698
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:31,701
And he just, eh, was rattling around,
and broke it up into little pieces.

699
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,667
He took it and he threw
it on the floor in fury.

700
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:39,009
And some of the pieces suddenly
looked to him like fish scales,

701
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,188
He immediately thought ‘AHA!’

702
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:45,298
#GEHRY FISH LAMPS - 1980#

703
00:48:45,637 --> 00:48:49,147
A good friend of mine was
designing this building.

704
00:48:49,507 --> 00:48:52,233
He said why don’t you put a
little sculpture on the corner

705
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,255
This hotel is a Ritz
Carlton and the guy who

706
00:48:56,314 --> 00:48:59,722
owned Ritz Carlton at the time
was in Tennessee, in Nashville.

707
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,606
He couldn’t come to the meeting when we
made the presentation, so he sent his guy.

708
00:49:03,686 --> 00:49:05,684
And he kept getting down,

709
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:08,581
crouching down and taking this picture.

710
00:49:10,337 --> 00:49:12,999
A few days later the client
called me up and said,

711
00:49:13,279 --> 00:49:17,816
‘We got problems. I’m
building a multi-million

712
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:20,346
dollar hotel and I ain’t
going to have my patrons

713
00:49:20,366 --> 00:49:22,933
looking up the asshole of a fish!’

714
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,846
#FISH - 1992#
#BARCELONA, SPAIN#

715
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,188
Do you recognize big changes

716
00:49:59,754 --> 00:50:03,760
in your work over the last 30 years?

717
00:50:04,186 --> 00:50:08,146
Well, my starting days as an
architect I was involved with

718
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:13,024
less expensive buildings.

719
00:50:13,102 --> 00:50:16,147
I couldn’t afford to pay for that

720
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,510
beautiful detail.

721
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:22,315
In the early 60s, Venice
was a place of cheap rents.

722
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:25,707
The artists would come
in. Larry Bell was one

723
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,749
and Larry began putting

724
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:32,322
up these interior walls, in his studio.

725
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:38,431
and leaving them bare,
where all the scars show.

726
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:42,162
And showing the scars

727
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:45,230
became a kinda thing that a

728
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:49,359
lot the artists were doing
out of practicality, and

729
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,102
then finally out of a kind
of style thing, that Frank

730
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:56,789
also began waking up to.

731
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:59,788
I grew up a modernist.
#O'NEILL HAY BARN - 1968#

732
00:50:59,847 --> 00:51:01,763
‘Decoration is a sin’.

733
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:04,462
That’s the mantra of Modernism.

734
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:07,976
So if you can’t use
decoration, then how do you

735
00:51:08,034 --> 00:51:10,952
humanize a building, how
do you humanize a thing?

736
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,030
Materials could be expressive.

737
00:51:16,051 --> 00:51:18,920
He was really making a statement
that architecture was very much

738
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,769
about the materials as well as
about the design and the look of it.

739
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,976
It was all to do with
making the most of little

740
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:30,324
bits of throwaway things
such as industrial material.

741
00:51:30,383 --> 00:51:32,705
Picket fence, corrugated
metal and chain link.

742
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:34,979
#DAVIS RESIDENCE - 1972#
#MALIBU, CALIFORNIA#

743
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:38,551
Jasper Johns was doing it.
Rauschenberg was doing it.

744
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:41,347
They would
make beauty with junk.

745
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,994
#GEHRY RESIDENCE - 1978#
#SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA#

746
00:51:44,094 --> 00:51:47,619
When he was doing that chain-link
stuff, he went to Mickey Rudin’s house.

747
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:51,251
And Rudin said to Frank, ‘What are

748
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,143
you doing with that ugly
chain link, how stupid that is.

749
00:51:55,162 --> 00:51:58,122
I mean, you’ll just destroy
the looks of the world.

750
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:02,586
You’ll make the whole world uncomfortable
with that damn chain-link of yours’.

751
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:06,584
Frank said, “Mickey, come on
over to the window, will you?

752
00:52:07,355 --> 00:52:09,475
What do you see out there?

753
00:52:28,452 --> 00:52:31,655
#EDWIN CHAN#
#DESING PARTNER#

754
00:52:32,098 --> 00:52:35,255
You know what’s confusing to
me is what you see from here?

755
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:39,514
Perhaps what you do is there’s
still kind of a a grade situation.

756
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,459
So it’s like a bridge?
- A little.

757
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,212
Well if you do that,
y’know, you could almost

758
00:52:45,273 --> 00:52:48,830
do that and walk under
it to the lakefront.

759
00:52:48,888 --> 00:52:50,832
That would be the ideal.
- Yeah I know.

760
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:54,621
I mean if we do this it takes it out
of the realm that I was worried about.

761
00:52:55,004 --> 00:52:57,317
Well I wasn’t worried about that.

762
00:52:57,729 --> 00:52:59,723
I know, you don’t worry about the
same things that I worry about!

763
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:01,685
I wasn’t worried about
it, I’m more naïve!

764
00:53:01,788 --> 00:53:06,032
Edwin is more contentious with me
than Craig is, have you noticed? - Yes.

765
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,799
For me that’s great, because it
makes it all much more interesting.

766
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,157
He’s been with me for fifteen years.

767
00:53:14,197 --> 00:53:18,084
For the first five years
he was here, he didn’t talk.

768
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:28,071
Now, fifteen years later I
can’t stop him from talking.

769
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:33,338
I don’t think I could do the
buildings alone any more.

770
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:36,233
I’ve gotten so used to

771
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,013
the team to play with.

772
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,729
He surrounds himself with good people.

773
00:53:43,828 --> 00:53:45,808
What he likes to do is, he gets

774
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:48,051
a vague idea, kinda very loosely.
#CHUCK ARNOLDI - ARTIST#

775
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:50,081
‘Well, y’know, something
kinda like, something

776
00:53:50,121 --> 00:53:52,589
kinda like this, kinda
likeyou know, what I’m

777
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,964
thinking is something kinda like.
I mean is something kinda like that.

778
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:58,166
this kinda thing is more what I got
in mind, you’know what I mean?

779
00:53:58,207 --> 00:54:00,737
And the guys’ll be standing around and
they’ll say, ‘Yeah, I think I got it Frank’,

780
00:54:00,777 --> 00:54:02,825
and they’ll run off and they’ll do some
stuff and they’ll come back and he goes.

781
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:05,439
‘No no no, not quite like
that, I thought I said a

782
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:07,730
little bit more like this.

783
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,427
you know. gosh, you guys
have just, y’know, I want you

784
00:54:10,428 --> 00:54:13,016
to really kinda more like
that, you know what I mean?

785
00:54:13,136 --> 00:54:16,219
No but if you see the stair,
like you see here, where it ends.

786
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,356
Where it’s sticking out?
- Yeah, do that.

787
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:21,729
The communication is almost
non-verbal.

788
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:30,458
A quick sketch, or a reference to

789
00:54:30,538 --> 00:54:34,059
a painting or a piece of sculpture
and he’ll say, ‘Try this’.

790
00:54:40,089 --> 00:54:43,205
I’d rather go to that
middle color titanium.

791
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:46,448
That would be beautiful.
See that red titanium?

792
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,525
But are you sure it’s
not going to be too red?

793
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,328
The other day we were
doing our offices.

794
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:56,892
He sent me a fax, where I was, and

795
00:54:57,013 --> 00:55:00,429
he said ‘Would you mind
if we flipped the plan?

796
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:03,470
So that’s typical Edwin. You
know, I would do that myself,

797
00:55:04,605 --> 00:55:07,828
if he wasn’t there. But he’s there.

798
00:55:09,302 --> 00:55:11,962
I think of it as an opportunistic thing.

799
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:14,783
Maybe one of the kids in
the office, just the way he

800
00:55:14,923 --> 00:55:17,705
put the model together that
day made me see something.

801
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,627
They see they’re part of it.

802
00:55:23,044 --> 00:55:26,691
So it engenders a
great sense of teamwork,

803
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:29,801
which gets you to the end.

804
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:44,422
Craig and I will go home
tonight, individually. separately.

805
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:47,391
and we’ll agonize
about this.

806
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:52,094
And we’ll come in tomorrow.
And we’ll say.

807
00:55:52,235 --> 00:55:56,344
and we usually come to the same
conclusion when it’s wrong, right?

808
00:55:57,178 --> 00:56:01,109
And what makes it wrong, is.
What’s wrong is that it’s too easy.

809
00:56:01,213 --> 00:56:04,870
Wait, wait, wait! - Or. or we think
we’re falling into some kind of cliché.

810
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,938
Or we already did it.
- Ah, that’s different.

811
00:56:08,049 --> 00:56:10,789
That’s different than ‘too easy’
What do you mean by ‘too easy’?

812
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:13,443
Too easy is.
I guess I gotta suffer a little before.

813
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:16,193
Ah, but that’s neurotic!

814
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:19,914
How do you tell the difference between
an aesthetic discipline and neurosis?

815
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:29,028
You know, you hire Frank
because you just love him

816
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:31,214
and you want him to do
whatever he wants to do.

817
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:34,191
And people are real
encouraging, ‘Oh be far out’.

818
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,522
But he starts getting far
out and they all fall in love.

819
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,538
’Oh I love that!’. Yeah, but he doesn’t.

820
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:41,416
He wants to change it. Until
it becomes a frustration game

821
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:43,806
where, ‘when are you
going to finish thing?

822
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,779
It looked good forty times
and you’re still going’

823
00:56:50,328 --> 00:56:53,085
What’s exciting to me is the process.

824
00:56:54,357 --> 00:56:56,435
And when people look
at this stuff because

825
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:59,047
it looks like it just happened.

826
00:56:59,267 --> 00:57:03,783
They don’t realize how much time
and effort went into the incubation.

827
00:57:04,277 --> 00:57:08,095
So I’m always compelled
to explain all that.

828
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:21,487
do you get the impulse first and that’s
what makes you go after the job?

829
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:23,488
No, I don’t go after the job anyway.

830
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:26,096
I wait till the jobs hit me on the head.

831
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:28,440
I guess I don’t like rejection.

832
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,406
So I just wait until
they just come to me.

833
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:32,974
Because when you go after it
and get rejected, I hate that.

834
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:37,565
And I accept the projects based
on whether I like them the people.

835
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:42,426
Frank has figured out, which some
architects don’t quite figure out,

836
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:48,054
is that the most important influence
on the design is the client.

837
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:52,553
And if there is a terrific
client to work with,

838
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,720
you get a terrific building.
If there isn’t, you don’t.

839
00:57:55,797 --> 00:57:58,447
I started talking about water.
#BARRY DILLER - CEO, IAC INTERACTIVE GROUP#

840
00:58:00,948 --> 00:58:04,508
because he likes
boats, and I like boats.

841
00:58:04,546 --> 00:58:06,965
I said to him that my real dream,

842
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:11,096
here, would be, that one day,

843
00:58:12,403 --> 00:58:16,002
I would sail up the
Hudson on my new boat,

844
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,424
and as I got past

845
00:58:20,304 --> 00:58:24,125
Battery Park, and coming
up the Hudson, there,

846
00:58:26,508 --> 00:58:29,549
next to the water,
would be this building.

847
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:35,027
And the next thing, Frank
did his little squiggles,

848
00:58:36,748 --> 00:58:39,500
and it’s essentially that!

849
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:44,897
And what it was that he
created was sailcloth.

850
00:58:45,173 --> 00:58:48,148
I mean, the idea of making a white

851
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:51,704
building is, is a little insane!

852
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:57,002
How do you make a white
building that from the inside,

853
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:59,450
actually, you can look out.

854
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:03,826
So then began this, this odyssey.

855
00:59:06,908 --> 00:59:09,719
And also, it was, let’s do
the whole thing in glass.

856
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:12,245
Nothing else but read glass.

857
00:59:12,528 --> 00:59:16,328
No steel, no aluminum,

858
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,607
just glass.

859
00:59:23,036 --> 00:59:27,547
any problem that comes up,
he finds some solution to,

860
00:59:28,017 --> 00:59:30,045
there’s some thing that

861
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:33,779
you never figured out,
that he goes away and

862
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,775
comes back and solves it.

863
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:38,822
What’s the process like?
Did he ask you questions?

864
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,461
Did you guys just
free-associate together?

865
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,438
Did you just talk?
- I don’t.

866
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:46,480
It’s not like, eh, y’know,

867
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:48,907
would you like square or round windows?

868
00:59:48,945 --> 00:59:52,766
Or would you like eh,
y’know, flocked wallpaper?

869
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:54,791
I mean, no. It’s not a query.

870
00:59:54,848 --> 00:59:56,767
He doesn’t really ask you.

871
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:00,804
He smells, y’know? You
talk, I mean, he sucks up

872
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:03,489
whatever is going on in the room.

873
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:09,459
With Frank, the work of models,
constantly screwing around with them,

874
01:00:09,498 --> 01:00:11,736
ripping something out.
You know?

875
01:00:11,754 --> 01:00:14,771
Or just molding it almost.

876
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:17,323
It’s like clay work.

877
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:21,819
Eh, is such a profoundly
creative process.

878
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:25,774
I mean, it’s not like
any building project

879
01:00:25,775 --> 01:00:27,679
I’ve ever understood.

880
01:00:28,588 --> 01:00:32,721
Literally if you go back and
you take the little squiggle,

881
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,751
the whatever it’s referred
to in the pro jargon?

882
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,562
Whatever that is?
That’s that!

883
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:43,256
I think I have a talent not
for recognizing artistic genius,

884
01:00:43,312 --> 01:00:45,255
but for recognizing talent.
#PETER LEWIS - CHAIRMAN PROGRESSIVE CO#

885
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,283
I loved what he was doing.

886
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:50,131
And, I kept getting, during the

887
01:00:50,207 --> 01:00:54,044
from the day we started,
I kept getting richer,

888
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:57,565
and busier.

889
01:00:57,725 --> 01:01:00,835
And he kept becoming
more and more well known.

890
01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:05,654
And then as the adventure of the
design of the house proceeded,

891
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:09,929
it was wonderful.
I mean, it was so exciting.

892
01:01:09,964 --> 01:01:13,212
I’d go out there and he
was able to do research,

893
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:16,079
on material, and design
things that he never

894
01:01:16,136 --> 01:01:18,288
woulda had the money to do. And I said,

895
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,579
‘Look, you just give me
bills for whatever you do,

896
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:23,587
just keep sending me bills, and if
I have a problem I’ll talk to you’.

897
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:27,151
And I never had a problem. They
turned out to be six million dollars.

898
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:30,513
Jesus!
- And, if I had to do it over again?

899
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:34,032
I’d do it again. - Well, what
happened? Why didn’t it get built?

900
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:36,921
Oh. Well, we went on
for about twelve years.

901
01:01:36,982 --> 01:01:40,747
And I think what happened
between the age of fifty and sixty,

902
01:01:41,942 --> 01:01:46,338
I no longer wanted to live in a
big house, or give big parties...

903
01:01:46,556 --> 01:01:49,108
My lifestyle changed.

904
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:54,098
What started out to be a dream would’ve
been a disaster I was building a museum.

905
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:56,909
When we sat down for that last meeting and
the number was eighty two million dollars!

906
01:01:56,948 --> 01:01:59,224
That was it!

907
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:03,840
The trouble with having the glass
here is that the top of it goes up into

908
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:05,931
this gable, which is really awkward.

909
01:02:10,649 --> 01:02:13,777
I liked this awkwardness here before.

910
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:16,775
This is a building we did, pro bono

911
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:19,460
for the memory of a friend of ours.

912
01:02:23,045 --> 01:02:26,969
That was the original design for Maggie’s
Place up there, that little model.

913
01:02:27,672 --> 01:02:31,343
I had these nightmares, that
Maggie was talking to me, and that

914
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:35,566
that was too much architecture
and she wanted me to tone it down.

915
01:02:35,647 --> 01:02:37,926
And I threw out the thing
and started over again.

916
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:41,962
Having worked with Maggie
he understood the idea

917
01:02:41,963 --> 01:02:44,231
of the center, which is to be an
informal space for cancer patients.

918
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:46,166
#MAGGIE'S PLACE - 2002#
#DUNDEE, SCOTLAND#

919
01:02:46,226 --> 01:02:49,258
He took on this commission at his
own cost, because he was a great

920
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:52,706
friend of Maggie’s, you know,
eh, we’re not paying him a penny.

921
01:02:53,044 --> 01:02:57,518
And em, out of love for Maggie, I
think he really is committed to a

922
01:02:57,597 --> 01:03:02,372
notion of an architecture
that relates to healing.

923
01:03:06,728 --> 01:03:10,572
Informality, non-institutionality
and a certain amount of

924
01:03:10,675 --> 01:03:13,801
humor and places for
reflection are very important.

925
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:20,452
It’s a very nice place to get up
and look out over the landscape.

926
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:24,221
That’s terribly important
for the cancer sufferers,

927
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,115
to see their illness in a context

928
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,769
which is bigger than themselves.

929
01:03:33,129 --> 01:03:35,316
Why did you come to Los Angeles?

930
01:03:35,419 --> 01:03:37,505
My father got sick.

931
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:41,985
Y’know it was those days when they
said, Go to the southern climate.

932
01:03:43,117 --> 01:03:45,606
He was broke, he lost everything,

933
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:50,840
What kind of work did he try to do?

934
01:03:50,979 --> 01:03:55,217
He became a truck driver for
Yankee Doodle Pop Company,

935
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:59,760
and I got a job truck driving
in the Valley, for a cousin.

936
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:03,445
This is where we lived, in here.

937
01:04:03,962 --> 01:04:08,071
We just didn’t have anything.
It was really rough.

938
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,586
You got a job as a truck driver
how long did you do that?

939
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:12,616
Two or three years.

940
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,073
I delivered a breakfast nook
to Roy Rogers and Dale’s house.

941
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:22,921
I came from Canada, I didn’t
know from movie stars, right?

942
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:26,194
I couldn’t believe it. And
they treated me like family,

943
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,375
they invited me to Christmas dinner!

944
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,906
How do you get out of driving
a truck to something else?

945
01:04:32,987 --> 01:04:35,698
What I was interested in as a kid then.

946
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:40,302
my cousin used to take me
up flying, and I loved it.

947
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:50,655
So I got a job washing airplanes.

948
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:54,698
Where did this come in terms of. - Before
architecture, before architecture.

949
01:04:55,037 --> 01:04:57,950
So I was freaked out
in love with flying.

950
01:04:57,971 --> 01:04:59,896
So I could’ve gone that
way, y’know, if somebody had

951
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:08,395
just taught me how to fly, I
probably would’ve been happy.

952
01:05:09,337 --> 01:05:13,178
It’s funny how it feels almost fragile

953
01:05:13,238 --> 01:05:16,828
the way people discover things that are

954
01:05:16,848 --> 01:05:20,811
meaningful for their
whole lives, y’know.

955
01:05:20,874 --> 01:05:22,811
I feel the same way.

956
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:29,516
If I have a big envy in my
life, it’s about painters.

957
01:05:29,797 --> 01:05:31,953
I wish I was a painter.

958
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:38,136
What I’m fascinated with
is the moment of truth.

959
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:42,555
There’s the canvas,
you’ve got a brush and you

960
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:46,350
got this goddamn palette
of colors, and whaddya do?

961
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:50,610
What’s your first move?

962
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:54,566
I love that dangerous place!

963
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:02,374
Have you ever tried to paint?
- Never! I wouldn’t dare.

964
01:06:04,368 --> 01:06:07,374
because I wouldn’t know what to do.

965
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:10,351
I know how to do a building.

966
01:06:16,204 --> 01:06:18,653
Since a building
ultimately is a surface,

967
01:06:18,654 --> 01:06:21,684
it’s ultimately got
something to do with painting.

968
01:06:26,085 --> 01:06:28,980
But I’ve never been able to achieve

969
01:06:28,981 --> 01:06:32,372
what in my mind is a painterly surface.

970
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,390
Oh yeah?

971
01:06:56,415 --> 01:06:59,430
Y’know you look at the Charioteer,

972
01:06:59,431 --> 01:07:01,824
that sculpture in Delphi.

973
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:10,281
And it says ‘Artist Unknown’.

974
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,648
And it’s one of the most
beautiful pieces of sculpture,

975
01:07:14,732 --> 01:07:17,672
when I saw it I started
crying, Sydney, because.

976
01:07:18,013 --> 01:07:21,306
How powerful that is, that
the guy doesn’t have his name,

977
01:07:27,367 --> 01:07:30,005
That’s antithetical
to democracy I think.

978
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:32,677
And I’m hoping that out
of democracy comes an

979
01:07:32,755 --> 01:07:37,399
expression that is the
consensus is democracy

980
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,066
How does that express itself?
It expresses itself chaotically.

981
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:47,148
And that chaos, we’re
starting to feel, is beautiful.

982
01:07:47,514 --> 01:07:51,016
Frank believes in accidents,
but I think it’s important to say

983
01:07:51,058 --> 01:07:53,387
that some of his
accidents are failures, and

984
01:07:53,447 --> 01:07:55,479
some of his work is extremely ugly.

985
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,626
People shy away from saying
that because they are.

986
01:08:00,017 --> 01:08:02,444
In a sense his reputation
is so strong now.

987
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:07,179
Of the anti-Frank Gehry contingent,
is there anybody that hits the spot?

988
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:11,460
Well, when I see something
negative, I usually try it on.

989
01:08:13,732 --> 01:08:16,204
I try it on for size.

990
01:08:16,523 --> 01:08:19,224
I wear it, I think, well
maybe there’s something here.

991
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,931
I must get something out of it,

992
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:30,645
But I don’t digest it intellectually,
I don’t take it in as a.

993
01:08:31,003 --> 01:08:33,078
’Oh I gotta do this,
or I gotta do that’.

994
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,365
A reporter just did a
thing saying that Toronto

995
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:39,723
deserved to get a Museum of Modern Art,

996
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:43,277
instead they’re getting a
second-rate Frank Gehry building.

997
01:08:43,438 --> 01:08:47,309
Even Marty Filler,
who I like, wrote about

998
01:08:48,067 --> 01:08:51,105
Chicago and said he thought
it was ‘Logo-tecture’.

999
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:55,251
So, that was his way of, of
saying I’m repeating myself.

1000
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:57,380
How does that affect you,
when you read that?

1001
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,433
I just keep going.
I don’t’ pay attention.

1002
01:08:59,474 --> 01:09:01,551
I mean, what am I gonna do?

1003
01:09:02,002 --> 01:09:04,489
#WHY ALL THE HOOPLA?
HAL FOSTER#

1004
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:09,495
#HULKING MASS?#
#GENIUS OR A MESS?#

1005
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:14,851
#PERVERSE#
#SPECTACLE, OPPRESSIVE#

1006
01:09:15,453 --> 01:09:20,396
#COMPLETE DISREGARD, MONSTRISITIES#
#UGLY#

1007
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:26,492
I think of it as water going down
a gutter, and suddenly this wonderful

1008
01:09:26,572 --> 01:09:29,225
bubble has come up above
all the other water.

1009
01:09:29,347 --> 01:09:33,184
And they can’t wait to,
like, pop the bubble and bring

1010
01:09:33,264 --> 01:09:36,196
it down under the water and
push it down into the bottom.

1011
01:09:36,357 --> 01:09:38,547
As a critic I think it’s, it’s.

1012
01:09:38,605 --> 01:09:43,337
incumbent upon me to, to
make an emphatic stand.

1013
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:48,578
To, kind of, hold a line of disagreement

1014
01:09:48,938 --> 01:09:51,798
so that other people
are not simply caught up

1015
01:09:51,898 --> 01:09:54,433
in the culture of
affirmation, the culture of

1016
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:57,394
embrace, that has surrounded Gehry.

1017
01:09:57,554 --> 01:10:00,188
This is the only history we’re
going to be living in, ok?

1018
01:10:00,247 --> 01:10:02,412
This is the one, we can read
about the ones that came before,

1019
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:04,621
this is the one that’s happening now.

1020
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:10,325
And fortunately there are a
few people who understand how to

1021
01:10:10,365 --> 01:10:13,542
respond to these challenges
and Frank Gehry is one of them.

1022
01:10:13,801 --> 01:10:16,397
There is only so much
that architecture can do.

1023
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:19,616
But what he’s serving is the

1024
01:10:19,653 --> 01:10:21,847
‘so much’, and trying to realize it.

1025
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:26,732
If you had to criticize Frank,
what would you criticize?

1026
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,729
I wouldn’t.
I wouldn’t criticize him.

1027
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:32,585
Because I think it’s like, eh, y’know,

1028
01:10:32,586 --> 01:10:35,780
flies flying around
on the neck of a lion.

1029
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:41,777
It’s like, y’know, watching a movie

1030
01:10:41,778 --> 01:10:45,819
like Apocalypse Now, and saying

1031
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:50,073
that you think that Robert
Duvall is over the top.

1032
01:10:58,316 --> 01:11:02,317
Because buildings take
so long to realize,

1033
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:08,018
by the time I get to the finished
building, I don’t like it.

1034
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:22,439
What takes over, what makes you
forget all the little trivia,

1035
01:11:23,224 --> 01:11:26,008
is then the way the
light hits the material

1036
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:30,639
the reflections you didn’t
have in the models and drawings.

1037
01:11:34,435 --> 01:11:37,543
That’s how it lives.
#WALT DISNEY CONCERT HALL- 2003, L.A#

1038
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,709
The only thing an architect
can do is be optimistic

1039
01:11:50,748 --> 01:11:54,353
about how it interacts with
the surrounding buildings.

1040
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:59,783
It can be a passive player, it can be a
stoic player, it can be a passionate player.

1041
01:12:01,594 --> 01:12:04,217
I don’t like the Chandler.

1042
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:09,160
But it’s here, and it’s
part of the community.

1043
01:12:09,335 --> 01:12:13,944
So you have to respect that I think
that’s like being a good neighbor.

1044
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,975
I tried to make a building that would

1045
01:12:19,036 --> 01:12:23,864
preserve the iconic
importance of the Chandler.

1046
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:27,430
To defer to that I decided
to break down the scale of the

1047
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:31,812
Disney Hall into smaller pieces,
so it’s not the same language.

1048
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,492
It relates to the Chandler

1049
01:12:43,055 --> 01:12:47,505
Now the shapes of the exterior of
Disney Hall are based on sailing.

1050
01:12:49,004 --> 01:12:53,018
When you’re wing-on-wing, with the wind
behind you, it forms a beautiful space.

1051
01:12:54,308 --> 01:12:57,697
And if you look at the front of
Disney Hall, it’s wing-on-wing,

1052
01:12:58,215 --> 01:13:02,221
it’s the two sails,
and you’re at the helm.

1053
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:08,508
This is the foyer, and
here, when you look up,

1054
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,079
you’ll be able to see the levels.

1055
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,509
No matter how great the design is,

1056
01:13:15,567 --> 01:13:17,800
if it doesn’t sound great,
it’s going to be a failure.

1057
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,218
Frank was very clear
about this from the beginning.

1058
01:13:20,236 --> 01:13:22,436
#ESA-PEKKA SALONEN#
#MUSIC DIRECTOR, LA PHILHARMONIC#

1059
01:13:22,493 --> 01:13:25,090
He said, ‘This is a hall for the
orchestra, and this is a building for music.

1060
01:13:25,148 --> 01:13:30,075
And that has to be the first priority, and
everything else is of lesser importance.

1061
01:13:30,135 --> 01:13:33,596
And I thought this was quite
a statement from an architect.

1062
01:13:34,322 --> 01:13:38,496
It’s very unusual that an artist
such as Frank puts the ego bit to a,

1063
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:42,088
sort of, lower level of importance than
the actual function of the building.

1064
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:21,462
Ok, let’s get the hell
out of here then.

1065
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:33,234
Holy shit! Where’s the
beer, where’s the beer?

1066
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:39,546
Do you ever get depressed
when it’s finished?

1067
01:14:39,586 --> 01:14:41,679
Like post-partum blues?

1068
01:14:41,794 --> 01:14:43,821
A little bit.
Yeah, I do.

1069
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:47,119
Well you know that better
than I do! You can’t let go.

1070
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:52,743
When I let go is a year
later after it’s test of time,

1071
01:14:52,802 --> 01:14:55,506
didn’t leak. people like it.

1072
01:14:56,137 --> 01:14:59,315
Then I sort of let myself
out a bit and enjoy it.

1073
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:02,530
Do you ever wonder what
part of you did that?

1074
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:05,108
Where did that come from?
- Yes, oh yeah, all the time.

1075
01:15:05,186 --> 01:15:07,388
I say, ‘How the. Where
did that come from?

1076
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:09,639
Yeah, I do.

1077
01:15:09,915 --> 01:15:13,238
It’s like a magic trick.
I call it a magic trick.

1078
01:15:14,204 --> 01:15:17,561
But you know when I was a
kid taking that ceramics class

1079
01:15:17,602 --> 01:15:20,293
at SC before I came an
architect, Glenn Lukins.

1080
01:15:20,908 --> 01:15:23,501
I’d you’d put the glaze on and the

1081
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:26,023
stuff, you’d put it into
the kiln, and it would come

1082
01:15:26,099 --> 01:15:29,734
out looking so beautiful
sometimes, and you’d say

1083
01:15:31,004 --> 01:15:35,500
I’d say to Glenn, ‘God that’s
beautiful, I didn’t. how did that happen?

1084
01:15:36,343 --> 01:15:39,318
And he said, ‘Just
claim credit for it from

1085
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:42,229
now on, because somehow
you made it happen!’

1086
01:15:53,901 --> 01:15:57,251
So you haven’t seen any
of this all together?

1087
01:15:57,530 --> 01:16:00,351
When I came last it was a mess.

1088
01:16:01,153 --> 01:16:03,885
Looked very precarious, like
it might not happen right.

1089
01:16:03,963 --> 01:16:06,560
#DG BANK - 2001#
#BERLIN, GERMANY#

1090
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:12,680
You get scared and you wonder, ‘God
what are these people going to think?

1091
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,571
I wanna hide under the covers!

1092
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:20,402
I know the feeling very well.
- I know you do!

1093
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:27,035
The structural engineer on this is a
guy from Stuttgart, Jörg Schlaich.

1094
01:16:27,114 --> 01:16:30,903
He’s my age, and I think
he’s probably the best living

1095
01:16:30,982 --> 01:16:34,059
structural engineer in the world.

1096
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:43,983
You know why this floor is like this?

1097
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:47,612
Because the offices down below, by code,

1098
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,857
have to have a certain amount of light,

1099
01:16:49,936 --> 01:16:52,107
and the only way we could
get it, and to have this

1100
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:55,182
balcony, was to make it a glass floor.

1101
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:06,335
You know, I’m not going to get
to live here, and stay here.

1102
01:17:06,395 --> 01:17:09,179
So I’m only going to see
it today, and I leave.

1103
01:17:09,259 --> 01:17:12,006
And maybe I’ll see it three
or four more times in my life.

1104
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:17,319
For me, it’s like one of my children.

1105
01:17:21,777 --> 01:17:24,541
and I love it.

1106
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:29,170
So what’s next Frank?

1107
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,037
Is there anything you haven’t
done, that you want to do?

1108
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:35,022
I’m superstitious, so I never say that.

1109
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:41,070
When you’re a younger
architect and starting out,

1110
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:43,365
you’re seeking some kind
of impossible perfection.

1111
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:50,963
You could spend your life thinking
about this ephemeral building that would

1112
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:54,586
be great to do y’know, it would be the.

1113
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,088
the capstone of my career.

1114
01:17:59,599 --> 01:18:04,305
You realize, as you mature,
that there’s no ‘there’.

1115
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:07,883
You ain’t gonna get there.

1116
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,459
A great many people come
to me hoping they can change

1117
01:18:12,537 --> 01:18:16,881
themselves and, settle
their anxieties, their

1118
01:18:17,005 --> 01:18:19,838
problems in their marriage, or whatever.

1119
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:23,208
They want to know how
to handle life better.

1120
01:18:23,805 --> 01:18:28,580
When an artist comes to me, he wants
to know how to change the world.
