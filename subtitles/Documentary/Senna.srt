1
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,597
We did not think that karting
could become a career.

AYRTON'S FATHER
MILTON DA SILVA

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,270
But it has become a
big part of our lives

4
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,471
and we are a bit worried because
then along came Formula One.

5
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,038
May God protect him forever.

6

AYRTON'S MOTHER
NEYDE SENNA

7
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,959
All the dangers are my biggest fear.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,032
I would like to thank him
because he is a good son

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,955
and this year he has worked
very hard and honestly.

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,194
For me, it is more important than any title.

11
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,152
The time has come.

12
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,074
Ayrton is ready to ride in a Formula
One car for the first time.

13
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,758
I believe it was God
who gave me this opportunity,

14
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,838
I've been waiting for a long time.

15
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,590
And now it is helpful
to remain calm, tranquil, relaxed.

16
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:33,754
1984

17
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,754
Ayrton, this is a beautiful city,

18
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,527
with wonderful streets to walk,
but unsuitable to host a race, no?

19
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,624
REGINALDO LEME

20
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,532
Indeed. I arrived at the last minute

21
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:47,205
and I was surprised.
I've never been to Monaco.

22
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,533
I did some testing

23
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,569
And fortunately, I managed
to adapt to the track.

24
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:59,441
There is no margin for error:
any error would result in an accident.

25
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,414
But for now, I'm satisfied.

26
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:07,756
I was travelling a lot, as a
Formula One journalist

27
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:10,762
when Ayrton began to be noticed
driving a Toleman.

VOICE OF REGINALDO LEME
GLOBO TV COMMENTATOR

29
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,063
Toleman was not a winning team.

30
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,138
The car was bad and never won a race.

31
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:28,812
That's why what Ayrton did in Monaco
was true genius.

32
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:13,618
Ayrton Senna overtakes Keke Rosberg

Ayrton Senna
takes second place!

36
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,602

VOICE OF JAMES HUNT
1976 FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPION

38
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,818
Incredible!

39
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:23,756
Ayrton raises his arms
and gestures with enthusiasm!

40
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:27,158
Celebrating as if he won the race!

41
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,492
If we had continued for a few more laps,

42
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,801
I am sure Ayrton would have passed him.

43
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,943
I had a serious chance of winning.

44
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:41,305
But until you cross the finishing line
in first position,

45
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,642
it is impossible to make a prediction.

46
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:46,308
Formula One is politics, money

47
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:50,450
and while you are making your way through it,
you must deal with such things.

48
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,664
Ayrton Senna
the new star of Formula One!

49
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,200
Appearing for the first time
on the Formula One podium

50
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,743

AYRTON'S MOTHER
NEYDA SENNA

58

For example, he always paid attention
in the classroom at school,

59
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,743
so he didn't have to study at home

60
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:28,577
and so he had more time
to play on his go-kart.

When the conditions were bad

66
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,775
he had a higher gear.

67
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:46,754
The Estoril race was incredible.

68
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:50,994
He lapped all his opponents except one.

69
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,332
It is wonderful!
An extraordinary feeling.

70
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,241
I am very happy because,
in my second year in Formula One,

71
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:07,034
I managed to fulfill my first dream,
which was to win my first Grand Prix.

He was very nervous.

It was as if he bore the weight
of the world on his shoulders

98
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:31,505
because he now had the responsibility

it began to rain.

It was incredible. I could not believe
I was going to win the championship,

Despite all the anxiety and tension.

I feel so much peace.

136

It is as if someone had removed

He is very humble and imporoves the

142
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:24,968
He shares his victory with us.

143
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:26,270
I admire him very much.

144
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:27,503
He is a very brave man.

145
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:28,637

It is one of the few things
that we can still be proud of.

148
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:37,246
Once, I asked Ayrton
"When will you think about quitting?"

149
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:40,553
He said, "Mum, the day I am
the champion I will stop."

150
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,990
In my heart,
I knew that was not true.

We noticed that he had changed between
the beginning and the end of the year.

157
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:12,752
Because he had found himself.

158

He had discovered who he was.

159
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:20,121
It was a process that reached

As a Christmas present?

172
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,386
What I really want, I cannot say here!

173
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:17,012
Why not?

174

Senna and Prost. Prost and Senna.

183
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:55,119
The order of the grid is always one or the other.

184
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:56,918
It is a war between them.

185
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:58,647
For the French driver Alain Prost,

186
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:01,852
he believes his teammate is unfair to him.

187
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:04,862
and these disagreements could
affect the rest of the season.

189
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:12,763
Grand Prix after Grand Prix they were
more and more distant from each other.

"He wants war."

193

After a little more time,

Prost jumped into the lead.

Finally they clash! It goes in the favour of Prost.

206
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:16,513
If the race ends like this,
Prost wins the title.

207
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:22,559
But, for Ayrton Senna it is a no win situation.

208
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:57,425
Nannini passes.

209
00:31:57,796 --> 00:32:00,356
Nannini is now in the lead.

00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:05,898
Senna is still in the pits.

211
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:14,306
Senna is back on track,
but he is far behind Nannini.

212
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:16,040
Catching up is almost impossible.

213
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:19,307
It's all or nothing,
five laps to go.

214
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:22,842
It will be a suicidal race for Senna,
if he decides to try anything.

215
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,955

As the wait was prolonged, the more people feared
that the decision was becoming political.

237
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:07,082
The decision taken by the
team of FIA Commissioners

at the Grand Prix of Japan

239
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:13,454
is to exclude the number one car
and its driver, Ayrton Senna,

00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,563
from the final outcome of the race.

After the race, a giant screen has
repeatedly shown the incident

and everything that happened to
enable Senna's return to the track.

243
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:28,869
After reviewing these images,
race officials have concluded

244
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:33,415
that Senna failed to use the
chicane to resume racing

245
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:37,251
Senna has infringed Article 56

a six-month license suspension for Senna.

he found it easier to attack me.

The fact that I believe in God,
the fact that I have faith in God,

00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,754
is not to say that I am immortal,

It does not mean that I am immune from
danger, as has been said.

he did the opposite,
waving the flag of his country.

00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:33,728
Come here.

335
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:44,238
Quiet, Ayrton.

336
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,816
Today, I fought hard.

337
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:58,586
I wanted to finish the race
and finish in first position,

338
00:56:58,662 --> 00:57:01,028
because He is the greatest

339
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:03,630
and He will give me this
race after all.

340
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,328
That's what happened.

341
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:08,802
It is God who gave me this race
and I'm happy.

342
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:10,840
It was thrilling.

343
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:04,850
All hail the Brazilian Senna
for his victory. Congratulations.

345
00:58:04,995 --> 00:58:07,463
I thank all of Brazil.
I thank all the fans.

346
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:11,126
This weekend I felt so
much warmth around me

347
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:14,193
that we could not do anything but win.

348
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:16,102
It could not have been any other way.

349
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:17,331
And we did.

VIVIANE SENNA
AYRTON'S SISTER

353
00:59:30,547 --> 00:59:33,038
there were a lot of people asking for help

354
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:38,187
for personal problems. Sometimes hospitals

355
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:42,157
and charities sought his
support and donations.

326
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:47,354
Ayrton gave donations and tried to work things out.

357
00:59:48,265 --> 00:59:51,291
But did not want to make random donations.

358
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:59,339
He wanted to develop a whole thing,
something organized and structured

359
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:04,270
to help Brazil, especially the children.

three-time WORLD CHAMPION

Ayrton Senna of Brazil,
three-time Formula One World Champion!

344
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:38,791
A lifetime dedicated to this moment

345
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:43,394
by a genius of international sport.

346
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:46,499
Three-time world champion
and many other titles ahead of him.

347
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:48,576
And only 31 years of age.

348
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:52,375
Thirty three wins, three world titles.

349
01:07:52,482 --> 01:07:56,351
Breaking record after record.
He celebrates as only Senna can do.

350
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:01,949
The third world title puts Senna
amongst the greatest of all time.

351
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:27,847
It is very special for me.

352

I want to hug him and kiss him.

I have got a box with

Everything you can imagine.

358
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:05,151
He is the only good thing in Brazil, right?

359
01:09:29,879 --> 01:09:32,370
It is a wonderful party.

360

Anything goes. What matters is happiness.

361
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:37,812
Have you spoken about Formula One today?

362
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:41,379
Formula One is too rigid.
Today is Carnival.

363
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:52,024
Have any of your girls
ever told you: "Faster, Ayrton?"

364
01:09:57,206 --> 01:09:58,730
Yes.

365
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:02,968
Ayrton acheiving the third world title

367
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:06,503
was the culmination of a script
he had written for himself

368
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,311
well before entering Formula One,

369
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:11,717
because he knew he could do it
and could do even more.

370
01:10:12,522 --> 01:10:15,855
The great idol of sport in Brazil.

371
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:20,355
With the third title, he became
the world's great sporting idol.

NIGEL MANSELL WORLD CHAMPION 1992

374
01:13:00,723 --> 01:13:02,213
The negotiations were lengthy

375
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:05,089
and we still do not know who will be
Prost's teammate.

375
01:13:05,327 --> 01:13:07,659
The three-time world champion has signed

376
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,561
a two-year contract with Williams

377
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:11,827

I'm pretty sure of one thing:

380
01:14:03,953 --> 01:14:08,117
I'm the one that has more to lose.

381
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:11,249
if I had to stop for a year or more,

382
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,262
Because I'm at an age near the peak of my career

489
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:20,234
and the number of years in the career
of a Formula One driver is limited.

383
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:27,838
So if I stop, I'd lose out
more than anyone else,

384
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:31,242
both professionally and personally.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF WILLIAMS DRIVERS

395
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:25,112
For Ayrton Senna, it is
a race against time.

396
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,215
He has to attune himself to be an integral
part of the team and adapt to the new car.

397
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:31,218
He says he is not yet comfortable.

398
01:18:31,286 --> 01:18:35,946
The car no longer has the electronic
components used last year.

399
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:40,585
He is without traction control, special
brakes and active suspension.

400
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:46,362
The cars are much less stable

401
01:18:46,468 --> 01:18:50,564
without the electronically controlled suspension.

402
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:54,598
As a result, they are more difficult to drive

403
01:18:54,977 --> 01:19:00,040
and it is very likely that more cars will leave the track.

404
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:05,379
So we might see more cars crashing,
giving more excitement to the audience.

405
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:08,249
Also for us, as long as nothing happens to the drivers.

406
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:11,884

We met four years earlier. I already met him.

Knew him by name, or in person?

423
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:35,119
I know him because I follow
Formula One and then we met in person.

Why are you so nervous, then?

him we always become emotional.

God asked me to speak to him.

443
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:47,885
He opened the Bible and
read a passage that said

444
01:29:47,962 --> 01:29:52,990
God would give him
the greatest gift of all,

445

It means that the safety car

On the sixth lap, Michael Schumacher is
trying to put pressure on Senna.

460
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:30,887
IN CAR CAMERA
AYRTON SENNA LAP 6 OF 58

461
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:14,999
Bad impact for Senna.

462
01:33:15,703 --> 01:33:17,330
At the Tamburello curve.

463
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:22,634
A very serious accident.

464
01:34:19,468 --> 01:34:22,492
VOICE OF PROFESSOR SID WATKINS
F1 DOCTOR

465
01:36:25,126 --> 01:36:26,650
There was a lawsuit?

467
01:36:28,162 --> 01:36:32,826
In my opinion,
the steering column broke

468
01:36:33,067 --> 01:36:34,932
and the car became uncontrollable.

469
01:36:35,503 --> 01:36:39,269
But above all, it was inevitable

470
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:45,336
because the car crashed
at such an angle. The suspension arm

471
01:36:45,413 --> 01:36:47,108
went into his helmet.

472
01:37:26,454 --> 01:37:28,854
BOLOGNA, ITALY

473
01:37:36,731 --> 01:37:41,794
SAO PAULO
4th MAY 1994

474
01:37:47,642 --> 01:37:51,601
He was my idol.
He represented the best of Brazil.

475
01:37:53,814 --> 01:37:55,076
I miss you, Senna.

476
01:37:55,283 --> 01:37:57,979
I will never forget you.

477
01:38:01,022 --> 01:38:04,856
Brazilians need food,
education, health

478
01:38:04,926 --> 01:38:06,120
and a little joy.

479
01:38:06,194 --> 01:38:07,286
The joy has been removed.

480
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:28,958
AYRTON SENNA DA SILVA
21/03/1960 - 01/05/1994

481
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,958
Nothing can separate me from the love of God.

482
01:42:03,297 --> 01:42:06,824
Ayrton Senna died at the age of 34.

483
01:42:08,335 --> 01:42:10,394
As a result of his death,

484
01:42:10,471 --> 01:42:12,769
the FIA appointed
Professor Sid Watkins

485
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,001
to improve safety in Formula One.

486
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:19,671
No fatalities have occurred in
Formula One since.

487
01:42:21,515 --> 01:42:23,540
The Ayrton Senna Foundation,
founded in 1995 by his sister Viviane,

488
01:42:23,617 --> 01:42:26,177
has helped to educate more than 1.2
million needy children in Brazil.

489
01:42:28,989 --> 01:42:31,389
Alain Prost is a member of the
advisory board of the foundation.
