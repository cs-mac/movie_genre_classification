00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,600
<i>Episode 15</i>
I ordered you to destroy this cup.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,100
How dare you ignore my orders?

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,200
How is it that this porcelain

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,300
was found in your belongings?

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,300
Are you planning to sell this

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,700
or did someone order you to bring it?

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,300
No. I didn't plan to sell it

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,600
nor was I ordered to keep it.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,400
I just...

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,400
couldn't destroy such a precious cup.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,400
A precious cup?

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,300
Yoo Tae Pyung.

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,500
You ignored my orders

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,300
just to keep an ugly cup like this.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,700
You have no reason to be in Bunwon.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,700
I was wrong, Bunwon Chief.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,400
Here, take this.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,100
And, right in front of me,

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,400
break it with your own hands.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,500
I said break it!

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,300
You can't do it?

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,300
If you can't do it,

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,570
then I will do it myself!

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,700
Stop!

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,700
How can you hit someone with a cup?

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,600
What is the meaning of this?!

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,500
This person hid a cup that had been 
ordered destroyed.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
She tried to sell it off.

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,500
I was only trying to discipline her
 to maintain order at Bunwon.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,800
Please, turn a blind eye on this.

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,300
Isn't this my late mother, Goong Bin's, possession?

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
No, it's not, Your Highness.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,300
This doesn't belong to the Palace.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,700
It's a spare cup, after the others had been
 dedicated to the King.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Regardless, doesn't it belong to the Palace?

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,000
Isn't it another one made by the same ceramist?

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,700
This cup that the King was so pleased with . . .

39
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Why did you order it be destroyed?

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,300
I'm sorry. But isn't managing Bunwon's porcelain

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,500
my job, since I'm the Chief?

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,000
It is my judgment that

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,500
this cup does not match the 
grace of the Royal family.

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,300
Chief Lee!

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,300
I will not listen to your excuses.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
Leave.

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,200
Your Highness..

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
I said leave!

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,300
Was this that important to you?

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Pardon?

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,100
You came in by changing your name 
and even your gender.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,000
You didn't even have that much determination?

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,000
You should have broken it.
You should have done it to prove to him.

54
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,600
How can you risk being kicked out
just because of being unable to break a cup?

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,100
It was made by my father, Your Highness.

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Then... How could I...

57
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,300
break it with my own hands?

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,000
Hide it well.

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,500
His Majesty,

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,100
said it was a cup that felt dearer and
 prettier the more he looked at it.

61
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,300
Until you can comprehend the King's words,

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,700
cherish this cup.

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Tae Pyung, that kid,

64
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,100
she kept the cup that was ordered to be broken?

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,900
Isn't this a crime serious enough 
for us to kick her out?

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
Do you think she wasn't aware of the gravity?

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
However, with Tae Pyung,

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,600
Prince Gwang Hae is behind her.

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,500
How does a menial worker have
 Prince Gwang Hae as her backer?

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
How can this happen?

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,300
The problem right now

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,900
isn't about a menial worker.

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,500
A person called Moon Sa Seung
 has entered Bunwon.

74
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
You probably heard of him, too.

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
Moon Sa Seung

76
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,000
is the previous Bunwon Chief 
who didn't acknowledge me.

77
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
What would be the reason that Prince Gwang Hae

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,000
brings someone like that into Bunwon?

79
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,600
He intends to

80
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,300
eliminate me, the Bunwon Chief.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,300
If I, your father and Bunwon Chief, fall,

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
you'll also lose your place here.

83
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,600
The legacy of our family's reputation
as ceramists will come to an end.

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,300
Before they can attack us, 
we should move to get rid of

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Tae Pyung and Moon Sa Seung.

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
We'll start with the ones

87
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,500
who work for Prince Gwang Hae.

88
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,700
Your Highness, thanks to you, I can
 once again protect my father's porcelain.

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,600
I am so happy as if I were reunited with my father.

90
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,100
The reason you had to pretend to be a man.

91
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,800
The reason you had to change your name. 
I understand it now.

92
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,800
Pardon?

93
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,600
Just because you're a girl, you've already 
had to go through so many hardships.

94
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,100
If they found out that you were Yoo Eul Dam's
 daughter, the things that could happen...

95
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
I am very worried.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,700
Your life is more important than my pride.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,000
So, definitely,

98
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,300
don't let them find out you're 
Yoo Eul Dam's daughter.

99
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Just live as Tae Pyung,

100
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,500
until you become a ceramist.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,700
Your Highness...

102
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Why are you crying?

103
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Because, Your Highness, is so worried about me.

104
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm very grateful and

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,700
very sorry...I couldn't keep myself from crying...

106
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,300
I apologize.

107
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,600
You . . .

108
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
You are indeed, Jung.

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
Jung.

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Your Highness.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,700
If I order you to stop at this point . . .

112
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,500
if I order you to give up your dream 
of becoming a ceramist,

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
would you listen to me?

114
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,900
This is the only path for me.

115
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Because I took this path, I found Father's porcelain,

116
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,300
and Your Highness is calling me Jung again.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,200
Right now, I feel like the whole world is mine.

118
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,200
I'm so joyous and happy.

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,100
Jung,

120
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm indebted to you.

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,300
How should I help you from now on?

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,100
Your Highness,

123
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,600
it's enough for me that

124
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
you're calling me Jung again.

125
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,100
Please don't worry anymore, Your Highness.

126
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,500
Please just

127
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,400
watch over me

128
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,800
as I take this path.

129
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,500
Teacher.

130
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,800
Teacher, why are you here?

131
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,000
You didn't know?

132
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm in Bunwon too now.

133
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,400
Why, Teacher?

134
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,200
Why else?

135
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,200
Is it because of me?

136
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,700
It just happened this way.

137
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Didn't your father make that?

138
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,400
How can you go around carrying that?

139
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,600
His Highness gave it to me.

140
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
What are you going to do if someone sees? 
 Give that to me.

141
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,300
I can't!

142
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,600
His Highness told me to keep it well.

143
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,500
If the Bunwon Chief sees this, what will you do?

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,300
Just give it to me!

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
I said no, Teacher!

146
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,400
Hurry, give it here..

147
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Tae Pyung was your student, Chief?

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
No.

149
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,300
What do you mean by student?

150
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,300
She's a long distant relative of mine
 who cooked for me and did my laundry.

151
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,900
She was so disobedient that I kicked her out.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,500
Now she's here causing trouble.

153
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Ddek! (Scolding remark)

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,800
Come here! Did you think you could run far?

155
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,500
Come with me!

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,300
Come on! Follow me!

157
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,500
It's my father's cup.

158
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900
Where did you get this?

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,700
Prince Gwang Hae gave it to me.

160
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,700
Then,

161
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,800
the Prince knows you're really Jung?

162
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,010
Does Orabeoni know that too?

163
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,870
Yeah. Orabeoni's real identity was discovered first.

164
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,010
As always, I'm the last to know.

165
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,010
No, I meant to tell you when 
 you came to Bunwon.

166
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,240
Why don't you come to Bunwon these days?

167
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,130
So, what did His Highness say?

168
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,400
He wasn't mad?

169
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,530
Does he understand your situation
and accepts why you had to do it?

170
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,120
No way.

171
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,160
Don't even mention it.

172
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,610
You wouldn't believe how angry
 he was in the beginning.

173
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,740
Now, he seems to have cooled down a bit.

174
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,490
But, I'm still uncomfortable around him.

175
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,950
Whenever I see him, I tremble in fear.

176
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,200
I get so nervous thinking I might make a mistake.

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,380
When his expression is lined with tension,
I wonder if he's mad at me for something I've done.

178
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,840
He makes me nervous.

179
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,870
I better go now.

180
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,770
I have a mountain of things to do,
but I stepped out for a bit to show you this cup.

181
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,320
Next time, when I'm done with work,
I'll come to see you after dark.

182
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,640
Please take good care of Father's cup.

183
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,240
Don't worry.

184
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm going!

185
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,270
Tae Pyung was Chief Moon's student.

186
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,900
Did you know?

187
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,820
Then Moon Sa Seung is...

188
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,820
What's wrong?

189
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,910
That time, when we were baking the blue celadon piece,

190
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,660
I had a chance to meet Tae Pyung's teacher.

191
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,010
I thought he was just an elderly country folk.

192
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,090
Do you mean that he was a former Bunwon Chief?

193
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,120
You must not be deceived by his appearance.

194
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,470
He may look as innocent 
as an elderly country bumpkin.

195
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,240
But the truth is, no one knows 
what he is thinking inside.

196
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,520
Oh no, please..

197
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,460
Why are you doing this?

198
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,040
Aren't you a royal ceramist of Bunwon?

199
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,370
A while back, you saved my life.

200
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,800
I never properly thanked you.
And I finally meet you here at Bunwon.

201
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,560
I apologize for not coming out to greet you sooner.

202
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,160
I am just a worthless old man.

203
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,230
That you would treat me so graciously,
I don't know what to do with myself.

204
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,080
Please allow me to pour you a glass.

205
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,840
No, no!

206
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,830
I don't want to burden a busy man like you.

207
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,460
Just go and carry on with your work.

208
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,790
It's fine. Please accept a cupful.

209
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,040
Oh dear...

210
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,380
Chief Moon, that man.

211
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,120
He suffers from hand tremors.
Did you know?

212
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,140
Yes, that is why he was kicked out in the first place.

213
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,880
Ask him to make a porcelain piece.

214
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,570
If it is apparent that there is no need for him
 to stay at Bunwon, won't he leave on his own?

215
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,340
Chief Moon is not someone you can consider lightly.

216
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,930
I am confident I can win in this situation.

217
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,390
Do you think he can even spin the wheel
 properly with such hands?

218
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,640
Father, if you can arrange an opportunity for me,

219
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,940
I will prove that my skills are better than his.

220
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,100
Your Highness, due to past incidences of bribery,

221
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,040
Prince Gwang Hae has taken a firm hand

222
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,100
over all control of Bunwon.

223
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,850
How incompetent of you.

224
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,600
You should be ashamed of yourself
 to even mention it.

225
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,520
Since it's an urgent matter, 
I've come to you for help.

226
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,880
Prince Gwang Hae has even called in

227
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,480
the former Bunwon Chief, Moon Sa Seung.

228
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,420
I guess that puts you in an awkward position.

229
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,460
I don't think this is just my problem alone.

230
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,060
If Chief Moon were to become
 involved in every little event,

231
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,760
it will be difficult to secretly pull out
 Bunwon ceramic wares.

232
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,230
And, this would mean an obstacle

233
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,240
to your, otherwise, great ambitions.

234
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,270
So then,

235
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,680
what are you asking me to do?

236
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,110
I plan to let the world know how worthless
Moon Sa Seung is at Bunwon.

237
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,080
I only need a justifiable cause.

238
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,970
If then, I will take full responsibility,

239
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,170
and cut off the hands and feet 
of Prince Gwang Hae. (not literally)

240
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,630
A justifiable cause?

241
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,470
Thanks to your wise rule,

242
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,400
every day is peaceful and prosperous.

243
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
The truth that even heaven and earth already knows,

244
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,340
spoken through your lips, makes me very happy.,

245
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,340
Your Majesty's happiness is your servant's happiness.

246
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,500
The royal subjects should all think the way you do.

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,300
But every day they submit scrolls and scrolls of appeals.

248
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,260
And they never cease to bring up discussions
of who to appoint as Crown Prince.

249
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,750
It's not too difficult to appease the foolish royal subjects.

250
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,050
First, hold a banquet to console the elderly subjects,

251
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,000
which will reflect well on your character.

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,300
A banquet!

253
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,240
That is an excellent idea.

254
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,620
Midway next month, I plan to hold a banquet
 at the Palace. (to encourage elderly royal subjects)

255
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,930
What are your thoughts?

256
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,780
I feel this is a good opportunity to preach

257
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,940
your teachings that loyalty and filial duty
are the cornerstones of our country.

258
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,440
Have them prepare enough royal wine.
Invite as many elderly subjects as possible

259
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,370
and see to it that they have a good time.

260
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,260
Your Majesty, as for the gifts for 
the elderly royal subjects,

261
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,180
just like before, should Bunwon prepare them?

262
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,540
Yes, do so.

263
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,780
Since they are gifts coming from me,
be sure that the preparation goes flawlessly.

264
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,500
As you have stated, Your Majesty.

265
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,710
We will be making ceramic ware 
to be used at the banquet.

266
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,740
Until now, Royal Ceramist Lee 
had been making them.

267
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,220
This time, the newly joined Chief Moon
 will be making them.

268
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,830
Be aware of this fact and give him
 the assistance he needs.

269
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,690
Chief Moon, over 20 years ago,

270
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,920
had made His Majesty's ceramic ware.
He is a legendary ceramist.

271
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,890
Chief Sir.

272
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,980
We, the ceramists here, all wish to see

273
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,690
your talent at work. Please grant our wish.

274
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,400
Please grant our wish.

275
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,490
The ceramists here are looking forward
 to seeing your work.

276
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes, it has been a long time since I've seen your work.

277
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,910
Please, show us your skills.

278
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,130
You people...

279
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,560
Skills? What skills?

280
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,690
These people...

281
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,250
I'm just a worthless old man.

282
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,320
I had just wanted to take it easy and eat and sleep.

283
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,200
Why are you people pestering me with such requests?

284
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,610
Look here.

285
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,170
Am I, indeed,

286
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,290
to be disgraced and kicked out 
of here, Bunwon Chief?

287
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:14,040
"The ceramist who cannot produce 
ceramic ware cannot stay at Bunwon"

288
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,680
Those words were spoken by you, Chief Sir.

289
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,160
If you are intent on causing me disgrace, 
so be it.

290
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,970
I'll try and make something.

291
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,280
Tae Pyung, since you are his student,
you should help the Chief.

292
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,090
There's no need, Bunwon Chief.

293
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,600
Tae Pyung!

294
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,180
Don't interfere and create more work for me.

295
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,520
You stay out of this.

296
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,520
How can I stand by and just watch 
my teacher at work?

297
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,650
I will assist him, Bunwon Chief.

298
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,150
Regardless that you are a menial worker,
you must accept the consequence of the outcome.

299
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,510
Do your best in assisting him.

300
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,070
Yes, I will.

301
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,640
Bunwon Chief, I will do it, too.

302
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,920
I want to duel with him, as ceramist to ceramist.

303
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,310
Please give me your permission.

304
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,500
You want to compete with him?
Haven't you heard of his reputation?

305
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,800
How dare you meddle?

306
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,830
If I lose, I will give up my position
as Royal Ceramist and leave Bunwon.

307
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:40,490
That means, if I lost, 
then I should leave here, too?

308
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,260
Sure, of course.

309
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,620
This is so like you, Lee Kang Cheon.

310
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,000
You are intent on making this happen.
So, I don't even have a choice, do I?

311
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,600
I'll do as you say.

312
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,760
What's going on here?

313
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,100
Your Highness, the ceramic ware for the banquet,

314
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,890
will be chosen from a competition between 
Chief Moon and Royal Ceramist Lee.

315
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,220
Bunwon Chief.

316
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,570
You haven't even consulted with me.
What is this you're doing?

317
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,580
Chief Moon and Royal Ceramist Lee want to do this.

318
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,950
By competing, the highest quality ceramic ware
will be dedicated.

319
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,050
I ask for you to be calm.

320
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,850
<i>So you mean to kick out the person I brought in?</i>

321
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,660
Were you looking for me?

322
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,340
Since Prince Shin Seong is ill in bed
and cannot leave the Palace,

323
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,690
you also must not have had 
a chance to go to Bunwon lately.

324
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,710
His Highness allowed me freedom,
so I stop by once in awhile.

325
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,580
You became a bodyguard
 so that you could remain at Bunwon.

326
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,670
Are you content with just that?

327
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,440
I hear that Prince Gwang Hae spends
most of his time at Bunwon.

328
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,180
Will you keep a close watch on Prince Gwang Hae?

329
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,150
Who he meets, what he does,

330
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,600
is he maintaining his conduct
as the Assistant Head of Bunwon,

331
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,330
anything that can be considered a fault is good.
Go find out what you can.

332
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,000
What a surprise

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,380
that you would call me to such a place as this.

334
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,930
Your Highness, all this time, I have been busy

335
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,140
tending to Prince Gwang Hae
 and Prince Shin Seong.

336
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,200
With your generous heart, please forgive me.

337
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,690
Hey, I know you.

338
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,930
You're not the kind to go without a payment.

339
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,510
A payment? No, that's not it.

340
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,030
Isn't it so obvious?

341
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,700
Fine.

342
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,910
What is it you want?

343
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,680
Teacher, please wake up.

344
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,530
What are you going to do now?

345
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,380
Whew... What do you mean what am I going to do?

346
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,860
Of course, I can't be kicked out. *sobs*

347
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,310
Hey, don't fret yourself over this.

348
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,460
Go and sleep.

349
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,750
Are you going to quit even before trying?

350
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,280
This won't do.

351
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,070
Please get up.

352
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,140
Please get up!

353
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,080
Aigoo, you're so foolish.

354
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,340
Isn't it obvious?

355
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,320
Sure, they call it competition.
But who do you think will call the shots?

356
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,440
Bunwon Chief, who else?

357
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,870
Regardless of what I make, 
the result has already been determined.

358
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,250
Don't say that, Teacher.

359
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,520
If you lose, then I will be kicked out, too.

360
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,330
I am never going to quit.

361
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,670
You! Don't you see this hand?

362
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,380
I will help! I even know how to spin the wheel.

363
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,620
If it hadn't been for you,

364
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,160
I could have left without seeing any of this.

365
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,480
You had to interfere, didn't you!

366
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,910
Then, you're doing it, right?

367
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,660
I only trust you.

368
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,130
Who will decide the winner 
of the banquet competition?

369
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,380
Surely, you can't be the only judge, right?

370
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,750
No, how could I, Your Highness.

371
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,310
Then, what are you planning to do?

372
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,380
I will do it.

373
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,840
Prince Shin Seong, who is the Head 
of Bunwon should have been here. However,

374
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,250
as you know, he is ill in bed. So,

375
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,540
I asked Prince Im Hae to help.

376
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,580
You asked Hyung-nim?

377
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,000
As you know, I am a just and fair man.

378
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,700
Bunwon Chief and you, Gwang Hae,

379
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,270
plus me. If the three of us serve
 as judges, it will be fair.

380
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,370
Then, I'll be on my way.

381
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,170
I heard that menial worker, Tae Pyung, 
is helping the old man, Moon Sa Seung.

382
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,100
Are you worried that wench will be kicked out?

383
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,780
Hyung-nim. She will be a ceramist in the future.

384
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,890
Please watch what you are saying.

385
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,710
Surely, I was not wrong.

386
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,420
You long for her, for sure.

387
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,290
What? That's not true.

388
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,250
There's no need to hide it. 
I already know everything.

389
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,110
Hyung-nim!

390
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,210
Seeing that you are reacting this way, 
I see that you don't recognize your own feelings yet.

391
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,830
Fine.

392
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,970
Listen carefully to what I say and contemplate it.

393
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,450
When she's not around, 
doesn't it make you nervous?

394
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,020
No, she doesn't. I get nervous 
when she's around me.

395
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,580
While she's carrying on with her worker duties,

396
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,350
are you worried that she may hurt herself

397
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,890
or collapse in this heat?

398
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,620
Yes, I admit I worry about that.

399
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:28,190
But, not only about her. I worry about 
every single worker here.

400
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,330
You think you're all that.

401
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,260
When you're alone with her,
 you want to hold her hand.

402
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,800
And you find it difficult to turn away
 from staring at her lips.

403
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,540
Has that happened before?

404
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,980
That has never happened before!
Please stop saying worthless things!

405
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,180
Tae Pyung!

406
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,200
Yes, Your Highness.

407
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,360
How are the preparations going?

408
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,840
Actually...

409
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,440
Why can't you answer me properly?

410
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,870
We haven't even yet decided what form to make.

411
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,420
I heard that, on Royal Ceramist's side, the sound
 of the wheel spinning has not ceased for a moment.

412
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,790
And, you still haven't decided on the form?!

413
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,700
This is bad.

414
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,060
We are contemplating on it. 
We will soon decide.

415
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,640
That won't do. Come follow me.

416
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,520
Where are we going?

417
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,780
There is nothing in your head.
What do you expect to do by just contemplating?

418
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,750
What is all of this?

419
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,370
The books are a collection of classics.

420
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,080
The artists use these pictures as reference.

421
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,670
If you look at these, it may inspire you.
Take your time and read through them.

422
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:02,040
Must I look through all of these?

423
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,830
Including all those books there. 
You must read them all.

424
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,210
I told you to look at the books.
But why are you looking at me?

425
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,540
Your Highness.

426
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,320
I didn't want to say this, but

427
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,010
how can I read the books?

428
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,960
Didn't you read books before?

429
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,470
While I was working on kneading the clay,
weren't you reading a book?

430
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,300
At that time, I was looking at the words,
as if looking at pictures.

431
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,420
You don't recognize a single letter?

432
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,830
I know how to write my name, and

433
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,520
I tried forcing myself to look at the 
Thousand-Character Classic. But...

434
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,910
Go hide back there.

435
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,920
Oh, it was Your Highness here?

436
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,500
What is it?

437
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,880
I came to take a look at the ceramic ware
used at last year's banquet.

438
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,900
There is something I need to find now.

439
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,630
Come back a while later.

440
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,920
Yes, Your Highness.

441
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,910
This place won't do. Let's leave here for now.

442
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,140
Vice Minister Choi, 700.

443
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,960
So, what is the total sum?

444
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,100
One thousand one hundred...

445
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,340
You Highness, you've come?

446
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,340
- What brings you all the way- -
-Tae Pyung!

447
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,880
Why aren't you coming in?

448
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,340
For the banquet, we decided to use the ceramic ware of the winner between Chief Moon and Royal Ceramist Lee.

449
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,090
-Chief Moon?
-Royal Ceramist Lee?

450
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,660
This child is to help Chief Moon,
but she doesn't have any ideas.

451
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,300
I want to open her eyes. Please show her
 the ceramic ware collection you have.

452
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,600
If you mean ceramic ware, Bunwon is full of it.

453
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,880
Why did you come all the way here?

454
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,530
If a menial worker frequents the 
porcelain warehouse, there will be talk.

455
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,650
This child will also feel uncomfortable.

456
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,680
Since this is to help Chief Moon,

457
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,300
how can I refuse?

458
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,840
Hwa Ryeong, you can help.

459
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,060
Yes, Haeng Soo Madam.

460
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,500
Is this it? Will you make it like this?

461
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,120
It's not possible with my spinning skills.

462
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,950
If you can't even make it, 
why do you bother looking at it?

463
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,360
Please don't keep watching me, Your Highness.

464
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,260
I can't focus on the porcelain.

465
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,120
When did I even look at you?

466
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,020
Fine.

467
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,520
Here, what do you think?

468
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,170
If we're going to prepare for the banquet,
how many of these will we need to make?

469
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,100
At least by the dozens.

470
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,460
In the same designs, right?

471
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,450
If we are to make them in this pattern,
we can barely make one overnight.

472
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,000
I can help with making at least one of them.

473
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,710
That's fine.

474
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,870
I am very aware of your skills at the wheel.

475
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,850
I should get going now.

476
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,460
Did you think of anything?

477
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,770
No, not yet.

478
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,970
These porcelain are so beautiful

479
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,970
and conversely, my skills don't measure up.

480
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,680
It's so discouraging that
 I can't even look at them anymore.

481
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,580
So, it's better that I don't even look
 at them at all.

482
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,630
Where have been all day long?

483
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,830
I was so contemplating 
on how to make the wine cup,

484
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,710
that I've been busy all day long.

485
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,790
So,

486
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,860
have you decided how to make it?

487
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,800
Aigoo...*tsk, tsk*

488
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,440
You just squandered the day away.

489
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,780
I'm just an old man working away;

490
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,360
grinding my old bones into dust.

491
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,730
You didn't even think of me, right?

492
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,060
No, that's not true, Teacher.

493
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,480
Whoa!

494
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,160
Wow!

495
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,740
If you were going to do it this way, you should
 have told me you were doing this earlier.

496
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,430
If you make all this by yourself so secretly, then

497
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,730
I won't be able to face you.

498
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,290
Even if I wanted to tell you,
 you weren't even around.

499
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,180
Tomorrow, don't think of 
stepping one foot outside.

500
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,440
Help with the spinning work.

501
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,790
Yes, Teacher.

502
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,260
Yeon Jeong* Madam.
(person who grinds dirt and mix solutions)

503
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,710
Chief Moon. Do you remember me?

504
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,790
You are...?

505
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,640
I used to be a laborer.
 My name is Oh Gok Bi.

506
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,070
Oh, is that so?

507
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,710
Yes, I remember!

508
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,530
Now I do Yeon Jeong work, making solutions.

509
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,090
I brought this, hoping it can help.

510
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:32,000
Thank you.

511
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,040
I will put it to good use.

512
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,240
To Bunwon Chief...

513
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,680
Oh, of course.

514
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,340
Tae Pyung, no one has been here, right?

515
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,300
Oh... yes!

516
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,410
It's only been you and me here.

517
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,520
Yes.

518
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,880
Teacher, just a moment, please.

519
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,950
Thank you.

520
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,210
This has nothing to do with you.

521
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,220
But still, thank you.

522
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,380
It's only

523
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,490
for repaying the debt I owed to Chief Lee.

524
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,870
I really do appreciate it.

525
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,240
What are you doing standing here?

526
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,130
Hurry, go inside and help.

527
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,820
Yes.

528
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:33,190
Then, goodbye.

529
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,880
Of all the banquet cups, this will be the best.

530
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,580
Do you think I can win with this cup?

531
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,320
You don't need to worry about winning or losing.

532
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,660
The outcome has already been decided.

533
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,930
It's not something I can decide.

534
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:51,370
The result should be recognized by everyone.

535
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,250
Wow.

536
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,910
Crane. Pine tree. Cloud.

537
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,710
Sun...

538
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,560
You drew the ten symbols of longevity
in blue ink.

539
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,430
By the way, what is the meaning of this fire?

540
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,820
It's an elixir plant.

541
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,470
To the elderly royal subjects
who desire long and healthy life,

542
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,800
there will be no better gift than this.

543
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,450
And, how is Chief Moon 
holding up on his front?

544
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,420
You have nothing to worry about
 at all on that end.

545
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,440
They haven't even decided on

546
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,360
what to make yet.

547
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,450
The day for that gentleman to pack up
 is not far away.

548
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,470
Who is making the ceramic ware
 to be used at the banquet?

549
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,430
Is it Royal Ceramist Lee?

550
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,730
It hasn't been decided yet, Honorable Father.

551
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,880
I issued my command ages ago.

552
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,730
Do you mean nothing has been prepared yet?

553
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,540
At the Bunwon, there is a man
 named Moon Sa Seung.

554
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,330
He was the former Bunwon Chief.

555
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:02,490
He and Ceramist Lee are competing

556
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,290
If it's Moon Sa Seung, 
didn't he leave Bunwon?So,

557
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:12,060
a man who is unable to spin the wheel 
 has been brought in as a ceramist?

558
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,730
Of course.

559
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:22,180
He'll receive recognition if he competes 
against Royal Ceramist Lee and wins.

560
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,240
This should be fun.

561
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,340
Aigoo!

562
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,820
Didn't I tell you to relax?

563
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,790
Do it again!

564
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,030
Okay.

565
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,700
Relax.

566
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,250
<i>Don't breathe.</i>

567
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,530
Did you see it?

568
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:37,310
The one sitting at the wheel wasn't
 Ceramist Moon, but Tae Pyung.

569
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,120
Then...

570
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,960
Am I competing against Tae Pyung?!

571
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,180
Didn't you already lose to
Tae Pyung once already?

572
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,040
In other people's memory, 
all they remember is that you lost.

573
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,460
It'll be the same this time.

574
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,120
The truth isn't important.

575
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,750
The people will only remember that

576
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,220
you beat Moon Sa Seung.

577
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,470
That will remain in their memories.

578
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,810
I will remember your words.

579
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,870
His Majesty, the King has arrived!

580
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,580
We are honored, Your Majesty.

581
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,510
Is this the truth?

582
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,340
It is, Your Majesty.

583
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,800
You are doing your work correctly.

584
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,180
Who is competing against whom
 in this competition?

585
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,330
This won't be an easy competition.

586
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,360
You two, come forth.

587
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,280
Your Majesty, the loser of this competition

588
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,180
will leave Bunwon.

589
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,110
Really?

590
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,050
That's good. You should follow such standards.

591
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,130
You two must work

592
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,600
to the best of your abilities.

593
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,500
We will accept your command.

594
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,410
Royal Ceramist Lee Kang Cheon, 
bring their porcelain

595
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,600
up when they're done.

596
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,310
I, personally, will do the judging.

597
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,780
A competition between Chief Moon 
and Royal Ceramist Lee...

598
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,460
This should be interesting to watch.

599
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,350
Hey,

600
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,120
who do you think will win this time?

601
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,860
When Chief Lee was judging,

602
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,450
the odds were 80:20 in Lee ceramist's favor.

603
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,130
Now that His Majesty will judge,

604
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,950
I don't know what'll happen.

605
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,730
Then, ceramist Lee might get 
kicked out of the Bunwon?

606
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,730
How could he stay?

607
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,950
His Majesty already knows about it

608
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:48,230
In that case, won't Bunwon Chief Lee 
help ceramist Lee?

609
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,000
His Majesty

610
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,580
Yes, Your Highness

611
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,410
That's not all, he also ordered

612
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,620
that the items be brought to him
personally for judging

613
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,510
This is the reason Gwang Hae went to Gang Hyun.

614
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,080
Yes, Your Highness

615
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,190
Destroy all of these and 
prepare to make new ones.

616
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,490
Did you not say this was satisfactory?

617
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,800
What will you do if His Majesty 
chooses Moon's over yours?

618
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,270
I will help, so do as I say

619
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,500
Why do you keep doing that?

620
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:35,070
Don't you feel any anxiety at all?

621
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,220
The heart of a ceramist

622
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,340
You,

623
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,890
Is that the kind of ceramist you want to be?

624
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,000
Forget that someone will see this

625
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,450
Yes, Master

626
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,960
Go ahead

627
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,000
Again

628
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,710
Grab the body of it

629
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,120
Don't move, again

630
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,880
Again

631
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,800
Try it

632
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,700
It's too far

633
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,320
Too far

634
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,190
His Highness came by?

635
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,040
He came with Jung.

636
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,490
About Prince Gwang Hae,

637
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:17,470
I think he has special feelings for Jung

638
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,250
because they have a special fate.

639
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:24,430
Jung might have the same

640
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,840
feelings for His Highness as well.

641
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,330
Not long ago, Jung said that

642
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,860
when she sees His Highness, she is 
nervous of making a mistake.

643
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,810
And when she sees him looking stern,

644
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,720
she worries that he's upset because of her.

645
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,480
No matter how close they are, he's the Prince.

646
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,710
So, won't those be obvious reactions from her?

647
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,180
When I'm with Oraboni,

648
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,830
I'm like that too.

649
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,940
That's why I can

650
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,590
understand her feelings well.

651
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,090
Watching His Highness looking after Jung,

652
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,270
do you know how jealous I am of those two?

653
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,940
Suddenly laughing, suddenly angry

654
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,330
and letting it go easily.

655
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:15,370
His Highness can't keep his eyes off
 Jung for a moment.

656
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,010
I should leave now.

657
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,550
Did you get what I asked for?

658
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,850
Yes

659
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,590
But, where will you use all these?

660
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,980
I want to show Jung.

661
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,960
I have something to tell her too.

662
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,210
Don't . . .

663
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,180
It's obvious that you'll be the only one hurt.

664
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,440
<i>Although I close my eyes</i>

665
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,560
<i> it's too late to hide</i>

666
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,620
Can you do it?

667
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,780
Hyungnim, don't worry about a thing

668
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,860
I will whistle.

669
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,960
When you hear it, set fire to them.

670
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,520
Yes

671
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,880
Jung

672
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,410
Have you finished your work?

673
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,440
All they need now is to be fired in the kiln.

674
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,470
You made all of these?

675
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,350
No, Master made them all.

676
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:58,680
I watched and learned from him.

677
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,920
Shall we go for a walk?

678
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,640
Let's!

679
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,880
You were like this last time, too. What is it?

680
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,440
If you don't start talking, I'm leaving.

681
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,870
I promised your father

682
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,370
to always be by your side

683
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,550
and to protect you.

684
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,670
What do you mean, Oraboni?

685
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,580
I . . .

686
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,600
It's okay if it's not right now.

687
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,210
I can wait as long as you want.

688
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,290
She's been at Bunwon for 20 years.

689
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,900
No one knows

690
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,680
when she'll become a ceramist.

691
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,390
The path I chose is like that too, Oraboni

692
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,100
I know, Jung. I'm like this because I know.

693
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:23,670
I don't want you to go alone
 on that long journey.

694
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,120
No,

695
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,730
I can go alone.

696
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:43,820
If I'm with someone, I'll feel apologetic 
to them and want to give up.

697
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:49,400
And, if that person is Oraboni, even more so.

698
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,550
Yes, Royal Ceramist

699
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,470
They are loading the kiln now.

700
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:08,560
I want to give you an opportunity.

701
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,910
Yes?

702
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,760
Who do you think

703
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,190
will win this competition?

704
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:19,520
Won't that obviously be Ceramist Lee?

705
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,800
If this goes well, I'm thinking of promoting
 Ceramist Lee to Chief Royal Ceramist.

706
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:33,540
If Ceramist Lee becomes Chief Royal Ceramist, 
who do you think should take his place?

707
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,750
Chief Royal Ceramist . . .

708
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,810
For that to happen, I have something for you to do.

709
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,660
Yes?

710
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,320
Here

711
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,640
Careful

712
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,120
Come on out, we're done

713
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:32,800
Good work

714
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,520
Yes

715
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,100
Come out

716
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,340
I see, alright

717
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,540
If you don't do that, they will overheat and break

718
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,510
I know, I'm just worried

719
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,700
If you have anything for me to do, just call and I'll come running

720
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,150
Alright

721
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,780
Look here!

722
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,230
What are you doing!

723
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:44,160
I told you to keep the fire low!

724
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,810
This person!

725
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,450
It's too late

726
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,430
It's too late!

727
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,800
Master...

728
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,740
The ceramics are all ruined

729
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,450
There isn't one intact

730
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:06,090
Don't be disappointed

731
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,980
I will explain to His Majesty

732
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,600
and somehow stop you from having to leave Bunwon

733
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,000
How could you change something that's already been decided?

734
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,410
Don't strain yourself

735
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,580
It doesn't matter if I have to leave

736
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:34,060
TaePyung, I'm worried about her

737
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:39,750
Since she'll be kicked out of Bunwon as well...

738
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,000
My greed in calling you

739
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:49,520
and ordering you to go through all this trouble made everything worse

740
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,440
All of this is my own fault

741
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,430
I'm very curious as to why you came

742
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,600
Did you order it?

743
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,660
What are you talking about?

744
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:21,230
Did you order that Hwajang to overheat the kiln?

745
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:31,920
No one knows how the dishes that are 
placed in the kiln will turn out

746
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:40,540
Perhaps this is because of the girl Tae Pyung

747
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:46,900
So when you leave Bunwon, make 
 sure you take her with you

748
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,780
You haven't changed a bit.

749
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:56,800
The dish takes on the character of the person making it

750
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:03,680
That's why your dishes don't move people's hearts

751
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:20,320
What are you doing?

752
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,260
As you said, Master, I'm holding my breath and relaxing

753
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,370
This is how you do it, right, Master?

754
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,690
Didn't I ask you what you were doing!

755
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,780
Leave it alone

756
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,220
It's already too late

757
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,980
It's possible

758
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:48,110
Did you include the kiln time in your calculations?

759
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,550
That's why you should just give up

760
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,660
If there's not enough time for kiln process, we have to find another way, Master

761
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,550
But still, I can't just sit around and wait to get kicked out!

762
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,390
Shouldn't I try everything?

763
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:15,520
If my father was still alive, he would've surely said the same thing

764
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,400
The moment you give up is the end

765
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,860
If you try everything, you will find a way

766
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,470
Please, allow me to continue Master

767
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,400
There is definitely another way

768
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,500
A way that doesn't need the full kiln process

769
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,510
there will definitely be one, Master

770
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,410
She's not eating at all, you say?

771
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,150
Yes, Your Highness

772
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:59,110
After that day's happenings, she wont sleep or eat

773
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,990
she's only working on the dishes

774
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,420
TaePyung

775
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,160
Your Highness

776
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,790
Even though time is running out

777
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,400
I can't think of a method that will work

778
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,990
Follow me out

779
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:43,240
I can't, I have to find a method

780
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,030
Didn't I say to follow me out?

781
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,690
Even if you order me to give up, I wont

782
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:55,730
Please allow me to complete these ceramics

783
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,650
Did I say to give up?

784
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,740
Your Highness

785
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,240
Eat

786
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:19,420
Didn't I tell you that I don't have time for this?

787
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,000
Don't you remember?

788
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,200
Ah, I have eat so that my brain will work and remember, please wait a bit

789
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:32,190
Didn't you say you have to eat for your brain to work?

790
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,800
Auntie, bring a serving of sooyook

791
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,570
Yes

792
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,150
Eat without leaving a thing, it's an order

793
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:51,140
How can I eat when your looking at me like that Your Highness?

794
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,900
Alright, I'll leave you alone for a while

795
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,600
Don't leave anything and eat it all

796
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,310
Don't drop it like last time and carry it well

797
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,830
Yes

798
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,280
No

799
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,210
Auntie

800
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,230
Yes?

801
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:00,650
Where did the girl eating rice soup go?

802
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,210
She left

803
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,510
You didn't meet her?

804
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,380
Oh gosh! It's these men!

805
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,630
They kept staring with a strange expression!

806
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,790
There's no mistaking it, they were behind this!

807
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:18,680
Oh, goodness, they're men that would do anything

808
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,020
Where did they go?

809
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,830
Th-that way

810
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,750
TaePyung!

811
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,270
Jung!

812
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,740
Jung where are you!

813
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,090
Where did you go!

814
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:13,790
Your Highness

815
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,920
Shouldn't you at least say where you're going?!

816
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,060
About that..

817
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,760
Don't ever

818
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:26,650
escape my sight again!

819
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,950
This is an order!

820
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,790
Your Highness

821
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:59,000
From now on, I'll obey, Your Highness

822
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,550
Why are you in such a good mood?

823
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,010
It's all due to Your Highness

824
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,950
Grab a hold of Gwang Hae's feelings

825
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:23,040
If you fall asleep leaning on me, what will the people 
 of Bunwon say?

826
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,630
Do you have to go this far to become a ceramist?

827
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,060
Is Tae Pyung Eul Dam's daughter?
