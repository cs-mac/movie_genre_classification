{44043}{44135}- I thought I told you to stand there!|- Get that hair down before Saturday.
{44138}{44187}We're goin' now. Good-bye!
{44244}{44351}Move ass. Tell everybody|we'll be back in an hour.
{44365}{44442}Great, but you belong in|Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood.
{44444}{44559}Why don't you detach us? Give us a shot, at|least till we find out if there's anything here.
{44561}{44706}Everybody wants Weinstock. Maybe here's|the lead we're looking for. We deserve this.
{44708}{44803}You couldn't burn a three-time loser|with this garbage.
{44805}{44922}The man has done absolutely nothin'.|You'll wind up in an entrapment rap.
{44924}{45022}Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own|candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs.
{45024}{45116}You put this hustler together with Weinstock|and maybe we got a big score.
{45118}{45205}Big score, my ass! At best|he's sellin' nickel-and-dime bags.
{45208}{45329}I wouldn't be infringin' on your coffee break|if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.
{45331}{45463}Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle,|or have you forgotten about that already?
{45467}{45535}Jesus Christ, Jimmy,|what's happened to you guys?
{45537}{45647}Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in|arrests. What was it, over 100 again last year?
{45650}{45718}Terrific. But who? What did you bring in?
{45720}{45788}A high-school kid in short pants|that had a twitch?
{45790}{45885}You grab a bellhop because|he's got three joints in his sock?
{45976}{46075}Walter, we got the information|there's no shit on the street, right?
{46077}{46151}It's like a desert full ofjunkies|waiting to get well.
{46153}{46259}Goddamnit, this could be it. This little|candy-store guy, he's put on a big show
{46260}{46345}in a club with no narcotics connections.|They were all over him.
{46347}{46423}And after working a day and night,|we tail him to Brooklyn.
{46425}{46540}And we sat on him for practically a week, and|who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock.
{46543}{46602}Now you gotta let us have it.
{46644}{46707}Do you believe all this crap?
{46710}{46770}I go with my partner.
{46817}{46865}- What'll it take?|- A wire.
{46867}{46951}No, two wires.|One on the store, one on the house.
{46984}{47066}You know I have to get a court order|for a wire tap, don't you?
{47068}{47143}- But you'll try.|- We know you can do it, Walt.
{47211}{47293}Popeye, you still picking your feet|in Poughkeepsie?
{47379}{47442}{y:i}J'entends parler de ça.|{y:i}Je n'arrive pas à y croire.
{47444}{47495}{y:i}Alors je vais un peu parler pour moi.
{47498}{47631}{y:i}J'ai tendance à penser|{y:i}à mes propres problèmes, enfin...
{47687}{47763}Monsieur Devereaux, is this|your first trip to New York?
{47764}{47849}- Yes, it's my first.|- Why did you choose to come by ship?
{47851}{47926}The next several weeks|will be very difficult for me,
{47928}{48075}and the ocean is the only place where|the telephone isn't ringing all the time.
{48078}{48153}Do you agree with the recent survey finding
{48156}{48243}that showed that Mayor Lindsay|was the sexiest man in the world?
{48412}{48445}{y:i}Tout à fait, oui.
{49740}{49836}Here's the warrants and the court order|for the wire tap. Judge gave you 60 days.
{49838}{49931}Mulderig and Klein'll sit in for the feds.|They'll make all the buys.
{49933}{50010}Make sure you keep 'em informed|of everything that goes down.
{50012}{50067}You know Doyle there, don't you?
{50070}{50200}Yeah, I know Popeye. His brilliant hunches|cost the life of a good cop.
{50202}{50305}If this is the way you're comin' in on this,|why not stay home and save us a lot of grief?
{50307}{50384}- Because that's my opinion.|- Shove it up your ass.
{50393}{50432}Whatever.
{50435}{50547}Bill, do me a favor, give them a chance.|He came in with a little basic information.
{50550}{50639}You worked with him, had some trouble,|but don't get off on the wrong foot.
{50641}{50732}- You have any problems, come to me.|- Simonson, just keep off my back.
{50734}{50847}Just try and cool it with him. If you have|any problems, come to me. I'll handle him.
{50849}{50918}- I'll be happy to work with him.|- He's a good cop.
{50920}{51023}- He's got good hunches once in a while.|- Fine. Just keep him off my back.
{51025}{51121}{y:i}Florida's Mackel Brothers|{y:i}invite you to join the great escape.
{51123}{51238}{y:i}You can say good-bye to air pollution,|{y:i}commuting, high prices, rising taxes

{51287}{51382}{y:i}Mackel Brothers will show you the way|{y:i}to Florida and fresh, clean air.
{51385}{51481}{y:i}Warm and sunny year-round weather|{y:i}in a home that you'll be proud to own.

{52958}{53008}Popeye.
{53072}{53115}Popeye.
{53116}{53192}- What?|- It's me, Cloudy. Open the door.
{53236}{53293}I can't.
{53296}{53395}- What do you mean, you can't? You all right?|- Yeah, I'm all right.
{53397}{53447}Let yourself in, will you?
{54516}{54566}What happened?
{54662}{54712}That crazy kid.
{54757}{54817}She locked me up with my own cuffs.
{54864}{54929}- Where's the keys?|- Over there.
{55209}{55259}Hi there.
{55585}{55645}Anybody hurt in this wreck?
{55760}{55855}I thought I told you to get|plastic folders for this stuff.
{55871}{55931}Your scrapbook is like you.
{55956}{56025}- A mess.|- Give me my pants, will you?
{56115}{56164}Come on.
{56185}{56257}- Did you get the warrants?|- Yeah.
{56259}{56353}I also got two feds. Mulderig and Klein.
{56371}{56440}What do we need those pricks for?
{56442}{56534}Because our department's got|about 908 bucks to make buys,
{56536}{56630}and they can get all they want|from Uncle Sap. Hello.
{56687}{56729}These yours, darling?
{57838}{57907}30 over here for this gentleman. Can I get 35?

{91241}{91313}You must take me for an imbecile.
{91315}{91390}Why do you think I asked you|to meet me in Washington?
{91393}{91500}I haven't spent five minutes in New York City|without the company of a policeman.
{91502}{91595}Look, I'm levelin' with you.|I need a little more time.

{125380}{125468}There's nobody been under that car|since it came from the factory.
{125470}{125524}That thing is clean.
{125527}{125582}I don't buy that, Irv.
{125584}{125637}The stuff is in that car.

{126228}{126296}First they send us to Pier One,|then here. Then what?
{126299}{126358}Why did you park the car|down by the waterfront?
{126359}{126467}You're staying in midtown Manhattan|and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?
{126469}{126570}Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations|for a film for French television.
{126572}{126627}He probably left the car to look at something.
{126630}{126729}We were told by the police commissioner|that the car was brought to this garage.
{126731}{126809}- I demand its immediate return.|- You have to be patient.
{126811}{126861}We get four or five hundred cars here a day.
{126863}{126934}Monsieur Devereaux is|an important guest of this country.
{126937}{127040}He is working with the absolute cooperation|and participation of your government.
{127043}{127106}Here are his credentials|from the French consulate.
{127108}{127231}Unless you wish to see this in his film,|I suggest you locate the car immediately.
{127259}{127390}You're in a no-smoking area, sir. Would|you please extinguish your cigarettes?
{127761}{127841}What was the weight of|the car when you got it, Irv?
{128004}{128054}4795 pounds.
{128187}{128248}You sure?
{128250}{128345}That's what it was. 4795 pounds|when it came into the shop.
{128372}{128457}Owner's manual says 4675.
{128493}{128553}That's 120 pounds overweight.
{128636}{128713}And when it was booked|into Marseilles it was 4795.
{128715}{128811}That's still 120 pounds overweight.|Jimmy's gotta be right.
{128854}{128941}Listen, I ripped everything outta there|except the rocker panels.
{128943}{128994}Come on, Irv. What the hell is that?
{129564}{129620}Shit.
{129649}{129694}Son of a bitch.

{130063}{130126}- Who's Devereaux?|- I am Mr Devereaux. Why?
{130127}{130227}I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot|of cars here and it's hard to keep track...
{130230}{130308}- You mean the car is here now?|- Oh, yeah. It's right outside.
{130310}{130390}They stole it right off|the street from you, huh?
{130391}{130486}Goddamn. You're gonna have to pay|the towing charge, you know.
{130489}{130575}I was told these things happen in|New York, but one never expects it.
{130577}{130654}Yeah, well, that's New York.|Is this your first trip over here?
{130657}{130710}Yes. Where's my car, please?
{130711}{130854}It's right over here.|You're lucky this time. It's in perfect shape.
{130856}{130924}Not a scratch. You must lead a charming life.

{140255}{140315}They got the bridge blocked off!
{140948}{141021}This is the police. You're surrounded.
{141023}{141083}Come out with your hands up!
{141085}{141155}This is the police. You're surrounded.
{142547}{142611}Give 'em the gas!

{144067}{144119}Frog One is in that room.

{145689}{145739}Mulderig.
