1
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:21,714
Far beyond the world we humans know,
there is a remote and ancient kingdom.

2
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,751
To most of us,
it seems a frozen wasteland.

3
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,012
But to creatures designed
for astonishing cold,

4
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,717
it's always been a paradise on Earth.

5
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:46,867
Snuggled deep in this protective ice,
one little life is just beginning.

6
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,442
For weeks she's lived in darkness.

7
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,142
Staring at the circle of light above her.

8
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,715
What lies beyond it?

9
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:11,022
Curiosity leads her
to peek into the light for the first time.

10
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,701
- Nanu, - she might be called in the north.
- Little polar bear. -

11
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:30,709
The world outside is a blanket of white
unfolding before her.

12
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,684
It is a majestic place
unlike any other on Earth.

13
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,553
A vast kingdom
at the very top of our world.

14
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,094
A kingdom of ice.

15
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,101
There's another youngster
exploring for the first time.

16
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,014
She sees a blue world of ice water.

17
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,517
Seela is a walrus pup, only hours old,

18
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:19,522
but like the young bear,
eager to discover the world around her.

19
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,271
Like all newborns,
they have much to learn.

20
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,139
They're children of the Arctic,

21
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,209
their lives cradled
by the ice around them.

22
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,249
But their world is changing.

23
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:55,661
And they will face challenges never
before encountered by their species.

24
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,366
Their adventures begin today.

25
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:22,046
It all begins one spring
on this snow-covered mountain.

26
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,512
Nanu's mother has had enough
of her cramped cave.

27
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:41,426
She's remained in the birthing den for
six months without eating or drinking.

28
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,633
In the dark of winter,
she produced twins,

29
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,072
Nanu and her brother.

30
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:05,053
It's 20 degrees below zero today.
Piercing cold.

31
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,983
Perfect for a polar bear.

32
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,001
Nanu's a little hesitant to leave the den.

33
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:29,036
But when your mother is a polar bear
and she calls you, you'd best be going.

34
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,339
Nanu is feisty.

35
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,407
Her brother, a little timid.

36
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,053
She's ready to play anytime.

37
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,827
Hey! Hole in one!

38
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,763
There are more serious days to come.

39
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,835
Survival is so demanding here

40
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,936
that Nanu and her brother
will need three years of basic training.

41
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,344
But just waking up
is enough for one day.

42
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,516
Polar bear boot camp starts tomorrow.

43
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:55,460
From Snow Mountain, the ocean
surface for 30 miles out is frozen

44
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,559
into a hard sheet of ice.

45
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,733
Just beyond lies
the world of Seela's birth.

46
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,878
A maze of ice floes
that serves as a protected nursery.

47
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,876
Here, a walrus mother
can lavish care on her newborn pup.

48
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,734
Using their sensitive whiskers,
they memorize each other's face for life.

49
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:33,827
That's right.

50
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,773
Those sweet 'staches
aren't just for style.

51
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,473
But Seela has a second face to learn.

52
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,812
Another female has been waiting
to hear those first barks.

53
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,658
She'll act as an aunt
and fierce protector

54
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,597
until Seela is old enough
to face the world on her own.

55
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,476
It's a three-year commitment,

56
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,740
starting now.

57
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,416
The first skill to master
is getting out of the water.

58
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,119
If Seela fails,
she'll get too cold and drown.

59
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,856
As Auntie keeps watch for predators,

60
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,898
Seela's mother
patiently shows her how.

61
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,732
Problem is,

62
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,375
practicing somersaults
is much more fun.

63
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,016
Her mother can urge
her 80-pound infant along.

64
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,656
But Seela's got to master
the heavy lifting on her own.

65
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,258
It's gonna be a long three years
with this little handful.

66
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,131
Auntie must wonder
what she signed up for.

67
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:55,543
On Snow Mountain, Nanu's brother
is delaying the start of a family trip.

68
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,615
He still hasn't quite mastered that hole.

69
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,020
Nanu's mother can't wait any longer.
She's starving.

70
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:24,069
Her only hope for finding food is to
venture down onto the frozen ocean,

71
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,303
her age-old hunting grounds.

72
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,384
And so they begin
the wandering life of polar bears,

73
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,988
leaving behind their birthplace

74
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,490
for unknown adventures ahead.

75
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,235
They soon pick up a little tagalong.

76
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,519
Nanu's mother finds a worrisome sign,

77
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,598
tracks left by the only animal in
the ice kingdom that can threaten her.

78
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,662
A male polar bear.

79
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,068
She knows that, given the chance,
he might attack her cubs.

80
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,156
But the male bear
is more interested in something else.

81
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,901
He's caught a scent on the wind,
miles away.

82
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,765
Newborn walrus.

83
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,681
At first glance,
Seela looks like easy pickings.

84
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,794
Auntie senses danger.

85
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,290
As the bear gains on them,
Auntie races to block him.

86
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:52,575
The bear is powerful, all right,
but he weighs half as much as Auntie

87
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,778
and he has no leverage in the water.

88
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,254
He withdraws, for now.

89
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,829
Seela is luckier than she'll ever know.

90
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,370
A female walrus
doesn't give birth very often.

91
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,503
So Seela is treasured,
not only by her mother and aunt,

92
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,479
but by the whole herd.

93
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,286
And they're not just a group,
but a close family.

94
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,759
A really close family.

95
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,628
All on top of each other,
all up in each other's business.

96
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:50,000
Cousins, grandmothers, grandfathers.

97
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,673
And what family doesn't have
a scary uncle?

98
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,531
Not far off, a distant cousin
of the walrus heads for the surface.

99
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,912
A ringed seal maintains several
breathing holes throughout the ice field.

100
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,545
Her private portals between sea and air.

101
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:11,350
Trouble is, she never knows
what ferocious predator

102
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,584
might be waiting at the surface.

103
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,032
She can handle a gull stare-down,

104
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,971
but the ringed seal
is the favorite food of polar bears.

105
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,208
In fact, that's what Nanu's mother
is hunting right now,

106
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,577
followed by Nanu and her little brother,

107
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,813
and their foxy little friend.

108
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:55,290
The ringed seal has one great ally
against the bear, the ice.

109
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:04,206
She can sneak into a cave
hidden under the hard surface snow

110
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,937
and hope that the bear can't find her.

111
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,648
Unluckily for the seal,

112
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,018
Nanu's mother can smell
through three feet of snow.

113
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,242
It's like playing hide-and-seek
with someone with x-ray vision.

114
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,400
Nanu will soon learn

115
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,706
it's not that easy to get a meal
in the ice kingdom.

116
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,174
The prey escapes 19 times
for every one success.

117
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,549
But you can't give up
when you've got babies to feed.

118
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,451
A first meal in six months
sustains the mother

119
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,750
and becomes milk for her cubs.

120
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,588
And for the clever tagalong, leftovers.

121
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,166
Unlike the mother bear,
a walrus seldom hunts alone.

122
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,279
When one gets hungry,

123
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,782
the whole herd does.

124
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,880
That's just how they roll.

125
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,719
This is Seela's first hunt,

126
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:41,929
and she'll need stamina, because
it will last for three straight days.

127
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,674
They work as a team
looking for remembered landmarks.

128
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,214
You'd think something as large
and in charge as a walrus

129
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,622
would take on something fierce.

130
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,651
This is the battleground.

131
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,230
And the prey?

132
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,528
A clam.

133
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,866
Each walrus can eat
4,000 clams per meal.

134
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,738
It'll take Seela years
to master the walrus way of clamming.

135
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,244
Snuffling them out with whiskers,

136
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,976
blasting them open with a snort,
and sucking the meat out.

137
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,612
But first, you've got to catch
the slippery little suckers!

138
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,063
In the chaos, some neighbors run.

139
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,927
Some even fly.

140
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,531
The herd never gets every clam.

141
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,571
Those left behind
will replenish the clam bed

142
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,840
for the herd's return in five years.

143
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,082
After three days of feasting on clams,

144
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,058
the herd's tendency to do everything
together extends even to digestion.

145
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,391
Someone starts a game
of pull-my-flipper,

146
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,899
and before you know it...

147
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,829
By the end of spring,

148
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:04,034
Nanu's family and other bears
in the ice kingdom have also feasted.

149
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,237
Seal hunts have filled their bellies.

150
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:12,249
In the Arctic,
a time of plenty is reason to celebrate.

151
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,841
In the ancient rhythms of the north,

152
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,678
the days of abundance
for Nanu and her family

153
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,547
end with the approach of summer.

154
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,780
A time of fasting for bears,

155
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:27,689
whose hunting grounds crack open
in a brief season of warmth.

156
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,968
The 24-hour sun
penetrates long-dark waters

157
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,004
and works its magic.

158
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:36,817
An explosion of life draws
hungry sea creatures to the far north.

159
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,768
Across the ages,

160
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,438
summer has always shrunk
the ice fields for a short time.

161
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,911
But cold returns with autumn,

162
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:13,250
and the ice quickly reclaims the coast,
then grows slowly seaward.

163
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,221
Ready to break their summer fast,

164
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,699
Nanu and her family waited
for their hunting grounds to reform

165
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,771
out on the frozen ocean,

166
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,266
practicing for the seal hunts to come.

167
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,613
Their mother coaches them
on technique.

168
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,791
And something else as well.

169
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:00,135
Pressing Nanu,
she tries to instill a kind of toughness.

170
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,904
A determination not to give in.

171
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,748
Nanu seems to have what it takes.

172
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,485
Her brother lacks focus.

173
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,690
Finally, a sign.

174
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,095
Darker days herald the return of winter,

175
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,231
and with it,
sea ice frozen solid enough to hunt on.

176
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,504
Just in time.
Nanu and her family are hungry.

177
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,346
But something is different this year.

178
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,947
The ice isn't hard at all.

179
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:10,734
This is not like any winter
Mother Bear has seen before.

180
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,719
They'll have to go back
and wait for the ice to thicken.

181
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,192
And until it does, they'll remain hungry.

182
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:41,463
Seela's family is also looking
for ice strong enough to hold them.

183
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,218
Weeks pass.

184
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,089
What the animals of the ice kingdom
can't know

185
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,155
is that their ancient ways of surviving
are about to be tested.

186
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,472
The sea, and the air above it,
are warmer than in the past.

187
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,376
The ice struggles to reform.

188
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,245
Finally, the ice returns here,

189
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,619
but three months late.

190
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,993
All seems normal again
in the ice kingdom.

191
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:18,896
But there's been too little snow
to create a birthing cave,

192
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:23,504
so the ringed seal's pup
is exposed on the ice,

193
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,712
in plain sight of her greatest enemy.

194
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,580
It's a challenge as well
for Nanu's mother,

195
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,385
who specializes
in catching hidden prey.

196
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,866
How is she going to surprise a seal
that can see her coming?

197
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,026
Her charge is a complete failure.

198
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,190
Nanu reminds her mom how it's done.

199
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,502
"Yeah, thanks for the pointers, kiddo! -

200
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,076
Mother Bear knows
that birds flock to food,

201
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,449
so they follow the birds.

202
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,430
There's a meal somewhere nearby.

203
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:06,343
But the only way to reach it
is to pass right by its owner,

204
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,038
a male bear.

205
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,044
Driven by hunger,
they take a tremendous risk.

206
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,771
They escape, but their hunger grows.

207
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,283
And now a fresh danger gathers.

208
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,518
An Arctic blizzard.

209
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:44,641
Storm winds seem to blast
with more fury than in the past,

210
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:52,439
slamming harder into coastal seas
once shielded by solid ice.

211
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,963
The herd heads to deeper waters
to ride out the storm.

212
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,331
But at sea,
they struggle to keep together,

213
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,737
battered by 15-foot swells.

214
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,279
A strong one separates Seela
from the others.

215
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,358
Her mother and aunt
search desperately,

216
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,561
but she's nowhere in sight.

217
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,208
On land,
the temperature drops to -40.

218
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,839
The wind reaches 80 miles per hour.

219
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,200
The storm is taking a toll.

220
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,937
Brother Bear is suffering.

221
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,310
For the first time in Nanu's life,
he's not right at her back.

222
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,260
Their mother pleads with him
to press on.

223
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,681
He tries to obey,

224
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,623
but hunger has made him too weak.

225
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:37,473
Nanu and her mother snuggle with him,
sharing their warmth.

226
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,539
But as time passes,
he drifts further away.

227
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,338
And then, he's gone.

228
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,092
Nanu and her mother stay at his side.

229
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,772
But finally, they must move on.

230
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,591
At sea, Mother and Auntie
are still looking for Seela.

231
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,202
Beyond their range of vision,

232
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,435
she barely clings to life.

233
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,444
She can't last much longer.

234
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,649
Her strength fades,

235
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,656
along with the herd's hopes
of finding her.

236
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,525
But mother and Auntie refuse to give up.

237
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,892
Following a strong current,
they go farther than before,

238
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,337
and manage to find
what seemed lost forever.

239
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,907
A youngster who held out,

240
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,247
waiting for the two adults
who always come for her.

241
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,077
Two springs pass in the ice kingdom,

242
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,381
and through each, a strange music
rises from below the ice.

243
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:17,961
In her second year,
now showing off little tusks,

244
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,232
Seela's begun to notice the odd sounds.

245
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,640
They're walrus love songs,
produced in the throats of young males,

246
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:39,586
and so complex in structure
it takes years to perfect them.

247
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,155
Until they're worth listening to,

248
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,256
the ladies have got
better things to do with their time.

249
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,036
Nanu has grown as well.

250
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,341
At two years old,
she's still dependent on her mother.

251
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,855
But a morning comes
when her mother remains distant.

252
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,101
Changing conditions
are forcing her mother

253
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,693
to do something earlier than usual.

254
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:46,451
Nanu sees something in her mother's
eyes that she's never seen before.

255
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,620
One look tells her
that life with her mother is over.

256
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,701
Mother Bear can no longer
provide for them both.

257
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,040
In order for them to survive,
she must drive Nanu away.

258
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,152
Leaving is the hardest thing
Nanu has ever done.

259
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,298
But it's also hard for her mother.

260
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,728
She can't protect
her young one anymore,

261
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,932
nor even see how she fares.

262
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,637
She may never see her again.

263
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,078
And so, only in her second year,

264
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,655
Nanu embarks on a life all alone.

265
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,563
Well, not all alone.

266
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,548
Earlier than expected,
spring warmth envelops the Arctic.

267
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:28,318
The hunting grounds are flooded.
There aren't any seals here.

268
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,788
So Nanu heads out
beyond the ice she knows,

269
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,666
hoping to find something to eat.

270
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,699
Anything.

271
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,647
Thick-billed murres are new to her.

272
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,630
Hardly a mouthful apiece,

273
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,163
but under the circumstances,
worth investigating.

274
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,653
But as Nanu is about to discover,

275
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,524
there's something fishy
about these birds.

276
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,071
Nanu hasn't got a chance.

277
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,650
What kind of bird flies through
the ocean instead of the sky?

278
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,468
Then, something even more bizarre.

279
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,242
Creatures she's never seen before.

280
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,437
Nanu has come upon
a herd of narwhals,

281
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,220
the unicorns of the sea.

282
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:24,163
Their ivory tusks, laced
with nerve endings, are so sensitive

283
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,332
they're able to taste the air and the sea,

284
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,099
reading the temperature and weather.

285
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,814
Like a lost tribe of the Arctic,
the narwhals roam the sea,

286
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,386
bearing silent witness
to the changing times.

287
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:03,463
Never before has the Arctic ice
broken up so early and so abruptly.

288
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,875
Hunting is impossible.

289
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,649
Unlike Nanu, Foxy can't swim.

290
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,029
Stymied by the melting ice,
he'll have to say goodbye to his bear.

291
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,050
Nanu faces her own crisis.

292
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,085
She's never been stranded
on shattered ice.

293
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,721
Never been so hungry.

294
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:00,428
Never been in circumstances
where her mother's training

295
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,066
was no help at all.

296
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,407
Farther at sea,

297
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,041
the walrus herd clings
to the few remaining ice rafts.

298
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,086
In the cramped conditions,
tempers flare.

299
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,602
Seela has never experienced
a bad ice year.

300
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,769
The adults have,

301
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,841
though never one this severe.

302
00:50:54,484 --> 00:51:00,514
Finally, one walrus triggers a collective
decision to abandon the shrinking ice.

303
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,094
They'll have to search for a new home.

304
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:04,492
They'll have to search for a new home.

305
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,893
They can't go to the shore
near Snow Mountain,

306
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,063
because of the bears there.

307
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,209
So they take their chances
in the open sea,

308
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,308
aiming for a distant island
where they'll be safe.

309
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:33,146
They'll have to travel day and night
on a week-long, 200-mile swim.

310
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,489
Back on the broken ice field,

311
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,864
Nanu's whole world seems
to be turning upside down.

312
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:54,768
Should she stay on the remnants of ice,
where she can't find food?

313
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:01,478
Or follow the scent of prey
out into the unknown sea?

314
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,752
Now is the time to be bold.

315
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,826
But not hasty.

316
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:24,106
Driven by a fierce will to survive,
she risks everything.

317
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:03,070
Finally, they reach a refuge far at sea,

318
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,719
Rock Island.

319
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,566
The herd is exhausted.

320
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,977
But before they can rest,
they must find a place to haul out.

321
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,376
Seela is too tired to swim another inch.

322
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,452
But getting out could be a problem.

323
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:58,163
Climbing up steep rocks is even harder
than crawling onto an ice floe.

324
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,444
They'll have to lift
2,000 pounds of blubber,

325
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,380
using only the strength of their flippers.

326
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:30,362
Maybe they should have laid off
some of those clams.

327
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,328
The herd's slumber
might not be so deep

328
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,703
if they knew who had reached
the island before them.

329
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,566
The male bear.

330
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,342
And where there's a bear...

331
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:25,084
He's a local fox,
dressed in summer camouflage.

332
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:33,021
On Rock Island,
he doesn't really need leftovers.

333
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,864
There are more murre chicks
than he can possibly eat.

334
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,706
There's nowhere to run.

335
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,370
And they're still too young to fly.

336
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:57,185
Caught between a fox and a hard place,

337
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,085
a murre father
makes a remarkable request.

338
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:21,371
The leap of faith
inspires the entire flock.

339
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,394
One youngster finds refuge in the sea.

340
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,965
Another, in the nick of time,
on a rare raft of ice.

341
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,843
Nanu has paddled for days,

342
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:01,007
and grown so exhausted
that she nearly drowned.

343
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,613
This tiny place to rest
has saved her life.

344
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:21,326
On Rock Island,
the summer sun generates a heat wave.

345
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:24,267
The temperature climbs
well above freezing.

346
00:57:30,877 --> 00:57:33,607
The warmth triggers
an exasperating itch,

347
00:57:34,748 --> 00:57:41,119
and an itch must be scratched,
no matter where, no matter how.

348
00:58:01,274 --> 00:58:03,469
Seela has an itch of her own,

349
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:09,842
to escape the crush of her family,
if only for a while.

350
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,838
Walruses aren't designed
for mountain-climbing,

351
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:41,573
but she pushes on.

352
00:58:54,594 --> 00:58:57,392
Auntie sees Seela
wandering off on her own

353
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:00,728
and starts after her

354
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:04,969
as fast as her blubber will allow.

355
00:59:12,946 --> 00:59:15,039
Suddenly, Seela disappears.

356
00:59:19,753 --> 00:59:23,086
When Auntie calls,
she gets no response.

357
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,855
Seela is strangely silent.

358
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,498
Her adventure has taken
a terrifying turn.

359
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:44,237
A stumble has left her trapped
on a narrow ledge.

360
00:59:47,547 --> 00:59:49,674
And someone has spotted her.

361
01:00:14,774 --> 01:00:17,766
The male polar bear
moves closer to attack,

362
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:25,416
and Seela takes desperate action.

363
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:34,149
She'll be sore,

364
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:37,092
but alive.

365
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,931
Now she races to warn the others.

366
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:34,246
Auntie is the last one off the island.

367
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:39,548
Seela's mother finds her,

368
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:42,692
and Auntie joins them.

369
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:53,906
The bear bides his time.

370
01:01:57,877 --> 01:02:01,369
Seela and family retreat
to another part of Rock Island.

371
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:08,177
They join the other herds driven here
by the vanishing Arctic ice.

372
01:02:16,129 --> 01:02:19,929
The changing conditions
have left many stranded and vulnerable,

373
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:24,468
and others desperate and hungry.

374
01:02:28,641 --> 01:02:31,610
Nanu reaches
the shallows of Rock Island,

375
01:02:33,213 --> 01:02:35,807
after a long week at sea.

376
01:02:48,528 --> 01:02:52,760
For a day now, she's been spurred on
by the scent of prey on the wind.

377
01:03:05,078 --> 01:03:07,569
But now that she's gotten
a look at them,

378
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,580
she's not so confident.

379
01:03:11,017 --> 01:03:13,042
These are no ringed seals.

380
01:03:15,522 --> 01:03:19,959
Nothing in Nanu's experience tells her
how to take on these big walruses.

381
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:26,097
The adults are three times her weight,
armed with teeth like daggers.

382
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:34,130
Maybe she can find one weak enough
or small enough to handle.

383
01:03:55,628 --> 01:03:58,961
Hunger compels her forward,
despite the odds.

384
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,311
But she's too young, and too small,

385
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:28,960
and they're being
completely unaccommodating.

386
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:35,225
Her last chance seems to be no chance.

387
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:45,741
Nanu may have come all this way
only to starve.

388
01:04:53,987 --> 01:04:57,787
The old male bear, however,
plans an attack from the sea,

389
01:05:05,231 --> 01:05:08,860
and makes his move
while the unsuspecting herd is napping.

390
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:46,204
The male bear approaches downwind.

391
01:05:54,147 --> 01:05:56,206
He slips in undetected.

392
01:06:23,276 --> 01:06:27,440
Seela makes for the water behind
her Auntie, but the bear grabs her.

393
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:34,144
Auntie doesn't hesitate.
She races back to save the youngster.

394
01:06:41,027 --> 01:06:44,019
Her courage allows Seela
to escape to the sea.

395
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:52,501
In an act of devotion, Auntie
makes the ultimate sacrifice.

396
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,850
Seela waits,

397
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,898
but Auntie will not return.

398
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:05,405
Meanwhile, Nanu is growing weak.

399
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:09,437
Without food,
she can't last much longer.

400
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,981
She knows the male is not
in the habit of sharing,

401
01:08:14,086 --> 01:08:16,486
and that he could easily kill her.

402
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:27,859
But now is the time to call on
the toughness her mother taught her.

403
01:09:21,254 --> 01:09:23,154
She refuses to give in.

404
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,984
He must share his kill or she will die.

405
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:33,664
And so she stands,

406
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:36,896
and keeps standing,

407
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:43,870
until he allows her to take
what she needs.

408
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:07,793
A single death
preserves the lives of many.

409
01:10:23,783 --> 01:10:28,982
For the next four years, Nanu and Seela
are driven to this rocky outpost

410
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:33,013
as the sea ice melts earlier and earlier.

411
01:10:34,727 --> 01:10:40,495
The increasing warmth has
made a demanding world more difficult,

412
01:10:43,903 --> 01:10:47,066
disrupting the ancient rhythm
of the seasons,

413
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:50,935
gradually dissolving the ice kingdom,

414
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:55,339
turning its rightful masters

415
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:58,940
into refugees.

416
01:11:11,397 --> 01:11:13,126
All over the Arctic,

417
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:17,669
animals wait longer and longer
for signs that the ice is returning.

418
01:11:19,372 --> 01:11:21,567
At long last,

419
01:11:21,674 --> 01:11:27,271
an old walrus in the herd catches
the far-off scent of sea ice and cold.

420
01:11:28,047 --> 01:11:29,844
It's time to go home.

421
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:14,582
Nanu also returns
to the ice kingdom of her birth.

422
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,163
In the spring of her eighth year,

423
01:12:28,274 --> 01:12:31,072
there's an added excitement
to being home.

424
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:39,883
Most of her life,
she avoided male bears.

425
01:12:41,353 --> 01:12:44,345
Now she finds herself drawn to one.

426
01:12:48,194 --> 01:12:52,028
And so begins a communion
as old as time,

427
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:58,729
but is of special importance
in a disappearing world.

428
01:13:26,665 --> 01:13:30,897
Later that year,
driven by instinct and memory,

429
01:13:31,003 --> 01:13:32,994
Nanu climbs Snow Mountain.

430
01:13:38,878 --> 01:13:44,009
For the first time since she was a cub,
she interrupts her life of roaming

431
01:13:44,116 --> 01:13:46,949
and seeks out the warmth
of a hidden den.

432
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:55,120
She disappears for the winter
beneath a blanket of ice and snow.

433
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:21,049
Meanwhile, Seela's tusks
have filled out nicely,

434
01:14:21,153 --> 01:14:23,018
and the boys are taking notice.

435
01:14:30,663 --> 01:14:32,858
She knows what they're after.

436
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:39,031
But Seela's got no time
for just any old male.

437
01:14:39,138 --> 01:14:40,799
She has standards,

438
01:14:42,908 --> 01:14:45,433
unlike some other females she knows.

439
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:11,200
Seela is holding out
for something special.

440
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:23,043
When a male is, well, motivated,

441
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:27,818
he can sing for 50 hours straight.

442
01:15:30,522 --> 01:15:34,151
And one of these Romeos
is still trying for Seela.

443
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:52,166
Something about the pitch
of his song finally moves her.

444
01:17:25,237 --> 01:17:27,728
On Snow Mountain,
where she was born,

445
01:17:29,074 --> 01:17:31,668
Nanu produces a miracle of the north.

446
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:02,934
And she's got a brother.

447
01:18:37,876 --> 01:18:42,904
With the arrival of spring,
Seela delivers a miracle of her own.

448
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:55,490
A new pup, a new mother.

449
01:19:00,165 --> 01:19:01,496
A new Auntie.

450
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:20,716
All across this special place,

451
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:24,619
children of the Arctic
make their way into the world

452
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:28,453
as they have for thousands of years.

453
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:35,095
Their fates are forever tied

454
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,829
to the shifting rhythms of the ice
that defines them,

455
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:44,541
their lives wrapped
in the blanket of cold

456
01:19:44,643 --> 01:19:46,941
that keeps this kingdom theirs.

457
01:19:49,214 --> 01:19:52,012
What will their children do
if it disappears?

458
01:19:56,622 --> 01:19:58,146
What will ours?

459
01:20:57,282 --> 01:20:58,544
If we change the way we live,

460
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:03,246
we can help save the lives of lots of
people and animals all over the world.

461
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:23,374
If you turn off the lights
every time you leave a room,

462
01:21:23,475 --> 01:21:26,842
it'll give all the animals
in the Arctic a brighter future.

463
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:31,177
If everyone replaced one regular
light bulb with a compact fluorescent,

464
01:21:31,283 --> 01:21:34,275
it would be like
taking one million cars off the road.

465
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:36,677
If your mom and dad buy a hybrid car,

466
01:21:36,788 --> 01:21:39,086
it'll make it easier
for polar bears to get around.

467
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:11,879
If you wash your clothes in cold water,
you use 80 percent less energy

468
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:15,426
which keeps the water where the
polar bears live from getting warmer.

469
01:22:15,994 --> 01:22:18,758
If you turn down
the temperature in your home a little,

470
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:22,061
you can keep the temperature
from rising where the Walruses live.

471
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:25,834
Drive less, carpool more. Take the bus.

472
01:22:26,305 --> 01:22:30,765
When you don't have far to go,
you can walk, bike, skate,

473
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:33,401
or if you're a walrus, you can swim.

474
01:22:34,046 --> 01:22:36,776
If you take two minutes less
in the shower,

475
01:22:36,882 --> 01:22:40,750
you can save enough water
to fill up a swimming pool in a year.

476
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:45,323
If you tell your parents
to buy fresh food instead of frozen,

477
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:47,949
you'll help save energy and animals.

478
01:22:48,627 --> 01:22:51,858
If you can figure out
how to make cheap, renewable energy,

479
01:22:51,963 --> 01:22:53,828
you'll be saving the world.

480
01:22:54,633 --> 01:22:56,260
That would be awesome.

481
01:23:13,985 --> 01:23:15,179
Plant a tree.

482
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:16,914
Plant trees everywhere.

483
01:23:17,022 --> 01:23:18,751
Plants lots of trees.

484
01:23:18,857 --> 01:23:20,825
Plant millions of trees.

485
01:23:41,113 --> 01:23:43,741
Ask your teachers
about global warming.

486
01:23:51,757 --> 01:23:55,284
What we do in our homes affects theirs.

487
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,018
We have to change the way we live.
