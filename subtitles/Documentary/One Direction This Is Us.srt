1
00:00:01,026 --> 00:00:04,308
One Direction
You And I

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,213
Hope u liked it

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,500
I figured it out,

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,200
I figured it out, from black and white

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,100
Seconds and hours

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Maybe they had to take some time

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I know how it goes

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,000
I know how it goes, from wrong and right

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,400
Silence and sound

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Did they ever hold each other, tight

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,300
Like us, did they ever fight,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Like us?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,600
You And I

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,200
We don’t want to be like them

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,100
We can make it till the end

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Nothing can come between

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,000
You And I

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,100
Not even the gods above (There's Only One GOD)

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,200
Can separate the two of us

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,000
No nothing can come between

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,000
You And I

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Ohh.. You And I

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
I figured it out

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,000
Saw the mistakes of up and down

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,300
Meet in the middle

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
There’s always room for common ground

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I see what is like

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,200
I see what is like, for day and night

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,100
Never together

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,400
Cause they see things in a different light

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,300
Like us, they never tried

32
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,000
Like us

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,000
You And I

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,000
We don’t want to be like them

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,000
We can make it till the end

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,300
Nothing can come between

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
You And I

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Not even the gods above

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,500
Can separate the two of us

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,201
Cause You And I ... haa..

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
We don’t want to be like them

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,100
We can make it till the end

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,100
Nothing can come between

44
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,000
You And I

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,100
Not even the gods above

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,200
Can separate the two of us

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No nothing can come between

48
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,000
You And I

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,900
 You And I ...haaa...

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,201
ohhhh You And I

51
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,901
You And I

52
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:44,001
We can make it .if we try

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,701
ohhhh You And I
