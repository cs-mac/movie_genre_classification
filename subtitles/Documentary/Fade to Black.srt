1
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:52,487
Oh, yes.

2
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:55,684
The Second World War had been
quite a disaster for poor old Italy.

3
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:01,522
Their Fascist leader, Mussolini,
had teamed up with Hitler.

4
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:04,193
And thought he was
on a winning ticket.

5
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:06,236
Then, Benito was
shot by partisans.

6
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:09,136
And strung up by his
heels in the local square.

7
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:16,977
Now, in 1948, the country
is still leaderless...

8
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:20,040
broke and heading for chaos.

9
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:22,415
Sure, the rich are still rich.

10
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:24,977
If you're not in
furs, you're in rags.

11
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,718
People are starving
and disillusioned...

12
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,556
and getting
angrier by the day.

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,155
Meanwhile, the black
market is booming.

14
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,827
With a fistful of lire you can get
yourself just about whatever you want.

15
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:42,236
And if you still harbor a grudge or
two from the war, it's a fine time.

16
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:45,207
To lay your mind to rest.

17
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:18,939
Certainly.

18
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:22,739
Passport.

19
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:28,175
Here.

20
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,550
My, uh, slimming pills.

21
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:37,150
Slimming?

22
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:42,856
We have to take these.

23
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,027
That will be all.
Welcome to Roma, Mr...

24
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:51,571
Welles. Orson Welles.

25
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:52,870
Thank you.

26
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,985
So, there I was, Orson Welles.

27
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:07,854
The great actor-director
hitting the eternal city in '48.

28
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:12,259
I just landed a lead role in
a picture called Black Magic.

29
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:16,425
So you see, by now I'd grown
pretty accustomed to the spotlight.

30
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:27,440
Tyrone Power! Hey, Tyrone Power.

31
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:31,447
It's true. Perhaps the
light had dimmed a little.

32
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:34,951
But don't worry. I wasn't quite
ready to relinquish my crown.

33
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,180
Signor Welles, has
she broken your heart?

34
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,721
Eh, is there another man?

35
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,586
Signor Welles, do
you know who is he?

36
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:42,353
I assume you're
speaking of Rita.

37
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,257
Sure. The divorce
is finished, no?

38
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,956
The marriage is finished,
the divorce is in the works.

39
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:51,024
Are you planning to visit the Vatican
while you're here, Mr. Hayworth?

40
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:57,831
I'd hoped to get away, to forget
for a while my private pain.

41
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,107
But she...

42
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,941
my God, she was everywhere.

43
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:10,548
This damn costume.

44
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:11,883
Is there a problem?

45
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:13,116
It's too small.

46
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,748
No, no, it's fine.

47
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,419
You sure it's all right?
It feels tight.

48
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:20,224
No, no, no, no, no.
It's terrific. No?

49
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,424
Absolutely. Absolutely.

50
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,163
Signor Wells. Signor Wells.

51
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:29,729
Your Rita, she's
so beautiful, so sexy.

52
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,138
Isn't she?

53
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,073
She's my favorite of them all.

54
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:35,668
It is such a tragedy you've
been abandoned by her.

55
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:38,180
I think you'll find it
was the other way round.

56
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:45,444
Marco, delighted to see you've
drummed up so many extras.

57
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:46,853
Well done.

58
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:50,054
No, no, no. These are not
extras, Orson. They are refugees.

59
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,458
Refugees, really?

60
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:53,826
Yes, of course. The city
is still full of them.

61
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:58,528
Your Occupation Army has no other
place, so I let them use my studio.

62
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:02,303
We are shooting synch sound?

63
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:04,432
A little noisy.

64
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:07,944
Oh, don't worry. I make it quiet
when the cameras, they roll.

65
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:11,673
Let's make a picture!

66
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,192
Okay, hard facts. My heart was
broken and my career was on the slide.

67
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,058
Right now this was
all I could get.

68
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,190
A second-rate film with
a third-rate director.

69
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:35,032
Nefter zufu, thousand blessing.

70
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,834
Oh, and the script.

71
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,375
From the darkness
beyond night...

72
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:41,502
from the forbidden mountains.

73
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:45,912
On the secret side
of the moon, behold!

74
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:48,008
Cagliostro.

75
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:50,986
See what I mean?

76
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:56,088
It's wonderful, Orson.
It's perfect.

77
00:05:58,128 --> 00:06:01,894
Moby Dick. No.

78
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:05,094
The whale doesn't have to be
huge and neither does the budget.

79
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,865
But, you see, I had plans, many of them.

80
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:12,136
To direct a host of movies that
even now are running in my head.

81
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,878
Another masterpiece
was waiting in the wings.

82
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:20,383
And the chance to return
home the conquering hero.

83
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,784
There is my,
my Othello, of course.

84
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,947
Who's that by?

85
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:30,790
By William... Look, could I please
speak to Mr. Korda in person?

86
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,624
How could I know then
the chain of events...

87
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,930
the danger,
deception and murder.

88
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,665
That was about to unfold?

89
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:52,241
I'm sorry to intrude...

90
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:55,376
but we shall be working together
this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

91
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:59,411
And I must say what a
great honor it is for me.

92
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,890
Please, sit down.

93
00:07:07,297 --> 00:07:10,789
And, you know? We have a passion in common.

94
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:13,736
A magician.

95
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:16,466
My card.

96
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,337
Alessandro Dellere.

97
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:26,477
Oh. Bravo.

98
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,111
Oh, yes, and I hear you had a
little trouble at the customs.

99
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:31,916
Yes.

100
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:38,258
My slimming pills.
How did you...

101
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:41,689
Remarkable.

102
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:52,669
All the movie is in my head. I have
one master, one close-up on you.

103
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,710
Yes, but you need
to go low and wide.

104
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:58,145
You have to give it some
power when the dragoons attack!

105
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,046
Alessandro.

106
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:03,109
I am the director, no?

107
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:08,625
The director that commands the most
respect is the one who listens the most.

108
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,525
But, Orson, wait a minute.

109
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:15,292
When you direct, you never
listen to the actors. Never.

110
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:19,062
It is my great weakness.

111
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:21,866
And have them put an
18-mil-lens on the third camera.

112
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,466
And add some torches to the
background to deepen the focus. Yeah?

113
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:29,145
What third camera?

114
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:46,319
I think she recognizes me.

115
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:56,067
He looks like the Queen.

116
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:05,747
Who is she?

117
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:08,284
One of our players.
Lea Padovani.

118
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,343
She's temperamental.

119
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,581
She's magnificent.

120
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:15,022
Orson, are you ready?

121
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:39,105
They're coming. They're coming. The army.

122
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:51,889
No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop!

123
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:08,974
Alessandro.

124
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:24,487
Ne... Ro.

125
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:26,153
Nero.

126
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:42,870
You know Signor
Dellere how long?

127
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:46,177
I only met him yesterday.

128
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,550
At the studio, we know. And we
know he gave you something, yes?

129
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:53,283
What? Oh, yes.

130
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:58,186
He gave me my, uh,
slimming pills.

131
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,560
Clearly a very
well connected man.

132
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:02,121
You have?

133
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,668
Yes.

134
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,897
And what did he say to you?

135
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,462
He was very pleasant.

136
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,906
Nothing really.

137
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,570
How did he die?
Was it his heart?

138
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:17,546
He takes too much drugs.

139
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,639
Really?

140
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:23,083
We find this in his coat.
In the dressing room.

141
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,986
It was opium. Very strong, very pure.

142
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:31,391
Well, he didn't seem under the
influence when I spoke to him.

143
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,554
He was addicted many years.

144
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,393
It's an overdose.

145
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:36,989
What?

146
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,262
Overdose.

147
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:42,669
When he was dying, did
he say something to you?

148
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:45,731
Did he whisper something, yes?

149
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:52,244
What did he say
to you, Mr. Welles?

150
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,447
Mr. Welles?

151
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,759
I couldn't make it out.

152
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,006
Okay, Tomasso, let's go.

153
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,884
Back to the hotel, Mr. Welles?

154
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:06,919
Be right there.

155
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:26,506
You in next?

156
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:30,034
Because there's definitely
something tricky going on.

157
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:33,348
Why you say that?

158
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:37,312
I got this bit player
dying in my arms.

159
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:40,322
And he didn't look
like an addict to me.

160
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,154
And he was definitely
trying to tell me something.

161
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:45,387
He was whispering.

162
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:48,556
What do you mean?
What did he say?

163
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:03,741
Perhaps I owe you
an introduction.

164
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:07,245
I know who you are.

165
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:09,751
You are the Army Occupation.

166
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,651
You have invaded Cinecitta.

167
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,746
Ah, the camera.

168
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:19,387
I would have apologized, but I
was struck dumb by your beauty.

169
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:23,422
Americans think the world is
made so they can play with it.

170
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,764
The Italians own
everything worth having.

171
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:27,667
The best wine, the best food.

172
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,830
Except when we are starving.

173
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,934
In that case, may I
invite you to dinner?

174
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:38,276
You may not!

175
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:53,558
The bit player,
he was my stepfather.

176
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,655
Oh, I'm...

177
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,970
I guess you'll be dining
alone, Mr. Welles.

178
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:13,709
I wouldn't bet on it, T omasso.

179
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,151
What's your story with the cops?

180
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:25,094
Fat one an old flame?

181
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:29,291
I used to work here. Criminal
Investigation Department.

182
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:31,493
You're a little
young to be a cop.

183
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:32,967
Ex-cop.

184
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:34,628
Ex-cop?

185
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,969
I made life difficult
for the wrong people.

186
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:42,671
So, cop, what kind
of fellow was Dellere?

187
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:46,807
Take my advice. Italy is a
very dangerous place right now.

188
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:48,976
Anger from the war.

189
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,983
Don't get involved.

190
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,523
So you think it was
a vendetta of some kind?

191
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:57,526
You have a problem
understanding my English?

192
00:15:57,594 --> 00:16:00,358
No. What's going on?

193
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,022
Communist demonstration.

194
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,531
Hey, hey, wait!

195
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:09,697
T ogliatti, T ogliatti.

196
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:11,331
Hey, wait.

197
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:14,070
Mr. Welles, come back.

198
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,341
Hey, wait.

199
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:23,045
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

200
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:25,349
Get out of the shot.

201
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,481
Never know when it
might come in handy.

202
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:29,184
Come on, this is dangerous.

203
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:40,392
You should see it
from up here, Tomasso.

204
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,098
It's great.

205
00:16:57,253 --> 00:17:02,247
Hey, hey, time to go. Come on, let's go.

206
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,089
Come on. Stay with me.

207
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:09,765
I love the spirit, the chaos.

208
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,165
The Italian people,
they've been through so much.

209
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:14,499
They really deserve
some kind of democracy.

210
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:17,870
A guy who drives in a limousine
is gonna talk to me about people?

211
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:20,501
Well, you seem happy
enough to be driving one.

212
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:23,137
Do I seem happy to you?

213
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,681
Tommaso, come on,
let's get out of here.

214
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:01,110
Nero.

215
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,534
What do you want?

216
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,977
They say you held him when he died.

217
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:33,806
Come in.

218
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,618
We are ebrei.

219
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:42,954
Jews.

220
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:46,484
When the Nazi come,
they raid the ghetto.

221
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:50,966
Everywhere they
take people away.

222
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:53,502
He give me a paper,
Signor Dellere...

223
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,538
that say I am
born a Catholic.

224
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:59,200
I see. Like a birth certificate.

225
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,766
If Jews had saints...

226
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,814
they would pray
to Signor Dellere.

227
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:08,214
They're ready for
you, Signor Welles.

228
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,917
May God protect you, Mr Welles.

229
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:21,720
Only death.

230
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:24,596
Knows all the answers.

231
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:29,595
Stop!

232
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,159
Signor Dellere's last shot.

233
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:01,066
Is no usable. None of it.

234
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:13,112
Now I must go to the funeral,
but tomorrow we do the re-shoots.

235
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,777
T ell me, did the
Police see this?

236
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,080
Of course.

237
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:18,848
And?

238
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,947
They say they see nothing.

239
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,629
You were watching, right?

240
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:31,758
He put his hand up against
his neck and took it away.

241
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:35,999
And yet nobody said a word. Why?

242
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,799
Nero.

243
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,578
What?

244
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:46,114
The last words
of a murdered man.

245
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:57,591
Did you tell the
Police what he said?

246
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,628
No.

247
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:01,823
Then why tell me?

248
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:03,798
They fired you, didn't they?

249
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,334
Huh.

250
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:11,168
Back to the hotel.

251
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:14,506
I say we join the convoy.

252
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:18,172
Some people would say
this is not your business.

253
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,011
These are people's lives.

254
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,243
Yes?

255
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:23,080
Real people.

256
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:27,113
I'm a director, Signor Moreno.

257
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,090
People's lives are my business.

258
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:32,025
Besides, I'm, uh,
addicted to mystery.

259
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:04,791
Look at her.

260
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,622
Breathtaking.

261
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:13,732
Is that the mother?
I think I recognize her.

262
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:15,896
Aida Padovani.

263
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:20,602
Aida Padovani, of course.
The silent movie star.

264
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:27,578
What's the joke?

265
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,948
No, no, no. Nothing.

266
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:37,054
It's not every day you find them
all staring into the same grave.

267
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:55,701
Hey, look.

268
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:58,906
Were you a friend
of the deceased?

269
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:00,279
Pete Brewster.

270
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,647
Hey there, buddy.

271
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:09,351
Last time I saw you was
in a brothel in Sao Paolo.

272
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:13,384
Really? I didn't
think anybody saw me.

273
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:16,159
So, how the hell are you?

274
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:24,304
I'm sorry about
Rita. Damn shame.

275
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:26,239
Yeah.

276
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:29,107
So, you're here with
the State Department?

277
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:33,205
That's right. Trying to get these
guys back on their feet after the war.

278
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:35,307
The Friendship Programme,
they call it.

279
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,444
Friendship?

280
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,422
You know, shipping in food,
bicycles, clothing, you name it.

281
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:43,982
We're even helping them
set up a new government.

282
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,618
You follow the politics at all?

283
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:47,993
Not really, I just
read the graffiti.

284
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:51,465
The election's next month and there's
almost a hundred parties competing.

285
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,772
It's a mess. That's why
we're getting behind

286
00:23:53,784 --> 00:23:55,834
these new guys, the
Christian Democrats.

287
00:23:55,905 --> 00:24:00,968
They, at least, have a vision of the
future, not squabbling over the past.

288
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:03,410
In fact, well...

289
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:09,842
we're putting on this big show
as part of the election campaign...

290
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,013
and I was wondering...

291
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,750
Go on.

292
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:17,520
I was hoping you might do your magic act.

293
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:21,859
I saw you do it for the troops
in '42, remember? Fantastic!

294
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:24,024
Yeah.

295
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,160
Oh, I don't know, Pete. I'm here
working on a picture, you know.

296
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:30,262
Yes, of course.

297
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:34,543
I'll keep a slot
open, just in case.

298
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,407
Sure.

299
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:41,375
And by the way, you still owe me a drink.

300
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,611
Surely not.

301
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,218
It's good to see you.

302
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:58,329
What did your pal have to say?

303
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:02,394
He's not my pal. He's a
brute, he's an asshole.

304
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:04,633
He have a name?

305
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:07,574
Mainardi. Ugo Mainardi.

306
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:10,077
Calls himself a Communist.

307
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:12,876
What's he doing here?

308
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:15,975
He told me they had
some business together.

309
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:18,486
Dellere had some
information wanted.

310
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:22,317
Did you ask him what
kind of information?

311
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:26,693
I did, yeah.

312
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:28,992
What did he say?

313
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:31,556
"Go fuck yourself."

314
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:33,261
Charming.

315
00:25:37,306 --> 00:25:40,605
I think it's time for me to pay
my respects to the grieving family.

316
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:43,735
The lovely Padovanis.

317
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:46,509
She'll never have
dinner with you.

318
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:47,640
What?

319
00:26:10,973 --> 00:26:13,203
So, if you're not a
Communist, what are you?

320
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:17,042
Me? I'm nothing.

321
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:20,708
Come now, Tommaso. I think you need
to work on your self-esteem a little.

322
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:22,978
Or maybe you could
just lend me some?

323
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,982
Tomasso.

324
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:41,296
Hey.

325
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,031
Wait here.

326
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:48,295
Ferenc, no.

327
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:50,134
Shit.

328
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,833
The timing is not an accident.

329
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:55,035
They knew we'd be
at the funeral.

330
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:58,080
Nothing seems to be missing.

331
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:01,548
It looks like they were
looking for something.

332
00:28:01,617 --> 00:28:04,586
Something particular.

333
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:07,714
Well, the Police
will be here soon.

334
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,858
What? What is it?

335
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:13,758
Mr. Welles, mother...

336
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,423
is not convinced the
Police are being so helpful.

337
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:21,198
If you mean you think there's something
suspicious about Alessandro's death...

338
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,170
we're inclined to agree.

339
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:25,673
He was murdered for sure.

340
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:28,938
And we are going
to find out who by.

341
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,248
My medicine. Thank you.

342
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:22,551
Then, one morning.

343
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,718
I hear some cars
pull up outside.

344
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:27,228
They break in the door.

345
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:30,163
I hear jackboots in the hall.

346
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:33,895
Cesare, my first husband,
he tried to resist.

347
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:36,665
And the Nazis, they shot him.

348
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:38,969
They took Lea and I.

349
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:42,807
They interrogated us.

350
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:51,452
And then this handsome
actor appears like an angel.

351
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,054
Alessandro?

352
00:30:57,126 --> 00:31:00,027
He gave us false
birth certificates.

353
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:01,926
To say we are not Jews.

354
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:12,600
"Age cannot wither her."

355
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:18,504
Cleopatra.

356
00:31:20,282 --> 00:31:21,772
I'm sure you were wonderful.

357
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,614
Oh!

358
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:28,615
Oh.

359
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:31,353
Your Messalina.

360
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:32,860
You saw it?

361
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:35,260
Huh? No.

362
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:37,923
But it's legendary.

363
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,628
But you must come
and see it some time.

364
00:31:40,703 --> 00:31:43,570
It was Alessandro's favorite.

365
00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:52,807
And perhaps when, uh, the
circumstances are kinder...

366
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:54,941
we might combine it with dinner.

367
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:56,109
Dinner?

368
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,620
How could I resist?

369
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:27,782
All magicians, you know, have
something up their sleeve.

370
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,442
Giuseppe Albergini.

371
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:31,679
That's a Christian Democrat.

372
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:33,654
Cardinal Sfogliano.

373
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:35,656
Count Montenegro.

374
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:36,850
He died last week.

375
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:38,325
Really?

376
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:39,986
Yeah. You didn't read about it?

377
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:42,189
Gunned down in his Mercedes.

378
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,698
Gianni Brasciatti,
that's the, uh...

379
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,758
The investor for the film, yeah.

380
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:48,769
Ermano Pontecorvino.

381
00:32:48,837 --> 00:32:52,933
That's another Christian
Democrat. He's-he's dead, too.

382
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:56,035
Mm.

383
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:57,271
What?

384
00:32:57,346 --> 00:33:00,213
Orson Welles.

385
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:07,017
Yes. Mr. Peter Brewster.

386
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:10,154
Yes, this is Orson Welles.

387
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:12,216
I'm a friend of his.

388
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:15,320
Ah. Would you please let
him know that I called?

389
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:18,298
It's very, very
urgent. Thank you.

390
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:41,218
I have no idea why he had
such a thing or what it means.

391
00:33:45,494 --> 00:33:48,395
Does the name Nero
mean anything to you?

392
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:59,703
My mother takes
drugs for her pain.

393
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:01,504
Opium.

394
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:04,774
Alessandro got them from
a man he called Nero.

395
00:34:07,182 --> 00:34:10,117
Do you know where
we might find him?

396
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:13,279
Sandro was a very
private guy sometimes.

397
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,121
I know this woman. She
worked for me in the force.

398
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:22,288
She knows all the dealers.
I can contact her.

399
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:24,332
Orson!

400
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:28,129
Orson, you remember Gianni?

401
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:30,728
Gianni Brasciatti.

402
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:33,741
Y es, of course. I never
forget an investor...

403
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,369
though there are many that
would like to forget me.

404
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:40,381
We were just wondering if you have
thought some more about my proposition.

405
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,714
What proposition? Oh, a picture?

406
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:45,481
I was contemplating the Bard.

407
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:46,987
Shakespeare!

408
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:48,751
Yes. A screenplay adaptation.

409
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:51,952
Shot for the first time
on location in Italy.

410
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:55,827
A wonderful idea, Orson. The
Merchant of Venice perhaps?

411
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:57,661
No.

412
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:59,325
Romeo and Juliet?

413
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:03,167
No. Othello.

414
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:05,172
You would make a splendid Moor.

415
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,835
So, wh-what do you
think, Gianni, uh?

416
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:12,438
Signor Welles will
direct Othello, hm?

417
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:16,143
By William Shakespeare
here in Italy.

418
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,186
And you and your friends.

419
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:21,552
Will give us lots
and lots of money.

420
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:24,252
Hm?

421
00:35:24,326 --> 00:35:26,624
I, uh...

422
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:29,562
Well, um...

423
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:34,431
we will do it.

424
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:38,365
Mr. Brasciatti.

425
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,977
You see, Othello was
a military genius.

426
00:35:53,055 --> 00:35:56,115
And the powerful
don't trust genius.

427
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,386
They may respect it...

428
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,552
may envy it.

429
00:36:01,764 --> 00:36:04,892
They may use it for their own
purpose, but don't trust it.

430
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,902
When I first went to Hollywood,
I might as well been a Moor.

431
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,736
I had a legion of lagos,
all plotting my downfall.

432
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:13,968
It's a waste of their
time, of course.

433
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:16,670
I'm perfectly capable
of destroying myself.

434
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:24,245
Stop the car.

435
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:29,315
Wait, wait.

436
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,333
No!

437
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:51,344
No!

438
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,348
Down, down!

439
00:37:15,204 --> 00:37:17,138
Brasciatti.

440
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:28,979
At least this time we can be
sure it wasn't an overdose.

441
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:32,748
Yeah, and if you give to us
sooner the list, Signor Brasciatti.

442
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:35,255
He might still be
walking around.

443
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:39,158
Maybe. And maybe if you looked a
little closer at the Dellere case...

444
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:41,321
you would have found
the list yourself.

445
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,632
Gentlemen.

446
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:50,600
I owe you my life.

447
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:53,163
No big deal.
You know my informer?

448
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:54,470
Yes.

449
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:57,103
She's got a lead on Nero.

450
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,670
Mr. Welles, do you believe
it's a Russian plot?

451
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:02,182
Is it true you were working
undercover, Mr. Welles?

452
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:04,014
Maybe it was the Russians?

453
00:38:04,086 --> 00:38:05,644
How does it feel to be a hero?

454
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:07,689
A hero? Well, I don't know about that.

455
00:38:07,756 --> 00:38:10,350
The American Government
is paying you, Signor Welles?

456
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:12,359
Surely not.

457
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:15,794
Must be good to be back on
the front pages, Mr. Hayworth.

458
00:38:15,864 --> 00:38:17,991
You could have got
yourself killed.

459
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:20,796
Y eah, and saved somebody else
the trouble. What did I do exactly?

460
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:22,928
You just foiled
a Communist plot.

461
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:24,632
Plot? What plot?

462
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:26,901
Remember these guys?

463
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:33,343
Yeah, from the funeral.
Ugo, Ugo, that Communist guy.

464
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:36,145
Seems they'd do just about
anything to win the elections.

465
00:38:36,218 --> 00:38:38,482
Really?

466
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:42,284
Everyone on the list is either
Christian Democrat or Democrat supporter.

467
00:38:42,357 --> 00:38:44,951
What's it got to do with me?
Why do they wanna kill me?

468
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:47,461
'Cause you're a Yank.
We're backing them, too.

469
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:50,054
These people hate that.

470
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:53,568
Your assassination is a neat way
of making these feelings known.

471
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:56,661
The higher the profile,
bigger the headline.

472
00:38:56,738 --> 00:38:58,899
Haven't they ever
heard of Tyrone Power?

473
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:00,703
You'll be fine.

474
00:39:00,776 --> 00:39:02,869
Good morning, Mr. Welles.

475
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:05,914
James Dunn, your
Ambassador here in Rome.

476
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:10,645
Allow me to introduce Signor Cava
of the Christian Democrat Party.

477
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,552
And Monsignor Pressner
of the Vatican.

478
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:15,146
Signor.

479
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:17,020
The great and the good. I'm honored.

480
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:19,151
We must thank you, Mr. Welles.

481
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:22,594
You have done this country
a truly great service.

482
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:25,030
I'm only too pleased
to see justice done.

483
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,059
We are hoping you might also
honor us, uh, with your magic show.

484
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:33,164
Uh, Mr. Brewster, he
tell us so much about it.

485
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:36,108
Strengthen the bond
between nations.

486
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:38,612
For the election campaign?

487
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,046
Part of the Friendship
Programme, exactly.

488
00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:43,448
Friendship, yes. You
help us win the election...

489
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:45,884
we help you make
your wonderful films.

490
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:49,185
Oh. You mean financing?

491
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:52,153
Why not?

492
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,591
You don't like them, huh?

493
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:58,860
What? Christian Democrats?

494
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,299
Yeah.

495
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:02,769
Nice shiny suits.

496
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:04,635
Meaning?

497
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,266
They still have their
black shirts in the closet.

498
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:12,806
My guess is half of them
were Fascists in the war.

499
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:19,286
Tell me something, Tommaso. Were you born
cynical or did you have to cultivate it?

500
00:40:19,354 --> 00:40:22,323
So, back to the hotel?

501
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:24,484
What do you think?

502
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,153
Uh, I think we still
have a loose end.

503
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,053
Tombolo? What
happens in Tombolo?

504
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,559
You don't want to go there.

505
00:41:32,627 --> 00:41:36,028
Well, you don't seem
too keen yourself.

506
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:45,735
So much of the art of cinema
died when sound as introduced.

507
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:47,206
You really think so?

508
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:49,368
Oh, yes, I know so.

509
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:54,642
But a great performance
always survives.

510
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:59,546
And here's the finale.

511
00:41:59,621 --> 00:42:02,920
Messalina. The Joan
Crawford of ancient Rome.

512
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:09,089
And how like your daughter.

513
00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:11,655
Same profile.

514
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:18,767
Ribbons of dreams.

515
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:27,407
So, Marco, I hear you are to make a film
of Othello with Mr. Welles. Is it true?

516
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:29,780
Yes, indeed. The preparations have begun.

517
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:33,082
I hope you gentlemen are
considering my daughter.

518
00:42:34,823 --> 00:42:37,291
She would make
the perfect Desdemona.

519
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,691
Mother, please.

520
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:42,924
I'm only saying what it's obvious.
You are the genuine article, after all.

521
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:50,637
I'll certainly keep her in mind.

522
00:42:52,107 --> 00:42:54,268
Good evening, everybody. Aida.

523
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:55,809
Hello.

524
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:57,936
Lea, have you forgotten?

525
00:42:58,013 --> 00:43:00,982
No, I'm ready.
Excuse me, everyone.

526
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,210
Mother, I'm sorry,
I did tell you.

527
00:43:03,285 --> 00:43:05,446
I know, I know.
Enjoy yourselves.

528
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,044
Where are you going?

529
00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:08,817
We're going dancing.
You want to come?

530
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:14,622
You should take Signor Welles.
Show a bit of the town. Hm?

531
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:16,664
Uh, I don't think so.

532
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:20,633
Of course, why not?
You must come.

533
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:38,844
She isn't seeing Glenn
Ford, she's seeing Aly Khan.

534
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,016
Of course, my even greater
star is Veronica Lake.

535
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:44,319
Do you know her?

536
00:43:44,392 --> 00:43:45,620
Yes.

537
00:43:45,694 --> 00:43:49,790
Oh, she is so, so, so...

538
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,195
Short.

539
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:53,200
Like a ray of sunshine.

540
00:43:53,268 --> 00:43:56,795
Her skin is like cream
and her hair is pure gold.

541
00:43:56,871 --> 00:44:01,069
Your Desdemona, she should
have the golden locks.

542
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:05,609
Did Lea say we saw your films?

543
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,170
No!

544
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:12,116
And?

545
00:44:12,187 --> 00:44:14,985
Um, they surprised me.

546
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:19,186
Surprised you? Good
surprise or bad surprise?

547
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:24,289
Well, if they were bad, I
wouldn't have been surprised.

548
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:11,397
Come on.

549
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:24,562
I have to go.

550
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,539
Could you see Stella
gets safely home?

551
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:28,337
Yes, of course.

552
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,767
Is Rita?

553
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,238
No.

554
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:42,944
No, it's...

555
00:49:43,017 --> 00:49:45,212
It's not Rita.

556
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,808
I got you, Mr. Welles.

557
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:17,908
You make a lot of trouble.
Big fucking trouble.

558
00:50:17,986 --> 00:50:21,820
I think maybe it's time
for you to die, yes?

559
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:33,328
Is no the Communists.

560
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:40,505
We no make this list.
We no make those killings.

561
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:51,078
If we want you dead,
you'd be dead long time.

562
00:50:51,152 --> 00:50:52,949
Orson?

563
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:55,216
Tombolo.

564
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,689
Is they who is
trying to kill you.

565
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,397
Orson, are you okay?

566
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:11,369
Tombolo.

567
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:37,627
After the war, all the outlaws,
the gangsters, collaborators...

568
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:41,032
the prostitutes, deserters,
they moved out of Rome.

569
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:44,730
They took refuge in the woods.

570
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,138
They call it Tombolo but...

571
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,741
this is not a town.

572
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,247
It's a disease.

573
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,480
So, tell me.

574
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:09,692
In the war.

575
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:12,927
The Fascists brought
people here to torture them.

576
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:19,503
People, huh?

577
00:52:24,879 --> 00:52:27,746
Only ghosts. Only ghosts.

578
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:33,112
Some of these ghosts,
they won't lay down.

579
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:37,422
They still breathe
the same air we breathe.

580
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,666
You're out of your
fucking depth.

581
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:52,069
That may very well be where
I'm most at home, Tomasso.

582
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:22,260
The name Nero? No.

583
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:36,447
Can I help you, gentlemen?

584
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:45,123
My name is Joe.

585
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:47,161
Follow me.

586
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:56,702
Hey, baby!

587
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,530
We got company.

588
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,608
This here is Flavia.

589
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:09,241
Yes, I believe we've met.

590
00:54:09,317 --> 00:54:12,286
So, where's Nero?

591
00:54:12,353 --> 00:54:14,184
That's me.

592
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:18,322
Giuseppe Nero.

593
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:20,326
Joe Black.

594
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,964
So, gentlemen, what's the deal?

595
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:28,433
Have you ever heard of,
uh, Alessandro Dellere.

596
00:54:28,502 --> 00:54:31,164
You got some kind
of accusation to make?

597
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:35,508
Down! Get down!

598
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:37,840
You bring the cops?

599
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:39,004
You set me up?

600
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,411
No.

601
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:45,785
What's happening?

602
00:54:45,853 --> 00:54:49,289
A raid. Military
Police. Stay quiet.

603
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:55,425
Rounding up deserters. Ain't
never gonna catch Joe Black.

604
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:18,781
Thank you.

605
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:25,485
Why would I kill Mr. Dellere when he
was gonna get me back to the States?

606
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,390
He was?

607
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:31,397
Sure. He was gonna get me
a passport and everything.

608
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:35,231
I heard he prepared fake
papers for Jews during the war.

609
00:55:35,303 --> 00:55:39,137
For a price, yeah.
What's more...

610
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:42,141
after you got it, you might
have to keep on paying.

611
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:49,346
He saved Jews to blackmail them?

612
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:53,251
I'm telling you, Mr. Dellere was
into all kind of monkey business.

613
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:57,018
Got into some bad shit.
Wanted me to go in with him.

614
00:55:57,091 --> 00:56:00,686
Even threatened to turn me in if I didn't.

615
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:06,393
I politely threatened him back.

616
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:07,900
What kind of deep shit?

617
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,028
Hell, man, why
should I tell you?

618
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:12,834
Look, Joe, I...

619
00:56:12,907 --> 00:56:16,240
I know important people.

620
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:20,440
Ambassadors, State
Department people.

621
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:23,972
People that can help
you get back home.

622
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:33,618
We got a deal?

623
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:36,185
You could give me your word.

624
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,125
You got it.

625
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:44,103
Follow me.

626
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:54,814
What is it made you run, Joe?

627
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:57,282
I was in Transpo, fifth Army.

628
00:56:57,351 --> 00:57:01,617
Seen a bunch of my friends
get blown into little pieces.

629
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:04,453
Then they pulled us
back behind the lines.

630
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:08,621
And I see the Nazi son of
a bitches been killing us.

631
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:11,961
Getting treated
better than we are.

632
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:14,501
So, one day I go on leave...

633
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,567
get a little drunk...

634
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:21,768
and I don't come back.

635
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,742
Here we are.

636
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:36,689
So Dellere was
blackmailing these people?

637
00:57:38,859 --> 00:57:40,349
Let's take a closer look.

638
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:41,759
That's where we part company.

639
00:57:43,497 --> 00:57:44,930
Joe.

640
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,990
Thank you.

641
00:57:57,945 --> 00:57:59,913
Wait.

642
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,377
Come on.

643
00:58:07,455 --> 00:58:08,547
Come.

644
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:09,714
Okay.

645
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:29,970
What's in those boxes?

646
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:44,981
Tommaso!

647
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,254
Wait, I wanna see.

648
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:03,833
Let's go.

649
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:46,279
Orson. Orson!

650
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:41,198
I'm telling you, Pete, there were
enough guns to start a revolution.

651
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:43,038
Phone call from Washington, sir.

652
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,600
Not now.

653
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:50,209
You think it's the Communists?

654
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:52,616
First the hit list, then this?

655
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:55,883
I guess they're not happy with
the occasional assassination.

656
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:58,720
Maybe they're
looking for civil war.

657
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:00,885
You really think
they're that organized?

658
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:03,054
Sure.

659
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,530
Now they've hooked
up with the Russians...

660
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,228
wouldn't surprise me if this whole
thing wasn't cooked up in the Kremlin.

661
01:01:09,303 --> 01:01:11,567
L-I don't think
it's the Communists.

662
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:15,200
Yeah, that guy with Mainardi, I mean,
you know, he could have killed me.

663
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:21,206
Do something for me.

664
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:24,649
I don't care who does what
to whom in this country...

665
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:28,484
but you're an American citizen.
That means you are my responsibility.

666
01:01:28,555 --> 01:01:32,753
And you're so lucky not to be floating
face down in the Tiber right now.

667
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:36,421
So, please, finish
your lousy movie.

668
01:01:36,497 --> 01:01:40,160
And try to stay out of
trouble for five minutes.

669
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,431
Maybe you're right.

670
01:01:45,506 --> 01:01:47,269
I know I'm right.

671
01:01:47,341 --> 01:01:50,003
It is a lousy movie.

672
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:56,781
I'm only kidding.
Sweet of you to care.

673
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,251
Don't kid yourself.
You die on my turf...

674
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:04,849
you foul up my report. Some
people have got work to do.

675
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,692
Will you do
something for me, Pete?

676
01:02:08,762 --> 01:02:10,457
If it's sensible.

677
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:12,692
This guy, Joe Black...

678
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:17,135
I made him a promise that
he could get back home.

679
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,263
It would mean a lot to me.

680
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,605
Joe Black? I'll get on to it.

681
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:25,144
Thanks.

682
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:30,615
Orson.

683
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:35,283
Behave yourself.

684
01:02:42,896 --> 01:02:44,329
No!

685
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:49,295
He saved me, you know,
my mother and me.

686
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:54,000
Maybe he got caught up with bad people.

687
01:03:08,522 --> 01:03:10,581
Okay, the truth.

688
01:03:14,528 --> 01:03:18,931
I always felt there
was another side to him.

689
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:22,025
A side even my
mother did not know.

690
01:03:25,773 --> 01:03:27,832
A kind of shadow.

691
01:03:34,348 --> 01:03:37,374
But I never dreamed.

692
01:03:54,768 --> 01:03:57,134
I'm so tired.

693
01:03:59,773 --> 01:04:02,901
So tired.

694
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:05,536
You're beautiful.

695
01:04:23,997 --> 01:04:28,900
It gives me wonder,
great as my content.

696
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:32,427
To see you here before me.

697
01:04:32,506 --> 01:04:35,669
O, my soul's joy.

698
01:04:36,844 --> 01:04:38,607
I think I'm in love.

699
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:42,115
I think you're confused.

700
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:44,742
Oh, no.

701
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:49,647
As I look into your eyes...

702
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:54,619
I begin to understand myself.

703
01:04:56,497 --> 01:04:59,796
Is that a quotation, too?

704
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:04,270
Oh, no. Maybe some day.

705
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:24,482
It's okay.

706
01:05:24,558 --> 01:05:27,652
I probably won't slap you.

707
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:48,473
If you say go, I go
without argument...

708
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:51,416
without complaint.

709
01:05:54,555 --> 01:05:56,682
Go then.

710
01:05:56,757 --> 01:05:59,157
Now.

711
01:06:13,507 --> 01:06:15,600
Okay.

712
01:06:56,883 --> 01:06:59,750
Lorenza.

713
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:06,084
That's a wrap.

714
01:07:09,596 --> 01:07:13,032
Now is the time for
serious business.

715
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,365
Now is the time to give the
world your noble Moor, Othello.

716
01:07:16,436 --> 01:07:21,499
Yes. Actually, I've,
um, begun casting.

717
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:23,941
May I introduce you.

718
01:07:24,011 --> 01:07:26,536
My Desdemona.

719
01:07:26,613 --> 01:07:29,673
Of course. The genuine article.

720
01:07:32,653 --> 01:07:34,211
Marco.

721
01:07:36,456 --> 01:07:38,287
You are serious?

722
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:40,553
Yes, of course.

723
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:43,425
And you will be a
wonderful Desdemona.

724
01:07:43,497 --> 01:07:47,456
We will be wonderful together.

725
01:08:18,031 --> 01:08:23,799
For I fear my soul hath
her content, so absolute.

726
01:08:26,506 --> 01:08:29,304
Good evening, Mr. Welles.

727
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:23,058
Word is, Mr. Welles, you've been snooping
about the place. Asking too many questions.

728
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:25,291
Is that right?
What kind of questions?

729
01:09:25,365 --> 01:09:27,731
Now, that's what I mean, see?

730
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:31,168
You're planning to do your next
picture in his country, I hear.

731
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:32,671
A Shakespearean tragedy.

732
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:34,570
Yeah. Othello.

733
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:38,270
I guess the real tragedy
would be it didn't happen.

734
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:50,822
Maybe not such a great idea mixing
with your Commie pals in public.

735
01:09:53,426 --> 01:09:54,586
It's terrible.

736
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:57,755
You see what I'm saying?

737
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:00,891
Look how much
weight I've put on.

738
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:15,871
But you see the
ramifications, I think.

739
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:19,112
They say there's a new
era dawning in the States.

740
01:10:19,186 --> 01:10:21,916
There's gonna be a major
shake-out, they say.

741
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:25,583
Names are gonna be named.
Careers are gonna be ruined.

742
01:10:25,659 --> 01:10:28,628
And if these were to end up in
the hands of the wrong people, huh?

743
01:10:28,695 --> 01:10:31,596
You're ahead of me, Mr. Welles.

744
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:37,034
You're a very
persuasive man, Mr...

745
01:10:37,103 --> 01:10:38,866
Luciano.

746
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:42,636
Luciano?

747
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:45,576
Yeah. So, hey...

748
01:10:45,645 --> 01:10:48,978
be a good boy, stop
with the snooping...

749
01:10:49,049 --> 01:10:51,643
just do your
little magic act...

750
01:10:51,718 --> 01:10:55,176
and maybe you and the Bard will
get to do business after all.

751
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:03,625
And the good news is we've got even more
stars from back home to make an appearance.

752
01:11:03,697 --> 01:11:06,598
Tyrone Power, no less.

753
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:10,158
Mr. Welles, do you have everything
you need for the performance?

754
01:11:10,237 --> 01:11:12,831
Let me see. Hopefully
a captive audience.

755
01:11:12,906 --> 01:11:15,773
A beautiful assistant.

756
01:11:15,842 --> 01:11:18,470
The finance for my next picture.

757
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:21,571
Who needs a stage? I
should be walking on air.

758
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,450
It is an alliance of some kind.

759
01:11:29,522 --> 01:11:32,355
The Mafia, the Fascists,
the Christian Democrats.

760
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:34,689
A conspiracy.

761
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:38,026
Those weapons in Tombolo,
it isn't a Communist plot.

762
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:41,625
It's a plot against the Communists.
It's a plan to destroy them.

763
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:43,532
In case they win
the elections, huh?

764
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:45,400
Yeah.

765
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,033
It has the ugly ring of truth.

766
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:53,034
We gotta do something.

767
01:11:53,113 --> 01:11:56,480
Elections are next week. Orson,
you have to go to the newspapers.

768
01:11:56,549 --> 01:11:58,483
Now, just a second.

769
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:01,145
We have to blow this wide
open. They won't listen to me.

770
01:12:01,221 --> 01:12:03,781
No. Tomasso, I can't.

771
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:07,450
What?

772
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:14,196
Your country,
it's... it's a tragedy.

773
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:17,395
It's tearing itself apart. It's not
as if I haven't done my bit to help.

774
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,062
What are you saying?

775
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:21,266
You gotta draw
the line somewhere.

776
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:26,571
It's-it's your
career? Is that it?

777
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:29,137
You-you're afraid of losing
the money for your movie?

778
01:12:29,215 --> 01:12:31,740
It's not just a career, Tomasso.

779
01:12:31,818 --> 01:12:33,665
Because of your big Mr.
Welles career you're

780
01:12:33,677 --> 01:12:35,413
gonna sit on your fat
ass and do nothing?

781
01:12:35,488 --> 01:12:39,686
What I'm trying to do is avoid being rubbed
out by one of your homicidal compatriots!

782
01:12:39,759 --> 01:12:42,489
We're this far because of you.

783
01:12:42,562 --> 01:12:44,996
Jesus, you-you people...

784
01:12:45,065 --> 01:12:48,831
you come over here, you-you piss with
our country, you piss with our women.

785
01:12:48,902 --> 01:12:50,699
Piss?

786
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:53,204
Now you're gonna go
and suck Democrat dicks.

787
01:12:53,273 --> 01:12:56,674
The truth is, is that this is your own
private little war that you're fighting.

788
01:12:56,743 --> 01:12:58,267
Finally, what's it
got to do with me?

789
01:12:58,345 --> 01:13:01,109
You're right. Fucking
American. I quit.

790
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:02,808
Crazy Italians.

791
01:13:04,584 --> 01:13:05,676
That include me?

792
01:13:05,752 --> 01:13:07,652
Absolutely.

793
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:15,889
I have a reputation, a
responsibility as an artist.

794
01:13:15,962 --> 01:13:17,953
You understand?

795
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:21,432
I understand. Maybe it is not your fight.

796
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:26,529
Look, I sympathize, but...
if Othello goes down the pan...

797
01:13:26,606 --> 01:13:29,166
it's not good for
either one of us.

798
01:13:31,945 --> 01:13:33,970
Who knows?

799
01:13:34,047 --> 01:13:37,141
Maybe your movie is not the most
important thing in the world.

800
01:13:37,217 --> 01:13:40,152
What? It's our movie.

801
01:14:23,863 --> 01:14:26,855
Look, I was wondering, do you
have time for a cup of coffee?

802
01:14:26,933 --> 01:14:28,696
Uh, a little busy right now.

803
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:31,032
I've just got the costume
designs for Desdemona.

804
01:14:31,104 --> 01:14:34,039
I thought you might wanna see
them. You're gonna look great!

805
01:14:34,107 --> 01:14:36,632
Orson, I'm really not sure.

806
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:41,476
But they're wonderful. You should take a
look at the set designs. They're fantastic!

807
01:14:41,548 --> 01:14:46,542
Understand this. Italy is not
a location. She's my country.

808
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:47,984
She has suffered enough.

809
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:49,612
Yes, but...

810
01:15:57,524 --> 01:15:59,082
Yes?

811
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:04,626
No, please, Signor Borghera, come in.

812
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:17,474
So?

813
01:16:18,845 --> 01:16:21,245
They never found the killer?

814
01:16:21,314 --> 01:16:23,214
That's right.

815
01:16:23,283 --> 01:16:26,810
Maybe they weren't looking
in the right places.

816
01:16:32,192 --> 01:16:34,126
Look at the third mirror.

817
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:39,896
There.

818
01:16:46,506 --> 01:16:49,031
Watch for the figure
in the cloak.

819
01:16:52,845 --> 01:16:56,406
Who's behind that mask?

820
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:07,754
I thought the set
would block the cameras.

821
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:12,662
But your specialty, Mr.
Welles, this low angle.

822
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:23,103
He could be so tender.

823
01:17:23,176 --> 01:17:25,872
He nursed me...

824
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:28,641
brought me opium
for the pain.

825
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:31,878
I thought maybe
he loved me, too.

826
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:34,249
Maybe a little.

827
01:17:36,956 --> 01:17:41,893
But then, one day, I found the
needle with enough in it to kill me.

828
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,896
Seems he could wait
no longer for my money.

829
01:17:44,964 --> 01:17:48,900
And, so, I ran to the studio,
and I ran to the set and...

830
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:54,398
I ask you only one thing.

831
01:17:54,474 --> 01:17:57,307
Please, let me tell my daughter.

832
01:17:59,379 --> 01:18:01,244
Very well.

833
01:18:02,882 --> 01:18:05,749
Will you go to the Police now?

834
01:18:10,323 --> 01:18:12,757
I'm not so sure.

835
01:18:19,098 --> 01:18:21,532
In the current climate...

836
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:25,162
a crime of passion has a
certain refreshing charm.

837
01:18:28,508 --> 01:18:29,600
You like?

838
01:18:29,676 --> 01:18:31,576
It's perfect.

839
01:18:31,644 --> 01:18:34,010
It's so exciting, Orson.

840
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:40,951
Is there a problem?

841
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,294
Sometimes you get the
feeling that you've got

842
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:45,344
a handle on things,
and then suddenly it.

843
01:18:47,026 --> 01:18:49,927
All becomes confusing.

844
01:18:49,996 --> 01:18:51,964
Do you ever get that?

845
01:18:52,031 --> 01:18:54,295
Most of the time.

846
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,102
Look older...

847
01:19:03,176 --> 01:19:04,939
fatter...

848
01:19:05,011 --> 01:19:08,378
fear growing behind the eyes.

849
01:19:09,615 --> 01:19:11,742
Of what you are afraid?

850
01:19:11,818 --> 01:19:14,719
Afraid of being found out.

851
01:19:16,723 --> 01:19:19,055
Discovering I'm a nothing.

852
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:22,720
An empty box of tricks.

853
01:19:22,795 --> 01:19:25,628
And a coward.

854
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:29,126
My poor, sad Orson.

855
01:19:32,372 --> 01:19:35,739
We are all ugly sticks of shit.

856
01:19:35,808 --> 01:19:38,299
But at least we have our dreams.

857
01:19:46,252 --> 01:19:48,311
It's a blessing.

858
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:55,923
Yes. I'm a film maker
for Christ's sake.

859
01:19:55,995 --> 01:19:57,895
What do they expect of me?

860
01:20:01,934 --> 01:20:03,231
What? What is it?

861
01:20:19,619 --> 01:20:21,610
Yes?

862
01:20:32,598 --> 01:20:34,088
Joe Black's dead.

863
01:20:39,272 --> 01:20:40,864
What?

864
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:43,465
Military raid.

865
01:20:46,879 --> 01:20:48,608
This time they found him.

866
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:53,451
This time they
knew where to look.

867
01:20:55,087 --> 01:20:56,611
Shit!

868
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:00,825
Bullet in the head.

869
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:19,235
Tell me something.

870
01:21:21,347 --> 01:21:23,440
Do you know how to use
one of these things?

871
01:21:27,687 --> 01:21:29,882
Let's make a picture.

872
01:21:30,089 --> 01:21:33,752
That signal will be sent
when you vote tomorrow.

873
01:21:33,993 --> 01:21:36,757
Vote Christian Democrat.

874
01:21:36,829 --> 01:21:40,128
And the Friendship
Program will proceed.

875
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,100
Vote Christian Democrat.

876
01:21:43,169 --> 01:21:48,106
And see your country
rise to prosperity!

877
01:21:56,682 --> 01:22:00,243
You hear them? I think
they're ready for you.

878
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:02,947
What? You nervous?

879
01:22:03,022 --> 01:22:04,819
I'm fine.

880
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:07,985
Get out there. Knock 'em dead.

881
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,994
I'll give it a try.

882
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:18,793
Thank you. Thank you.
Samboco sisters.

883
01:22:18,871 --> 01:22:20,600
Say, Pete.

884
01:22:20,673 --> 01:22:23,301
Yeah?

885
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:25,742
Any news on Joe Black?

886
01:22:25,811 --> 01:22:30,441
Fifth Army guy, sure. He'll be on his
way back home by now, safe and sound.

887
01:22:30,516 --> 01:22:33,508
Thanks.

888
01:22:33,586 --> 01:22:35,645
That's what I wanted to hear.

889
01:22:35,721 --> 01:22:38,986
It's nothing.

890
01:22:39,058 --> 01:22:42,255
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

891
01:22:42,328 --> 01:22:46,662
I give you Orson Welles,
The Great Orsini...

892
01:22:46,732 --> 01:22:50,190
who has graced our
shores to heal the heart.

893
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:55,536
That has been broken by the
incomparable Rita Hayworth.

894
01:23:17,396 --> 01:23:21,355
My beautiful assistant Stella!

895
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:46,648
The Great Orsini, huh?

896
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,723
Now, if you could
cook those things...

897
01:23:52,798 --> 01:23:57,633
put them on a table with a fine
bottle of wine, I'd be impressed.

898
01:24:01,607 --> 01:24:05,634
Signor Cava, please, come up.

899
01:24:10,516 --> 01:24:15,749
Oh, no. He's gonna drag some poor
innocent Italian into the act.

900
01:24:24,497 --> 01:24:26,397
Or maybe not so innocent.

901
01:24:26,465 --> 01:24:28,660
Who knows?

902
01:24:31,203 --> 01:24:33,433
Easy, fella.

903
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:35,974
You're showing your roots.

904
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:38,943
Fascist.

905
01:24:41,681 --> 01:24:45,276
You see, it's all about
diversion and subterfuge.

906
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:47,649
They get you looking one way.

907
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,156
While they pull off some
devilish deception somewhere else.

908
01:24:56,729 --> 01:24:58,993
A last cigarette.

909
01:24:59,065 --> 01:25:01,625
Why not?

910
01:25:09,308 --> 01:25:12,436
T ake the Yankee cigarette,
take the Yankee candy.

911
01:25:12,511 --> 01:25:16,743
For what the Yanks will take from
you ain't quite so doodle dandy.

912
01:25:20,019 --> 01:25:22,487
Democracy and Friendship.

913
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:25,422
Or is it smoke and mirrors?

914
01:25:27,526 --> 01:25:32,691
For I could tell you
tales of villainy so dire...

915
01:25:32,765 --> 01:25:36,064
of lies and murder done
beneath the banner of freedom.

916
01:25:39,572 --> 01:25:42,666
And one such shocking
tale indeed I'll tell.

917
01:25:44,944 --> 01:25:47,777
Of an evil pact
committed to destruction.

918
01:25:49,949 --> 01:25:54,545
And of a warehouse crammed
with guns and ammunition.

919
01:25:55,855 --> 01:25:59,222
T onight, beneath the stars...

920
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:02,021
beneath the stars
and stripes.

921
01:26:05,731 --> 01:26:07,995
And it begins.

922
01:26:08,067 --> 01:26:10,865
In T ombolo.

923
01:26:29,755 --> 01:26:31,655
So, where are these guns?

924
01:26:43,335 --> 01:26:46,600
Not one of your better
tricks, Mr. Hayworth.

925
01:27:10,029 --> 01:27:11,860
Damn!

926
01:27:29,515 --> 01:27:31,449
We should go.

927
01:27:45,965 --> 01:27:48,661
Need a ride back
to town, Mr. Welles?

928
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:51,134
I have a car.

929
01:27:51,203 --> 01:27:54,900
Oh, but I insist.

930
01:28:05,551 --> 01:28:07,348
Mr. Welles, please.

931
01:28:09,188 --> 01:28:10,883
Where are you taking him?

932
01:28:15,594 --> 01:28:17,858
I'll be fine.

933
01:28:40,286 --> 01:28:43,551
You lied to me,
every step of the way.

934
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:45,556
I was trying to take
care of you, Orson.

935
01:28:45,624 --> 01:28:48,184
Like you took care of Joe, huh?

936
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:52,356
What, you'd rather we hand this place over
to Stalin on a fucking plate, is that it?

937
01:28:52,431 --> 01:28:55,332
Forgive me, I didn't
know it was ours to hand.

938
01:28:55,401 --> 01:29:00,031
Pete, you're backing the guys we
were at war with three years ago.

939
01:29:00,105 --> 01:29:02,369
Not ideal, but
it's all there is.

940
01:29:02,441 --> 01:29:04,841
You need to see the big picture.

941
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:07,470
This is not about Italy.
This thing is worldwide.

942
01:29:07,546 --> 01:29:09,844
And it's a major
threat to freedom...

943
01:29:09,915 --> 01:29:12,406
a major threat to democracy.

944
01:29:12,484 --> 01:29:15,009
No one wants the
Communists in power.

945
01:29:15,087 --> 01:29:18,420
Except maybe the people. Don't
you think they should decide?

946
01:29:22,962 --> 01:29:24,429
No.

947
01:29:24,496 --> 01:29:26,862
No. No!

948
01:29:26,932 --> 01:29:30,095
You want I should waste him?

949
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:34,162
How you'll explain that? I'm an
American citizen, for Christ's sake.

950
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,070
Pull over.

951
01:30:23,722 --> 01:30:25,451
No!

952
01:31:05,531 --> 01:31:07,328
No!

953
01:31:33,392 --> 01:31:36,054
You call yourself American?

954
01:31:36,128 --> 01:31:40,189
Listen, he's just another name
on that list. I say we waste them.

955
01:31:40,265 --> 01:31:42,733
Let the Reds take the rap.

956
01:31:53,946 --> 01:31:57,973
You got something to say about
that, Mr. Welles? Something smart?

957
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,917
Christ, Pete, stop him!

958
01:32:00,986 --> 01:32:02,886
You gotta stop him.

959
01:32:02,955 --> 01:32:05,651
I don't have to stop anything.
You heard what he said.

960
01:32:05,724 --> 01:32:08,090
You're just a name on a list.

961
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:19,099
How can we possibly shoot you.

962
01:32:19,171 --> 01:32:22,766
When you played such a
sterling part for Uncle Sam?

963
01:32:24,309 --> 01:32:26,709
You know that list?

964
01:32:26,778 --> 01:32:30,544
When we first planted it and you made
such a big splash with it in the press...

965
01:32:30,616 --> 01:32:33,847
well, it was more
than I could've hoped.

966
01:32:33,919 --> 01:32:36,285
You know the best part?

967
01:32:36,355 --> 01:32:40,951
Originally, you weren't even
on the list. You know why?

968
01:32:42,327 --> 01:32:44,955
You're not that important.

969
01:32:46,431 --> 01:32:48,194
You were kind
of an afterthought.

970
01:32:48,267 --> 01:32:51,634
You're not worth
the bullet, Mr. Welles.

971
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,974
Don't judge me.

972
01:33:01,046 --> 01:33:05,813
The war never stopped,
it just went underground.

973
01:33:05,884 --> 01:33:09,650
And we simply have to win.

974
01:33:09,721 --> 01:33:13,657
Now it's all about sacrifices and
whether you're tough enough to make them.

975
01:33:13,725 --> 01:33:16,285
Maybe you made too many, Pete.

976
01:33:16,361 --> 01:33:20,661
I remember when you had
a soul, not just a job.

977
01:33:20,732 --> 01:33:23,997
You're entitled to your opinion.

978
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:26,003
It's a free country.

979
01:33:27,873 --> 01:33:29,238
Fuck you, Orson.

980
01:33:29,308 --> 01:33:30,900
Fuck you, Pete.

981
01:34:47,986 --> 01:34:49,510
Is he bad?

982
01:34:49,588 --> 01:34:51,954
I mean, how is he?

983
01:35:30,262 --> 01:35:33,026
Great Orsini.

984
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:38,101
How are you feeling?

985
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:40,695
Only pain.

986
01:35:44,609 --> 01:35:46,600
I'm sorry.

987
01:35:48,347 --> 01:35:50,645
You should be.

988
01:35:50,716 --> 01:35:52,149
Fucking Americans.

989
01:35:52,217 --> 01:35:54,981
Crazy Italians.

990
01:36:06,298 --> 01:36:08,562
I came to say goodbye.

991
01:36:10,635 --> 01:36:12,660
Going home?

992
01:36:12,738 --> 01:36:15,571
Wherever that is.

993
01:36:16,908 --> 01:36:19,001
I'm-I'm sorry.

994
01:36:19,077 --> 01:36:21,807
Oh, no, Tomasso.

995
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,849
I'm-I'm...

996
01:36:24,916 --> 01:36:26,907
I'm sorry...

997
01:36:29,087 --> 01:36:31,419
I cannot drive you
to the airport.

998
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,523
Next time.

999
01:36:41,533 --> 01:36:43,433
Next time.

1000
01:37:14,933 --> 01:37:16,901
Quite a fellow.

1001
01:37:16,968 --> 01:37:19,232
Not too bad yourself.

1002
01:37:19,304 --> 01:37:22,171
Italy needs more men like him.

1003
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,502
Orson, I...

1004
01:37:23,575 --> 01:37:25,702
And so do you.

1005
01:37:27,379 --> 01:37:30,576
Very gallant, Orson.

1006
01:37:30,649 --> 01:37:32,913
You think you know
what's good for me?

1007
01:37:32,984 --> 01:37:37,250
You son of a bitch,
you know nothing about me.

1008
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:42,927
You spoke to my mother?

1009
01:37:42,994 --> 01:37:44,723
Yes.

1010
01:37:44,796 --> 01:37:46,263
And you believed her?

1011
01:37:46,331 --> 01:37:48,356
She admitted it.

1012
01:37:48,433 --> 01:37:51,493
She confessed.

1013
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:55,269
She always was a great actress.

1014
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,898
What?

1015
01:37:56,975 --> 01:37:59,409
What do you mean?

1016
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,244
I saw the rushes.

1017
01:38:04,316 --> 01:38:06,375
I can understand your mistake.

1018
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:10,717
I mean, you say yourself
how much alike we are.

1019
01:38:10,789 --> 01:38:13,815
And anyone can wear a mask.

1020
01:38:17,629 --> 01:38:20,689
It was Alessandro turned
my father over as a Jew.

1021
01:38:20,765 --> 01:38:23,928
It was Alessandro
had him killed.

1022
01:38:26,338 --> 01:38:30,536
My mother and me, you
see, we both have a motive.

1023
01:38:32,544 --> 01:38:35,638
What a good daughter you are.

1024
01:38:37,215 --> 01:38:40,207
Yes. Maybe.

1025
01:38:40,285 --> 01:38:43,482
One who avenged
her father's death.

1026
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:47,151
Who knows?

1027
01:38:49,528 --> 01:38:52,326
Do you want me to
tell you the truth?

1028
01:38:52,397 --> 01:38:54,797
Is that what you want?

1029
01:38:54,866 --> 01:38:56,993
No.

1030
01:38:58,703 --> 01:39:01,171
Don't spoil it.

1031
01:39:31,269 --> 01:39:33,635
And what in the end did I do?

1032
01:39:33,705 --> 01:39:36,936
I made a crummy picture,
and not a lot of difference.

1033
01:39:41,513 --> 01:39:45,142
It's not as if things would've been
any better had the Communists got in.

1034
01:39:45,216 --> 01:39:49,175
Same shit, as my pal
would say, different flies.

1035
01:39:49,254 --> 01:39:52,246
Still, one hell of a trip.

1036
01:39:57,896 --> 01:40:00,057
So that just about wraps it up.

1037
01:40:00,131 --> 01:40:03,191
And when people ask me
if all this was true...

1038
01:40:03,268 --> 01:40:05,736
well, like I say...

1039
01:40:05,804 --> 01:40:10,173
if you're looking for facts,
pick up the history book.

1040
01:40:10,241 --> 01:40:12,539
Just be sure
to check who wrote it.
