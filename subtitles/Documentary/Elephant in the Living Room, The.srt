1
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:18,140
Come on, come on, come on.

2
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,859
Shit.

3
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,068
Don't look at me.
This guy's the one who shot you.

4
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:11,943
Hey.

5
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,165
Six men.

6
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:08,750
Ten grand a head. Sixty thousand.

7
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,590
Wherever my daughter's spirit is,
I hope she's a little happier.

8
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,511
I thought I would feel better, but--

9
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,304
somehow--

10
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,643
That's my little girl.

11
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,228
They turned her into an addict.

12
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:32,107
I saw her body
and it was hard to recognize.

13
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:34,276
I keep thinking she's still alive.

14
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,868
# Let's go Put some sake in my cup #

15
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:44,703
# Fill it up Fill it up #

16
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:48,707
# Put some sake in my cup
Fill it up Fill it up #

17
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,861
You deserve to lose.

18
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,571
Watching me instead of looking

19
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:22,199
at all that beautiful Siamese
kitty cat out there.

20
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,075
Boss, problem with the check.

21
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,105
English. Why you running?

22
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,899
because I know why you're here.

23
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:02,614
I just need a favor.

24
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:11,081
Wait. Just hear me out.

25
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,165
Forget it.

26
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,282
Oh, no. Not now.

27
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,090
Hey.

28
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:09,681
Get off my car.

29
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,562
Moron. You want it?

30
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:21,443
Look, I have a gun.

31
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:23,653
You'd already be dead if
I was here to kill you.

32
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:25,655
You want to ask me questions first.

33
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:27,949
Hey. Hey.

34
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,618
How do you even think that
shit about me?

35
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:33,163
They always send--

36
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,414
someone you know.

37
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,584
I am on a job here.
And you're not it.

38
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,502
I just need some weapons.

39
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:43,089
Why didn't you say so?

40
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,386
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You know, this is Versace.

41
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,555
It's not a knockoff, either.

42
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:55,143
Do you know what it
is to get Versace into Thailand?

43
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,562
Is that my button?

44
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:02,609
I think all them titties are
going to your head.

45
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,235
What could you possibly know
that would bring....

46
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,820
that kind of heat from the agency?

47
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,658
You know that I was deep cover.

48
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:13,036
I was too deep for them to take
responsibility....

49
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,580
...once it was blown to fucks.

50
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,248
So what about you?

51
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:20,251
If you're not here for me,
then what's the job?

52
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:23,755
Are you working for the agency
or are you moonlighting?

53
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:26,174
A guy lost his daughter to a few punks.

54
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,258
They put her to work.

55
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:29,177
Bullshit.

56
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:31,596
What would have you slumming
in with the likes of that?

57
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,765
He's paying the rate.

58
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:35,558
Okay, fine. Here.

59
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:39,104
Oh, fuck. I fucking knew it.

60
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,354
Here.

61
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,776
Okay. Maybe I was mistaken.

62
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:48,988
You know,
I have been a bit tense lately.

63
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,282
I don't know what came over me.

64
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:53,284
Here. We're tight.

65
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:54,786
No. You hold onto it.

66
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:58,081
No, no. Never carry a gun.

67
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,791
People get shot that way.

68
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,751
Good point coming from you.

69
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,128
Precisely.

70
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:06,214
You sure living here's been
good for you? Huh?

71
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,216
It's paradise.

72
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,407
Whoa. Who's that?

73
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:35,285
Relax. Only guy I can trust.

74
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:48,089
I have got to do something with my hair.

75
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,307
This is where the magic happens.

76
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,279
Right this way. Welcome...

77
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,740
to my little slice of heaven.

78
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,617
Oh, this might become handy.

79
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:17,118
No, no. Sorry, sorry.

80
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:19,329
Wrong section. Not for rent.

81
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,498
Not just any M76.

82
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:24,000
That was used by Lee Marvin in Prime Cut.

83
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,502
He shot Gene Hackman with it

84
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,754
and I have got the papers to prove it.

85
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,882
I am starting my own Planet Hollywood
here. But all guns.

86
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:32,759
It's genius. Right?

87
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,719
You ever hear of Pretty Boy Floyd?

88
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:37,222
Not the bank robber. The movie.

89
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:40,391
This is the first piece I grabbed.

90
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:45,021
This M1 was used by Clint himself
in Pink Cadillac.

91
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:48,191
Grease gun. Charlie Bronson.
Dirty Dozen.

92
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,860
I know, it's a franchise, right.

93
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,070
I am going legit.

94
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,489
All I need is a name.

95
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,741
I was thinking, you know, Café AK.

96
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,828
Or Guns Zone. Like Fun Zone.

97
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:03,289
But Gun Zone. Uh huh?

98
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,667
Well, I need something long.
Working from a distance.

99
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:09,587
Accuracy international. Real light.

100
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:13,508
That will do you.
It's a thousand a day.

101
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,301
That's the buddy rate.

102
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:22,851
You got a suppressor for this?

103
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:24,269
No. Not for that.

104
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,979
What about a scope, 30 times?

105
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,732
You trying to hit something in Cambodia?
Uh, 15.

106
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:34,696
Best I can do.
But I will throw in night vision.

107
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,127
How much for this?

108
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:50,670
You golf?

109
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,216
You know,
even if you find this guy's daughter

110
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:59,554
they make them all addicts
so they won't leave.

111
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:00,805
And it's one needle for everybody.

112
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,641
I already found her.

113
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:07,604
Whoa. Feel that?

114
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:11,024
Fucking chill just went through me.

115
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,237
So, where you staying?

116
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,239
Wouldn't you like to know.

117
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:21,618
Got to be careful.
This whole city's haunted.

118
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:25,246
There's a lot of unhappy spirits
looking for you.

119
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:26,998
There's going to be a lot more.

120
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,236
Initiation of a monk.

121
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,366
What are you doing here?

122
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,118
I tried to follow you.

123
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:28,161
Why?

124
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,788
I don't know yet.

125
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:32,290
Are you alone?

126
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,792
Yes. I couldn't keep up with you.

127
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,503
Then I followed the sound of the chanting.

128
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,047
And you were here.

129
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,301
It's not a coincidence.

130
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,053
It was meant to be that I find you.

131
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:48,139
You shouldn't have followed me.

132
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,767
It's okay. It's okay.

133
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,352
Do it. Do it.

134
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,655
I won't leave.

135
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,324
I have seen your tracks.

136
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,868
Know you will be trying soon enough.

137
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,249
Open your mouth.

138
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:03,172
Heroin withdrawal. It will pass.

139
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,883
Please let me go.

140
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:07,426
I need to go back.

141
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,803
I will do whatever you want.

142
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:11,889
I will love you. I will.

143
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:20,773
You will feel better when it's over.

144
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,906
Come here. Time to get up.

145
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:09,924
Good?

146
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:14,553
There's water there for you to clean up.

147
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,055
Here.

148
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:34,198
You will kill me for following you?

149
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:36,617
No. For knowing where I am staying.

150
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:39,036
Why is it important you stay here?

151
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:47,211
Why didn't you do it?

152
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:49,463
Because you said it was okay.

153
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:50,183
It is.

154
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,387
Nothing's ever that bad to want
to give up on life.

155
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,389
I didn't see it as an escape.

156
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:01,934
It was all right for other reasons.
Jai yen.

157
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,645
I am comfortable with whatever comes.

158
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,814
The settlement for past wrongs.

159
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:08,566
Then why not just stay there
and settle up....

160
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,067
...instead of following me?

161
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:13,237
You were sent because my time
there was finished.

162
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:15,948
Shh. Come here.

163
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:30,296
Now you stay there and be quiet.

164
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,758
My name is Mae. What is yours?

165
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:41,015
I have to get some sleep.

166
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:43,225
You're going to watch that
club down there....

167
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,769
...for the guys who had you.

168
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:47,396
That is not their club.

169
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,982
I know.
But they will be showing up there anyway.

170
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,442
Because you made it look like

171
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:53,444
one of the guys from the club
just attacked them.

172
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,410
Wake me up when you see somebody you know.

173
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,746
I can't help you kill anyone.

174
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,539
You will.

175
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,333
Why do you kill them?

176
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,752
Why do you think?

177
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:12,046
Because they're hurting people.

178
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,871
Don't. You have to stop.

179
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,581
This is wrong.

180
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:56,215
Shhh.

181
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:00,928
Shut up.

182
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:19,173
Thanks for the help.

183
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:22,903
I need to know the other places

184
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,572
where they take you girls.

185
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,456
I don't understand why you won't help me.

186
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:37,167
It is always wrong to kill.

187
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,003
It is possible the people you shoot

188
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:40,588
might become better people.

189
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,053
Maybe I can persuade you.

190
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,930
No. It is forbidden.

191
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:54,351
If killing is always wrong

192
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,186
then I get the same points against me

193
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:57,479
for a holy man as a pimp.

194
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,897
The only choice you have here is

195
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,482
whether you will be part
of getting him killed....

196
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:03,319
...or the guys who had you.

197
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,904
Okay. I will take you to them.

198
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:10,743
If you won't tell me your name

199
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,203
please tell me the month and day
of your birth.

200
00:25:13,203 --> 00:25:16,665
Your luck today may depend on it.

201
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,667
You can wear colors which may help.

202
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:22,129
That's not the kind of help
I am looking for.

203
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,881
I make my own luck.

204
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:31,472
Why do you talk like a monk?

205
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:33,265
A long time ago, I joined them.

206
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,391
To escape those pimps?

207
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:37,269
No, my father sold me.

208
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,440
This is it.

209
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,737
Why would they bring anyone here?

210
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:48,739
To get rid of them.

211
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:51,283
There's one right there.

212
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:57,539
May Ying. She loved to sing.

213
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,708
You misunderstood me.

214
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:04,755
I want to know where else they
had you working. Working.

215
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,720
This is one place.

216
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,930
Wow.

217
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,392
You look troubled.

218
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:18,852
Well,
I didn't think there'd be as many.

219
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:22,106
Or this organized.

220
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:26,610
So will we stop this and leave?

221
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,405
You're going to have to tell
me everything you know.

222
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:32,908
Eleven more? Seems like a lot.

223
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:34,451
I will take your word for it.

224
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:36,036
Must be all of them.

225
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:40,040
What are you doing?

226
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,959
Chang Kao.

227
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:44,002
Oh, my God.

228
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,796
Do they know who you are?

229
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:48,424
If they find out,
they're going to kill me.

230
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,051
Hey, listen,
I am sorry to have involved you in this.

231
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:53,387
But we can walk away from this, right?

232
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:56,306
Maybe they don't know who you are.

233
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:58,767
I won't say anything if they come to me.

234
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,686
I will just keep going.

235
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,980
I don't want you to. I am out.

236
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,693
The deal was all of them.
You're out when it's done.

237
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,655
Put some ice on that shit.

238
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:13,031
You hear me? I am out.

239
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:15,993
Hi.

240
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:18,328
I told you to wait downstairs.
Come on.

241
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,622
And I told you I'd help.

242
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,207
You talk back, too.

243
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,042
It's time you learned to behave.

244
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:43,854
Hm?

245
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,497
What does a painted elephant mean?

246
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:05,125
It's not paint.
It's naturally white.

247
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,255
Buddha's mother dreamed a white elephant

248
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,673
gave her a lotus flower three nights

249
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,092
before she gave birth to him.

250
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:17,221
And so he's there for a truce.

251
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:19,515
Nobody will risk hitting him.

252
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:23,018
I am happy that you have decided
to stay here and continue.

253
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:27,940
Not what you would normally do, is it?

254
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,983
It will mix up what comes for you.

255
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:31,378
Hey, Jimmy here?

256
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:34,089
No, no, no, no.

257
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,674
Okay, okay, okay.

258
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,352
Get out.

259
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:52,149
Wait, no. Not you.

260
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:53,775
Did you happen to notice

261
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:57,487
that the girls were mostly
naked when you came in?

262
00:29:57,487 --> 00:30:00,073
Are those lovely breasts any clue

263
00:30:00,073 --> 00:30:04,202
as to who in this city might
allow me to operate here?

264
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,747
It's the same gang you're shooting at.

265
00:30:06,747 --> 00:30:09,666
Do I have to tell you what happens
if Bhun realizes....

266
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:13,003
....that you're using my
specialized weaponry to do it?

267
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:15,088
I didn't know who I was up against.

268
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:16,673
Well, you do now.

269
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:19,343
Does the guy that hired you
know who he's fucking with?

270
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:20,636
He fired me.

271
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:24,264
Oh, perfect.
Well, no need to apologize.

272
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:27,851
Just stay as far away from me as--

273
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:33,065
Where's the gun?

274
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,816
Why bring the bag and no gun?

275
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:36,944
I needed to carry another one.

276
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:37,986
That's funny.

277
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:39,571
Only you're never funny.

278
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,657
You're dark.

279
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:45,035
And I don't mean skin tone.

280
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:49,373
Remember what you said to me
last time I saw you?

281
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:51,124
"That's twice you saved my life."

282
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,293
No. There was a time before that.

283
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:57,297
Hmmm. "I swear I will get this
cash back to you."

284
00:30:57,297 --> 00:30:58,966
No, that was even further back.

285
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:00,968
"Take your hands off of me,
I don't go that way."

286
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:03,220
You owe me.

287
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,389
Another life.

288
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:08,767
I don't owe anybody anything
from back then.

289
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:19,027
Oh, fuck me.

290
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:28,620
Go see this guy.
They call him the Thai Stick.

291
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,583
Why are you doing this?

292
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,002
They're hurting people.

293
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:39,923
"They're hurting people."

294
00:31:42,385 --> 00:31:45,012
Christ. Even you're smiling.

295
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:48,932
And you don't smile.

296
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:51,184
You owe me.

297
00:31:51,184 --> 00:31:53,645
Now, I have seen the cigar room.

298
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,188
Must be a place in that warehouse

299
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:56,440
where you keep the Cubans.

300
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,525
Yeah.

301
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:08,577
The Cubans aren't in the warehouse.

302
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:36,730
Welcome to my humidor.

303
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:48,325
I suppose you don't need...

304
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:49,075
No.

305
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:54,664
Colt, M4 sniper. HK PSG-1.

306
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:57,501
Anything in a bigger caliber?

307
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,127
You want to go out with a bang?

308
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,352
For the man who has everything.

309
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:18,522
Ho... wow.

310
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:21,775
Barrett 82,
.50 caliber.

311
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:23,068
Just what I need.

312
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:26,196
It's 35 pounds with the bipod.

313
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:28,949
It's a lot of weight
if you have to run the hundred.

314
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:33,370
I suppose there's not much point in
you running, though, is there?

315
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,540
Who's running?

316
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,624
It's 10 Gs a day.

317
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,209
And that's the pay up front

318
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:44,631
because you're going to be dead buddy rate.

319
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:48,135
Throw in the crotch gun.

320
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:49,344
I like this one.

321
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:54,850
Here.

322
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,570
Sweet.

323
00:33:57,812 --> 00:34:00,522
Well, happiness is a warm gun.

324
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:03,108
Hey. One more thing. Right here.

325
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:03,942
Ow.

326
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,488
Ow, what the fuck are you doing?

327
00:34:08,488 --> 00:34:09,781
You said, "Hit me."

328
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,451
I know. But I wasn't ready.

329
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,620
I thought you were going to ask me why.

330
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,122
I know why.

331
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,374
If you get caught,
you can tell them I robbed you.

332
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:26,506
It's okay. I am okay.
It can't get much--

333
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:27,632
Versace?

334
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:31,428
No. It's Paul fucking Smith.

335
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:35,098
I am back.

336
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:42,314
Ahh... Jesus, Mae.

337
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,527
I got to think.

338
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,555
Mae, Mae.

339
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,226
Your knots are getting sloppy.

340
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:22,479
What are you doing here?

341
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,356
I was with the monks.

342
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,690
I saw you leaving just now.

343
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,234
Great.

344
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:29,778
You think I had gone to
tell the gang about you?

345
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:32,489
Just don't do that again.

346
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:34,908
I am concerned about what we are doing.

347
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:36,743
I went to talk to the monks about it.

348
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,787
Really?

349
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:40,914
Why does everything
I say make you so angry?

350
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:43,708
Because you actually seem to
believe what you're saying.

351
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,502
No point in tying you up anymore.

352
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:46,795
I told you that too.

353
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:59,808
She was something to you?

354
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:02,852
Something to someone else.

355
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,772
So you right wrongs?
Because it's the right thing?

356
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:09,859
And because it pays.

357
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,861
You were discussing me with them?

358
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:15,031
Not just you.

359
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:17,534
Whether what I do is right or wrong?

360
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:19,452
There is no right or wrong.

361
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:21,204
Only what is and what comes.

362
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:23,873
You kill those that do great harm.

363
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:25,959
The world should punish them.

364
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:28,420
They're not all bad.

365
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,921
They're good for business.

366
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:35,844
Take the long way back

367
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:37,512
so their ghosts cannot follow.

368
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:42,392
Wait here.

369
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,747
Okay. Too crowded.

370
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:16,843
Oh, I will definitely get back to you.

371
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:25,769
Here, too.

372
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:59,028
Ah, shit.

373
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,417
Keys.

374
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:33,141
Oh, my God. Mae?

375
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:35,310
Come on out. Let's go.

376
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,394
Come on.

377
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:42,317
You're bleeding.
You have been shot.

378
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:43,693
Are you okay?

379
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:47,196
Not really.
I didn't know they were in there.

380
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:48,698
Maybe you can help them.

381
00:41:48,698 --> 00:41:50,617
Well, they can leave.

382
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:52,535
Let's go. Before they come.

383
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:53,911
Let's go.

384
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,880
You can't let them do this to you.

385
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,214
Come on, let's go.

386
00:42:05,214 --> 00:42:06,424
No, take us back.

387
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:09,510
Yes, what are you doing?

388
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,720
Take us back.

389
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,056
What? Come on, you're free now.

390
00:42:13,056 --> 00:42:14,098
Come.

391
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,016
It's okay.

392
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,351
Come with me now.

393
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:18,061
You're free to go now.

394
00:42:18,061 --> 00:42:19,395
No.

395
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:22,940
They will find us.
They will kill us.

396
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,486
It's because of the drugs.
They need to go back.

397
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,503
What were you doing in there?

398
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:45,838
They put us in the truck when you attacked.

399
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,175
Not the truck.
What were you doing in the house?

400
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,425
Fuck.

401
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,766
I went to tell them if they would
stop what they are doing

402
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:58,935
you would stop killing them.

403
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:02,772
We shouldn't have left the girls.

404
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:07,318
That's not what I do.

405
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,237
Even if they get out

406
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:15,159
what's been done to them is
who they are now.

407
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:19,163
What do you keep staring at?

408
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,416
You crazy.

409
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:37,348
Don't touch it.

410
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:44,749
Well,
I hope you got the prick who stole this.

411
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,417
You were robbed?

412
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:50,379
Yes. Surprised him at my warehouse
yesterday on his way out.

413
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:52,715
So, did you get a good look?

414
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:56,344
For as long as it took for him
to break my nose.

415
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:57,845
White boy, you know

416
00:44:57,845 --> 00:44:59,889
about my height but, uh, packing pounds.

417
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,265
Blond hair. Goatee.

418
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,684
Face like a smacked ass.

419
00:45:03,684 --> 00:45:06,979
Hey, I thought I was protected.

420
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:08,773
They hit me, they hit you. Right?

421
00:45:09,983 --> 00:45:11,234
Ah.

422
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:14,153
You recall any details,
you will let us know.

423
00:45:14,153 --> 00:45:16,322
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

424
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:40,221
I will take care of you.

425
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:41,514
Mae?

426
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:45,059
I will love you in so many ways.

427
00:45:47,062 --> 00:45:50,565
Touch you in so many places.

428
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:59,532
Make you feel so good.

429
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,705
You are so cold.

430
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:13,921
Who took the bullet out?

431
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,798
It went right through.

432
00:46:15,798 --> 00:46:18,301
Looks like you have attracted
a few bad spirits.

433
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:21,596
Ah,
here you go talking that nonsense again.

434
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:27,351
Khamin chan and other herbs

435
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,687
and holy ash from a sacrificial fire.

436
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:30,897
It will protect you.

437
00:46:30,897 --> 00:46:32,815
Oh, no.

438
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:35,776
The monks do not know what you do,
so they help.

439
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,491
I feel like I am losing my mind.

440
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:44,493
Maybe that's a good thing.

441
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:49,999
Maybe better to let you bleed to death.

442
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:53,127
It would be easier
for you to die and start over.

443
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,844
Why are you looking at me that way?

444
00:47:01,844 --> 00:47:05,181
Oh, I am just wondering if
I am still dreaming.

445
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:07,600
Or maybe you were awake.

446
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,186
And are now dreaming.

447
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:16,317
I have no idea what you're talking about.

448
00:47:24,785 --> 00:47:28,371
You look like you're being followed,
English.

449
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:36,545
Got you.

450
00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:01,529
Oh, no.

451
00:48:01,529 --> 00:48:04,824
Not you again. Upstairs.

452
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:07,368
Come on.

453
00:48:07,368 --> 00:48:09,161
I got your gun.

454
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:10,705
Yeah. One of them.

455
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:12,498
They found my Barrett so
they're all over out there.

456
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:14,041
Not anymore.

457
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,710
Oh, great.

458
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,129
So with that,
you just confirmed my involvement.

459
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:20,464
Don't answer it.

460
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,758
Bastards can track that
as good as the government.

461
00:48:22,758 --> 00:48:26,721
It's not mine. I took it off one of
the guys outside your place.

462
00:48:26,721 --> 00:48:28,681
Then they're checking in. Come on.

463
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,852
We're taking the high ground.

464
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:34,937
I need something for up close.

465
00:48:34,937 --> 00:48:37,398
Another gun?

466
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:39,442
And you lied about bringing
back the last one.

467
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:41,777
Right. And?

468
00:48:41,777 --> 00:48:45,072
No. No. No way. No. Not happening.

469
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,532
No, no, no.

470
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,250
Because I am dead.
Put your boss on.

471
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,918
You want to say hello?

472
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,343
Now am I getting what I want?

473
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,595
What is it you want?

474
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:09,263
Not you. Hold on.

475
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:10,513
Well?

476
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,477
I will give you
some time to think about it.

477
00:49:14,477 --> 00:49:16,103
I am back.

478
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:19,982
We should meet.
Come to some understanding.

479
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:22,860
I will never have
any understanding of what you do.

480
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,610
Hm.

481
00:49:24,404 --> 00:49:27,573
You understand that most of these girls

482
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:30,451
are sold by their own parents?

483
00:49:30,451 --> 00:49:34,121
To pay off debt, or just abandoned?

484
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,665
That we find a place for them

485
00:49:36,665 --> 00:49:41,337
and for doing so take some small profit

486
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:47,510
from something they will give away
or trade for less on their own.

487
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,595
You understand we give

488
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:53,015
what little they have to offer value?

489
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:54,850
You give bullets value.

490
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,060
Now you want to give me what I want

491
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,189
or you want to talk to the boss?

492
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:18,040
I am glad you find this so amusing.

493
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,208
Get out.

494
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,709
Just get out.

495
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:25,548
I have to keep going.

496
00:50:25,548 --> 00:50:27,466
You're not going to shoot me.

497
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:28,968
I might as well.

498
00:50:28,968 --> 00:50:31,554
You're as good as dead
unless I get another gun.

499
00:50:31,554 --> 00:50:33,180
Now give me another guns

500
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,267
so there won't be anybody
left to come after you.

501
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:42,857
Cobray Street Sweeper.

502
00:50:42,857 --> 00:50:46,026
I will take this.

503
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:49,238
It's a thousand a day.

504
00:50:49,238 --> 00:50:52,241
You know, you're always out there.

505
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:55,452
When did you start believing
that you can't be killed?

506
00:51:01,585 --> 00:51:02,668
I haven't.

507
00:51:11,344 --> 00:51:13,012
Do you like what you do?

508
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:20,728
I do it without remorse.

509
00:51:20,728 --> 00:51:24,356
I cast no shadow about it.

510
00:51:24,356 --> 00:51:28,194
Intent is most important for
future well-being.

511
00:51:28,194 --> 00:51:29,904
Intent makes karma.

512
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:31,947
What will you do with the money
you are paid?

513
00:51:31,947 --> 00:51:34,325
You know, all this is just
what you have come up with....

514
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,286
...to fool yourself
into some kind of happiness.

515
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:39,121
And what do you use to fool yourself?

516
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:43,500
It doesn't get any more real
than what I do.

517
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,420
You do not know
as much as you think you do.

518
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,130
Starting from who you are....

519
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:50,341
...all the way to the man
in that hotel room.

520
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,468
What do you know about him?

521
00:51:52,468 --> 00:51:54,178
You have seen him before?

522
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:55,179
Hm.

523
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:34,760
You are crazy, man.

524
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,512
I told you to stop killing them.

525
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:39,265
You owe me. Ten o'clock.
Same hotel room.

526
00:52:41,768 --> 00:52:45,604
Hey, mister.
How much longer you waiting?

527
00:52:56,783 --> 00:52:57,783
Follow him.

528
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:41,327
Hey, can I help you?

529
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:43,245
Uh, yes.

530
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:45,831
Twelve and, uh, fifteen are available.

531
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:51,670
Twelve.

532
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,547
She'd be my choice. Youngest.

533
00:53:53,547 --> 00:53:55,132
But don't let her age fool you.

534
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,009
Down the hall. Take a left.

535
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:58,552
Up the stairs. Green door.

536
00:54:31,544 --> 00:54:34,088
What can I do for you?

537
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:36,298
Whatever you want, big man.

538
00:54:36,298 --> 00:54:40,302
Okay. Sit. Sit... sit down.

539
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:43,806
You know the man with the big ruby ring?

540
00:54:43,806 --> 00:54:46,308
Where is he?

541
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:48,227
I will do whatever you want.

542
00:54:48,227 --> 00:54:53,399
Is he the boss or a customer?

543
00:54:53,399 --> 00:54:55,818
There are many men who come.

544
00:54:55,818 --> 00:54:58,612
Where is his office?

545
00:54:58,612 --> 00:55:00,906
Where is his office?

546
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:03,158
He is upstairs. Top floor.

547
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:10,327
I want him alive.

548
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:11,703
Alive.

549
00:57:52,453 --> 00:57:54,413
Wait. Coming out.

550
00:57:54,413 --> 00:57:56,164
Coming out.

551
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:58,875
I can explain.

552
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:06,091
Empty it.

553
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:07,217
The safe.

554
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,343
Okay.

555
00:58:08,343 --> 00:58:09,344
I wasn't told you were a crook.

556
00:58:09,344 --> 00:58:10,262
I am not.

557
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,850
You're now paying for the numbers
I just racked up here.

558
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,393
What's this really about?

559
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,729
Would you have gone at the whole
gang if I'd told you?

560
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,147
So what gang are you?

561
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:22,149
Am I a way of making war with
the Chang Kao....

562
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:24,359
...without you losing men?

563
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:25,235
Hmm?

564
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,614
Do you really care?

565
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:30,866
Huh?

566
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:32,784
I wanted you alive

567
00:58:32,784 --> 00:58:34,745
so I could double everything.

568
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:35,829
For one more man.

569
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,126
Advisor Bhun.

570
00:58:42,962 --> 00:58:44,671
Why him and not the boss?

571
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:48,550
The old man is sick.
He will be dead soon.

572
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,177
You're thinking about it.

573
00:58:50,177 --> 00:58:53,263
because if you weren't,
I'd already be dead.

574
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,015
Why are you looking at me like that?

575
00:58:55,015 --> 00:58:57,684
Does any of it really matter
why you're doing it?

576
00:58:57,684 --> 00:59:01,521
Does it have anything to do with
my story of, of the daughter?

577
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:03,857
Another million for one man.

578
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:49,945
Try and focus on my neck and shoulders.

579
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:52,948
Too much stress.

580
00:59:52,948 --> 00:59:54,449
Oh, you have no idea.

581
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:56,118
But why do you say that
like it's a good thing?

582
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:58,370
I want his name.

583
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,705
And I want to know

584
00:59:59,705 --> 01:00:02,582
who needed me in my underwear for this?

585
01:00:05,378 --> 01:00:07,129
What's his name?

586
01:00:07,129 --> 01:00:08,296
Pudding Thame.

587
01:00:08,296 --> 01:00:09,464
Ask me again

588
01:00:09,464 --> 01:00:13,135
I will tell you the same.

589
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:19,141
Oh, fuck.

590
01:00:19,141 --> 01:00:20,308
His name?

591
01:00:20,308 --> 01:00:22,060
You're pissing in the wind.

592
01:00:25,732 --> 01:00:27,649
Why do you work against us?

593
01:00:27,649 --> 01:00:29,317
You are in the same business.

594
01:00:29,317 --> 01:00:32,404
No, the girls that work for me--

595
01:00:32,404 --> 01:00:35,615
have filled out an application.

596
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:38,243
They enjoy their work.
They're artists.

597
01:00:45,752 --> 01:00:48,128
All right. All right.
I will tell you.

598
01:00:48,128 --> 01:00:49,463
I will tell you.

599
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:55,635
Not because it hurts.

600
01:00:55,635 --> 01:00:57,637
But because

601
01:00:57,637 --> 01:01:00,432
he... wouldn't care.

602
01:01:00,432 --> 01:01:02,267
It's Church.

603
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:04,394
Curtie Church.

604
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:08,190
And who would want someone with
the skills of Curtie Church here?

605
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,025
I don't know.

606
01:01:14,113 --> 01:01:15,363
Where is he?

607
01:01:15,363 --> 01:01:17,365
I don't know that.

608
01:01:19,035 --> 01:01:20,660
Who is he working for?

609
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,121
I don't know that either.

610
01:01:23,121 --> 01:01:26,249
Do you think he'd be stupid
enough to tell me?

611
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:43,016
Why do you help him against us?

612
01:01:43,016 --> 01:01:45,685
Because I am more afraid of him--

613
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:49,022
than I am of you. You understand?

614
01:01:49,022 --> 01:01:52,067
And you haven't even pissed him off yet.

615
01:01:56,364 --> 01:02:01,326
What he's doing to you
is death taking a holiday.

616
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,208
You're already dead.

617
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,619
You don't sleep so well, do you?

618
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:04,712
I didn't do anything
bad enough to deserve this.

619
01:07:09,802 --> 01:07:12,554
Will you go out again tonight?

620
01:07:12,554 --> 01:07:13,304
No.

621
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,643
No, I am done here.

622
01:09:30,442 --> 01:09:31,859
Going to the toilet.

623
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:35,905
You want to watch,
you handle the paperwork.

624
01:09:48,085 --> 01:09:49,877
I told them who you are.

625
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:51,838
For real this time.

626
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:53,256
And not because they broke me.

627
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:56,384
But because now you have no
choice but to run.

628
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:59,304
Already decided I am out.
What about you?

629
01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:01,723
I will figure something out.

630
01:10:01,723 --> 01:10:03,891
But you're willing to do that?

631
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:07,145
Listen, I need one last thing.
I need to set a girl up.

632
01:10:07,145 --> 01:10:12,233
Maybe 14. Adoption and private
school. How much for that?

633
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:19,198
Don't know.
Ten Gs will buy a family and a history.

634
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:21,909
Another 20 will pay her way
till she graduates.

635
01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:23,286
Cool. Done.

636
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:24,829
I told her to wait at the Lotus Temple.

637
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:26,789
Your half of the money's there,
and your guns.

638
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,374
Hey. Hey. What are you doing in there?

639
01:10:28,374 --> 01:10:31,711
I can't concentrate in here
if you're listening.

640
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:37,675
I guess I will, uh, you know,
see you down the road.

641
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:41,387
Thanks, English.

642
01:10:41,387 --> 01:10:43,056
Hey. Hey. Let's go.

643
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:52,815
Crap, oh, that feels good.

644
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,442
Oh, here's an idea.

645
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:55,485
Why don't you guys

646
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:57,487
just go out of the room,

647
01:10:57,487 --> 01:10:58,780
one at a time come back in,

648
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,281
and we will see who's made of what, huh?

649
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:03,785
I will take you up on that.

650
01:11:15,089 --> 01:11:17,340
Just spoke to him.

651
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,549
Where is he?

652
01:11:18,549 --> 01:11:21,469
Good news. He's going to disappear.

653
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:24,138
And you will be your father's son
again in no time.

654
01:11:24,138 --> 01:11:25,515
We're good.

655
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:27,809
You gave his name,
and we're going to find him.

656
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:30,645
What do you mean? No. No, no,
you don't have to do that.

657
01:11:30,645 --> 01:11:32,647
You know he went too far.

658
01:11:32,647 --> 01:11:35,983
I need his head now to
assure the position.

659
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:02,260
This is for you.

660
01:12:07,766 --> 01:12:10,852
No one ever gave me--

661
01:12:26,285 --> 01:12:27,285
Thank you.

662
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:28,619
You're welcome.

663
01:12:31,165 --> 01:12:34,876
My name is Curtie.

664
01:12:34,876 --> 01:12:37,879
Curtie Church.

665
01:12:40,883 --> 01:12:43,593
Like hurt? Only friendlier?

666
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:45,761
No, like Curtis.

667
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,473
Only misspelled on my birth certificate.

668
01:12:48,473 --> 01:12:50,057
It was meant to be.

669
01:12:50,057 --> 01:12:51,309
And April second...

670
01:12:51,309 --> 01:12:54,061
month and date of my birth.

671
01:12:58,525 --> 01:13:03,779
Today's Friday,
so wear blue for luck today.

672
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,741
Tomorrow wear pink.

673
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:09,827
Ooh.
Tomorrow may be a bad day for me then.

674
01:13:09,827 --> 01:13:12,455
You can wear it underneath.

675
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:14,040
That could make it even worse.

676
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:31,265
Listen, I want to thank you for
taking an interest in me.

677
01:13:31,265 --> 01:13:36,020
You're wrong.
I am just doing it for me.

678
01:13:43,946 --> 01:13:45,404
You're leaving me, aren't you?

679
01:13:55,332 --> 01:13:57,708
I have someone coming for you

680
01:13:57,708 --> 01:14:00,211
who will help you.

681
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:04,006
You have to promise me
you will wait here. Hmm?

682
01:14:06,468 --> 01:14:07,969
Promise?

683
01:14:11,139 --> 01:14:12,473
Okay.

684
01:14:12,473 --> 01:14:13,473
Hmm.

685
01:14:54,725 --> 01:14:56,100
Yeah, Jimmy?

686
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,019
I was hoping I'd catch you.

687
01:14:58,019 --> 01:15:00,104
Yeah,
the flight's just about to leave.

688
01:15:00,104 --> 01:15:02,523
At the airport already, huh?

689
01:15:02,523 --> 01:15:06,277
I don't blame you.
Too many ghosts.

690
01:15:06,277 --> 01:15:07,903
Did you get your money?

691
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,115
Yeah. It's too much.
But, uh, thanks for that.

692
01:15:11,115 --> 01:15:13,159
The reason I am calling is, um

693
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:16,078
your girl, she wasn't there.

694
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,749
Impossible. She wouldn't leave.
Did you wait?

695
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:20,875
I waited.

696
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,668
Sorry, Church.

697
01:15:22,668 --> 01:15:23,836
Thanks.

698
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:32,470
Well, I hope this confirms my loyalty.

699
01:15:57,412 --> 01:15:58,871
Fucking Jimmy.

700
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:01,916
Come on. Let's go.

701
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:05,975
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

702
01:19:08,436 --> 01:19:10,229
Wait.

703
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:14,942
Oh, English.

704
01:19:14,942 --> 01:19:17,570
How many times did I tell you to leave?

705
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:18,445
Shoot the son of a bitch.

706
01:19:18,445 --> 01:19:20,614
Are you insane? No.

707
01:19:20,614 --> 01:19:25,744
Okay. Couple million dollars
and your life for the girls.

708
01:19:25,744 --> 01:19:27,496
Who paid you the money to do this?

709
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,498
Ask him.

710
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,166
We're going to talk to this devil

711
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,918
while he holds a gun to my father's head?

712
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:36,297
Hey, hey.
Let this son of the bitch speak.

713
01:19:36,297 --> 01:19:37,882
No, it's too late for that.

714
01:19:41,386 --> 01:19:42,469
Don't move.

715
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:44,471
Hold your fire.

716
01:19:49,436 --> 01:19:51,645
Changed my mind.

717
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:56,525
Was it my son who arranged this?

718
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:59,111
Was he trying to kill the secret with you?

719
01:20:04,034 --> 01:20:06,452
Bring the girls in.

720
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,972
There's one missing.

721
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:30,309
Where's the one you took from the temple?
Mae.

722
01:20:30,309 --> 01:20:35,189
There was no one there except the monks.

723
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:38,108
I don't remember any Mae.

724
01:20:38,108 --> 01:20:40,110
I will find you, Mae.

725
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:53,707
Mae. Here. That's Mae for you.

726
01:20:53,707 --> 01:20:56,585
Oh, that Mae.

727
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,379
Oh, yes. That Mae.

728
01:20:58,379 --> 01:20:59,964
You're insane.

729
01:20:59,964 --> 01:21:01,340
What are you talking about?

730
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,217
I remember her.

731
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:05,052
She was special.

732
01:21:05,052 --> 01:21:07,054
First girl that I brought in.

733
01:21:07,054 --> 01:21:09,264
And that's me beside her.

734
01:21:12,477 --> 01:21:14,979
Some 30 years ago.

735
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,316
It's not a coincidence.

736
01:21:19,316 --> 01:21:21,485
It was meant to be that I find you.

737
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:28,158
Church. What's going on?

738
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:32,579
Do we have a deal on the others?

739
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:33,747
I want to thank you for

740
01:21:33,747 --> 01:21:35,416
taking an interest in me.

741
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:37,626
I am just doing it for me.

742
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,545
Do we have a deal?

743
01:21:39,545 --> 01:21:41,130
It's in the car.

744
01:21:53,351 --> 01:21:57,271
I will take care of you.

745
01:21:57,271 --> 01:21:58,271
Mae?

746
01:21:59,816 --> 01:22:01,025
Mae?

747
01:22:01,025 --> 01:22:02,359
Drive.

748
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:03,986
You crazy.

749
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:05,426
You crazy...

750
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:12,369
Put the guns down.

751
01:22:12,369 --> 01:22:13,169
And let them go.

752
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,250
So you right wrongs

753
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,461
because it's the right thing?

754
01:22:20,461 --> 01:22:24,298
I am happy that you have decided
to stay here and continue.

755
01:22:24,298 --> 01:22:26,133
We shouldn't have left the girls.

756
01:22:26,133 --> 01:22:29,219
Maybe you can help them.

757
01:22:33,016 --> 01:22:35,392
Get your bag.

758
01:22:44,527 --> 01:22:46,570
It was all about bringing you

759
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:49,698
to a place of understanding.

760
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:54,495
My voice was there to help you all along.

761
01:22:54,495 --> 01:22:56,455
It was about bringing you to the decision

762
01:22:56,455 --> 01:22:59,792
to stay here and right these wrongs.

763
01:23:55,348 --> 01:23:59,768
So I guess, uh,
one of those spirits really found you.

764
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:03,355
Guess that's a good thing.

765
01:24:03,355 --> 01:24:05,732
Before you were losing your mind.

766
01:24:05,732 --> 01:24:08,819
English. Stop the truck.

767
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:10,904
English...

768
01:24:10,904 --> 01:24:13,031
Please, stop the truck.

769
01:24:39,684 --> 01:24:42,019
I have to go back.

770
01:24:42,019 --> 01:24:44,521
I will see to it that they get help.

771
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:48,025
Thanks, buddy.

772
01:24:59,078 --> 01:25:02,456
I can now be with you, Curtie Church.

773
01:25:02,456 --> 01:25:04,708
And you can be with me.

774
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:07,169
With the darkness which you offer.

775
01:25:07,169 --> 01:25:09,588
And which my light needs to shine.

776
01:25:09,588 --> 01:25:13,383
It was the initiation of a monk.

777
01:25:13,383 --> 01:25:14,463
A monk...
