Resync By Bajingan, Toa Pek Yuna

2
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,741
Whoo!

3
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:46,852
Open up!

4
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:52,314
It's your dog, bro!

5
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,448
We've got a warrant
for a Hector De la Taco.

6
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,406
So send him on out.

7
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:07,174
You've got the wrong house, ese.

8
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,004
Why don't you let me worry about
that there, snookum?

9
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:21,040
This is the FBI! Why the fuck don't you
open the fucking door? Let's go!

10
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:27,139
That's cute. Look! You putas got ten
seconds to get the fuck off my stoop!

11
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,713
- OK?
- Putas?

12
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,973
Hey, man! You know what, man?
We got off to the wrong foot!

13
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:33,907
You're damn fucking right we did!

14
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:37,871
All right, man! Just take a step back

15
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,551
and take another look
at our credentials!

16
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:45,828
Officer McQueen, would you please show
this nice young gentleman your badge?

17
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,270
I can't see shit!

18
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,739
Whoo!

19
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,352
You ain't gonna need this no more.

20
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,112
Stop it! If you had bothered
to learn the language,

21
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:09,034
you know what you could
be saying to me right now?

22
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:12,071
Do you know what you could be saying?
You could be saying, "Hey, man,

23
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:16,559
this is a big mistake.
I'm a Federale. I've got a wife!

24
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:19,581
I got a wife and I got a kid at home!
Please don't let me die!"

25
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:25,589
But that's all you want to do!
Talk in your jibber-jabber.

26
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:29,514
That would be like me going to Mexico
and expect everybody to speak American.

27
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:32,911
God Almighty! I mean, what am I...?

28
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,859
You tell me what I'm supposed to do.
What am I supposed to do?

29
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:39,337
All right, you've got a job. Right?
You clean toilets, or cut grass,

30
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:42,682
or whatever the hell it is you do.
This is what I do.

31
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,541
I shoot people in the face.
You understand?

32
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:50,131
Somebody wanted you gone, you know
who they came to. This guy right here.

33
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,121
You know? So I'm sorry.
But just so you know,

34
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:57,685
this ain't nothing personal. All right?

35
00:04:57,988 --> 00:05:00,879
You ain't gonna believe this.

36
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,843
Yeah?

37
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,808
We got the wrong house.

38
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:13,645
Oh, this shit ain't
gonna turn out well!

39
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:18,017
You don't listen, man! You're
like MacGruber! Goddamnit, man!

40
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:19,190
Well, ain't that some shit.

41
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,404
- Sheriff?
- What's the story?

42
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:49,473
It's just an all-out massacre.
Thirteen dead bodies, mounds of drugs,

43
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:53,125
- guns, spit and ass. It's a mess.
- So who were these miscreants?

44
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:55,959
No one appeared to be anybody special.

45
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:58,037
Just run-of-the-mill
dealers and bangers.

46
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,752
- Anybody talking?
- Ah, you know how it is.

47
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,835
Nobody heard nothing, nobody saw
nothing, and nobody talks to the po-po.

48
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,478
Yeah, that sounds about right.

49
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,178
Fill out all the necessary paperwork,
run the bodies through the county.

50
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,499
Have the report on my desk.

51
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,839
Sir, I also took the liberty to go
ahead and put it out over the wire.

52
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,538
See if we can get
a bead on these shooters.

53
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:21,281
- Now, why would you go and do that?
- Trying to speed things along.

54
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:22,832
Oh!

55
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:26,216
- You think I can't do my job.
- I just thought...

56
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:29,041
Don't do that! Don't ever do that.

57
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,472
Just do as you're told.

58
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:40,878
- Nothing?
- Nope!

59
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:45,862
- Not even half?
- Mm-mm.

60
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:50,728
Something's gotta change!
Risking our necks for no money.

61
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:53,694
This some bullshit!

62
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,891
I'm about tired of us getting fucked
six ways from Sunday, you hear me?

63
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,749
Goddang, man!

64
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:05,905
I was gonna put a pool in
with that money.

65
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,778
Goddang, motherfucker!

66
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:18,133
Stop! Yeah, walk away, bitch!

67
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:21,425
You lucky I ain't in the mood
to whip your ass, boy!

68
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,280
Wasting food, motherfucker.

69
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:03,591
- Can I help you?
- Oh, shit!

70
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:08,847
- Sorry. You scared me.
- That's what I do.

71
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:17,396
I'm Celeste. I was hoping to talk
to you and your friends.

72
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:20,866
Friends? I ain't got no friends.

73
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:23,764
I've got my brothers.

74
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,519
Got my house. My car.

75
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,439
I've got a sexy little chica
standing in front of me.

76
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:34,056
But I ain't got no friends.

77
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,897
You wanna be my friend?

78
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:39,794
I saw you this morning.

79
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:42,700
I was hoping
to acquire your services.

80
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,813
You got the wrong fellas.
We was at church this morning.

81
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,918
- Really?
- Yeah.

82
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:52,281
So there's just three other white boys
that looked just like you

83
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,658
that ripped up a whole house
on Bacon Street?

84
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,991
Trying to figure out how you guys walked
out of there with all those witnesses.

85
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,292
And every cop in the state
isn't lined up at your door.

86
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:15,104
So, what's a pretty little girl like you
doing in a neighbourhood like that?

87
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,992
- Well, I was there to hire muscle...
- Hire him to do what?

88
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,338
Get my godson back
from my ex-husband.

89
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:27,593
Dibs.

90
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,957
Dang it! Cock-blocking motherfucker!

91
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:40,390
Lady, I'm not sure what it is
you think you're doing,

92
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:44,482
but that's not exactly
our line of expertise.

93
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,410
- I got money.
- How much?

94
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,923
Ten thousand.

95
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:55,439
Yeah, I don't think
saving people is really for us.

96
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:57,938
You know? Why don't you
take that shit to the cops?

97
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,562
They'll do it for free.

98
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:02,792
Twenty-five thousand.

99
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:06,982
Five thousand up front.

100
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:27,106
Come on inside and meet the boys.

101
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:43,164
This is what I'm talking about.
Clean lines, nothing to profile.

102
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,940
None of that spinner,
hydraulic shit to get you lit up.

103
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,979
What I'm talking about, Sal, is you
transporting anything and everything

104
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,866
in this pre-owned Hyundai Sonata.
And here's the reason why.

105
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:57,857
Hidden compartment. Coated
with coffee bean and talcum paste

106
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,227
no drug dog on the planet Earth
can sniff out.

107
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:02,768
This space is worry-free,
and this time next month,

108
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:05,028
I'm gonna have
a fucking fleet of them.

109
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,488
- Damn, that's tight.
- Hear that, Dad? It's tight.

110
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:15,022
So, what do you say, boys? You want
to take a few road trips for me?

111
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,499
Abso-fucking-lutely, Carlos.

112
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:23,999
We surely don't mind being your
fucking little mule, Don Carlos.

113
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:27,238
But we gotta talk about our cut.

114
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:31,754
We're the one doing all the risks.

115
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:36,579
You know, I just remembered something.
I need batteries and toilet paper.

116
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,426
And I need to get that Brad Pitt movie.

117
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:41,418
The one where he turns back
into a fucking baby?

118
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:44,543
Running low on milk, a few things.

119
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:48,958
I wonder where I could get all these
items in one convenient location?

120
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:54,696
- Walmart.
- Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

121
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:57,537
I love the way you put "fucking"
in the middle of a word like that.

122
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,089
I'm gonna start using that shit.

123
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:03,275
You see, guys, I kind of, uh...

124
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:09,196
...look at my future empire as the
Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

125
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,003
But, you know,
we can't all be Sam Walton.

126
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:16,564
That's my job.

127
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,717
And when my foot soldiers
start talking about shit like cuts

128
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:23,558
and percentages and things like that,
well, see, that's partner talk.

129
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,686
And I don't need a partner.

130
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:31,049
I need stockers and cashiers
and mercenaries and mules.

131
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:33,195
And in your case, Padre,

132
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,876
dime-bag dealers
from the lawn and garden department.

133
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,429
Coincidentally, where I found you.

134
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:43,147
Now, Padre, I like you. I really do.
I like your son too.

135
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:46,173
I really appreciate all the shit
you've done for me, you know,

136
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,449
that God wouldn't be proud of.

137
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:53,660
But some things, you just have
to stop them before they start.

138
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,121
See, partnership leads to ambition.

139
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,664
Ambition leads to a word
they don't use much any more.

140
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:03,475
Mutiny.

141
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:29,045
- Papa, what's that?
- It's bad news.

142
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,496
Listen up, dipshits!
This here is Celeste.

143
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:36,687
And she'd like to give us an assload
of money to kidnap her godkid back

144
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,694
from her deadbeat ex-husband.
That about cover it?

145
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,974
- I guess so.
- Well, OK.

146
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,386
Let me just find my
missing persons report here,

147
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:46,931
and I'll get you right set up.

148
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,794
You out your damn mind, brother?

149
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,468
The big fellow over there,
that's Lincoln.

150
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:55,217
The mouthy little faggot here
is McQueen.

151
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,060
And I'm Brick.

152
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:01,529
Did you happen to mention that
kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

153
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,400
I was there this morning.

154
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:10,828
You was at church?

155
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:14,215
When I saw you guys take out that whole
house and walk out without a scratch,

156
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:16,437
I knew I found my guys.

157
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:22,335
Bull sheet. What the catch?

158
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,493
Yeah. Why didn't you just
go to the cops with this?

159
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:31,342
His voice box was crushed
when he was a kid. He can't talk.

160
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,303
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

161
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,017
Why would he go and do
a dumb thing like that?

162
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,021
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

163
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,254
I just want to get Rob
and take him away from all this shit.

164
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,112
- That window closes Tuesday night.
- Do we look like FedEx to you?

165
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,316
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

166
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,079
- Shut up, man.
- You shut up.

167
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:49,910
I'm talking to the lady.
Shut up, man!

168
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,223
- Shut up!
- I just want peace of mind.

169
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:53,085
That's something the cops can't give me.

170
00:14:57,484 --> 00:15:00,135
- And you think we can provide that?
- Yeah.

171
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:02,884
If he's arrested, he'll just get out
in 18 months and hunt me down.

172
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:05,559
This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

173
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:11,870
It is now. She just gave us
25,000 reasons to open up shop.

174
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,201
Five up front.

175
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,969
Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

176
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:24,666
It's a chance.

177
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:28,940
You wanted to be the last
true family man, Clark.

178
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,594
OK.

179
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:36,302
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

180
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:42,264
We'll even get your kid back.
But if this man, this, uh...

181
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:46,189
- Carlos.
- If he's as crazy as you say he is,

182
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:49,427
then why didn't he just kill
you in the first place?

183
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:54,821
He tried.

184
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:57,596
So when you leave,

185
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,780
it would be great if Lincoln
could put a boot through his skull.

186
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:08,521
You ladies have any other questions?

187
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:18,233
Henry, there's someone
in the back for you. In your office.

188
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:23,144
- Who?
- Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

189
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:26,193
- Cute, too.
- Yeah. Thanks for that.

190
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,552
I'll be sure to freshen up
before I go in.

191
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:50,439
Agent Reese. Henry Millard.

192
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,552
- Pleasure, sir.
- Well...

193
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,565
- We don't see suits in here much.
- Yeah, I can see why.

194
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:02,211
- How do people move in this heat?
- At our own pace.

195
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,925
So...
what can I do you for?

196
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:10,552
Well, I wanted to ask you a few
questions regarding the shootout

197
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,471
that occurred earlier today.

198
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:14,856
We think we may have a lead
on some suspects.

199
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:18,391
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

200
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:23,268
It was a... It's an interesting region
you have over here.

201
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:26,787
It seems every few months there's
a large number of violent offenders

202
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,570
that go missing or show up dead,
but there's never any leads.

203
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,128
Cases just... go away.
It's very weird.

204
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,815
Well, I guess around here
finding justice for murderers

205
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:41,673
isn't a top priority.

206
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,473
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers?

207
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:49,138
I know all, son. But I can see you
came prepared for show and tell.

208
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:52,418
So... get with the getting.

209
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:55,512
All right. Prime suspects!

210
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,751
Case dating back to their father,
Jonathan Warren Oodie,

211
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:04,576
or Johnny Boy Oodie, as he was called.

212
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,126
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

213
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,709
Apparently, in his mid-twenties,
Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

214
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:15,261
Made things very colourful for local
law enforcement back in the day.

215
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:19,839
Flash-forward, KKK just about
dumbed themselves out of existence

216
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:22,804
and Johnny Boy went out
in a blaze of glory

217
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,839
during a federal drug raid
in March of '86.

218
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,441
No known mother to speak of, which
makes these three a Christmas miracle.

219
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:32,069
Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?

220
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:35,418
There were no grandparents or kin
suitable to take the children in,

221
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,160
so they were sent into foster care.

222
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:42,909
<i>Then, when they became of age, they
started to become everyone's problem</i>

223
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:46,269
The oldest is Brick.
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.

224
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:49,849
Can't seem to stay out of trouble.
And boy, does he love his guns.

225
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,733
Then it looks as though they tried
to go legit for a minute.

226
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:58,037
So they put their middle brother,
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.

227
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,337
He ended up killing
seven men in the ring. And guess what?

228
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:05,183
Absolutely nothing was done about it.
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,

229
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:10,143
saying it was accidental and part
of his neck-breaking gimmick.

230
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:13,637
And to make this giant fucker
even freakier, he cannot talk.

231
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:16,010
Or at least he couldn't
last time anybody checked.

232
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:19,427
Wrestled under the name
the Dixie Reaper.

233
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,412
And then there's McQueen.
Practically illiterate.

234
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:24,453
He's the baby of the brood.
He was well on his way

235
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:26,420
to becoming a real-life G.I. Joe.

236
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:29,132
<i>But he's got a bit of an issue
with authority.</i>

237
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,197
Whoo!

238
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,538
That's a mighty fine
detective job you've done, son.

239
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:38,679
- Thank you, sir.
- But... it ain't as easy as all that.

240
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:44,531
- So you do know the Oodie Brothers?
- Like I said, I know all.

241
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:48,369
I can't just bring them boys in 'cause
some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

242
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:54,103
Well, you can if some suit

243
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:58,037
from Chicago tells you to.

244
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,796
The longer you stay down here,
the more you're going to realise,

245
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,678
we don't like being
told what to do, son. Now...

246
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,956
...if you'll excuse me,
I got other work to attend to.

247
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:13,332
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking
for, you know, a little cooperation.

248
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,672
Once this thing gets wrapped up,
I'll get out of your hair.

249
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,572
Why don't you let me
worry about my county?

250
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,413
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

251
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:45,349
I'll drive us
until I can't drive no more.

252
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:49,350
Can you believe she went ahead
and paid us five grand up front?

253
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,473
I know, right?

254
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,598
I mean, you'd think she'd have
some trust issues, right?

255
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:59,579
- But hey, each to their own.
- Each to their own, man.

256
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:02,173
Each to their own.

257
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:06,849
Now, I know we've got
an address to Austin,

258
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:10,236
but shouldn't she have given us like
a picture of the kid or something?

259
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,216
How many kids you reckon
they got up there?

260
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:14,453
I mean,
they ain't running a day-care centre.

261
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,290
- OK.
- Yeah.

262
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,737
What if we get there
and Rob's a baby?

263
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,770
Well, if he's a baby,
they got baby junk up there.

264
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,018
- Oh, that's smart.
- It's not like they're riding around

265
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:31,584
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing.
I mean, come on.

266
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,737
Besides that, them bullet scars didn't
look too fresh on Celeste's belly.

267
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,554
- You're right. You're right.
- Yeah.

268
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:48,966
- What if there's more than one kid?
- Why are you asking me so many

269
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:51,936
goddamn questions, man?
We just went over this! What?

270
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,131
What do you want to know?!
What do you want to know?!

271
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:57,666
- How will we know which is Rob?
- I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

272
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:00,207
How about that? I'm gonna say,
"You know what, I don't want Kevin!

273
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:02,278
I don't want Michael!
No, I don't want Stephen!"

274
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:05,039
If there's a bunch of fucking kids
around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!

275
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:07,754
How about that?
Fucking hell, man!

276
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,022
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

277
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:13,515
We smash whoever's in front of us
and we take Rob!

278
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:18,207
Damn! Plain and simple!
What? Sorry, Lincoln.

279
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,218
- I don't know why you have to yell...
- Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

280
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:23,736
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

281
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:26,569
Where'd you learn that word?
Inquisitive?

282
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:30,840
- Where the fuck did you pick that up?
- It's in my lexicon, man!

283
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:33,017
- Jackass. Yeah?
- I've got it up here.

284
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,671
There's a lot you
don't know about me.

285
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:35,888
Are you ready for a potty break?

286
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:37,541
How many books you read, motherfucker?

287
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:54,396
- Where are we?
- We're in Crockett.

288
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:58,788
Davy Crockett. What time is it?

289
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:01,093
Four.

290
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,305
Hey.

291
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:12,961
Hm... I guess there's
a little candy in every pinata.

292
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,486
Shh.

293
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:01,923
Got some free shit!

294
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:05,572
Take it easy, Van Damme! Hey.

295
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,401
Hadji at the front desk said
we're only a few hours from Austin.

296
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,071
- Nice!
- Whoo! Ow!

297
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:19,244
- Who that?
- Fuck. Who do you think?

298
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:21,883
Don't answer that shit, man!

299
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:25,228
Don't answer it. Don't you...

300
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,492
- Hey.
- Hey?

301
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:30,864
Don't hey me.
The hell are you?

302
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:32,521
Texas.

303
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:34,471
Texas?

304
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:37,182
Well, what in the Sam Hill could
you possibly have to do in Texas?

305
00:24:37,455 --> 00:24:39,583
Hey, man. Check this out.

306
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:43,122
Permian Stadium from
Friday Night Lights. It's on the way!

307
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:44,946
I took a job out here.

308
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:48,222
Oh, you took a job!
Well, excuse me.

309
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:53,039
What was I thinking? I forgot you guys
are freelance artists. So, Mr Brick,

310
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,555
- what job did you take?
- Look, it's not a big deal, man.

311
00:24:56,854 --> 00:24:58,744
All right? It's just a little gig
out here. We can handle it.

312
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:01,031
Oh, you're going to handle it
like you handled me yesterday?

313
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:02,517
It's bad enough you can't
check a damn address,

314
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:04,944
but you also got to lay them
pork chops out in my backyard?

315
00:25:05,198 --> 00:25:06,802
- Put it on our tab.
- What was that?

316
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:09,766
- Nothing!
- You watch your mouth, son.

317
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,201
This ain't a joke. This little misstep
is gonna be a pain for me,

318
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,423
but you may have just stuck
your dick in a hornet's nest.

319
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:17,195
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

320
00:25:17,422 --> 00:25:19,265
I've got some jackleg
ATF agent up my ass,

321
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,510
looking to make a name
for locking up you idiots.

322
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:25,049
The last thing I need is for you dumb
shits to draw more unneeded attention.

323
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:29,399
I mean it, Brick. I better not hear shit
about your little Texas job.

324
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:30,969
Keep your ass off the grid.

325
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,078
Don't call my house.
Write this number down.

326
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:36,924
And for the love of God,
get rid of that damn cell phone.

327
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,721
- Yes, sir.
- Damn well better.

328
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:45,397
You mess around and fuck up
my pension, that's your ass.

329
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,109
I don't even know you.

330
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,749
Hey!

331
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,419
Check it out, man!
Permian Stadium!

332
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:07,056
It's on the way, man!
You want to win, put bubba in!

333
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,168
It's not on the way, jackass.

334
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,010
It is, man! It's Odessa, Texas!

335
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:13,966
Huh?

336
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:30,388
Man! Don't take it out on me
because you got your ass chewed.

337
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,406
We got work to do, boys.

338
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,167
I'll get my badge.

339
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,125
No. I figured we'd do
the old Roosevelt slammer.

340
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,207
Fuck, yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

341
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:43,124
Dibs, bitch! Whoo!

342
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:47,208
Goddamn it, Montane! I didn't want you
to blow the place to hell and back.

343
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:50,823
I don't give a shit! Would you fucking
listen to me every now and then?

344
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:54,171
Please? Goddamn it.
Come here, baby. Come here!

345
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,349
I don't know if your mama told you,
but you are hotter than shit.

346
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,917
Goddamn.

347
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:05,355
Fuck.
That's the shit right there, boys!

348
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:08,689
From now on,
no more nickel and diming!

349
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:11,219
You get it? Only the finest!

350
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,324
- Hey, how come she's not naked?
- Don't know, boss.

351
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:17,826
Find out.

352
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:20,643
Hey. I'll call you when I need you.

353
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,195
All right. Bye.

354
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:28,687
Doesn't anybody know how
to use finesse any more?

355
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,621
You all right?

356
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,834
- The helmet ain't work for shit.
- I told you. Aah!

357
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,333
All right, you go east, I go west!

358
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:24,716
Plain and simple. Smash and grab.

359
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,946
Oh, shit.

360
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:40,823
My bad, lady. You OK?

361
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:45,821
In my defence,
you do work for an asshole.

362
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,315
You Rob?

363
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:12,267
Brick!

364
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:16,876
Goddang. Brick!

365
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,858
Goddamn it.

366
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:28,872
Fuck.

367
00:29:31,488 --> 00:29:33,856
Oh, shit.

368
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,406
Boss! Boss, are you all right?

369
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:44,266
What the fuck
does it look like, Marty?

370
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:47,072
It looks like a fucking bomb went off.

371
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:53,853
Denny?

372
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:57,107
- What the hell happened?
- The kid.

373
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,718
- Say what?
- Three guys come in.

374
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,790
Yes, I know three guys came in!
They came all the fucking way in!

375
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,517
- I see that!
- They took the kid.

376
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:10,908
Fuck! Goddamn it!

377
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:17,523
They shot my motherfucking maid!

378
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:23,845
OK, Marty,
I know it's over a year ago,

379
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:27,824
but I need you to fucking think, OK?
You did kill Celeste, right?

380
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:29,348
You wouldn't lie to me about that shit,
would you?

381
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,689
I put three bullets in her gut.
She looked dead to me.

382
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,507
But you didn't check to see
if she was dead, did you?

383
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,356
Guess not.

384
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:41,576
That was our golden ticket,
you stinking fuck!

385
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:44,598
How am I going to pay for this?
You got the dough?

386
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,110
Hm?

387
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,122
You got a fucking piggy bank
in your fat ass?

388
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:51,948
Sorry, boss.

389
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:56,606
OK. As long as you're sorry, I guess
that's all that matters, isn't it?

390
00:30:56,886 --> 00:30:59,457
I'll take care of it, boss. I'll make
sure it's right. I'll take care of it.

391
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,134
Good, good. Thanks, thanks.

392
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,673
Yeah. Hand me my goddamn pills,
will you?

393
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,704
You still want to go look at that car?

394
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:26,594
That Carlos man make you cripple?

395
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:32,029
Hi, buddy.

396
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,626
I don't think he can talk.

397
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,120
- Well, ain't this some shit, man.
- What?

398
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,207
That he's all, you know...

399
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:45,284
- Don't do that shit!
- What?

400
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,851
'Cause you're being mean!
He can't help it.

401
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:50,999
You OK?

402
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,468
You hurt?

403
00:31:54,457 --> 00:31:56,937
You OK? He can understand us.

404
00:31:57,211 --> 00:32:00,534
How the hell did you get
"I'm OK" from that?

405
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:06,719
Hey, look, buddy. We ain't going
to hurt you, all right? Celeste sent us.

406
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:10,034
You know Celeste?

407
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,475
Huh?

408
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:16,170
Yeah! There he goes!
See? He understands us just fine.

409
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:19,849
Once again, how the hell do you
know what he's saying?

410
00:32:20,156 --> 00:32:21,601
You the tard whisperer?

411
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:23,111
You say that again,
I'm gonna kill you.

412
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:25,409
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- Say it again. You are making fun.

413
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:28,314
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- You are making fun of him.

414
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,587
It's just a little weird that she didn't
mention the poor little fella's

415
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:34,007
- all buggered up, you know?
- It don't matter.

416
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:37,705
She sent us to get Rob.
We got Rob. All right?

417
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:41,395
You good, buddy?

418
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:45,301
- I wasn't being mean.
- You were being mean!

419
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:47,205
You were making fun of him.

420
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,541
Bless his heart.
He ain't got no control over that.

421
00:32:56,952 --> 00:32:59,717
It's a damn good thing
he wasn't in the living room.

422
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,540
I'm just saying.

423
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:12,023
Hm-mm.
Yeah, we can do that.

424
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,120
Oh, we can get that done.

425
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,808
All right, Carlos. I'm just
finishing up a little something here.

426
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:31,534
Then we'll get on the road.
Don't you worry about a thing, sweetie.

427
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:38,226
Excuse me, councilman.

428
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,764
What? He wanted a bath.

429
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:10,753
Another one already?
I didn't even get off.

430
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:14,844
- It's for Carlos.
- Well, that makes it a bit better.

431
00:34:45,546 --> 00:34:47,310
Doesn't get much better
than this, Bill.

432
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:51,439
It'd be better than this if the fish
was biting as well as these chiggers.

433
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,603
You gotta be shitting me.

434
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:01,094
This is where the real police matters
are handled, huh?

435
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:04,440
Oh, you mean on private property?
Yeah, sometimes it is.

436
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,784
Anthony Reese, ATF.

437
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,318
- Bill Hawkins. Nice to meet you.
- Bill's a representative for the state.

438
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:12,383
Ah, nice to meet you, sir.

439
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,246
Bill, have you heard about an
investigation going on in our area?

440
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,706
No, I haven't.

441
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:20,810
It seems Agent Reese was sent
down here to check up on us.

442
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,694
Seeing as he's an Ivy League grad,

443
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:24,927
I guess that makes him
better at our jobs than we are.

444
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:26,225
Oh, is he now?

445
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:30,321
No. I'm not trying to intrude,
only assist.

446
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:33,931
Sheriff, I feel
like we got off on the wrong foot.

447
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,757
We're on the same team.
I don't want it to feel like

448
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:39,075
I'm infringing on your territory.
I just...

449
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:40,971
I really think we have something
with these Oodies.

450
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:43,405
We don't talk business
when I'm fishing, son.

451
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,866
When I'm about to cast.
Don't get hooked!

452
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:52,871
We can, however, talk all
about it tomorrow at my office.

453
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:56,183
It don't excite me that some
Yankee's come down here

454
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,549
imposing his authority
on one of my best friends.

455
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:02,884
This county has the lowest crime rate
in the state, last time I checked.

456
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:04,514
- Uh-huh.
- I know you Democrats

457
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,092
think we need your help,

458
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:10,682
but I'm here to tell you that we don't.
Bad enough I've gotta fight you in D.C.

459
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:14,918
Now you can just ease your way out
of here the same way you eased in.

460
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,131
I'd like to enjoy what's left
of my afternoon.

461
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:24,092
Alrighty, then.

462
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:29,239
Why don't you go back home
to that wife of yours?

463
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:33,035
It must be hard raising
a baby all by herself.

464
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:18,189
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

465
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:25,241
- Pretty classy joint you've got here
- Thanks. Nice shirt.

466
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:33,975
- You Lucky?
- That's right.

467
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:36,178
Let's see about that.

468
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:38,553
Hey, man, why don't you
turn that shit off back there for me?

469
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:42,091
That's Mac. He's 98 years old.
I think he's earned the right

470
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,518
to watch a little T and A if he wants.

471
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:47,056
Why? He ain't jerking nothing.

472
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:49,520
Yeah, well, he's been watching that
stuff since I opened the joint,

473
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:52,506
so I'm gonna keep it that way,
all right?

474
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,667
Well, how about this?

475
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:59,867
If I go back there, I'm gonna bust
up Mac and your TV. How about that?

476
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,852
Yeah, is that a fact?

477
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:09,951
- What the fuck?
- See, I got a minor with me.

478
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:13,379
I'd appreciate it if he wouldn't
have to listen to that.

479
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:22,198
Hey, Mac, I'm gonna give it
a rest for a second, all right?

480
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:25,087
I'm looking for
a friend of mine. Terry.

481
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:26,286
Macky?

482
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,456
I'm gonna give it a rest!

483
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:35,480
Mac.

484
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:39,871
Say, Mac. Mac?

485
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,599
It looks like Mac finally
had enough.

486
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,890
Hey, man.

487
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,644
Let me guess.
This is the part where you say

488
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:55,978
<i>you'll be back. Am I right?</i>

489
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,721
I'll be back.

490
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,290
You know this movie?

491
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,908
I'll be back.

492
00:39:28,272 --> 00:39:29,876
I'll be back.

493
00:39:34,863 --> 00:39:37,515
Well, ain't you full of surprises?

494
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:03,653
Hey, this is Lucky. Yeah, listen,
I need an ambulance down here, OK?

495
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:06,589
It seems like Mac's passed on, OK?

496
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:13,985
You got anything to eat back there
besides the bar food bullshit?

497
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,415
- I have to go get it.
- Well, rustle something up, man.

498
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:21,402
I need something for the kid, please.
We're in a big hurry if you don't mind.

499
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:23,515
Oh, yeah? You running from something?

500
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:32,614
Goddamn.

501
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:53,006
How's it going, ladies?
Need something to drink?

502
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:55,737
Don't know what we'd like yet.

503
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:59,011
All right. Well,
you let us know when you do.

504
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:00,906
Looking real good up in here.

505
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:08,059
Watch this.

506
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:20,446
Dibs.

507
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:34,482
Name's McQueen.

508
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:39,166
What's your name?

509
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:40,846
Can I buy you a drink?

510
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:44,590
Her name is Jez.
And you can buy us a drink.

511
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:50,431
Lucky? Can I get us some beers
for my new friend Jez.

512
00:41:50,824 --> 00:41:54,034
And her ladies. And that kid's
still waiting on his food.

513
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:56,172
I'll be right back.

514
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:02,501
Figure it out.

515
00:42:06,928 --> 00:42:10,489
What's your story?
And I'm gonna pretend I'm listening.

516
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:12,890
Damn bullshit!
Don't want the kid seeing porn,

517
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:16,432
but when some sweet tail walks in,
they forget all about that, right?

518
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:21,533
First time in four years I got
some sweet, fresh snapper come in here,

519
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:25,193
and I'm down here making fucking
sandwiches for the Road Warriors?

520
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:26,903
Kiss my fucking ass!

521
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:37,405
Hm...

522
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,051
Wanna dance?

523
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:45,446
About damn time.

524
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:52,041
Not like that.

525
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:55,522
Um...

526
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,354
Not like that either.

527
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:05,808
Brick?

528
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,011
Is that the Big Whopper
or the Ponytail?

529
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,575
By the way, Marty says hi.

530
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,162
Yeah? Well, tell Marty, "Fuck you. "
I see you dodged another bullet.

531
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,801
How'd you get this number?

532
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:19,416
These days, baby,
I can get just about anything I want to.

533
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:23,573
For instance, right now I'm
getting back my paycheque on wheels

534
00:43:23,898 --> 00:43:27,904
- from those amateurs you sent.
- Moneygrubbing piece of shit!

535
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:30,444
What happened to us, baby?
We were good once, weren't we?

536
00:43:30,698 --> 00:43:33,907
Fuck you! We were never good.
I got played and that's that.

537
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:38,731
Whoa. Hang on a second.
Anybody got played, it was me.

538
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:41,928
I thought I had a bitch
that was down with this shit.

539
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:44,102
You killed his parents, you psycho!

540
00:43:44,341 --> 00:43:46,742
And it makes me sick that
I brought you into their world!

541
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:49,139
Don't you think they're just
a bad judge of character?

542
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:51,311
It ain't my fault all your
friends are richer than shit.

543
00:43:51,557 --> 00:43:54,801
And you know something? At the end
of the day, I think you knew.

544
00:43:55,104 --> 00:43:58,028
If I knew, I would have lit your
gutless ass on fire while you slept!

545
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:01,206
Now, there's
the feisty bitch I know!

546
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:04,218
I wish it hadn't
ended up the way it did.

547
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:08,576
But what's Clyde gonna do
if Bonnie crosses him and goes soft?

548
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:12,281
And besides, what does that
son of a bitch need money for?

549
00:44:12,543 --> 00:44:14,910
I mean, how much can a wheelchair cost?
Two or three hundred dollars?

550
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,652
You lost, motherfucker!
Rob's coming back with me. Deal with it.

551
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:24,425
Now, girlie, obviously you
didn't learn the first time around.

552
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:27,087
Let me tell you
how this shit's gonna end.

553
00:44:28,687 --> 00:44:32,056
I sent some really awful bitches
to handle this situation.

554
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:35,169
Now, once they track down your fellas,
it's not gonna be a bloodbath.

555
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:38,416
It's gonna get fucking sexy.

556
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:46,346
They'll single them out,
divide them up, then thin the herd.

557
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:33,940
Each one will have
forgotten about everything,

558
00:45:34,186 --> 00:45:36,792
except for the fine piece
of strange grinding on them.

559
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,550
Then, without warning,
their lives will be snuffed out

560
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:04,565
and the girls deliver Rob just in time
for me to plan the boy's 18th birthday.

561
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,775
You should have stayed dead, darling.

562
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:10,910
'Cause unless your name is Jesus,
you had no business coming back.

563
00:46:11,232 --> 00:46:13,041
See you soon.

564
00:46:57,122 --> 00:46:58,408
Why don't you try a taste of me?

565
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:21,520
Well, hi, big guy.
Here's my boom stick.

566
00:47:24,948 --> 00:47:26,677
Oh, shit!

567
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:44,238
Hey! Hey, don't be
fucking around up there!

568
00:48:16,137 --> 00:48:17,627
Fuck!

569
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,490
Well, those girls were the longest
relationship I ever had.

570
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:36,742
You OK, bud? Huh?

571
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,580
All right, come on.
I wanna move. Let's go.

572
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:51,272
Lucky's about to get lucky
up in this motherfucker.

573
00:48:51,597 --> 00:48:54,442
Do this shit right.
I'm gonna do it all night.

574
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:56,650
I've got to pay to play.

575
00:48:56,896 --> 00:49:00,139
Five girls like that come in there,
you've got to pay to play.

576
00:49:00,442 --> 00:49:01,682
That pussy ain't free.

577
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:03,985
Don't you laugh at me.
I'm gonna make you work all this,

578
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:06,003
all this extra weight off me,
because all I've been doing

579
00:49:06,241 --> 00:49:09,768
is eating fried chicken, baby
and fried collards!

580
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,244
Fried! Everything fried!
I saw a man fry a Twinkie yesterday.

581
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:18,385
Hill County officials
have these renderings to go on.

582
00:49:18,715 --> 00:49:20,524
Baby, let me call you right back.

583
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:22,205
...the assailants are travelling
with a minor,

584
00:49:22,428 --> 00:49:25,398
and appear to be highly dangerous.
If you see anyone

585
00:49:25,682 --> 00:49:28,526
fitting this description,
please contact the local authorities.

586
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:31,291
- I'll be a motherfucker.
- Back to you with the weather, Bob.

587
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:37,079
That sexy bitch broke
her damn heel off in my back.

588
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:38,899
Whoo!

589
00:49:39,615 --> 00:49:42,620
- What in the hell was that?
- I don't know.

590
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:45,995
But you can bet I'm gonna
call Celeste and find out.

591
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:53,637
Rambo time.

592
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:16,891
Now, you ain't gonna
get me back for this later?

593
00:50:17,163 --> 00:50:18,767
Promise me now.

594
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:23,178
'Cause I've got a feeling
this is gonna hurt.

595
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:28,427
- He's taking it, man.
- Take it like Drago!

596
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,091
Drago.

597
00:50:30,304 --> 00:50:34,947
Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago!

598
00:50:38,689 --> 00:50:42,580
- Yeah, baby!
- Man! She got you good! Whoo!

599
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:52,912
Hill County officials
have these renderings to go on.

600
00:50:53,248 --> 00:50:56,139
Eyewitness accounts say the assailants
are travelling with a minor

601
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,583
and appear to be highly dangerous.
If you see anyone

602
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:03,092
- fitting this description, please...
- Fuck me!

603
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:10,520
Hey!

604
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:15,076
They did a really good job, didn't they?
It looks just like them too.

605
00:51:15,402 --> 00:51:17,928
Look at that.
It was all over the news.

606
00:51:19,072 --> 00:51:21,599
Sheriff, this is the first time
that evidence

607
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:24,951
has literally been
brought to my doorstep.

608
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:29,480
We were able to pick up
an address for them, too.

609
00:51:29,794 --> 00:51:31,957
I'll have a search and seizure
here by noon.

610
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,182
And surprise, surprise!

611
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,666
It's located on a piece
of residential land

612
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:41,014
here in your county, Sheriff.
Can you believe that?

613
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:44,161
That sounds like a hell of a plan, son.
What can I do to help?

614
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:47,999
Well, I'm guessing half the roads that
get me there won't show up on my GPS.

615
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:52,289
So if you could do me a favour
and simply escort me to the property,

616
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:55,982
that would be fantastic.

617
00:51:57,955 --> 00:52:02,324
Oh... You mean that old-ass
condemned shack out on Euleton?

618
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:06,595
Son, you didn't hear? Fire chief let the
volunteers burn that up for training.

619
00:52:08,051 --> 00:52:10,213
- Burn it up for training.
- Yeah.

620
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:13,360
Yeah, I think it was scheduled
for early this morning.

621
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,530
Is that right?

622
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:19,800
- Well, I suggest you better stop them.
- I could call Chief Walters,

623
00:52:20,065 --> 00:52:22,875
but I'm pretty sure ain't nothing
left out there but smoke and ash.

624
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:26,555
My! I'm really sorry about that.

625
00:52:26,866 --> 00:52:29,392
It really sounded like you had
something there.

626
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:37,174
Motherfucker,
I'm done with you wasting my time.

627
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:40,030
I don't ever remember asking for it.

628
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:42,381
This good-old-boy justice thing
you got going on,

629
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:45,606
letting the trash take out the trash,
saving tax dollars

630
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:48,210
by keeping the bottomfeeders
out of the system

631
00:52:48,476 --> 00:52:51,605
so you can just go fishing all day,

632
00:52:51,896 --> 00:52:53,899
that's a slippery slope
you're playing on.

633
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,551
It's gotten to the point where
you're no better than they are, Sheriff.

634
00:52:58,154 --> 00:53:00,555
Yeah, I'd be careful if I was you.

635
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:06,354
Well, I'll take
that under advisement.

636
00:53:12,047 --> 00:53:13,970
Shit.

637
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:44,420
Wake up.

638
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,153
Go get Rob something to eat.
I'm gonna call Celeste.

639
00:54:07,908 --> 00:54:11,230
Ooh...
Found the mother lode, boy!

640
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,619
I'm gonna pay for it.
Don't worry. God.

641
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:35,317
You see, man, when you
open up something in the store...

642
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:39,435
...you have to pay for it.

643
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:47,939
No one taught me that
when I was young.

644
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:52,236
I learnt that one the hard way.

645
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:54,428
From the cops.

646
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:00,292
What?

647
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:05,514
What's wrong, man?

648
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:08,965
I don't know you mean
by all that squirming.

649
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:12,796
Help me out, bud. What you need, huh?
What you need?

650
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:16,505
You got to take a piss?

651
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:21,519
You're hungry. Goddamn,
of course you're hungry!

652
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:26,752
Let's get you something to eat, eh?
OK. Let's go.

653
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:28,975
Man!

654
00:55:30,803 --> 00:55:33,374
It's like working out a riddle
every time talking to this boy.

655
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:35,767
Morning, sunshine! You know,

656
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:38,862
I don't remember crazy-ass biker chicks
being involved in our deal.

657
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:42,787
I don't remember leaving Carlos alive
in the deal either. Is Rob all right?

658
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:44,838
Fuck!

659
00:55:46,406 --> 00:55:48,295
Yeah, he's probably scared
half to death, but he's fine.

660
00:55:48,533 --> 00:55:50,661
- Let me talk to him.
- He's inside getting something to eat

661
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:52,561
with McQueen. Besides,
you and I got something to talk about.

662
00:55:52,788 --> 00:55:54,438
All right? What the hell
was that last night?

663
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:58,113
I told you, Carlos would try to get
Rob back if you didn't kill him.

664
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,946
What are you talking about? We killed
every motherfucker in that place.

665
00:56:01,215 --> 00:56:03,695
Well, evidently not, Brick!

666
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:06,051
All right. Why would a guy like
Carlos, what would he want to do

667
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:08,626
with a kid in Rob's condition?

668
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:13,342
Carlos killed Rob's parents,
and then lied to me about it.

669
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:16,170
That might have been something
you wanted to mention.

670
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:18,207
All right, look. I'm sorry.

671
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:22,417
Rob has a trust
that matures when he's 18,

672
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:27,229
and as legal guardians, we would
get him and eventually the money.

673
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:31,667
That too might be something that
you wanted to mention! Fuck!

674
00:56:32,004 --> 00:56:36,566
Rob's trust matures next week and...
Carlos will do anything to get it.

675
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:40,328
- Brick, you're all he's got.
- All right. New plan.

676
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,440
- You meet us halfway.
- Fine. Where?

677
00:56:45,896 --> 00:56:48,422
Vicksburg, Mississippi.
Big Bayou Campground.

678
00:56:49,985 --> 00:56:52,147
I'll be there as soon as I can.

679
00:56:52,404 --> 00:56:56,807
And if you lie to me again,
Carlos will be the least of your worries.

680
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,051
I already dropped five bitches.
I won't hesitate to make it six.

681
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,399
Now, you may have heard
of pig in a blanket,

682
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,088
but this here is a pig in the sun.

683
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:19,855
Whoo!

684
00:57:20,064 --> 00:57:23,785
You want hair on your chest,
now, don't you? Strippers like it.

685
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:26,978
Hand me a napkin, man.

686
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:37,741
You all right?

687
00:57:38,503 --> 00:57:40,790
Hey. Don't worry.

688
00:57:41,048 --> 00:57:45,134
Don't worry, man.
Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

689
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,040
He's OK.

690
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,450
...believed to be
responsible for the shooting

691
00:57:50,685 --> 00:57:51,846
in a rural Texas bar.

692
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:54,633
They are travelling with a disabled
young man and believed to be

693
00:57:54,899 --> 00:57:59,143
armed and dangerous. Do not
approach these men if you see them.

694
00:58:08,874 --> 00:58:10,922
Who wants a Snicker bomb, huh?

695
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:16,134
Think you can kidnap
some kid and get away with it?

696
00:58:20,638 --> 00:58:23,688
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math,
five whore assassins

697
00:58:23,977 --> 00:58:26,378
can't trump three retards
and a fucking cripple.

698
00:58:26,646 --> 00:58:29,126
I mean, well,
according to my calculations,

699
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:31,402
they should be in your
area someplace by now.

700
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:33,735
But that's not my fucking job
to figure out, is it?

701
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:36,879
I mean, isn't owning
the road your goddamn job?

702
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,207
That's what I thought. OK.

703
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:41,934
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do.
Just get my boy back.

704
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,164
Yes! Get it done!

705
00:58:50,718 --> 00:58:54,040
- Yeah?
- We're in a world of shit down here.

706
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:55,997
Yeah, and now it's
spilling over into mine.

707
00:58:56,224 --> 00:58:58,831
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg,
Mississippi. OK?

708
00:58:59,104 --> 00:59:03,109
- Big Bayou Campground. We could...
- Stop. Stop! Shut up!

709
00:59:03,442 --> 00:59:05,729
Just shut the fuck up!
The less I know, the better.

710
00:59:05,986 --> 00:59:09,275
- I taught you better than this!
- Look, I just thought that if,

711
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:11,225
you know,
we could run in and do a quick...

712
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:15,821
Don't do that! Don't get ideas!
Just do what the fuck I say!

713
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,329
Things ran smooth when we did that,
didn't it?

714
00:59:19,128 --> 00:59:21,256
<i>I cleaned up your shit,
you took care of mine.</i>

715
00:59:21,506 --> 00:59:23,508
I could have handled this hotshot.

716
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:26,240
But now this shit has gone public.

717
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:29,164
There's repercussions
to working for yourself.

718
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,403
- About time you learned that.
- Meaning what?

719
00:59:32,686 --> 00:59:36,453
<i>I got to cut ties, Brick.
I cleaned up everything on my end</i>

720
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:39,619
So, what you do from now on
rests solely on your shoulders.

721
00:59:39,904 --> 00:59:43,751
If you come back here,
I got no choice but to put you down.

722
00:59:45,203 --> 00:59:46,648
I got a family to protect.

723
00:59:51,251 --> 00:59:54,415
I'll be sure to let the boys know
that we're on our own again.

724
00:59:54,714 --> 00:59:56,637
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

725
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,149
Brick! We gots to go!

726
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,326
We made the news!

727
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:22,590
Hood Pirates! Mount up!

728
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:44,765
Whoo!

729
01:00:47,321 --> 01:00:48,892
Give me that!

730
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:53,936
- You call Millard?
- Yeah.

731
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:56,696
Well, what did he say?

732
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:58,521
The suspects
in question are believed to be

733
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:01,961
- Brick Oodie and his two brothers...
- Nothing.

734
01:01:02,256 --> 01:01:05,419
They hail from the Atmore area,
located in Montgomery, Alabama.

735
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:08,644
They drew you to look like a fag.
Look at that.

736
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:11,776
What the fuck you do that for, man?

737
01:01:18,735 --> 01:01:20,976
- What the fuck, man?
- Come on! Come on, huh?

738
01:01:21,238 --> 01:01:22,239
- What are you do...?
- Come on!

739
01:01:22,448 --> 01:01:24,052
I ain't gonna fucking hurt you,
you little faggot!

740
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:26,685
- Stop, man!
- Come on! Come here!

741
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:28,319
Want some? You want some?

742
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:31,782
- Fuck!
- What the devil got into you?

743
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:36,940
I fucked us.

744
01:01:38,802 --> 01:01:41,282
How you mean?

745
01:01:41,555 --> 01:01:46,642
Uh, let's see. Millard won't have
anything to do with us any more

746
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:50,184
'cause he can't clean up that mess
with the biker chicks down at the bar.

747
01:01:50,483 --> 01:01:53,090
So now we can't go back to 'Bama.

748
01:01:53,362 --> 01:01:56,252
And all of them son of bitches
we mowed down in Austin?

749
01:01:56,532 --> 01:01:59,502
- Guess what we missed.
- Carlos.

750
01:02:01,372 --> 01:02:04,421
And he ain't gonna stop neither.
He's already tracked down Celeste.

751
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:08,714
So now we gotta get him to fucking
Vicksburg so they can disappear.

752
01:02:10,008 --> 01:02:11,692
Well...

753
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:14,373
This is getting better by the minute.

754
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:21,530
Now, I like that little fella
just as much as anybody.

755
01:02:23,733 --> 01:02:29,184
But tell me something. Just give me one
reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

756
01:02:31,826 --> 01:02:33,430
They ain't got no other options.

757
01:02:33,662 --> 01:02:35,744
Hell, we ain't got
no other options either.

758
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:41,308
I mean, look at us.
We can't even take care of ourselves.

759
01:02:43,132 --> 01:02:44,179
Has it ever crossed your mind

760
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:47,627
that maybe he stands
a better chance without us?

761
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,462
- It's just different.
- How's this different?

762
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,128
- It's just different!
- How the fuck is it different?

763
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:58,170
We had a brother...

764
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:02,432
...who passed away
before you can even remember.

765
01:03:03,574 --> 01:03:05,816
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

766
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:08,809
He was all buggered up,
and he was in a wheelchair.

767
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:13,291
Daddy beat his ass every single day.
Treated him like a dog.

768
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:18,317
And there's nothing
we could do about it. Different.

769
01:03:27,646 --> 01:03:31,014
Well, he gets a pass. I don't
understand why you didn't say nothing.

770
01:03:31,317 --> 01:03:34,765
- How come you never said nothing?
- What do you want me to say to you?

771
01:03:36,323 --> 01:03:38,052
I'm sorry, all right?

772
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:41,414
But ever since I've seen this fella,
I can't stop thinking about it.

773
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:51,983
How'd he die?

774
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:54,058
- How'd he die?
- I don't know.

775
01:03:54,262 --> 01:03:56,469
He was there one day and gone the next.

776
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,048
I asked Daddy about it one time,
but that went over like a fart in church.

777
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:11,451
What was his name?

778
01:04:16,247 --> 01:04:20,298
- They never named him.
- Fuck me.

779
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:47,802
Got them bitches! Dead ahead!

780
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:57,758
And this time, try not to hit
the motherfucking baby.

781
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,545
Here they come!

782
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,053
I'm giving it all she's got.

783
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:09,519
Monaco ain't got nothing left!
Strap in Rob! Here they come, boys!

784
01:05:09,814 --> 01:05:11,737
What the hell is this motherfucker?

785
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:17,540
Hey, Rottweiler!
You better back the fuck up, mutt!

786
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:22,622
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

787
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:27,132
The kid's in the back!

788
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,559
Aah!

789
01:05:49,948 --> 01:05:52,235
They took the kid!
I thought I told you to strap him in!

790
01:05:52,493 --> 01:05:55,144
They took the fucking door, man!
I really don't think a fucking seatbelt

791
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:57,222
would have mattered right now! Go!

792
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:08,885
- Hey, he all right?
- How in the fuck do I know?

793
01:06:09,931 --> 01:06:11,421
Here they come! Just like you said!

794
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:17,058
Hey! Help the driver.
You want to see this.

795
01:06:17,357 --> 01:06:19,598
We're about to fuck
your babysitters up.

796
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:31,363
- Come on, boy!
- Whoo! Come on!

797
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:35,782
Welcome to the South, motherfuckers!

798
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,951
Whoo! What you got now, bitches?!

799
01:06:46,518 --> 01:06:47,565
Time out, bitch!

800
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,636
No. No, indeed. Hell no.

801
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:10,969
- Do something, you're the brains!
- We've gotta figure something out!

802
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:12,786
What?!

803
01:07:14,428 --> 01:07:16,192
- Top rope!
- Top rope!

804
01:07:23,356 --> 01:07:25,245
Motherfuckers!

805
01:07:27,027 --> 01:07:28,916
Whoo!

806
01:07:33,034 --> 01:07:35,560
Get them, Lincoln! Come on!

807
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,810
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

808
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:43,096
Go get 'em!

809
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:46,183
They're slowing down!
They're slowing down!

810
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:50,169
Come on.

811
01:07:55,228 --> 01:07:56,957
Lincoln!

812
01:08:13,084 --> 01:08:14,734
We're good!

813
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:17,936
You all right, buddy?

814
01:08:26,893 --> 01:08:28,895
You're one crazy redneck.

815
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,448
Trying to be a tough guy? Huh?
Running away from us?

816
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:45,815
You want one of these?
You've earned it.

817
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:50,408
- How's Linc?
- Not so good.

818
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:52,521
- What?
- You better check on him.

819
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:54,602
You got Rob?

820
01:08:58,515 --> 01:08:59,846
Fuck.

821
01:09:04,815 --> 01:09:07,102
You do all this?

822
01:09:09,487 --> 01:09:11,217
By God.

823
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:16,098
It ain't your hat, bitch.

824
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:20,021
Good work!

825
01:09:20,293 --> 01:09:22,455
Let me take a look.

826
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:24,636
Come on. Let me see it.

827
01:09:27,718 --> 01:09:29,960
Shit!

828
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,438
Well, I think it's safe
to say that, uh,

829
01:09:33,684 --> 01:09:37,689
that surpasses McQueen's
level of doctoring.

830
01:09:40,068 --> 01:09:41,354
- Fine.
- You are not fine.

831
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:43,890
We need to get that looked at.

832
01:09:44,156 --> 01:09:47,080
- Fine.
- All right. You're fine.

833
01:09:49,204 --> 01:09:51,252
Fine, my ass.

834
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:57,643
Fuck!

835
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:09,968
McQueen!

836
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:26,774
Montane! Montane,
where the fuck are you?

837
01:10:30,546 --> 01:10:31,593
Shit.

838
01:10:41,143 --> 01:10:43,829
Goddamn it!

839
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:46,931
Hey. you guys need a ride?

840
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,663
Who are these fucking people?!

841
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:05,639
Nah, man. We're good.
Just keep going.

842
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,052
Son of a bitch.

843
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:13,195
He practically made these monsters,
then hung them out to dry.

844
01:11:13,517 --> 01:11:15,963
You gotta be kidding me.

845
01:11:17,313 --> 01:11:20,045
And why aren't they working for me?!

846
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,309
Just get in the car.
I'm a nurse. I can help.

847
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,107
That ain't such a bad idea.

848
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:31,725
Bingo.

849
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,700
What happened here?

850
01:11:36,754 --> 01:11:40,157
- I did that.
- The stabbing or the stitches?

851
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:43,949
- The stitches.
- Infection is setting in.

852
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:46,915
I poured whiskey on it.

853
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:48,985
Let me guess,
you saw that in a movie?

854
01:11:49,228 --> 01:11:51,799
Yeah. Several.

855
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,352
Hey-Hey,Rob?

856
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:10,827
You hold onto that, all right?
You know that's his prize possession.

857
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:14,340
He's gonna need it when
he gets to feeling better, OK?

858
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:22,884
Chogan, this is Carlos.
I'm only calling as a last damn resort.

859
01:12:23,187 --> 01:12:25,508
Some asshole took Rob
and I need you to kill him.

860
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,902
<i>If you can, bring me back the kid,
and if not, then fuck it.</i>

861
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:30,313
If I can't have him, nobody can.

862
01:12:33,784 --> 01:12:35,149
They're close.

863
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:37,098
Finish up!

864
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:51,688
He gonna be all right?

865
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:55,174
Like I said, it's up to you.

866
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,089
You look really familiar.

867
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:06,312
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

868
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:09,465
Do you stay in shitty motels?
'Cause we clean them.

869
01:13:10,913 --> 01:13:14,440
Crockett.
That's where I've seen you.

870
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:17,725
Small world.

871
01:13:19,173 --> 01:13:21,175
So why ain't you a nurse?

872
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:26,550
- Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.
- Why don't you become legal?

873
01:13:26,892 --> 01:13:29,498
Your country doesn't
make it that easy for us.

874
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:30,771
What are you talking about?

875
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,506
Just go down to the place
and fill out your paperwork.

876
01:13:34,776 --> 01:13:37,508
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal.
I mean, you speak the language.

877
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,545
That's more than most
of them do out here.

878
01:13:40,825 --> 01:13:42,873
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

879
01:13:44,496 --> 01:13:47,148
Yeah, well, I might
be just an ignorant redneck,

880
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:49,624
but at least I know who I am.

881
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:54,744
I mean, you're a nurse.
You ought to be helping people.

882
01:13:55,052 --> 01:13:57,100
Not scrubbing toilets.

883
01:13:58,097 --> 01:14:02,978
Well, is that why you do what you do?
'Cause it's who you are?

884
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:09,433
Let's just say it runs in the family.
You know?

885
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:14,356
Well, you're not gonna have
much family left at this pace.

886
01:14:22,294 --> 01:14:25,264
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for us.

887
01:14:25,547 --> 01:14:28,596
I can't say that I'd exactly
done the same thing, so...

888
01:14:31,055 --> 01:14:32,784
You're welcome.

889
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:38,936
What would you say if...
if I offered you two grand

890
01:14:39,272 --> 01:14:40,798
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi?

891
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:48,925
What do you say I convince you not
to do what you're about to do?

892
01:14:50,996 --> 01:14:53,442
I could take you anywhere else.

893
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:59,143
Nah. This here's one of them
kind of deals, you know?

894
01:15:02,301 --> 01:15:07,308
We kind of had people controlling
what we do our whole lives, you know?

895
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,778
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

896
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:04,816
- Please keep the kid safe for me.
- Nothing bad's gonna happen.

897
01:16:05,171 --> 01:16:09,301
- We've just got a job to finish.
- I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

898
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:16,215
- Thank you.
- See ya.

899
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:19,401
See you around.

900
01:16:28,575 --> 01:16:31,659
Can we still put a pool in
with three grand?

901
01:16:34,416 --> 01:16:36,418
What you thinking?

902
01:16:40,048 --> 01:16:41,857
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

903
01:16:42,092 --> 01:16:43,935
But it's gonna be tough
with just two of us.

904
01:16:46,472 --> 01:16:48,521
What you mean two?

905
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:57,612
That's fitting.

906
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:06,271
- You want to go high?
- No.

907
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:20,386
You go and run in the house.

908
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:26,265
No matter what you hear,
no matter what the people say,

909
01:17:26,606 --> 01:17:30,930
Papaw did what he could to make things
better for you than he had. OK?

910
01:17:31,278 --> 01:17:33,326
Go. Run along.

911
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:44,068
Dispatch told me you'd, uh...
you'd be here.

912
01:17:44,378 --> 01:17:48,064
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea,
but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

913
01:17:48,383 --> 01:17:51,114
It might be too strong for you.

914
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:52,513
Ah...

915
01:17:52,722 --> 01:17:58,729
You know, of all
the Southern idioms and charms,

916
01:17:59,146 --> 01:18:02,833
you know which one
I find the most helpful?

917
01:18:03,152 --> 01:18:04,836
My extraordinary hospitality?

918
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:10,282
The fact that nobody
ever throws anything away.

919
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:14,211
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

920
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:19,988
There was nothing in any database
that ever connected you to them.

921
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,144
Wasn't no computer
files back in the day.

922
01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:28,239
Another perk of Alabama
being behind the times.

923
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:30,167
Paper trail easy as hell
to get rid of.

924
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:33,838
Only thing this proves is that
a young deputy was doing his job.

925
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:37,631
Right, right, right.
Well, I figured you'd say that,

926
01:18:37,903 --> 01:18:43,706
so I did a little further digging,
and I found this.

927
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,723
You missed some paper, Henry.

928
01:18:46,915 --> 01:18:51,364
You signed for $1,200 dollars
on May 26th, '05,

929
01:18:51,712 --> 01:18:53,953
$800 June 15th, '07

930
01:18:54,215 --> 01:18:56,696
$1,100 on February 3rd, '08.

931
01:18:56,969 --> 01:18:58,971
And it goes on and on and on.

932
01:18:59,221 --> 01:19:02,191
That money was issued
for crime scene clean up.

933
01:19:02,475 --> 01:19:05,764
And I can hire anybody
I damn well please.

934
01:19:06,063 --> 01:19:09,670
Well, since when do people get paid
to clean up a crime before it happens?

935
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:16,500
You are right though, Sheriff.

936
01:19:16,743 --> 01:19:19,428
You've got the lowest
crime rate in the state.

937
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,261
You certainly weren't paying
them much though, were you?

938
01:19:24,545 --> 01:19:27,276
It's no wonder
those dogs turned on you.

939
01:19:29,509 --> 01:19:33,754
Now, listen. This story,
you know, could end one of two ways.

940
01:19:34,098 --> 01:19:36,544
You could either help me out,
cooperate...

941
01:19:37,894 --> 01:19:40,101
...or I could just arrest you
on the spot.

942
01:19:40,355 --> 01:19:43,519
Take them down myself, eventually.

943
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:45,628
Look, either way,
I've got to take you to prison,

944
01:19:45,863 --> 01:19:51,587
but you play nice, I'll see to it
that your sentence is shortened.

945
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:55,239
Maybe one day you'll be able to see your
granddaughter graduate from high school.

946
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:11,755
Let's consider it
a professional courtesy.

947
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:15,934
They get big quick on you.

948
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:19,769
You'll find that out sooner or later.

949
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:29,068
- Come with me.
- No, no, no. Come on.

950
01:20:29,334 --> 01:20:31,541
- I don't think so.
- Cut that shit out.

951
01:20:31,795 --> 01:20:34,036
Fighting's a young man's game.

952
01:20:37,844 --> 01:20:41,735
- Where are you going, huh?
- Vicksburg.

953
01:20:42,057 --> 01:20:45,345
If anybody's gonna put an end to this,
it's going to be me.

954
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,660
You know, I'm the one that ain't
supposed to be trusting you.

955
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:53,071
Y'all won the damn war.

956
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:05,340
Now this is the same face paint
that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

957
01:21:07,005 --> 01:21:09,770
Solidifies you as one of us.

958
01:21:15,516 --> 01:21:17,245
You scared?

959
01:21:18,895 --> 01:21:22,184
You're an Oodie now.
You got to swallow that fear.

960
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:31,893
For what it's worth,

961
01:21:32,162 --> 01:21:35,530
I think you deserve more
than what you've been through.

962
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:38,904
It ain't right,
people taking advantage of you

963
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:42,015
just because you can't help yourself.

964
01:21:44,552 --> 01:21:48,602
I know you may not have had a lot of
people in your life you can look up to.

965
01:21:50,476 --> 01:21:54,686
Hell, I ain't telling you
to look up to us.

966
01:21:58,777 --> 01:22:02,499
I just want you to know that we're
going to do everything we can

967
01:22:02,825 --> 01:22:04,156
to keep you from getting hurt.

968
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:15,776
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

969
01:22:17,218 --> 01:22:18,902
My new lookout.

970
01:22:25,352 --> 01:22:27,276
You've been promoted.

971
01:22:47,464 --> 01:22:48,545
Hm.

972
01:22:50,926 --> 01:22:52,530
Empty-

973
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:07,553
- That ain't much.
- It's gonna have to do.

974
01:23:15,498 --> 01:23:17,102
Lincoln don't look so good.

975
01:23:19,962 --> 01:23:22,045
Yeah, he's been better.

976
01:23:24,176 --> 01:23:26,065
Hey.

977
01:23:26,303 --> 01:23:30,628
You think she's gonna come
and see this thing through?

978
01:23:30,976 --> 01:23:32,740
Or is she just gonna run
for the hills?

979
01:23:33,938 --> 01:23:36,305
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

980
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:39,331
Yeah.

981
01:23:45,369 --> 01:23:50,137
Why you reckon God
would make someone like him?

982
01:23:52,503 --> 01:23:53,993
What?

983
01:23:55,006 --> 01:23:58,489
Why would God let something
be wrong with him like that?

984
01:24:04,517 --> 01:24:08,489
I don't know. Hell, man, I don't know.

985
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:15,425
Hell, why you asking me that, man?

986
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:20,189
I don't know.
Just been thinking about it.

987
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:26,375
I don't ask
why God made men like him.

988
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:31,741
I wonder why he made men like us.

989
01:25:06,553 --> 01:25:07,793
How are the boys?

990
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:13,968
All right.

991
01:25:16,357 --> 01:25:18,121
- Hey, Brick?
- Hm?

992
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:21,496
I'm starting to think we should
have finished school.

993
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:25,940
At least junior high.

994
01:25:46,936 --> 01:25:49,258
It's almost over, bud.

995
01:26:11,175 --> 01:26:13,462
- Oh, shit!
- McQueen!

996
01:26:16,849 --> 01:26:19,056
A fucking arrow, man? Fuck!

997
01:26:33,035 --> 01:26:34,561
Come on!

998
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,617
Go!

999
01:26:40,878 --> 01:26:42,209
Move your ass, woman!

1000
01:26:51,893 --> 01:26:53,816
- Shit.
- Where's Rob, Brick?

1001
01:26:54,062 --> 01:26:55,552
He's safe!

1002
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:00,429
Stay right here.
I've gotta go get some ammo.

1003
01:27:00,654 --> 01:27:01,655
- No! I'm going with you.
- Stay here!

1004
01:27:01,864 --> 01:27:04,151
- I'm going with you!
- Fuck!

1005
01:27:04,742 --> 01:27:06,153
- Come on, man!
- Go!

1006
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:17,572
- Grab a gun. Fuck.
- Take me to fucking Rob!

1007
01:27:17,883 --> 01:27:19,249
You're keeping your ass here!

1008
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,121
That was a fucking arrow, man!

1009
01:27:26,685 --> 01:27:28,814
Brick!

1010
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:35,822
Brick!

1011
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:39,001
Time out, motherfucker!
This ain't fun no more! Stop!

1012
01:27:40,286 --> 01:27:43,415
Fuck me! Oh, shit.

1013
01:28:05,526 --> 01:28:06,732
I told you to fucking stay here!

1014
01:28:06,944 --> 01:28:08,025
You're really gonna say
I told you so right now?

1015
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:09,603
You mind yourself, woman!

1016
01:28:09,823 --> 01:28:12,110
Shit!

1017
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,634
God!

1018
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:27,705
- Don't fucking move!
- Come out, come out.

1019
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,576
What you gonna do with that, huh?

1020
01:28:33,895 --> 01:28:35,863
- McQueen!
- Hey!

1021
01:28:36,105 --> 01:28:37,345
Hey! Hey!

1022
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:58,250
You're about to have
a bad day, John Redcorn.

1023
01:29:10,273 --> 01:29:12,241
Remind me again who's
gonna have a bad day?

1024
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:41,229
Ain't that a sight.

1025
01:30:35,295 --> 01:30:39,539
So, uh... you and your brothers
kidnapped the kid from, uh...

1026
01:30:39,884 --> 01:30:42,729
...from Ms Martin, and you were
planning on holding him for ransom?

1027
01:30:43,013 --> 01:30:46,938
- Yeah? All right.
- That's what I said.

1028
01:30:47,268 --> 01:30:50,796
And what about these other men here?
Who are they? Huh?

1029
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:53,356
Hm?

1030
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:59,519
- Oh...
- All right. All right.

1031
01:30:59,826 --> 01:31:02,272
You'll have plenty of time to think
about your answers in prison. Yeah?

1032
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:15,436
- Agent Reese?
- Special Agent Simmons! Hey!

1033
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,769
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1034
01:31:18,016 --> 01:31:20,826
I'm very impressed
with how you navigated these waters.

1035
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:23,582
I'm putting in a request to have
you take over this territory.

1036
01:31:23,855 --> 01:31:26,177
- No, no, no, no, sir...
- Don't worry about the details.

1037
01:31:26,443 --> 01:31:29,287
We'll get everything handled. Cover
the moving expenses and everything.

1038
01:31:29,571 --> 01:31:31,573
- But my wife...
- It's a fine place to raise a family.

1039
01:31:31,824 --> 01:31:34,430
- Sir... I...
- I'm sure she'll love it.

1040
01:31:35,746 --> 01:31:38,636
Oh... fuck me.

1041
01:31:40,293 --> 01:31:42,022
Hey! Fuck me!

1042
01:31:47,343 --> 01:31:49,152
Hey, bud!

1043
01:31:50,055 --> 01:31:53,663
I just wanted to say thank you.
I'm sorry it came down to all this.

1044
01:31:53,977 --> 01:31:56,708
Don't mention it.

1045
01:31:58,148 --> 01:32:00,913
Just make sure
you take care of this little guy.

1046
01:32:02,195 --> 01:32:04,324
He's one tough cuss.

1047
01:32:07,744 --> 01:32:10,224
Sorry we didn't get the fucker.

1048
01:32:10,497 --> 01:32:12,865
That's all right.
Carlos will get his.

1049
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:22,456
Hey, man, you think I could have
a minute? I ain't going nowhere.

1050
01:32:22,846 --> 01:32:24,530
All right.

1051
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:29,638
Hey, stop that.

1052
01:32:34,026 --> 01:32:36,267
You're an Oodie now.

1053
01:32:38,782 --> 01:32:42,151
Make sure this shit
didn't go down for nothing.

1054
01:32:42,454 --> 01:32:44,456
Yeah.

1055
01:32:49,296 --> 01:32:51,344
Thank you.

1056
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:58,179
Well, ain't that some E.T. shit?

1057
01:33:01,352 --> 01:33:03,798
You know Brick's gay, right?

1058
01:33:05,523 --> 01:33:07,970
See ya, Rob.

1059
01:33:18,999 --> 01:33:21,650
The hits just keep on coming.

1060
01:33:29,929 --> 01:33:32,580
No matter how this thing plays out...

1061
01:33:35,353 --> 01:33:37,355
...I'm proud of you boys.

1062
01:33:47,242 --> 01:33:51,213
You busy? Goddamn it!

1063
01:33:51,622 --> 01:33:54,513
Is there anything I can get you?

1064
01:33:58,381 --> 01:34:01,192
- What?
- I have a package for Carlos Lyman.
