You know, B-flat. B-flat.

00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,775
Yeah. Not too slow.

00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,149
Go.

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,455
I think it's seen
just as a hobby of mine.

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,120
Some people want to come,
and others don't.

6
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,560
Millions and millions of people

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,825
don't have the slightest
interest in this music,

8
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,993
whether it's played by me
or Sidney Bechet or anyone else.

[New Orleans jazz playing]

10
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,815
I never liked that dog.

11
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,382
I don't like dogs,

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,624
but even amongst dogs,
that dog I especially hate.

13
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,093
'Cause it's wild...

14
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,137
You feed it and walk it,

15
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,764
but there's no return.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,105
I'm always afraid
that the dog will lick me.

17
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,008
[Soon Yi]: She french-kissed
a friend of mine.

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,604
He was talking and she put
her tongue in his mouth. Yes.

19
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:25,082
- Do you know
that it is a medical fact

20
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,813
that dogs' mouths
are cleaner than people's?

21
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,253
[Woody]: I would rather
be bitten by the dog

22
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,985
than licked by it. I mean it.
- I can arrange that.

23
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,118
- I would rather
the dog bit me than...

24
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,720
- But I'm telling you that's true.

25
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,322
Dogs' mouths
are cleaner than humans'.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,129
- Yeah...
- It's the truth.

27
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,965
It actually is.
- It's disgusting.

Let me know
when we arrive in Paris.

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,075
- Hold on one second.
- Well, if you don't make noise

31
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,910
and keep the dogs away from me,
maybe I can get some sleep.

32
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,813
- Hold up one second.
You're on my coat.

33
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,681
- Our goal
is to see that you sleep.

34
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,249
G'night, baby.

35
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,290
- I don't want to be bothered.

36
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,431
- Croissants.

[Woody]: Get those buns
away from that mutt.

38
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,174
I never eat
at 4:30 in the morning.

39
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,111
I'm always unconscious.
- It's 1 0 after 5:00.

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,512
- Ten after 5:00?
I should be on the treadmill.

41
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,158
[Soon Yi]: The next morning,
we should leave at 1 1 :00.

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,260
Don't you think?
- If we leave at 1 1 :00,

43
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,194
when am I going
to do my underwear?

44
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,960
[laughter]

45
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,127
Well, you know,
the tour started off

46
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,330
just me and the banjo player

47
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,272
saying what a nice idea
it would be

48
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,300
to play a couple of places
in Europe just for fun.

49
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,813
And then, you know,

50
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,712
two weeks later,

51
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,877
this arduous tour was set.

52
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,786
- I think once you start playing...
- Yeah.

53
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,155
- The actual act of playing is fun,

54
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,559
but we're all, you know,
leaving home,

55
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,723
then I'm going to places
that I've never gone to in my life.

56
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,202
- You're only going overnight.
- Yeah... Well...

57
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,898
You know, in New York,

58
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,170
you know, I can live my life

59
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:35,112
just going from my house
to where I make films,

60
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,706
to the theatre,
to the movies,

61
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,618
to Madison Square Gardens,
to you know, just to...

62
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,280
And I don't need...

63
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,517
I never feel a sense

64
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:51,121
that I have to get away
on the weekend or anything.

65
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,291
In fact,
it would be a punishment to me.

66
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,698
If someone, you know,

67
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,532
one of those times
when I've had to,

68
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,063
for one reason or another,
go away on the weekend,

69
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,904
you know, I count the minutes.

70
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,737
Paris...

71
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,681
doesn't have
the excitement of New York.

72
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,617
On the other hand,
it's more beautiful.

73
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,449
[humming]

74
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,529
And I love the weather in Paris,
because I don't like sun,

75
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:30,467
and Paris has great gray weather
almost all the time.

76
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,231
Soft light.
It's really beautiful.

77
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,836
So I'm always very happy
walking the streets of Paris,

78
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,277
'cause, you know,

79
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,783
I like the idea
that you can do things late at night.

80
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,443
The funny part of it is,

81
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,455
in New York,
I don't keep late hours at all.

82
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:57,429
But I like to know
that if it's 3:30 or 4:00 in the morning

83
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:02,560
and I want a bowl
of duck-wonton soup, I can get it.

84
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,262
Now, I don't get it,

85
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:08,535
because who needs that
at 4:00 in the morning?

I practice every day
of my life, just about,

89
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,789
because I couldn't play at Michael's Pub
every Monday night,

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,557
even at the level I play,
I couldn't do that without practicing.

91
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,621
I mean, my lip wouldn't hold out,

92
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,429
I wouldn't be able
to play anything at all.

93
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,504
They may like the novelty

94
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,772
for the first 1 5-20 minutes,

95
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,076
then, as an hour goes by,

96
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,549
and they're hearing
New Orleans jazz, I mean...

97
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,587
- But they're coming
to hear that.

98
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,087
You know,

99
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,124
so there'll be
a certain enthusiasm.

100
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,494
- A big problem is that...

101
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:42,091
that I'm not a sufficient-enough
musician to hold their interest.

102
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,068
If you have a concert

103
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,039
and have a real artist out there
who can play...

104
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,009
If this was, you know,
Sidney Bechet or John Coltrane

105
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,568
or somebody that can...

106
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,946
then, just to hear them play,
you don't need anything else.

107
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,713
They're endlessly
creative and great.

108
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:04,883
But, you know,
that doesn't obtain here.

109
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,720
You know, this has...

110
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,990
this has a different quality to it.

111
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,657
- So every country we go to,
that you only do one show,

112
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,792
you see it as the closing?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,028
- It makes no sense.

114
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,072
- You see it as the opening?
- Yes. Tonight's the opening.

00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,438
- You know, I'm sure there's something
we're going to find out.

116
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,601
Unless it's nothing,

117
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:28,477
unless it's the same thing
we do at Michael's Pub,

118
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,312
you know,
we're not gonna bore them.

119
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,547
Just say hello
and a couple of lines,

120
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,418
and then get on to the playing.

121
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,086
You know, at some point,
maybe introduce the musicians.

122
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,628
[Letty]: That's it?

123
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,090
- Yeah. That's more than it.

124
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,690
That's the maximum.

125
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,670
- D'you have a good trip?
- Oh, yeah. It was a breeze.

126
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,501
I went over to Paris first,

127
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,441
just 'cause I had to get
one night of sleep,

128
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,444
you know, to get over it.

129
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,710
And Paris is the only place
outside of New York that I can survive.

130
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,647
You know what I mean?

131
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,048
I can't come
right to another country.

132
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,382
I have to go to Paris,
then I know I'm in Europe.

133
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,513
- Really? You like it?
- Then I can go from there.

134
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,084
And they built it...
exact replica of my $1 2 Ramponi.

135
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,188
I told them I only wanted
two keys here, no more.

136
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:24,726
- It's amazing. It looks
like an old one, but it's brand-new.

137
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,999
- I didn't want
any extra weight on it.

138
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,133
- When you guys sit down,
just start into a blues in C.

139
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,575
- Then we just go,
play whatever we want,

140
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,341
take it like we're playing at Michael's.
- All right.

141
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,439
- How many people
are out there?

142
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,576
What's the capacity
of this room?

143
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,516
- It's... I don't know.

144
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,020
- I think they said, like, 1,700.
- 1,800.

145
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,954
- That's hilarious.

146
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,061
Yeah. Theoretically,

147
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,757
this should be fun for us.
[laughter]

148
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:58,236
You know? It should not have
a sense of obligation, or... or...

149
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:02,365
You know, we should
just have a good time.

150
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,274
- Yeah.
- It should be our pleasure.

151
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,902
[applause]

152
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,352
Uh, we want
to say hello to you,

153
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,692
and I don't know
if you can understand me,

154
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,426
I can't speak any, uh, Spanish...

155
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,069
'cause I didn't pay attention
in school years ago.

156
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,437
[laughter]

157
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:41,906
The, uh... we're very honoured
to be playing here in Madrid.

158
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,380
Uh, and, uh...

159
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,146
I think we're gonna
play for you tonight

160
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,916
the music of New Orleans.

161
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,423
It's, uh....

162
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,426
it's the original
birthplace of jazz,

163
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,826
as you undoubtedly know,

164
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,424
and, it's, um, very primitive music.

165
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,166
And, uh, it will be composed
mostly of blues

166
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,367
and ragtime and dance music

167
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,934
and, uh, parade music,

168
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,243
so, you know,
if you sit back and relax,

169
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:21,378
and we'll do our best
for the next hour and a half or so,

170
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,685
and sing some songs for you
and play music,

171
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,952
and thank you all for coming.

172
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,459
[applause]

173
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,995
- It's sort of like
an ancient dialect of jazz.

174
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,224
It's not something
you can find anymore.

175
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,462
It's hard enough to find
any kind of old jazz.

176
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,902
This type is non-existent,
even in New Orleans,

177
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,600
where it originated,
it doesn't exist anywhere.

178
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,110
- What we're trying to achieve
is crude,

179
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,475
and makes the word "crude"
a very acceptable term.

180
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,811
We like it. Most people think
of crude and go "ugh,"

181
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,647
but crude is the term
that should be used,

182
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,847
but it should be used
in a very favorable light.

183
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,344
- When I was a teenager,
I heard some New Orleans jazz

184
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,448
and became completely
obsessed by it.

185
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,790
So much so that I ran out
and bought an instrument

186
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,488
and learned to play it.

187
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,078
There's nothing between you
and the pure feeling of the playing.

188
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,951
There's no cerebral element
to it at all.

189
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,643
There's something
about New Orleans jazz

190
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,980
that just rings a bell in me
for some inexplicable reason.

191
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,821
It's like taking a bath
in honey or something.

192
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,667
[applause]

193
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,203
What do we do,
we're playing New Orleans jazz.

194
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,711
There's very little interest in that
even in its country of origin.

195
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,110
And they're...

196
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,239
they're loving it.

197
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,285
I mean, the problem was
getting off and out of there.

198
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,411
I mean, that should be
our biggest problem.

199
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,087
We'll be very curious to see

200
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,429
if that reaction is the same
with the Swiss or the Germans.

201
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,762
Oh, yes, come in.

202
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,201
[Soon Yi]: Do you have the tip?
- Yeah, I have it.

203
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,411
Here, guys.
- Thank you.

204
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:49,853
- Okay. I have to get
my multivitamin,

205
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,117
baby aspirin, antibiotic...

206
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,091
- Okay. Is this you or me?

207
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,456
- That's the Spanish omelet.

208
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,495
- Oh. How appropriate.

209
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,764
Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

210
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,500
[Soon Yi laughing]

211
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,069
- Just our normal
average breakfast.

212
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,945
The shower was excellent,
wasn't it?

213
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,957
- Yes. Great pressure.

214
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,993
The problem is...

215
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,759
that it comes down
over the drain.

216
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,423
- Right.
- The drain's not in the corner.

217
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,592
- Uh-huh.

218
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,296
- So you have to stand
close to the drain,

219
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,272
so if you put a mat in there...
- Is that what you did?

220
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,107
- Yeah, 'cause I can't stand
on plain marble.

221
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,945
You have to put it over the drain
and then the water doesn't drain.

222
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,644
- Right.

223
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,620
- Um, the question is--
- Can I just see your omelet?

224
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,954
- You don't like yours?
- No. Can I switch?

225
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,425
It's, you know--
- Can I have the cover? Oh.

226
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,933
- It's very hard.
It's like eating a rock.

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,731
And it's very heavy.
- Why'd you give it to me?

228
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,398
[Soon Yi laughing]
- I won't have any breakfast!

229
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,838
You might like it.

230
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:20,436
- Um, the question is,
should we do the same...

231
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,003
all the same tunes tonight,

232
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:27,610
'cause the running order
of them is so effective.

233
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,285
My impulse is not to.
- No, I wouldn't.

234
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,091
It'll get boring.
Especially for us.

235
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,427
- Yeah.

236
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,296
Yeah, probably get boring for us.

237
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,099
Then it becomes a show, I guess,
and then it's no fun anymore.

238
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,231
- Right. The crowd outside
was hilarious.

239
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,833
It's, like, for a rock concert,

240
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,242
but you were an older guy.

241
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,871
- Yeah. That's great.
[chuckling]

242
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,917
[cheering]

243
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,849
That's right,

244
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,050
I'm a...

245
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,060
a much-beloved older figure.

246
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,096
- That's right.

247
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:15,065
- You see, I think your mistake
was ordering a Spanish omelet

248
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,068
just 'cause you're in Spain.

249
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,764
[laughing]
- I thought that was appropriate.

250
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,602
- It's, like, vulcanized
or something.

251
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,244
- Right. It's like lead.
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,009
Well, bad break for me
that you ordered it.

253
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,577
- You couldn't have asked
for a better night than last night.

254
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,916
- I know.

255
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,015
Uh, the band was very good.

256
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,529
- You should tell the band
they were very good last night,

257
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,429
and not only speak
to Eddy Davis.

258
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,697
You know, like yesterday,
in the... backstage--

259
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,638
- Mm-hmm.
- --you were talking only to Eddy Davis,

260
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:59,143
and he was the intermediary,
and then spoke,

261
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,771
relayed the message to the band

262
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,873
when you're in the room
with everyone.

263
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,043
You look like a crazy.

264
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,212
[Woody laughing]
- All right.

265
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,418
- You should tell them all
that they were very good.

266
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,084
- I did. I mean, I think I did.

267
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,722
- You should just make sure,
'cause it's nice to hear it.

268
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,231
A compliment is always nice.

269
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,997
- Well, I think I did tell them
they were good. I hope I did.

270
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,767
- Right. 'Cause you tend
to latch on to one person.

271
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,537
- Remember, Eddy put
this whole thing together.

272
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,704
He knows all the guys
in the band.

273
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,906
He hired them.

274
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,471
- Right. I was relieved

275
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,747
you got the names down
of the band.

276
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,190
- I mean, some of the guys I know,
so I know their names, but, uh...

277
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,887
a couple of them
I didn't know,

278
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,989
and I had to read
the booklet of the tour.

279
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,873
- You had a great night.
- Had a good reed.

280
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,533
We sounded great last night.

281
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,204
We really sounded
like one of those bands.

282
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,509
I don't think Preservation Hall
would've done any better.

283
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,515
- No, definitely not.
- You know what I mean?

284
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,517
- Not with the guys
they got nowadays.

285
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,553
- Like we knew
what we were doing.

286
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,589
- We liked the way
you handled the audience

287
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,385
and spoke like that
three different times.

288
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,292
- Well, I will speak to them,
'cause they expect to be spoken to.

289
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,557
Otherwise, I'd prefer not to, but, uh--

290
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,826
- Yeah, they showed
you speaking on television.

291
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,458
- And you remembered
everybody's names.

292
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,730
What's that about?
- I got them figured out.

293
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,361
That was easy.
- Very impressed

294
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,668
- And the tunes.
- The tunes, that's right.

295
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,436
[applause]

296
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,842
- Merci beaucoup.

297
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,913
Je vais presenter
le orchestra.

298
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,754
Ah, the trombone is Dan Barrett.

299
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,293
[applause]

300
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,765
And trumpet is Simon Wettenhall.

301
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,303
[applause]

302
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,777
On drums, John Gill.

303
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,312
[applause]

304
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,453
The bass is Greg Cohn.

305
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,988
[applause]

306
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,794
Our beautiful piano player
is Cynthia Sayer.

307
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,332
[applause]

308
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,239
And the banjoist,

309
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,143
and the director, is Eddy Davis.

310
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,680
[applause]

311
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,167
- Where'd I get that?

312
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,801
When this music started,
it was not unlike rock 'n' roll.

313
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,539
It was a new form
of earthy music that was pop,

314
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,309
and everybody was having
a good time and it was fun.

315
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,576
So, really, I would prefer

316
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,118
to link the revival
and these early musicians

317
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,247
with rock 'n' roll and whatever else
is a pop form of music.

318
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,485
I like it as a pop form.

319
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,221
I like to express myself,
I like to have a good time.

320
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,039
The Near North Side of Chicago

321
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,600
is where a nightclub
called Mr. Kelly's was.

322
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,511
And they would bring in
Barbra Streisand, Trini Lopez,

323
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,446
and Woody Allen
would come there.

324
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,111
Woody Allen was just a young
stand-up comedian at the time.

325
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,381
The next thing I know,

326
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:40,551
Woody's agent is coming down
saying, can he sit in with the band?

327
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,458
That would've been probably
in the very early '60s,

328
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,961
and I became aware

329
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,498
that he was very serious
as a clarinetist.

330
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,289
[applause]

331
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,753
[Woody]: Tonight's going
to be a different concert.

332
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,132
You know, we're relying
a little too much on...

333
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,931
[Letty]: Crowd-pleasers.
- Crowd-pleasers, yeah.

334
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,436
- But remember,

335
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,339
a certain percentage of the people
who are coming to see you

336
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,934
are seeing you not
because of your music,

337
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,945
but because
you're in the movies,

338
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:39,040
so therefore,
they want to be entertained.

339
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:43,918
- We're gonna play hard-core
New Orleans music,

340
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,786
esoteric tunes and--

341
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,792
[Soon Yi]: You don't want them
to get up and leave, do you?

342
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,794
[Letty]: I think
there'll be no encore tonight.

343
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,126
[Soon Yii]: I know. I think
we should stay home.

344
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm bringing my book
tonight, right?

345
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,467
- I think they're coming
to see you play the lead,

346
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,632
you know, and move your clarinet
up and down. They like that.

347
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:07,201
- Your leg bopping op and down,
your head shaking, all of that.

348
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,746
- When you lean forward--

349
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,783
- But that I'm doing legitimately.

350
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,842
That I'm not putting on.

351
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,185
- You know when she came
to Michael's Pub to see you play?

352
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,417
That's the most movement
she's seen from you

353
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,426
from the whole time
she's known you.

354
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,155
- The most movement?
- Yeah.

355
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,754
- Really?
- Yep. That's what she said.

356
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,527
- What does she expect?

357
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,593
I'm not gonna bop my head
and tap my feet

358
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:36,266
when I'm talking about politics
or literature or something.

359
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,835
I'm not gonna, you know,
keep time and...

360
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,970
Right?
- Yes.

361
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,674
- I mean, be reasonable.

362
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,443
- No, you can--

363
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,918
- I'm appropriately animated
for a human

364
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,388
in the context
within which I exist.

365
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,124
- You ready?

366
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,562
- You know the trouble
in all the countries.

367
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,657
They only have trouble
in some of the countries.

368
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,827
We're not in those countries.
- We'll show them around.

369
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,495
- You're afraid
I'll be kidnapped by terrorists?

370
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,301
- Where should we start?
- Uh, this is the living room.

371
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,569
Franz Josef used to bring
his dates here.

372
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,405
This is where we sleep.

373
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,743
- The humble bedroom.

374
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,785
- Yeah. It's a cozy little bedroom.

375
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,811
If the ceilings were
just a little higher,

376
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,858
it would be perfect.

377
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,018
Now, whenever I travel,

378
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:34,088
I always have to have
my own bathroom,

379
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,427
because I'm crazy.

380
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,936
So I always wind up
taking an extra room,

381
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,598
or an extra suite of rooms,

382
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:45,837
and it gives me
my own bathroom in there,

383
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:50,075
and I can place all my unctions
and vanishing creams

384
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,379
and cosmetics
that give me this look.

385
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,282
- Do you want to speak
to your mother?

386
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,821
- Okay, hold on.

387
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,424
- Hello?

388
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,892
Okay.

389
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,588
- Can I have a stiff drink?

390
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,221
- I'm fine.

391
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,766
Yeah. Yeah.
This is very easy.

392
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,737
Yeah, it's very easy.

393
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,137
It's easy. It's easy.
It's no problem.

394
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,607
It's no physical
problem at all. No.

395
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,872
- You can talk to Daddy, too.

396
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,574
- Yeah, you should talk
to your father.

397
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,115
- Is Daddy there?

398
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,248
He's in the lobby.
[laughing]

399
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,524
He was in the lobby yesterday
and a couple came in

400
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,257
and went to their apartment
on the 27th floor and he went with them.

401
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,764
- Omigod!
[laughter]

402
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,767
- Well, did they let him in,
or did they...?

403
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,132
[laughter]

404
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,336
Oh.

405
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,465
- He's 96. We can't expect more.

406
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,134
- I have to go.

407
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,113
Okay.

408
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,478
Goodbye.

409
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,545
Oh...

410
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,177
It's grueling.
- I know.

411
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,015
I did think
there was something mysterious

412
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,151
when they announced
our concert here

413
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,390
and then the theatre
burned down a month later.

414
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,431
[laughter]

415
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,595
I thought they were trying
to tell me something.

416
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,769
- Here'll be some waves.

417
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,779
Oh, not bad.

418
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,788
- I'll be all right.

419
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,965
I'll just get to the hotel
and lie down for a while.

420
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,200
I'll see Venice
maybe next time.

421
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,907
No, I like it.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,877
- Because it's like heading
into the midtown area, you know?

423
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,915
I could sing, if you like.
[Soon Yi laughing]

424
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,985
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

425
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,650
- Uh, excuse me.
Please, wait. Thank you.

426
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,192
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

427
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,352
- Okay?
- All right.

428
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,794
- So you can have this bathroom.
- Right. Thank you.

429
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,491
And I'm gonna have
the one in the other room.

430
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,729
You know, the other room
may have a double bed in it.

431
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,895
- Oh, really?

432
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,336
Yeah. Then I won't slide
into the cracks.

433
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,897
Oh, is it two beds?
- It's two beds.

434
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,840
- Two beds pushed together, right?
- Yeah.

435
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,074
- Hmm. It's a concept
they haven't gotten used to here.

436
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,607
And now, a ritual
as old as the city itself:

437
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,779
I give out my laundry.
- Okay.

438
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:47,450
- I give them specific instructions
so they know what to violate.

439
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,959
- Here. You can just
write it on this.

440
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:50,926
- Oh, okay. Yes.

441
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,553
Uh, my name, no starch,

442
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,464
and do we want it back
with holes in it or, uh...

443
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,095
or do you want it
the way we send it in?

444
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,196
- Remember,
you're not signing an autograph.

445
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,707
- All right, I'll write it more clearly.

446
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,710
- Is it this one or this one?

447
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,269
- No, no. That's the dusting lady.
That's the maid.

448
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,542
Yeah, those little drawings
are confusing, you know?

449
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:15,575
The one with the knife in her hand
is the one not to press.

450
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,945
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

451
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,819
Thank you so much.

452
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,088
We have to be careful.
The mayor has many enemies.

453
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,658
We'll go to the Fenice
and look at it.

454
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:34,435
We were gonna play there.
We were gonna open there.

455
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,241
I know. I know.

456
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,537
Uh, before it burned down,

457
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,909
it was, you know,
a great work of art.

458
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,548
[Soon Yi]: Omigod.

459
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,418
There's just nothing.

460
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,185
- It's... it's a complete...

461
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,590
complete annihilation.

462
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,628
[mayor speaking ltalian]

463
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:03,623
- You have this every day, right?
- You have to please the...

464
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,293
[reporters speaking ltalian]

465
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,596
- Ah, it's incredible.

466
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,937
I couldn't believe
the devastation in there.

467
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,171
I was amazed.
I knew it was a catastrophe,

468
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,908
but you're not prepared
for anything like that.

469
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,494
I don't really understand
why they're all after me.

470
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,761
It's the same photo, no?

471
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,029
The same?
- It's all the same.

472
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,470
- Yeah, I know.
It's so funny, it's the same, uh...

473
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,438
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Thank you for the book.

474
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,949
I look forward to reading it,
and it's a pleasure to meet you.

475
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,212
And I'll see you this evening.
- Yes, yes. This evening.

476
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,049
- Thank you very much.
I'll see you tonight.

477
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,452
- Thank you.
I'll see you later.

478
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,354
- This is a great way
to achieve maximum tension -

479
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,452
going out in a gondola.

480
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,962
You know?

481
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,999
Your knuckles are white...

482
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,329
The heartbeat is raised...

483
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,170
Ah, they look
like they're having fun.

484
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,173
- Uh-huh.
- I see.

485
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,540
- That's what we look like.
- I see. Oh.

486
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,602
If that's what we look like,

487
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,204
we should get our money back.

488
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,547
It's quiet back here, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,451
- The gondolier could cut our throats
and no one would know.

490
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,925
[footsteps overhead]

491
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,928
Thought I heard footsteps
on the bridge.

492
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,089
[water rippling]

493
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,723
What's that?
- That's a frog.

494
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,030
- A frog?
- It sounds like a frog.

495
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:22,971
It's not a frog. It can't be.
But it does sound like one, doesn't it?

496
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,110
- Yeah.
Maybe it's a special Venetian frog.

497
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,616
- Mm-hmm.
- Made of glass.

498
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,653
Ah... Venice!

499
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,786
My God.

500
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,449
[chuckling]

501
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,790
Yes, you're right. It's me.

502
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,455
It's me. You've seen me
in those films. I'm the guy.

503
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,364
Just try not to throw
the cameras.

504
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,492
- Eh! Woody!
- Woody!

505
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,162
- Oh, hi, fellas.
Don't get too excited.

506
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,865
I come here
a few times a year.

507
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,840
Hey, guys. Yes.

508
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,270
Hi, fellas.
[nervous chuckling]

509
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,182
They won't pay 1 0 cents
to see one of my movies,

510
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,344
but passing on the gondola,
they love it.

511
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,252
- Oh, there's the guy again.
[camera clicking]

512
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,586
- Ah...

513
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,923
we're gonna have
to teach him a lesson.

514
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,929
- What are you gonna do?

515
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,965
- Knock his fucking teeth out.

516
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,470
- I'll just go right inside.

517
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,771
[speaking ltalian]

518
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,778
- Tonight... tonight is okay.

519
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,781
Tonight is okay.
But not now. No more.

520
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,113
- Is for me. For me.
- Okay. Okay.

521
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,651
- Thank you.

522
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,354
[bells tolling]

523
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,225
[Woman]: Why are you here?

524
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,664
- Because I think
he plays so-and-so.

525
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,430
I want to be sure
he plays better than...

526
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,234
I don't think so well.
I don't think so well.

527
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,070
But I want to...

528
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,738
to feel
that he is better than I think.

529
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,576
I'm very...
[speaking ltalian]

530
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,741
- Suspicious.

531
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,911
- I'm very suspicious.
That's right.

532
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,955
And, Woody, be careful.
Play well, huh?

533
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,382
- The evening's performance
is, of course,

534
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,257
dedicated to the Fenice Theatre.

535
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:28,094
The proceeds tonight
are going to help rebuild it.

536
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,793
[applause]

537
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,442
Okay, let's go out there and do it,
because I gotta eat.

538
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,774
You know, I mean,
I can't be eating 1 2:00 midnight.

539
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,643
It's havoc on my stomach.

540
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,689
[Eddy]: This looks
like he's just saying,

541
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,925
"Oh, let's play a tune and go."
That's not true.

542
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,523
It's very well thought out.

543
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,093
He's often said to me,
"That or this won't work now."

544
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,036
He also says, "Well,

545
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,666
"the audience
is maybe liking it a little too well.

546
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,108
Let's see if we can push it
another direction."

547
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,169
So, same as, I think,
in his filming,

548
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,148
he's doing the same thing
out here on the road.

549
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,112
[applause]

550
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,564
[Woody]: Do something
to get them out of here.

551
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,628
Flood the house.
Turn the sprinkler system on.

552
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,841
Ah, perfect.
Food, food!

553
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,571
- I love him!

554
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,040
[man speaking ltalian]

555
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,743
He's wonderful.

556
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,377
- Did he stink?
- I changed my mind.

557
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,047
It was a really pleasing concert.

558
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,954
Very peaceful, very nice,

559
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:18,223
and just like I used
to listen in New Orleans.

560
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,959
Exactly... exactly the same style.

561
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,194
Very, very pleasing -

562
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,237
nice musicians,
wonderful... Yeah.

563
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,704
I didn't believe him.

564
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,640
He was more than my imagination.

565
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,236
[Woody]: lmagine having to tote
that bass around everyplace?

566
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,746
- Yes. Exactly.

567
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,647
- They should've told him
when he was a kid, you know,

568
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,049
flute.

569
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,746
How many people
have we got here?

570
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,753
- A lot.
- Oh, really?

571
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,756
- Yeah.
- Well, how many does the boat take?

572
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,018
- Seventeen.

573
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,925
- Is he going to back up
all the way?

574
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,087
- Huh?

575
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,563
- Is he going to back up
all the way?

576
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,192
- That's the front.
- This is the front?

577
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,360
- Yeah. Turn around.

578
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,960
- Oh.
- You're sitting the wrong way.

579
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,699
- Where's the captain?
- Up there. Higher, so he can see.

580
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,536
- Oh.
- He's up here.

581
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,736
- Oh, I see. I see.
This is the front.

582
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,081
Okay. I see now
why I failed geography.

583
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,393
Ah!

584
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,623
Ah, well, here we are.

585
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,693
Oh, hey, Chester,
I could get used to this.

586
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:31,757
- Check claim?

587
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,031
- I am so glad to see you,

588
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,040
because all my life
I wanted to see you.

589
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,668
- Oh, well, thank you very much.
- Really.

590
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,736
Because you have humour.
You are so intelligent.

591
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,247
- Oh, don't stop. Don't stop.

592
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,749
Keep going.

593
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,911
- You're so intelligent.
- I'd like to help a little here.

594
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,045
- Really.
- Thank you.

595
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,091
Very nice of you.
Thank you so much.

596
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:58,527
You're a Venetian?
- No. I am from Ancona.

597
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:02,999
In the middle...
near the Adriatic Sea.

598
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,831
- So you're here just, uh...

599
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,133
- No. For you. Really!

600
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:11,732
You are so happy
to be so intelligent.

601
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,903
- Yes, it is a burden,
though, sometimes.

602
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,708
- It's a big part...

603
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,443
- You have too much to know.

604
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:24,113
- Yes, with this much intelligence
comes great responsibility.

605
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,679
You know, it's lonely at the top.

606
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,885
Can we eat,
or do we wait for everybody?

607
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,452
- We can't wait for 1 00 people--
- So you just eat.

608
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,998
- I'm eating.

609
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,497
- Mm!!!
- Mm!

610
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,504
- Asparagus.

611
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,634
Starting to fade a little bit.

612
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,646
This guy's got to have
sweets someplace here.

613
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,614
Want to gad about?
- Yeah.

614
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,049
See if we can find, uh...

615
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,519
some chocolate Graham crackers
or something.

616
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,256
There's the band.

617
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:04,351
They're eating like they're going
to the chair. I can't believe it.

618
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,962
Nice leisurely walk
for lunch now.

619
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,939
- Would you like to start
with your usual pasta,

620
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,238
noodles with tomato and scampi?
- Yes.

621
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,541
- And then the sea bass.
- Perfect.

622
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,103
- Your usual one.
- Perfect.

623
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,274
"My usual meal." Mm.

624
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,012
I dream about it sometimes.
- Thank you.

625
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,485
The DGAAward is tonight.

626
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,148
So how do you feel
about them giving you

627
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,987
a lifetime-achievement
kind of thing?

628
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,653
- It's very nice. It's fine.

629
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,856
But, I mean,
you can't delude yourself

630
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:44,128
into thinking that it really has...

631
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:47,329
meaning and that... you know,

632
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:51,170
that your work is, you know...

633
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,470
anything special.

634
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,444
'Cause you can get...
You could, if you wanted to organize,

635
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,879
get a group of people
that would come forward -

636
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,849
if you took the time,
and it wouldn't take much time -

637
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,614
to say, "l don't think we should
give this guy something."

638
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,248
- But when you receive
as many honours as you do,

639
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,521
it does mean that generally
people enjoy your work,

640
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,721
and there are enough
legitimate organizations

641
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,593
that feel it's worth honouring.

642
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:17,498
- They have given one to Kurosawa--
- Maybe it's only American.

643
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,263
- --they have given one to Bergman,

644
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:23,102
but not to Fellini,
and I don't understand that.

645
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,368
I don't want to say anything,

646
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,070
but I can't imagine,
in this lifetime,

647
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:32,639
that I could be eligible
for this thing prior to him.

648
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,581
You know,
when I was a little boy,

649
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:38,179
I remember that Jose Ferrer,
who I liked very much,

650
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,782
won the Academy Award
for Cyrano de Bergerac.

651
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,760
And that was the same year
that Marlon Brando

652
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,126
played Stanley Kowalski
in Streetcar Named Desire.

653
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,928
Now, to me, I was just
an adolescent at the time,

654
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,832
but it was so absurd

655
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,497
that any actor ever
could've been chosen

656
00:42:55,573 --> 00:43:00,135
as giving the best performance
of the year other than Marlon Brando.

657
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,178
It didn't... You know,

658
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,714
I-l-I knew then that, you know,

659
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,773
that it's totally subjective.

660
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,114
- Your work
has a European... affinity.

661
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,919
[Woody]: Only post facto,

662
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,085
because people say to me,

663
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,289
"Why is it that your films
do so well in Europe -

664
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,331
all over Europe -

665
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,128
and not very well
in the United States?"

666
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,432
You know, Steven Spielberg
said that, uh...

667
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:31,099
he likes to make the films
that he liked when he was a kid.

668
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,200
And Sydney Pollack
also told me that.

669
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:37,111
He said, "l like to make the films
that I liked when I was growing up."

670
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,443
And I feel the same way.

671
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,382
I like to make the films
that I liked when I was growing up.

672
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,784
And the films that I liked
when I was growing up

673
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,651
were foreign films,
for the most part.

674
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,762
But in terms
of contributing an art form,

675
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,799
jazz is really it.

676
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:59,302
You know, I was brought up
in, really, the early '40s.

677
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,531
I mean, I would wake up
in the morning,

678
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,403
and while I was dressing,
the radio would be on,

679
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,943
or having dinner,
we listened to the radio,

680
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,172
and what you'd hear
at that time,

681
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,077
as part of your everyday fare,

682
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,979
was Artie Shaw
and Benny Goodman

683
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,244
and Tommy Dorsey and...

684
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,118
You know, turn on the radio,
and Billie Holiday would be singing,

685
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,088
or Louis Armstrong
would be playing,

686
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,092
and that's what
our popular music was.

687
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,787
So for me,

688
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,660
that era was so strong

689
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:32,259
and made
such an impression on me, uh...

690
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,705
that the music that I love
is, for my money,

691
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:40,710
the best period America
has ever had musically.

692
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,211
I think I'm at the apogee of...

693
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,115
this disgusting invention.

694
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,154
- I haven't hit the peak yet.

695
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,293
- I started a moment
before you, and...

696
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,955
I assume this is the peak.

697
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,463
If the peak is any higher,

698
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,727
I'm going to sit down
on the treadmill and...

699
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,362
just let it carry me along.

700
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,241
[playing clarinet]

701
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,743
This is dead as a doornail.

702
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,279
You know?

703
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,909
- This one was made
especially for you.

704
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,417
- This one?
- Yeah.

705
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,978
- I know, but, uh... I'm blowing
my brains out to make it sound good.

706
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,614
[applause]

707
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,039
[blowing harder,
playing more softly]

708
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,945

[Woody]: Down by the Riverside
In "F '."

715
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,410
Down by the Riverside in "F ',"

716
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,450
[band playing]

717
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,943
I'm gonna lay down
my sword and shield

718

Down by the riverside

Down by the riverside
[clapping along]

720
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,445
Down by the riverside

721
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,956
Gonna lay down
my sword and shield

722
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,118
Down by the riverside

723
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,993
I ain't gonna
study war no more

724
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,494
Ain't gonna study
war no more

725
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,471
Ain't gonna
study war no more

726
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,972
Ain't gonna

727

[band playing]

730
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,101
- Whoo!

731
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,542
- More!

732
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,011
[applause]

733
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,139
[applause continues]

734
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,055
Merci beaucoup.
Vous etes tres gentils.

735
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,462
Demain matin, je dois...
je dois vol a Milan.

736
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:53,128
Nous jouons
demain soir a Milan.

737

[audience members

00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,801
Je peux pas
comprendre frrancais.

00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:03,073
Je peux parler,
mais pas comprendre.

[audience members

741
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,247
Oh!

742
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,783
Ah!

743
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,754
Il va avec moi.
[laughter]

744
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,915
Merci encore.

745
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:19,428
C'est un... vraiment, vraiment,
un reve qui est venu vrai.

746
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,758
[applause]

747
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,730
Merci.

748
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,096
[applause continues]

749
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,432
- You picked up a few words,
haven't you?

750
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,833
- Hey, they were good,
weren't they?

751
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,066
[kisses]
- They were.

752
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:35,942
- Let me just put my...
my old man's sweater on.

753
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,572
Look how young I look.
- I know! It's amazing!

754
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,583
- I look like such a dope,
such a goofball.

755
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,709
- Let me see.

756
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,515
Nerd comes to mind.
- That's very cute.

757
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,079
- Yeah, he looks cute.
- I do look like a nerd, yes.

758
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,563
Yes. I'd like to get it...

759
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,796
wide, so when I blow into it,
I don't have that feeling.

760
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,564
So it's completely open.

761
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:06,405
You know, the same openness
as the Selma that I was playing,

762
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:07,738
or the Ramponi.

763
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,335
They're very, very open.

764
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,744
And... and so, I'd like to,

765
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,943
you know,
open it as maximum as I can.

766
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,144
- Maximum, yes.
- Really--

767
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,777
- It's not a problem.

768
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:20,414
[motor whirring]

769
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,684
- Oh, I see.

770
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,952
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

771
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:28,123
- We practice a burrow
inside of the hole.

772
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:33,636
But now, on the new models,
we have very different burrows.

773
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,137
Different... polycylindrique
is the name...

774
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:41,200
- And different burrows
on the lower joint and upper joint.

775
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,745
- Probably things like that

776
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,440
that, um... you know,
Bechet played on,

777
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,177
or, you know,
people of that era.

778
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,809
- That's a very pretty one.

779
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,945
[man speaking French]

780
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,011
- This is amazing.

781
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,557
- C'est pas mauvais, hein?
- Ah, c'est incroyable.

782
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,116
C'est juste....
It's very much in tune.

783
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,721
It's probably not a good
recommendation for you.

784
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,265
[playing]

785
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,667
- Yeah, it's amazing.
- Yeah. Can you...?

786
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,770
I mean, it's, uh...
it's just amazing, yeah.

787
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,251
- That sounds like the Good Times
jazz recordings right there,

788
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,416
what you just did.

789
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,255
- This-this-this is perfect.
- Yeah.

790
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,456
- But these, they don't, uh...
these they don't sell,

791
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,555
they just exhibit.

792
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,793
Je peux l'acheter?

793
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,930
- Ca appartient a Buffet.
Moi, je veux bien.

794
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,270
Can I buy this?

795
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,936
- I think it's part of our history.

796
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,308
- Yes.

797
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,077
Well, think about it
for a minute.

798
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,616
This would be perfect for me.

799
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,448
- If we can find a solution,
we will let you know.

800
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,420
- Because this is perfect...

801
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,391
for the kind of music that we play.

802
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,424
- Hello.
Are you ready?

803
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,863
- I'm lost. I'm... Yeah.

804
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,092
- Come on.

805
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:48,103
I never swam
in my own apartment before.

806
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,937
[Soon Yi laughing]
Except during plumbing emergencies.

807
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,675
Uh, my glasses.
I can't swim with my glasses.

808
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,306
- No. Let's get in.

809
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,953
Ready?
- Ready for what?

810
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,985
Oh, I can stand.
- Mm-hmm.

811
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:17,158
You're in the shallow part.
- I'm in the shallow water?

812
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,427
- Yeah. Come on.

813
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,131
- I want to read the Trribune.

814
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,901
All right, one more time,
and then, uh...

815
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,601
- Afew more times.

816
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:37,446
- Now, how do you get out?
- The same way you came in.

817
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,418
- Wait a sec.

818
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,924
Oh, this is... this is not for me.
I'm like a...

819
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,583
- No, it was very good.

820
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,323
- I like the other kind of sports.
I like sports with a ball.

821
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,955
Thank you.

822
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,166
You know, this being Milan,

823
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,397
I just hope the laundry
doesn't come back breaded.

824
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,837
- So how did you sleep?

825
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,704
- I was afraid to get up
and go to the bathroom

826
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,437
in the middle of the night.

827
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,206
- In case you bumped
into someone?

828
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:06,942
- No. I didn't know
who was living or lurking...

829
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:10,713
You know, I mean,
you look down that hallway...

830
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,915
You know, it's just strange,

831
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,790
because it's just the two of us
in this big apartment, you know?

832
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,489
And access to it -
people have access to it.

833
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,464
You know, who knows--
- Right. When I got up this morning,

834
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,693
the place was crawling.

835
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,735
Thank you very much.

836
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:29,328
- When John clocks this joint,

837
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,374
he's going to... faint.
He won't believe it.

838
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:35,411
- You know what?
They forgot my toast. Shhh.

839
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,673
- Oh, really?
- That's okay. That's okay.

840
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,739
- Well, you know, it is--
Don't mention it.

841
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,445
- You know,
I think it's his first job.

842
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,784
I think he's a reformed
serial killer.

843
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,755
They're trying
to rehabilitate him.

844
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,485
Would you like
some orange juice?

845
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,823
- Would you like some toast?
- Uh, no, no.

846
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,728
No, thank you.
- No, I'm fine. There's plenty for me.

847
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,061
Hey, John, come in.
It's cozy, isn't it?

848
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,761
- This is unbelievable.
- You want some breakfast?

849
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:03,237
- I love your robes.
- You have to button your button.

850
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:07,470
- Oh, okay. How are you, sweetheart?
- Did they stamp your hand?

851
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,310
Look next door.
We can bring all our friends here.

852
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,282
They're used to classy people, I guess -
dignitaries, politicians.

853
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,251
They get 2 scuzzballs like us,
you know,

854
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,313
it's like 2 kids locked into
FAO Schwartz overnight or something.

855
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:25,122
- This is unbelievable.
- I know! It's unbelievable!

856
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,422
[both laughing]

857
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,589
This kid who was eating...

858
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,658
eating out of garbage pails
in Korea, on the streets,

859
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,929
is-is now...

860
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,436
- He's locked it.

861
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:38,940
I can't take a shower.

862
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:40,873
Well, we're the first people

863
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:44,038
to ever use this place.
We're the guinea pigs.

864
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,513
We're the shakedown crews
for the place.

865
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,948
You know, nothing works.

866
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:51,111
[Water running]
- Yep. Still freezing cold.

867
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,786
I'm hoping someone
can take care of the problem.

868
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,464
[Water running]

869
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,969
- I'll-I'll catch up with you later.

870
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,871
I'm going to shave,
shower and everything,

871
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,773
and, you know,
put my eyedrops in.

872
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,812
[Water running]

873
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,407
[knocking on door]
- Woody?

874
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,988
[speaking ltalian]
[Water running]

875
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,666
Oh, this one gets hot water.

876
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,499
This is when I shut the door.
Good-bye.

877
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:51,473
- I never saw so many people
as walking around in the...

878
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,174
The housekeepers
have housekeepers.

879
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,342
[man speaking ltalian over PA.]

880
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:05,289
- He's great, because he can do
whatever he would like to do.

881
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:09,297
He's trying to be, on his films,
what maybe he is,

882
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,764
so that's just great,

883
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,700
and what we would like
to do, maybe.

884
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,200
My mother,

885
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,831
she's madly in love with him.

886
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,308
And so, I said,
"Okay, let's go and do it."

887
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,811
So I made this big present,

888
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,316
and she was nearly crying for that.

889
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:31,114
And here we are. Let's see what
he's going to do with his jazz band.

890
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,712
- What'd you do
with that horn yesterday?

891
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,621
You bore the barrel out?

892
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,784
- Yeah, 'cause it's, uh...

893
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,123
- Does it feel better,
opened up like that?

894
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,129
- No.
[laughter]

895
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,995
I'm going to try
and use it anyway.

896
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,846
[applause and cheering]

897
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,449
[applause continues]

898
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,816
[Woody]: Like the lights are out...

899
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:41,823
Ah...

900
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,133
could we get the band
out here or something?

901
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,638
Could we get some
of the band guys out here?

902
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,342
Could we get some
of the band guys out here?

903
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,949
- One, two, three...

904
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,796
[man singing]

905
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,606
- You said it!

906
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:10,241
Well I ain't seen
that evening sun go down

907
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,076
[laughter]

908
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:15,083
I ain't seen
that evening sun go down

909
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,743
Man: Ah-ha!

910
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:20,755
'Cause my baby
she done left this town

911
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:23,417
[applause]

912
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,585
- Thank you.

913
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:29,256
Thank you very much
for sitting through us in the dark.

914
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,594
[laughter]

915
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,430
Um, I don't know
what happened, but...

916
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:37,939
you know, these are the things
that make life interesting,

917
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,269
I suppose.

918
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,173
Um, thank you again for coming.

919
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,405
It was great to play for you -

920
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,277
greater even in the dark
than in the light.

921
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,442
[laughter]

922
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,451
That's it for us,
ladies and gentlemen...

923
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,111
[kisses]
So thank you again.

924
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,486
It was a great, great pleasure.
[applause]

925
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,994
We'll be right backstage.

926
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,064
Let's get out of here.

927
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:04,258
Follow the light.

928
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,427
I thought there was gonna be -
God knows what -

929
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:10,233
I thought there was
gonna be a stampede.

930
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,933
In New York, by this time,

931
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,238
there would be 1 6,000
television sets missing.

932
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,676
Just quickly,
'cause I'm due at--

933
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:17,906
- Grazie, grazie. Bravo.

934
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,174
- Oh, thank you.

935
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,442
- Grazie.
- Thank you.

936
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,950
- You're the humorist
of the century.

937
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,611
- Thank you. I must go,

938
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,178
because my mother's
on a respirator.

939
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,154
The reed. It's the reed.

940
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,858
- Come on in.
- Hello.

941
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,834
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

942
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,427
- I'm Tatiana Mantovani.
I'm a journalist.

943
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:45,941
I'm here just to give you this.

944
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,270
- Oh! Thank you.

945
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,072
The spaceship has landed.

946
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:53,013
"Thank you, Woody..."
- For your so...

947
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:56,950
How do you say?
Brave heart.

948
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:59,078
'Cause... at the Esmeraldo,

949
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:02,318
one night there was no light,

950
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:05,019
and you were so secure,

951
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:07,722
and you continued to play.

952
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,698
- Yeah, some people
are just heroes.

953
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,233
- Yes, a hero...

954
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,634
- At least I know that it's...
I guess it's hereditary.

955
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:19,471
You know, I have a tendency to--
- One picture, please?

956
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,770
- Oh, yes, sure.

957
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,079
[Soon Yii]: Oh, my God,

958
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,982
there are so many
people out there.

959
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,918
It's funny.

960
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,425
- Soon Yi, they'll recognize you
because you're Asian.

961
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,926
- You think I'm the only Asian
in the hotel?

962
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,225
[Woody]: No, no,
don't blow my cover.

963
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,095
They'll start throwing
pebbles against the window.

964
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,861
What do I do? I'm scared.

965
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,698
- There are hundreds of people.

966
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,068
A thousand people out there.

967
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,437
You just cannot get through.

968
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,102
We're gonna go out the back.

969
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,111
No one tell them.

970
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,271
- I'm scared.
- Hey, I like that.

971
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,043
- You know what you do?
You go to the door, you wave,

972
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,914
and then you walk
back up the stairs,

973
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,249
and then you sneak back down
around the other way

974
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:06,652
as you go out the stairs.

975
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,815
That way they'll never know
where you're going from. Trust me.

976
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:10,188
- No, but don't you think they're here

977
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,227
because they know
he's going to the mayor this time?

978
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:15,127
- I don't think they know that.
- You think they just camped out?

979
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,290
Maybe when you come back
into the hotel,

980
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,529
before you come upstairs,
you could just go to the front door -

981
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,161
not open it - and just wave,

982
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,604
because all those people
are waiting to see you.

983
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,073
It seems a shame.
It doesn't seem quite right.

984
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,543
- You can't afford
to lose your own people.

985
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,409
- You sure they're there for me?

986
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,415
'Cause I don't want to go out
and wave if it's not for me.

987
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,916
It'll be embarrassing.

988
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,920
They may be here for Berlusconi
or Mick Jagger or somebody.

989
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,512
- No, I don't think so.

990
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,758
[scattered applause]

991
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,265
[Woody]: The funniest thing to me
is meeting all the mayors.

992
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,996
- Oh, yeah, sit down.

993
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,940
[Woody]: I got nothing to say to them,
they got nothing to say to me.

994
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:02,409
It's a photo op for the mayors,

995
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,207
and I get my little present.

996
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,578
Grab the swag.
Put it in a gunnysack somewhere.

997
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,345
- Thank you very much.

998
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,046
[Mayor]: I imagine
that you are very busy, sir.

999
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,418
- Holy God.

1000
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,424
- Want me to say hello?
- Yeah.

1001
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,931
- Just gonna say hello.

1002
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,901
- Woody!

1003
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,732
[applause]

1004
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:30,271
Thank you, Woody!

1005
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,505
-... to say hello

1006
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:38,240
and... and thank you
to everybody.

1007
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,408
- Thank you! Thank you, Woody!

1008
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,180
- How are you?
All right, all right?

1009
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:46,585
- Am I all right? Yes.
- Thank you

1010
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,054
- Okay, let's go.

1011
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,558
- Thanks, fellas.
I just thought l...

1012
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,657
I'm coming out
for a glimpse later,

1013
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,895
if you don't mind waiting.

1014
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,404
- Where are we going
to put these flowers?

1015
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,032
- You want to keep the flowers?
- Yeah.

1016
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,303
- That's why I hate to get flowers.

1017
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,369
'Cause the burden
is always on the receiver.

1018
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:14,041
[Letty]: All you have to do
is call the housekeeper.

1019
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,846
[Woody]: Oh, no.
Then the pullman's gotta come up.

1020
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,716
[Letty]: And ask him for slippers.

1021
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,914
[Woody]: I gotta have
a beer or something.

1022
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,723
[Soon Yi]: The mayor was very nice
and very good-looking.

1023
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:28,661
- Yeah, but thank God
he couldn't speak English.

1024
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:32,531
So they have this retrospective
of my films here.

1025
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,092
They always show,
with equal respect,

1026
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:39,403
the films that were not successful
in the United States.

1027
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,410
[Letty]: Right, but those films
were successful in Europe,

1028
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,412
so they don't see them as--

1029
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,414
- Yes, "Another Woman"
and "Stardust Memories"

1030
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,109
and "lnteriors" and "September."'

1031
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,085
- Yes, but they were equally
successful here.

1032
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:52,780
- So they don't--
- I know.

1033
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,756
They definitely gained something
in the translation.

1034
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,849
I don't know what it was...

1035
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,828
but in the United States,
they were--

1036
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,763
[Soon Yi]:
Maybe it's your voice dubbed.

1037
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:07,427
- No, I'm not in any of those movies.
[laughter]

1038
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,028
[Letty]: That must be it.
- It's amazing.

1039
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:13,438
But isn't it interesting--
- Although "Bullets" did very well.

1040
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:16,637
- I've known her how long now,
seven years, five years?

1041
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:17,940
I don't know how long.

1042
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:21,949
She's seen so many of my films.
She's never seen "Annie Hall."

1043
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,542
- How could you have
never seen "Annie Hall"?

1044
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,487
- And she's so friendly with Keaton.
She loves Diane.

1045
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,456
And she would love "Annie Hall."

1046
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,459
It's the perfect picture for her.

1047
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,586
- I've never gotten around to it.

1048
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:35,721
I've never read anything of his.

1049
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,163
Of all my pictures,

1050
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,725
which I don't have a high opinion of,
that one I think you would like.

1051
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,964
I think you would have
a particularly good time.

1052
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,871
- Everybody loved it, first of all.
- My favorite is "Manhattan."

1053
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,340
- You should probably go in

1054
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,934
with one of your...
you, you know,

1055
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:52,537
teenage twitty friends
and see "Annie Hall."'

1056
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:55,140
Probably 'cause you'd like it,
that's all.

1057
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:58,118
I wouldn't recommend necessarily
seeing any of the others,

1058
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,747
but that one
I think you would like.

1059
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:04,224
I saw "lnteriors" when I was young.
- What did you think of "lnteriors"?

1060
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:08,923
- I would rather not say!

1061
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,364
I mean, I was very young,
so I couldn't--

1062
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,559
- Oh, I see.
- Listen,

1063
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:16,594
most Americans that saw the picture
would've agreed with you.

1064
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,606
- Right. I couldn't sit through it.

1065
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,472
It was long and tedious and... yeah.

1066
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,670
- Right.
- Europeans like pictures that drone on,

1067
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:26,544
and I'm good at making pictures
that drone on.

1068
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,176
[Letty]: I need slippers,
and she needs slippers here.

1069
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,447
- And also no face towels.

1070
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,785
You know those small ones?

1071
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:35,983
- Yes, I understand.

1072
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:38,424
- Okay, thank you, washcloths.

1073
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:39,791
Woody?
- Yeah?

1074
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,830
- Someone's staying in the hotel,
and they would like

1075
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:44,798
to take a picture of you.
Of course, noWs not a good time.

1076
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,095
- Well...
- So what should I say?

1077
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,966
- Tell 'em it's not possible.
[Letty]: Say no, he's very busy

1078
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:52,337
and he has to go to the concert.
Tell 'em it's not po--

1079
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,968
- Wiill you tell them?
- Tell 'em in no uncertain terms.

1080
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:57,171
Jesus, people are just crazy,
you know?

1081
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,476
I'm sorry.

1082
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:02,073
[Woody]: Mr. Allen hates taking photos.

1083
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:05,518
- No, I understand, but he can't.
- Just put the phone down.

1084
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,919
- He's busy getting ready
for the concert.

1085
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,322
Why do you negotiate
for 1 5 minutes?

1086
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,417
- But thank you
for your interest.

1087
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,590
- It's amazing. Do 500 pictures a day,
1 0,000 autographs.

1088
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:21,159
They don't have to call
the hotel room and pressure you.

1089
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,430
- Bye.
[hangs up]

1090
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,905
Well, you see, this was the problem.
Their husbands won't believe

1091
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,442
that they saw Woody Allen
without a photograph.

1092
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:32,241
- So when I go down in the lobby later
on the way to the concert,

1093
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:35,477
I'll stop and do a photo.
I've never said no to anybody.

1094
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:38,179
- Now you tell me!
After I tell her it's not possible,

1095
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:40,619
he's going to the concert,
no way, no photographs--

1096
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,281
- I'm sorry.
I said no to nobody

1097
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,326
on this whole European trip.

1098
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,518
- He's already resting.
- I know.

1099
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:51,157
I always get a little depressed.
- Oh, why?

1100
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:55,294
- At some point during the day,
I always do.

1101
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:59,967
Ah, you know...
You're in a strange town and...

1102
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,704
[Letty]: And your tooth bothers you.

1103
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,042
- And I gotta do it tomorrow.

1104
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,911
- You've heard only
wonderful things about Bologna

1105
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,244
and the people in it.

1106
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,410
- The truth is, I've been
apprehensive about coming.

1107
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:13,512
- But you've heard very good things
about the people in Bologna,

1108
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,784
and you've heard
that the town was beautiful.

1109
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:18,053
- But I get a little spooked
by medieval towns.

1110
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:21,528
They're too sinister for me.
It's, like, winding medieval streets.

1111
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:22,928
I couldn't take it today -

1112
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,330
we were driving around in the car -

1113
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,427
you drive through those things,
and, uh, you know...

1114
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,439
I like nice, big, wide-open spaces--

1115
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,771
- That I wouldn't say!

1116
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,867
- Oh, I shouldn't
tell them that, right?

1117
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:38,708
- "You got a hell
of a town here."

1118
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:42,273
"l know with a couple of valium
I could really learn to love it."

1119
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,319
[applause]

1120
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,949
[speaking ltalian]

1121
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,928
Before we begin
the conversation,

1122
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:44,439
first, I want to thank everybody
for coming here.

1123
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,940
I'm very, very honoured
to be here.

1124
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:50,274
It's a great pleasure for me.

1125
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:53,940
But you should know one thing.

1126
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,416
In the United States,

1127
01:15:56,485 --> 01:16:00,114
I'm a very, very famous
claustrophobic.

1128
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,383
[laughter]

1129
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,721
This is not a joke.

1130
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,762
So after the questions are over,

1131
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:12,323
I would appreciate it
if everyone would keep their seats

1132
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,893
while I walk up the aisle
and collapse.

1133
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,734
Otherwise,

1134
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:23,745
the experience
will be very, uh, traumatic for me.

1135
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:27,407
And now anything
you want to say is okay.

1136
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,916
[applause]

1137
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,919
- Woody, is this reality?

1138
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,387
- For me,
it's a total digression from reality.

1139
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,549
The whole trip
has been, you know,

1140
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,422
because I live
a very quiet life.

1141
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:40,586
I live in my apartment,
I get up, I work,

1142
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,096
I take a walk
on the Upper East Side.

1143
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,759
You know,
it's a quiet, normal life.

1144
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:49,600
The life of the writer, mostly.
You know, the filmmaker.

1145
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,161
This whole trip,

1146
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:55,938
between the fans and the responses
and the places...

1147
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:43,589
- Slide that finger up,
you got the seven.

1148
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,456
- Yeah.
[strumming banjo]

1149
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,155
- I like that.
Experiments in modern writing.

1150
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,929
- It's my Neil Hefti arrangement
of Sidewalk Blues.

1151
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,162
[laughter]

1152
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:58,934
- I can't see,
because there's a light in my eyes.

1153
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,874
Ah, okay, does somebody
have my horn?

1154
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:04,844
- Yes, we've got it.
- Oh, okay. Great.

1155
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:08,711
You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

1156
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,752
- Very pretty.

1157
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:11,786
Uh...

1158
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,723
I gotta get a reed.

1159
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:20,194
- Okay. Over there.
- Yeah, go that way.

1160
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:23,390
- Where's my coat?
- I have it.

1161
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:26,525
- I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

1162
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:28,091
[screech]

1163
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:35,743
I could play in here.
Gonna have the concert right here.

1164
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:39,076
Move the audience in here.
It'd be perfect.

1165
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,444
Oh, God, I should live so long.

1166
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:45,748
Now don't go away

1167
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:51,259
As they sang
love's old sweet song

1168
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,658
On Moonlight Bay

1169
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:58,459
On Moonlight Bay

1170
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,905
- We're playing shorter tonight.

1171
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:08,204
Good to see you.
- I am very, very pleased.

1172
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:10,471
- Thank you.
- I make the presentation.

1173
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:11,842
- What present--
- Yes.

1174
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:15,007
I say, "Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Woody Allen."

1175
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,211
- Oh, no,
we usually don't do that.

1176
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,345
Usually we just come out
and play.

1177
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,185
No presentation.
They just come out,

1178
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,384
they begin to play,
and I come out.

1179
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,654
Whenever you're ready,
you just tell us,

1180
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:30,220
and we'll go out and play.
- I don't say, "Ladies and gentlemen"?

1181
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,459
- No, nothing at all.
Just nothing at all.

1182
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:36,903
As soon as he comes back in here,
you can wander out and...

1183
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,439
- Very good.

1184
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,440
[speaking ltalian]

1185
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:44,945
[Woody]: Uh, what is he doing?

1186
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:50,113
- He's making an introduction.
- You want to...

1187
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,119
to just go out and play?

1188
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,781
- In the middle of his speech?
- Yeah.

1189
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,017
Yeah, come on, let's just go.
Let's just go.

1190
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:03,119
Okay, okay.
Come on, let's go.

1191
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,977
- This guy put 'em to sleep.

1192
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:41,799
Shine
toesies and nosies

1193
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,667
And you'll frind

1194
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:47,469
Trhat everything
will turn out frine

1195
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,271
Folks I'm shouting to ya

1196
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,471
Everyone's gonna
howl out to ya

1197
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,982
You make
the whole world shine

1198
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:39,786
That was the jury, definitely,
out there tonight.

1199
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,091
- Yeah, it was, uh...

1200
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:45,291
The second we walked out,
they were...

1201
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,891
anaesthetized.

1202
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,493
This was definitely...

1203
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:54,205
[Soon Yi]: What'd you think
of the crowd?

1204
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,301
- What?
- What'd you think of the crowd?

1205
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,107
- I thought
they were a little reserved.

1206
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:00,739
We were wondering
why you were staying on so long.

1207
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:03,613
- Yeah. We thought you'd play
Little Place Like Home even sooner.

1208
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,245
I didn't know what to do.
- I was just, uh, you know--

1209
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:08,346
- I think there were people there
who enjoyed it,

1210
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,256
but there were others who were
probably there as an obligation.

1211
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,090
- Right, right.
- They were waiting for it to be over.

1212
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:15,356
- That's why I played longer,

1213
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,591
'cause I knew
there were people out there

1214
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,497
who were there
with an obligation,

1215
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,125
and I wanted
to torture them.

1216
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,897
- Fantastico.
- Thank you so much.

1217
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,336
- I am very, very happy.

1218
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:28,069
- They were a very good audience.
- People are very happy.

1219
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:31,112
- Very nice people.
- And the music is fantastic.

1220
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:33,943
If it's possible, I take you
to question for the television?

1221
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,448
- Sure.
- Okay.

1222
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,176
What is for you

1223
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:41,620
the music and the clarinet?
For your heart?

1224
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,352
- Well, it's a hobby.
I do it 'cause I love it.

1225
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,485
I'm not doing it
for the money.

1226
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,620
I'm doing it
just for the amusement,

1227
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:52,326
and I hope the people like it, too,
because, you know....

1228
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,197
But I could tell they did.

1229
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:56,464
They were tapping
their feet tonight.

1230
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,438
They were just great.
- Thank you very much.

1231
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,406
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you for the concert.

1232
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,409
- No, thank you, thank you.
- Thank you, grazie.

1233
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,605
- These two gentlemen
paid for all of this.

1234
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,207
- Very happy to meet you.
- Oh, how are you?

1235
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:13,311
- How long you've been playing
without stopping not even a minute.

1236
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:14,548
- But this was shorter.

1237
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,090
In a concert,
we play longer than this.

1238
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,955
We cut it down tonight,

1239
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:22,758
because we didn't want
to keep the people too long.

1240
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,197
We didn't think it was...
I know they want to eat.

1241
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:27,666
Oh, my goodness.

1242
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,770
There's a coronation.

1243
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:33,365
Wow. Look at this.
Isn't this incredible?

1244
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,568
- May I introduce you my wife.

1245
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:38,271
- Yes, please.
Hello. How are you?

1246
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:41,577
This is Soon Yi Previn,
The notorious Soon Yi Previn.

1247
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,583
- Hello.
- You missed a hand there.

1248
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:47,018
They're more animated now
than when we played for them.

1249
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:50,489
If you need my coat,
you can have my coat.

1250
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:53,959
Any time you want my coat,
you can have it.

1251
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,053
'Cause I have another.

1252
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,893
Well, first going out,

1253
01:23:56,965 --> 01:24:01,026
you know, it was the height
of all that...

1254
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,798
in the newspapers at the time,

1255
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:08,900
and we just never allowed
our pictures to be taken together.

1256
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:11,946
So if we were on the street
and there was a paparazzi,

1257
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,742
we would just, you know...
And then--

1258
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,909
- We would have to take a walk
on the terrace.

1259
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,546
- Then as reality set in,

1260
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:22,749
you know, um...

1261
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:24,451
We, you know,

1262
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:29,589
became more and more
open and direct about it,

1263
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:30,756
but, uh...

1264
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:35,531
So now they're asking,
"Can you give her a kiss?"

1265
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,969
And now I do, you know.

1266
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:44,876
You want to get out
on the terrace for a while?

1267
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:46,470
- Yes. I'm coming.
I'm coming.

1268
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,877
- Doesn't the city
look beautiful?

1269
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:55,946
- It does.
- It looks great.

1270
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,117
I can never look at this view

1271
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:01,720
without thinking of the opening scene
in "La Dolce Vita,"

1272
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,889
where the helicopter's
flying over Rome,

1273
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:06,092
with the Christ statue.
- That's right.

1274
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,964
- Or the Mary statue,
or whatever it was,

1275
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,264
and blessing it.

1276
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:17,477
Are you gonna be sad
to go home?

1277
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,706
You gonna miss Europe?
- No, no.

1278
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,774
I mean, I like this trip a lot.
You know, it's been fun.

1279
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,753
We've been on the go constantly.
- Mm-hmm.

1280
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,255
- But...

1281
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:32,418
- 'Cause, uh, I know
I've got the kind of personality

1282
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:35,588
where when I'm here in Europe,
I miss New York,

1283
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:38,427
and when I'm in NewYork,
I miss Europe.

1284
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,990
- You want to be here.

1285
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:43,435
- I just don't want to be where I am
at any given moment.

1286
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,735
I would rather be somewhere else.

1287
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,436
And there's no way
to beat that problem,

1288
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:54,312
because no matter
where you are,

1289
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,782
it's chronic dissatisfaction.

1290
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:58,478
Anhedonia.

1291
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:02,947
[Letty]: So how do we all feel

1292
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,219
now that we're coming
down to the wire?

1293
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:07,193
[coughing]
- I have a terrible cold.

1294
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:12,393
The first time I've gotten sick
in Europe with a cold ever, I think.

1295
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:16,665
I mean,
it's like a real classic head cold.

1296
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:20,406
What a drag.

1297
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:24,605
I was looking forward
to giving a good show tonight.

1298
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:27,914
[sniffling]

1299
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:30,007
I didn't want to just go out there

1300
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:33,019
and make it an achievement
if I get through the show.

1301
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,055
I wanted to be very good.

1302
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:37,091
'Cause if I'm not good,

1303
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:40,719
these people will hate me
in my own language.

1304
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,361
- He's just so brilliant.

1305
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:48,925
Everything he does is good.

1306
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:52,302
- I've been a Woody Allen fan
for a long time and a jazz fan,

1307
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,705
and it seemed to me
a logical thing to do:

1308
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:56,437
to have them both in one session.

1309
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,945
- So we've come to meet him.

1310
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:01,140
- Is there something in particular
about his sense of humour

1311
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:05,915
that attracts you?
- Uh, his Jewishness.

1312
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,548
- If I'm feeling down, I just put on
"Annie Hall" or whatever,

1313
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:13,219
and he just makes me laugh.
He just makes me laugh.

1314
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:15,285
- I can't breathe.

1315
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:17,354
I feel weak.

1316
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,491
[Letty]: You had soup?
- Yes.

1317
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,228
[Woody]: Yes, disgusting soup.

1318
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:22,564
- Oh. Well...

1319
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:24,798
- If they're in this state,
they want consomme.

1320
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,840
- And he just took
his temperature.

1321
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:31,242
And he didn't have one. It's normal.
And then he sticks the thermometer

1322
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:34,645
back in his mouth,
hoping it'll go up a point.

1323
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,378
- I'm not hoping.
I'm just trying to check.

1324
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,545
- He keeps it in forever.

1325
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,088
[laughter]

1326
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,419
- You'll get caught up
in the audience,

1327
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,516
and you'll be fine.
- That's right.

1328
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:48,994
As soon as they start clapping,
you'll forget it all.

1329
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:50,758
- You think so? Not me.

1330
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:52,823
Maybe Jolson was like that.

1331
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,925
- You'll be throwing kisses.
- Yes.

1332
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,971
[applause]
[iazz playing]

1333
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,735
[applause]

1334
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:28,895
- Kansas City!

1335
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:52,953
[applause]

1336
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,491
[applause]

1337
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,137
[applause]

1338
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:58,841
[applause]

1339
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:18,761
[playing "Home Sweet Home"]

1340
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:21,267
- There's no place like home.

1341
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:23,496
It usually means that the dance,

1342
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,232
or the picnic or the funeral

1343
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:28,769
or whatever it is they're at,
is over,

1344
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,936
and everyone goes home.

1345
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:33,003
The orchestra goes home,

1346
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,105
the audience goes home.

1347
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,809
They resume their lives,

1348
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:41,116
pick up the broken pieces
and try and go on.

1349
01:32:41,188 --> 01:32:44,521
And that's
what it means for us.

1350
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:48,961
It's sort of the end
of our... our concert.

1351
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:52,932
So I just want to say
on behalf of the orchestra,

1352
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,959
it was an incredible privilege
to play for you tonight.

1353
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,302
Really, really
a great, great privilege.

1354
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:01,398
Thank you so much
for coming, really.

1355
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,739
[applause]

1356
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:05,938
[cheering and whistling]

1357
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,437
- That was a great finale!

1358
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:09,072
[audience cheering louder]

1359
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,770
- Thank you, thank you.

1360
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:32,889
Have a good trip back.

1361
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:35,094
- Okay, we'll see you in NewYork.

1362
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,431
- Bye!
- Bye!

1363
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:39,473
- We'll see you all back in the city.
All right, bye now.

1364
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:42,768
- Feel better.
- We'll do this again.

1365
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:45,107
[laughter]

1366
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,646
Hey, it's great. It's over.

1367
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,773
There was a time
I was looking forward

1368
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,942
to that whole
formidable list of dates.

1369
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:51,985
- Mm-hmm.
- And now?

1370
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:55,079
- "Oh, God, I'm gonna be in Turin,
I'm gonna be in Bologna,

1371
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:57,215
I'm gonna be in Spain,"
and now it's history.

1372
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:00,819
- She didn't want them
to unpack it,

1373
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:02,294
you know... alone.

1374
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,689
[Woody]: Okay.
- Thank you.

1375
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:07,961
- You're welcome.
[Letty]: Hello, hello, hello.

1376
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,196
- Hello.

1377
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:12,102
[Letty]: Here, Dad.

1378
01:35:12,173 --> 01:35:14,835
We want to show you
what we got,

1379
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:16,570
what Woody got in Europe.

1380
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:17,804
Woody, you want
to explain these?

1381
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:21,405
- This is a medal
from the theatre.

1382
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:24,144
- It's a medal.
They gave you a medal.

1383
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,914
- What theatre?
- It's from the theatre in Venice.

1384
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:29,581
- Oh.

1385
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:32,091
- Well, don't you want it?
- Yeah. Why not?

1386
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,423
- I know, but what are you
gonna do with it?

1387
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:35,519
- Put it my... Save it.

1388
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:37,962
[Letty]: No. You'll put it out here
with his other stuff.

1389
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:43,834
- This was awarded to me
by the fire department in Milan.

1390
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:48,238
- "Crazy Woody"!
- No, it says "grazie," not "crazy."'

1391
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:52,905
It says here I single-handedly
saved some lives in Milan,

1392
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:56,177
and the fire department
gave me this.

1393
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,115
- Uh-huh, uh-huh...

1394
01:35:58,185 --> 01:36:01,279
There was a terrible,
terrible emergency.

1395
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:04,153
Actually, what happened
was the lights went out,

1396
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:05,487
but I didn't panic

1397
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:09,461
and saved the lives
of a lot of people

1398
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:13,432
from being stomped to death
and trampled to death.

1399
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:16,163
Feel that. It's heavy, isn't it?
- Oh, and how.

1400
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:18,637
- You always liked
that kind of lucite stuff.

1401
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:22,073
[Letty]: That was from the theatre
in Venice that burned down.

1402
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:23,974
- You're a very lucky man.

1403
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:25,534
- I ought to engrave this.

1404
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,478
- I thought they engraved it.

1405
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:29,948
Oh, this is from, uh...

1406
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:31,382
it's from Madrid.

1407
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,420
- It was engraved
over there, huh?

1408
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:36,479
- All he cares about
is where it was engraved.

1409
01:36:36,557 --> 01:36:37,524
What's the difference?

1410
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:40,321
- This is a D.W. Griffith Award,

1411
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:42,328
distinguished achievement
in motion pictures.

1412
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:46,696
This was given to me
for managing to live to 60.

1413
01:36:46,767 --> 01:36:49,099
- Given to you?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

1414
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:52,264
Because I'm alive
and in good health.

1415
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:55,035
- Whoever did the engraving,
it's beautiful.

1416
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:58,408
Let me tell you something,
this is real good engraving.

1417
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,142
- Uh-huh. One would get
the feeling he was an engraver.

1418
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:03,843
- D.W. Griffith.

1419
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:07,877
D.W. Griffith.
I remember him years ago.

1420
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:09,354
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1421
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:13,189
- You don't remember me practicing
the clarinet in my room?

1422
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,352
- Yes, we... I do.

1423
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,020
- Yes. You shut the door.
I remember.

1424
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:19,088
You shut the door and played.
You didn't play it loud.

1425
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:22,363
Yes, I remember the fella coming in.
He was a black man.

1426
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:27,499
- Gene Cedric was a great,
great jazz clarinet player,

1427
01:37:27,575 --> 01:37:30,976
who I called up on the telephone

1428
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:33,980
and asked if he would...
I saw him play in town.

1429
01:37:34,048 --> 01:37:36,414
I asked if he would come
to the house,

1430
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:38,417
and he only charged me
$2 per lesson.

1431
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:39,918
- I don't remember.

1432
01:37:39,987 --> 01:37:42,979
- Two dollars, but he'd come
all the way in from Harlem.

1433
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:44,922
- I remember the man
coming to teach you.

1434
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:47,722
- Yeah, and neither of us
could read music or anything,

1435
01:37:47,795 --> 01:37:50,263
and we would just sit
in the living room,

1436
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:52,629
and he would try
and help me in some way,

1437
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:53,632
and he was helpful.

1438
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:57,262
- Remember he took tap?
- Remember I took tap-dancing lessons?

1439
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:58,930
- Oh, yes, I remember that.

1440
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:04,706
You did a lot of good things,
but you never pursued them.

1441
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:08,145
[Letty]: Had you gone on, you would
have been a good tap dancer.

1442
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:09,477
- I would've been a tap dancer.

1443
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:11,848
- You'd have been a tap dancer,
which is bad.

1444
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:12,908
- Why is it bad?

1445
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:16,047
- It's very hard for people
in show business

1446
01:38:16,123 --> 01:38:17,647
to make a living.

1447
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,920
- You wanted me
to be a pharmacist.

1448
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:20,926
- A pharmacist or--

1449
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:22,428
- So you don't remember
anything else?

1450
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:25,397
You don't remember if I used
to listen to the radio a lot

1451
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:27,127
and listened to music
all the time?

1452
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:29,362
- Oh, yes, you listened to that,
but I wasn't concerned.

1453
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:31,097
You were in your room,
your room.

1454
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:34,072
You stayed there most of the time,
just came out to eat.

1455
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:35,574
[Letty]: You lived in your room.

1456
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:38,271
- What did you have
in your room?

1457
01:38:38,345 --> 01:38:42,111
- What'd I have in my room?
- Did you have a Victrola?

1458
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:45,583
- Yeah. Don't you remember?
Were you an uninterested parent?

1459
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:47,621
- I wasn't an uninterested parent.

1460
01:38:47,688 --> 01:38:51,749
I took you wherever I thought
was good for you.

1461
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,452
- Like where?
What does that mean?

1462
01:38:53,527 --> 01:38:54,892
Hebrew school?
- Like Hebrew school.

1463
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:58,329
That was good for you.
Yes, that was very good for you.

1464
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,197
- All that time-wasting junk.
- No, that wasn't time-wasting--

1465
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:02,428
- So would you say

1466
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:05,870
that you were the exact
wrong kind of parents for me?

1467
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,034
Would you say that you were
the exact wrong kind of parents?

1468
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:11,168
- I think I was too strict.
- She was too strict.

1469
01:39:11,245 --> 01:39:14,612
- You used to beat me and beat me
and beat me every day.

1470
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:15,671
[Lettty laughing]
Every day.

1471
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:17,512
- How did I beat you,
with a stick?

1472
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:19,609
- No. Wiith your hand,
with a strap, with...

1473
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21,780
Oh, you used to beat me
every day.

1474
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:25,882
I could've grown up
to be a drug addict or a criminal.

1475
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,121
- Did they offer you drugs?
- Why?

1476
01:39:28,195 --> 01:39:29,253
- Or a criminal.

1477
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:34,131
- But you weren't brought up
in that kind of a household. I'm sorry.

1478
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:36,726
You were brought up
in a household

1479
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:39,398
that knew right from wrong,
acted right.

1480
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:42,203
And don't think for a moment

1481
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:46,906
that you are what you are
by yourself. You're not.

1482
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,243
You had help.

1483
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:51,341
You had help from parents.
You listened.

1484
01:39:51,418 --> 01:39:54,512
Don't give all the credit to you.

1485
01:39:54,588 --> 01:39:56,215
- You had an idea

1486
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:59,225
that you could write a script,

1487
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:01,761
that you're a big shot.

1488
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:05,925
That's a lot of hokum.
Don't mean a thing.

1489
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,767
- I'd still be better off
if I was a druggist, right?

1490
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,863
- By the--
Maybe you would be.

1491
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,670
Maybe you'd do more
business as a druggist

1492
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:17,768
than you did as an actor.

1493
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,870
- I probably would do more
business as a druggist.

1494
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:21,710
- More people would
come into the drugstore

1495
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:23,807
than go to the films!
That's probably true!

1496
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:25,112
- Maybe you would--
- That's right.

1497
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,413
If I had a good drugstore,

1498
01:40:26,487 --> 01:40:29,354
I'd probably get a bigger audience
than I get for my movies.

1499
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:32,688
So how do you feel now
about the fact

1500
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,227
that both Christopher and l

1501
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:36,694
go out with Asian women?

1502
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:38,459
- I personally don't think it's right.

1503
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:41,296
[Dad]: You go where?
- That's me, my opinion.

1504
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:44,496
- Wiith Chinese women.
- Not Chinese, Asian.

1505
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:47,734
- Christopher's--
- Cheryl's not Chinese. I'm not--

1506
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:50,276
- I would've liked him
from the beginning

1507
01:40:50,344 --> 01:40:54,144
to fall in love
with a nice Jewish girl.

1508
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:57,274
- A nice Jewish girl?
- lnstead of a nice movie actress.

1509
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:59,546
- That's why the Jews
someday will be -

1510
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:03,716
not in your time - be extinct.
And that's very bad.

1511
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,419
- This is truly the lunch from hell.

1512
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:08,051
[laughter]

1513
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:18,768
- I didn't think that Woody
would turn out to be this successful.

1514
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:21,399
I knew he had a terrific brain.

1515
01:41:21,475 --> 01:41:24,103
He didn't show
any other talents.

1516
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:28,080
He showed a lot of talent
in his sports.

1517
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:31,174
But he did say to me years ago,

1518
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:34,277
that if he had
to choose a career,

1519
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:35,844
he would choose music.

1520
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:37,390
Anyhow, that's that.

1521
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:40,450
- He did a good job, though.

1522
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:43,963
- Yeah. I should hope
you would know it.

1523
01:41:44,031 --> 01:41:47,125
- What one of his films
do you like?

1524
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:49,897
Do any come from his real life?

1525
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:53,133
Do you see any of him in them?

1526
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:55,004
- Sometimes I do, yeah,

1527
01:41:55,075 --> 01:41:56,872
but very seldom.

1528
01:41:56,944 --> 01:42:01,244
He adds or subtracts
from his life.

1529
01:42:01,315 --> 01:42:04,842
He'll tell you a story,
or he'll have a movie

1530
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:07,386
that will be
not like his life,

1531
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:09,922
and some of them
he adds on,

1532
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:14,256
but, no, he doesn't want
to make a movie of his life,

1533
01:42:14,328 --> 01:42:17,092
I mean,
have people know that.

1534
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:19,962
I like it
because he tells you a story.

1535
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:23,196
Even though it may not
be true, the stories,

1536
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:26,433
or it may be farfetched,
but it's a story.

1537
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:28,805
That's what I like.
All right, sir, go home.

1538
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:07,413
Look down look down

1539
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:10,746
Trhat lonesome road

1540
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:15,083
Befrore you travel on

1541
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:18,921
Look up look up

1542
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:22,257
