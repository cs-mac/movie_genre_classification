for it for two days in a row."

"I really want to try it."

- My gosh!
- Goodness.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,604
- Isn't it amazing?
- Indeed.

10
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,973
That's so cool.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,074

15

- Oh, my.
- It looks amazing.

16
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,051
- It's mouthwatering.
- It looks so good.

17

Gosh, what's this?

18
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:36,820
- I want to try this.
- What is it?

19
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:37,821
It's sold on a food truck?

20
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:38,921
It looks so delicious.

21
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:40,400

need to go there right now!)

Oh, my.

23

- Me too.

Okay.

It's so quiet though.

Do you think we picked a wrong spot again?

31
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,432
How many servings do you think we'll sell?

32
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,322
I'm not sure. About 17 servings?

33
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,690
- Oh, gosh!
- This is amazing!

34
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,969
- My gosh.
- This is so cool.

35

- It's Cha Pasta.

- It's Cha Pasta.
- What's the matter?

37
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:20,830
- Amazing.
- It's Cha Pasta!

38
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,466
Score. I found it!

Both of them are handsome.

59

Not those guys. I'm asking about the pasta.
How does it taste?

Hae Sung. I tried your food,
and it is really good.

120

It doesn't taste like street food.

Of course it doesn't. The chef
used to own a big restaurant.

Jung Won, why are you eating
what fell on the floor?

123

I failed the contest, you know.

124
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,231
That's why I should eat it off the floor.

125

- Come on.
- What's wrong withy you?

126

That's enough.

127

- Okay.

Tae Hoon, can you drop some of
the snacks, so I can eat them?

132

- You little...

133

- What are you doing?
- Stop it.

the AC and I get the order,

I have to go. This manager
who is a complete failure,

- What? What is it?
- Hey.

- How many times did we tell you?
- Goodness.

You never get it. You never do.

144

- You are not considerate at all.
- Why are you doing this to me?

145
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,823
I can't believe I even fell off the bed.

147
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:44,741
Jung Won! Jung Won!

148
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:48,243
Why is he knocking on
my door in the morning?

149

bed sleeping last night.

You and I have to be at somewhere.

I was going to stay home today.

156

No, get ready. We have to leave now.

157
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,572
What are you going to wear?

158
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:18,041
Which one? Is it this one? Or this?

159

Okay, fine.

160

00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,550
But promise you'll hurry. Okay?

164
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,393
What do you think? Isn't it nice?

165
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,794
It is nice.

166
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:20,870
Hey, how did you find this place?

167
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:24,741
I stayed here last week.

168
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,142
Really?

169
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,382
Ma'am!

170
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,283
Hae Sung!

171
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,920
- Do you know her?
- She's the owner of the farm.

172
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,761
Hae Sung!

173
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,763
Ma'am!

174
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,736
- Hello.
- Hi.

175
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,881
Goodness, I almost forgot. I
forgot to unload the corns.

176
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,283
- I'll bring them to you.
- Can you do that for me?

177
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:20,706
I heard my cousin stayed here for a week.

178
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,931
Thank you.

179
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,534
You can tell me that he's your boyfriend.

180
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:25,802
Sorry?

181
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,222
You're Jung Jung Won, aren't you?

182
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,205
I heard everything from Hae Sung.

183
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,872
Pardon?

184
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:34,644
My husband came back to this world
three years after his death.

185
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:36,411
Really?

186
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,382
You and I are in the same boat.

187
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,585
I see.

188
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,621
Why did you steam so many corns?

189
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,192
I told Jung Won everything.

190
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,360
I see.

191
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,564
Then...

192
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,833
where is your husband?

193
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,301
Him?

194
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:03,606
He's back home in Seoul.

195
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:06,743
I see.

196
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,479
I have to go now. I have a
poker game to attend to.

197
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,515
You should eat these corns...

198
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,085
- and clean up the cattle sheds.
- Okay.

199
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,223
Win big!

200
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,432
Hey, we have to work?

201
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,934
This is a place where you come and
work without having any thoughts.

202
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:34,704
Let's eat these up. Come on.

203
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:54,824
Goodness.

204
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,163
This is a place where you let go of
your frustration and just work hard.

205
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:03,403
What's so bad about spilling them?
You can pick them up just as easily.

206
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:08,704
You're right. I'm not
thinking about anything.

207
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,585
This is a place where you let go of
your frustration and just work hard.

208
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,455
Fine.

209
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,392
Or not! Come here.

210
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,892
Come back here!

211
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,161
No!

212
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:48,945
I'm tired and hungry.

213
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,781
Aren't we going to eat?

214
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,259
This is a place...

215
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:57,203
- where we work without any thought.
- Where we work without any thought.

216
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,192
Jung Won and Hae Sung from Seoul,

217
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:06,295
come to the community hall and cook.

218
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,931
Come to the community hall and cook.

219
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,131
That'd be all.

220
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:12,635
She's not going to feed us?
We have to cook?

221
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,404
This is how things are in this town.
Let's go.

222
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,243
But why am I so happy though?

223
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,004
I guess you like when I touch you.

224
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,580
Forget it.

225
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:28,050
I feel like I failed that contest ages ago.

226
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:36,626
But where is she? Shouldn't
we say goodbye before we go?

227
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:38,694
She went back to Seoul in the afternoon.

228
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,931
She went back to see her husband.

229
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:43,833
Yes.

230
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:46,102
Jung Won.

231
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,070
Your hair pin.

232
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,175
Oh, no. I had it on in the afternoon.

233
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,045
I must have lost it in the farm.

234
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,814
Really? Let's hurry then.

235
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:03,452
Come already. You might
miss the last bus to Seoul.

236
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,124
We're coming.

237
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,260
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

238
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:16,065
But if we miss the bus, you can't
work on the food truck tomorrow.

239
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,300
What should we do?

240
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,570
Mr. Cha can't work by himself.

241
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:24,573
Gosh, what should we do?

242
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,478
Mister, we'll be quick.
Give us just 10 minutes.

243
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:33,382
We are already late. We
have to get going now.

244
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:38,621
Hae Sung, let's leave for now.

245
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,190
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

246
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,825
Let's go.

247
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:51,634
(Eunha Farm)

248
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,932
What's the matter with him?

249
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:39,381
Hey, I poured the hot water
in it, so I could eat that.

250
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,050
You can make another one then.

251
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:45,121
That was the only one left.
That was the last one.

252
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:46,655
Fine. I'm sorry.

253
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,393
Why are you lashing out on me?

254
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:53,662
Did something happen?

255
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,601
Jung Won lost the hair pin.

256
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:02,971
The pin? The hairpin you
bought 12 years ago?

257
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,073
Yes.

258
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:08,110
Goodness. She got herself in big trouble.

259
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,490
I asked him to have udon before
coming home, but he just left.

260
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,759
He got all angry at me just
because I lost that hairpin.

261
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,062
He's so small-minded.

262
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,932
I didn't know Hae Sung could hold a grudge.

263
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,901
Of course, I do feel sorry
about the fact that...

264
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,369
I lost something he got for me.

265
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,273
But he was angry at me for three
hours throughout our ride back home.

266
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:39,075
Don't you think that's a bit too much?

267
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,709
I don't think it's that big of
a deal, so let's just hang up.

268
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,945
I'm sleepy.

269
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:44,980
Don't hang up.

270
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,559
I need to badmouth him a little
more to be able to fall asleep.

271
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,851
Jung Won, what's that behind your back?

272
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:50,953
What?

273
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,091
My gosh, Jin Joo.

274
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,931
(Cha Pasta Food Truck)

275
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,233
Please enjoy.

276
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,642
(Hong Jin Joo)

277
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:17,980
My gosh.

278
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,952
Hey, Jin Joo.

279
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:25,820
Ho Bang, why are Jung Won and
Hae Sung still fighting?

280
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,490
It's getting on my nerves.

281
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:42,905
What? I thought you wanted
me to stop calling you.

282
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:46,242
Jung Won, I think you should
apologize to Hae Sung.

283
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,210
What are you suddenly talking about?

284
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,146
You know that hairpin you lost?

285
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,881
It's not just any hairpin.

286
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,150
What do you mean?

287
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,385
I just heard about it from Ho Bang.

288
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,420
Hae Sung...

289
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:01,790
apparently bought that hairpin
for you 12 years ago.

290
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:04,960
He just never got to give it to you.

291
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:09,131
He bought that for me 12 years ago?

292
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,877
He couldn't give it to you because
he had gotten into an accident,

293
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,501
but he recently got lucky and found it.

294
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,204
That's how he was able to give it to you.

295
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:18,440
What?

296
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,111
Jung Won.

297
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,580
Jin Joo, I think I need
to go find that hairpin.

298
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,383
- I'll hang up now.
- Jung Won.

299
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,224
Move over, you guys.

300
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,235
What should I do?

301
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,154
I can't find it anywhere. What should I do?

302
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,221
You're going to go with
me to the US, right?

303
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,231
I've given it some thought...

304
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:52,634
If I build my career there...

305
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,103
I'm sorry, Young Jun.

306
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,842
To be honest, going to the US
is a bit too sudden for me.

307
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:03,843
I've started to enjoy working at
the magazine publishing company.

308
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,281
Seo Won.

309
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:08,284
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for me.

310
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,819
You're already competent enough.
You don't need to go.

311
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:15,291
Okay.

312
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,960
I won't go without you.

313
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:21,630
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:24,900
Instead, let's get married
as soon as possible.

315
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,114
Hi, Young Jun. I'm sorry
for making you wait.

316
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,948
- No, it's okay.
- Okay.

317
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,669
Did you prepare all the required documents?

318
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,054
- Sir.
- Tell me...

319
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,390
if you need anything else.
I'll take care of everything.

320
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,061
I'm investing in your future.
Don't feel pressured.

321
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,431
Well, I'm grateful for your kind offer,

322
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,700
but I've decided not to go to the US.

323
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,335
What did you say?

324
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,879
I may not come from a great background,

325
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,743
but I'd like my competence
to be acknowledged.

326
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,621
It's not an opportunity that
will come to you often.

327
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,913
You're making a mistake by
letting that opportunity go.

328
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:14,726
I'm sorry, sir. I came to tell you this.

329
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,052
When I kindly offer you
something, you need to take it.

330
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:20,456
You're not in any position to decide.

331
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,225
Sir.

332
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:27,663
I understand.

333
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:30,599
You may leave now.

334
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:41,709
- Dad.
- Hi.

335
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,744
- You're home.
- Yes.

336
00:22:42,745 --> 00:22:43,912
You're home.

337
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:49,451
Is something bothering you these days?

338
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:52,821
No. You don't need to worry.

339
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:56,825
I met Chairman Shin's wife at
the massage spa this afternoon.

340
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,261
And apparently, her youngest son's wife...

341
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:02,231
treats her really nicely.

342
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,031
Oh, really?

343
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:07,002
"Oh, really" is not what you
should be saying right now.

344
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,472
When are you going to introduce
us your future wife?

345
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,940
When it's time.

346
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:15,711
My gosh, does that mean you're
going to introduce her to us soon?

347
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:19,280
Honey, you need to help me out here.

348
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:21,083
My gosh, just cut it out.

349
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:24,352
He'll take care of it on his own.
Why are you trying to rush things?

350
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:27,623
I want a daughter-in-law too.

351
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,725
You men don't know anything.

352
00:23:30,025 --> 00:23:31,760
I'm the only one who's suffering.

353
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,702
Gosh, it's so late. Where
in the world is she?

354
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,271
My gosh.

355
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,039
My goodness.

356
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,109
Hae Sung, why did you come home so late?

357
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,343
Did you wait a long time?

358
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,289
Here. I brought you some
steak from the food truck.

359
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,415
That's not important right now.

360
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,750
Jung Won...

361
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,952
Jung Won? What about her?

362
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,721
Well, she went to the
farm all by herself...

363
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,691
- to find that hairpin.
- What?

364
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,192
Did you tell her?

365
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,962
Yes, of course. I didn't know
that you guys had fought.

366
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,799
My gosh, she could've just
talked to me about it.

367
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,435
Ho Bang, I'll see you later.

368
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:16,071
Hey, how are you going to
find that in the dark though?

369
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,061
Where could it be?

370
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:43,332
Please.

371
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,634
Please show up.

372
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:07,890
What?

373
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:17,032
I found it.

374
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,601
Gosh, I found it.

375
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,955
I should hurry up and go now.

376
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:43,825
I'm not scared.

377
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:47,462
I'm not scared at all. No, that's not true.

378
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,131
Gosh, I'm so scared.

379
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:52,000
My gosh.

380
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,912
Hae Sung, how did you know I was here?

381
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:10,252
I found this.

382
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,654
How could you come here
alone without telling me?

383
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:15,490
Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:19,595
I heard you bought this for me...

385
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:24,032
12 years ago on the day of the accident.

386
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:28,670
That's right.

387
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:33,075
I didn't know that.

388
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:36,345
I'm sorry.

389
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:55,315
I'm going to let it slide
because you're pretty.

390
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:01,570
I promise I'll never lose it again.

391
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:07,743
What time is it?

392
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,212
We'll miss the bus. Let's hurry up and go.

393
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:12,481
We already missed it.

394
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:14,049
Then what are we going to do?

395
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:16,852
I don't know.

396
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,820
Usually when a couple misses the last bus,

397
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:22,023
they can't help but spend
the night together.

398
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:25,093
And usually, there's only one room left.

399
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:26,795
Aren't I right?

400
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:28,730
What?

401
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,233
I was just kidding.

402
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,313
The farm owner said he'd give us a
ride as he's going to Seoul too.

403
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:38,240
They said they'd give us a
ton of corn and potatoes.

404
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,541
Let's get going.

405
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,210
Let's go.

406
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:44,812
- Finding this was so hard.
- It must've been.

407
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,783
- You found it though. Good job.
- Yes, I'm so glad.

408
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:51,653
What's all this?

409
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,222
This is corn, and there
are potatoes in this.

410
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:56,424
What shall we eat first? Tell
us what you want, Ho Bang.

411
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,037
Then shall we start with corn?

412
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,629
- Okay.
- Okay!

413
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,164
- Where's the big pot?
- It's here.

414
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,633
There are so many of them.

415
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:07,769
My gosh, they look so fresh.

416
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,141
Hello?

417
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,745
This is Detective Shin Ho
Bang at Mapo Police Station.

418
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,082
You're the one who put up the
banner in Chungho, right?

419
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,883
The banner in Chungho?

420
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:25,954
Yes, that's right. It was me.

421
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:33,095
I have some information for you.

422
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:37,733
Did you witness the accident
that happened 12 years ago?

423
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,271
Hello?

424
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,641
Hello? I'm listening.

425
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:49,511
On the day of the accident 12 years ago,

426
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:52,981
a murder took place inside the school.

427
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:56,451
That's right. Please go on.

428
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,520
I want to give you some information...

429
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,323
about that murder case.

430
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,912

on major music websites.)
