Pat Haggerty
Humor Coach.

120
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Should I make joke about
my mother-in-law?

121
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,080
In America, that's a very popular
joke. Do you have a mother-in-law joke?

122
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,400
I have sexy time with my mother-in-law?
- A what time?

123
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,880
Sexy time. I made sexy time
with my mother-in-law.

124
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,360
You had sex with your mother-in-law?
- Yes.

125
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,160
I don't think that americans will find
that funny. - No, it is not a joke.

126
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,880
I'm talking about humor.
- Oh, yes, you ask me about my mother-in-law.

127
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,280
Do you have a joke about your mother-in-low?
- No, why make a joke on a mother-in-law?

128
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,640
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?

129
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,520
Here in America, we try not to make fun of,
or be funny with things that people don't choose.

130
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,000
But perhaps you have seen not someone
with very funny retardation.

131
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,680
My brother, Bilok, have a verry
funny retardation.

132
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,280
Mental retardation, you know, causes a lot
of pain hardship for a lot of families.

133
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,760
Sometime, my sister, she show her vagin
to my brother and say

134
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
You will never get this!
You will never get this!

135
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,680
He, behind his cage, crazy -crazy,
everybody laughing. You never get this.

136
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,040
But, one time, he break the cage, and he get
this. And then we all laugh. High 5!

137
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,848
That would not be funny in America.

138
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,640
What is a NOT jokes?

139
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,120
A NOT joke is when we try to make
fun of something,

140
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,640
and what we do is we make a statement,

141
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,200
that we pretend it's true, but at
the end, we say NOT.

142
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,320
Which means it's not true.
- So teach me how to make one.

143
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,960
What color is your suit?
- This suit is grey.

144
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,520
Grey, I would call it blue.
- It's grey.

145
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,920
All right, it's blue grey,
but it certainly not black.

146
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Let's say it's grey
- It is grey.

147
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,680
A NOT joke I would say:
that suit is black NOT!

148
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,160
This suit is not black.
- No, no, no. Not needs to be at the end.

149
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,040
This suit is black-not.

150
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
This suit is black, pause, you know what
pause is? - Yes.

151
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,680
This suit is black NOT!

152
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,280
This suit is black pause NOT.

153
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,720
You don't say pause.
This suit is black.

154
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,640
That's a pause NOT.

155
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,120
This suit is black.
- Ok.

156
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,120
NOT.

157
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,960
Everybody say USA television much better,
but this I watch for three hours and do not change.

158
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,800
This two arrows to change the channel.

159
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,520
Be careful, be careful, CJ.

160
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,520
This CJ was like no
kazak woman I have ever seen.

161
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,480
She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls.

162
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,040
And the ass hole of a 7 years old.

163
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,320
For the first time in my lifes,
I was in love.

164
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,500
Get Up! Get up!

165
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,500
Why you aren't you ready?!

166
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
We have people to interview today!

167
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,100
I understand.

168
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,000
Learn what you can from this women's group.

169
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,600
My hair?
- It's beautiful. Don't worry.

170
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,400
In Kazakstan, it is illegal for more
than 5 woman to be in the same place.

171
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,120
Except for in brothel or in grave.

172
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,560
In US of A, many womans meet in a groups,
called a feminists.

173
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
I find them all.

174
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,384
Feminist Veterans Of America.

175
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,400
So what does means this feminism?

176
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,120
It's the theory that women should be
equal to men in matters...

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,320
You are laughing. Well, that is
the problem.

178
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,760
Do you think a woman should be educate?
- Definitely.

179
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,760
But is it not a problem that a woman have
a smaller brain that a man?

180
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,880
That is wrong.

181
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,200
But a government scientist doctor
lama prove that it is size of squirrel.

182
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,760
Your government scientist?
He's wrong.

183
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,600
Give me a smile, baby.
Why angry face?

184
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,080
Well, what you say is very demeaning.
Do you know the world demeaning? -No.

185
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,560
I could not concentrate on what
this old men were saying.

186
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,120
All I could think about was this lovely
woman in her red water panties.

187
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Who was this CJ?

188
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,200
Last night, I see, in my hotel room,

189
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,880
a woman called CJ on the television.
Do you know her? -No.

190
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,520
She from a town called the Baywatches.

191
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,520
She's just on television.
Her name was Pamela.

192
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,520
Do she live here in New York?
- She lives in California.

193
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,040
O, you mean California.
- He's gonna look her up.

194
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,160
Ok, can we finish now?

195
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,520
Listen pussycat, try smile a bit.

196
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,120
We're finished, we have to leave.

197
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,600
Although I was obsessed by this CJ,
I could not pursue her.

198
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,680
or else my wife will snap off my cock.

199
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,720
Mister Sagdiyev?
- Yes.

200
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
I have a telegram for you.

201
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,640
You can read?
- Yes, I can.

202
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:40,240
Dear Boratsendiev, your wife
Oksana was walking your retarded

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,760
brother in the woods when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.

204
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,320
She is now dead.

205
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,080
What you saying my wife is dead?

206
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,160
This it what it's...

207
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,080
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you but that's
what the telegram says.

208
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,240
Hi 5!

209
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,820
What do you mean "California"?

210
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,000
I have arranged all our filming for New York.

211
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
But we need to leave New York
to find the real America -

212
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,000
Rodeos, cowboys...
it will be better for our documentary.

213
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
But why California?
What's there?

214
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Pearl Harbor is there...
and so is Texas.

215
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,580
Eventually, I persuaded Azamat that
we will travel to California

216
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,340
and make our reportings along
the way.

217
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,580
He insist we do not fly, in case the jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.

218
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,300
Okay, I'll find another way
for us to get there.

219
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,900
My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your
driving instructor. Wellcome to our country.

220
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:05,015
My name Borat.

221
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,500
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.

222
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,660
Now, you do know how to drive a
little bit? - Yes.

223
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,980
Put it in D.
- What?

224
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Drive.

225
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,740
Wait a second, wait a second.
Have you driven a car before?

226
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,980
Yes, many times.
- All right, let's go this way.

227
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,180
Wait a minute, I don't want
you to hit anybody.

228
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,900
Now use two hands now.
- What?

229
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,340
But then it look like I'm holding a gipsy
while I eat my hram.

230
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,500
I don't care what it looks like.
Use two hands when you drive, ok?

231
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,460
Watch the children.
- Ok, no problem.

232
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,540
Must not hit the children.

233
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,820
Look, there is a woman in a car.
Can we follow her?

234
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,340
And maybe make a sexy time with her.

235
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,220
Why not? - Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

236
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,900
What!? They do?
- There must be consent.

237
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,380
How about that. That's good, ha?

238
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,580
It's not good for me.

239
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,700
You want have a drink? - You can't drink
when you drive. It's against the law.

240
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,740
Who is this car that follow us?

241
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,500
Maybe we lose them
- We better not lose them.

242
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,100
Hey, don't look at me. Eat my teets.

243
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,060
We'll make a right turn right here.

244
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,300
Don't look at me like that.
That will eat your shit.

245
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,460
You fuck my mother.

246
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,660
He.. do before.
Look on me.

247
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,900
They're gonna throw us in jail.
Me with you.

248
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,380
Why in jail.
He look on me! Behind.

249
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,460
You can't say that.

250
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,740
I like you? Do you like me?
- I do like you.

251
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,180
You are my friend? - You're a nice
young man and I am your friend.

252
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,900
Will you be my boyfriend?
- I won't be your boyfriend.

253
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,540
Why not? You don't like me?
- Don't push, I can be.

254
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,820
Great success. Now time to make purchase
of motorcars.

255
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,020
I want to have a car that attract woman
with a shave down below.

256
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,820
That would be a Corvette.
Or a Hummer.

257
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,420
We will try to help you out here.

258
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,900
A man, yesterday, tell me,
if I buy a car,

259
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,860
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.
- He means a car that women would like.

260
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,740
Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, no there's no magnet.

261
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,900
He means the vehicle.
Women love the Hummers.

262
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,060
Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

263
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,100
If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?

264
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,540
There's no such thing in this country
as a... magnet.

265
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,020
If this car drive into a group a gipsy,
will there be any damage to the car?

266
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,140
It depends on how hard you hit them
and all that? - Hard!

267
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,540
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
it could crack your windshield.

268
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,940
How fast do I need to go to guarantee
I kill them?

269
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,540
With this vehicle right here, probably
doing 35-40 mph will do it.

270
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,580
When I buy my wife,

271
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,260
at the start, she was cook good,
her vagin work well,

272
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,220
and she strong on plow. But after
three years, when she was 15,

273
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,300
she become weak, her voice become a deep
Borat, Borat.

274
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,980
She receive a heir on chest.

275
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,540
And her vagin hang like
sleeve of wizard.

276
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,700
How do I know that this will not
happen with the car?

277
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,980
Chevrolet guarrantees that with
the warantee.

278
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,780
I like very much buy this Hommers.
How much is it? - 52 thousand.

279
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:57,140
I am looking for something between
600- 650 dollars.

280
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,180
We don't have cars for 650 in
that you can buy.

281
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,380
I might be able to sell you
a ho-sale car, a car with a lot of mileage

282
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,140
for 700 but with no warranty.
- Ok.

283
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,860
California, I coming.

284
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,020
First on my journey was Washington DCs,
home of the mighty US warlords,

285
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,380
premier Bush.

286
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,646
Look who has an embassy here!

287
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,340
Fuck you, mother fuckers!

288
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,780
We arrive here to learn from
american politic.

289
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,780
As I arrange interview with party
official from ruling regime.

290
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,121
BOB BARR
Former Georgia Congressman.

291
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,940
We're are good friend, yes?
- I hope so.

292
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,220
It is custom to have cheese
at the start. - Thank you.

293
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,580
My wife, she make this cheese.
- Very nice.

294
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,020
She make it from a milk from her tit.

295
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,780
After interview, I encounter
traditional american street festival.

296
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Gay Pride Parade

297
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,060
People here were much more friendly
than in New York.

298
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,300
Next morning, I interview politician
who is a genuine chocolate face.

299
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,900
No make-up.

300
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,000
ALAN KEYES
2-time Republican Presidential Candidate.

301
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,900
On a sunday, I arrive in Washingtons,
there was a parade, I make two friends,

302
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,260
from this parade, I invite them back to my
hotel room, we drink like a normal in Kazakstan,

303
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,020
we wrestle like a normal in Kazakstan,

304
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,260
then they say I wash you in the shower,
he wash me in the shower.

305
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,820
It sounds like you met somebody who is from,
what is called in America, the Gay community.

306
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,500
What it mean... gay?
- Homosexual.

307
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,140
Homosexual... you mean?

308
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,460
You telling me that man who tried to put
rubber fist in my anus was homosexual?

309
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,260
Even though my anus was broken, I knew that
rest of our journey would be great success.

310
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,220
We left Washingtons and continue towards
California. Howdy, partners!

311
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yes Minister, we're on schedule.

312
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,000
Yes I am standing in the
middle of Times Square.

313
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,000
It is time to prepare for your
TV appearance.

314
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Remember to talk of singing
National Anthem at rodeo.

315
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Don't worry, I am a TV professional.

316
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,300
This morning, we have a very special guest
here in the studio, this is Borhat Sahadyev.

317
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,180
He is travelling across America to give
a taste of life here in the United States.

318
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,580
He spent the last few days here in
our area.

319
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,380
Hello, my name Borat.

320
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,740
Before we start, can you tell me because
I want to make your ends and then

321
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,860
I come back here and... if you tell me what me
on the we start...

322
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,380
We started. We are actually live on the air
right now.

323
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,900
I very excite!
Hello, US and A!

324
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,420
Hello, US and A! I very excite!
I very excite to be here! Hello!

325
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,380
Hello to you as well. Now, real quickly,
why are you here in the United States?

326
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:07,820
Because I want to learn from US and A your
culture and to understand from

327
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,300
how thing happen and to take this lesson
back to my country.

328
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,460
All right, would you like to have a seat?
- yes.

329
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,900
One of the things that you'ved enjoyed
so much about...

330
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,940
Can I have a microphone so people can
hear me? - They hear you right now.

331
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,220
You're miked up. This little thing
right here that's the microphone.

332
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,180
Hello, hello, nice to meet you.

333
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,300
Welcome to the United States. Thank you
very much for coming on, we appreciate it.

334
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,460
When you come to Kazakstan,
you can stay my house,

335
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,340
you can sleep my house and
you can use my sister.

336
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,580
Metereologist Ted Johnson with the latest
on tropical storm...

337
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,500
Traffic is flowing along smoothly along
interstate 55

338
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,780
Very nice have me.
What your name?

339
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,300
We're on air right now, doing the weather.

340
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,740
Go with Adrianne, she's calling you
to go over here.

341
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,300
He is a she? - Somehow!
- Very nice.

342
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,380
What your name? What you do here?
- I'm the weather guy.

343
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Let's get over to the weather.
You can see the rain..

344
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,100
Nice to meet you!
- Thank you.

345
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,000
You are singing at a rodeo tonight!
Why didn't you mention it?

346
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:57,548
What can I do? They are not professional.

347
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,150
Get a move on, we have
100 miles to go.

348
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,060
Of course, every picture that we get back
from the terrorists or anything else

349
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,540
the muslims, they look like you,
like your black moustache

350
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,540
Shave your damn moustache so you not
look so conspicuous

351
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:51,380
so you look like maybe an italian, or
something, as far as people looking at you.

352
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,900
I see a lot of people....
Young muslims working on bomb... strapped to it.

353
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,460
And you probably are not a muslim.
Maybe that't not your religion.

354
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,180
No, I'm kazak. I follow the hawk.
- But you look like one.

355
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,900
This thing gets over with, and we win it,
and kick the butts over there,

356
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,500
and all the damn sons of the buck hanging
from the gallow, by that time,

357
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,940
you've proven yourself and they'll
understand you and be accepted.

358
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,540
I don't kiss you.
- Why not?

359
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,180
The people that do the kissing over here
are the one that float around like that.

360
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,900
Ah, they...
- Yes, they'll wait for them to kiss.

361
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,260
In my country, they take them and they take
them to jail and finish them.

362
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,100
Take around and hang them?
That's what we're trying to get done here.

363
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,260
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please
give a worm american welcome

364
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,660
to a gentleman who has come all the
way from Kazakstan

365
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,420
and we are honored to have singing our
national anthem

366
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,700
Borat Sagdiyev.

367
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,220
My name Borat. I come from Kazakstan.
Can I say first

368
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,660
we support your war of terror.

369
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,180
May we show our support to our
boys in Irak.

370
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,940
May US and A kill every
single terrorist.

371
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:34,860
May George Bush drink the blood of every
single man, woman and child of Irak.

372
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,780
May you destroy that country so that for
the next thousand years

373
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,580
not even a single lizard will survive
in their desert.

374
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,140
To show our friendship,
I now will sing

375
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,460
our kazak national anthem to the tune
of your national anthem.

376
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,860
Listen.

377
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,660
Kazakstan is the greatest
country in the world,

378
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,980
All other countries are run
by little girls,

379
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Kazakstan is number one
exporter of potasium,

380
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,020
Other central asian countries
have in theory our potasium

381
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:31,060
Kazakstan is the greatest country
in the world,

382
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,420
All other countries is the home
of the gays.

383
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We nearly died last night.
This journey is cursed.

384
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
We should have stayed in New York.

385
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:57,140
I was sad. The rodeo peoples
did not like me.

386
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,740
What if Pamela did not like me too?

387
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,100
We needed something to change
our fortunes.

388
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Look Azamat, a Gypsy village.

389
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,111
Let us extract some of their tears
so we can remove the curse.

390
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,100
Do not fear me, gipsy.
All I want from you is your tears.

391
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,100
Let's give them to me or
I would take them.

392
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,460
I'm not a gipsy. I'm midwestern
farmer's daughter, americana.

393
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,020
You have many treasures.
Who did your rob for this?

394
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,820
We didn't rob them.
They all came from inside the house.

395
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,700
I will look in your treasures, gipsy.

396
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,180
Is this understood?
I will look on them. - Please, do.

397
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,100
Who is this lady you shrunk? Was she the owner
of this house that you came in front of?

398
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,220
There's couple more child's doll.

399
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,700
Do not try and shrink me, gipsy.
I, serious.

400
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,380
These are your spells?

401
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,060
Ne, podívejte se na tohle.

402
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,020
Och, Pobøežní hlídka.
- Pobøežní hlídka.

403
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,500
Azamat, great success!
I have the tears.

404
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:16,300
Onwards to California!

405
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,000
Lets go!

406
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,500
What's that you've got there?

407
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,500
- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

408
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,200
Are we going the right way?

409
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
I do not know, this map is from 1917.

410
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
- Where the hell are we?

411
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I am going to stop to ask.

412
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,200
- No, no, no, keep going. Keep going.

413
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,780
I need a direction to California, please.
- You're far away from home.

414
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,740
I travel with my friend Azamat Bagatov,
we travel across the country

415
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,900
You look like Michael Jackson,
Beat It.

416
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,820
I like you, peoples. Can you teach me how
to dress? How can I be like you?

417
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,740
First is to loosen up your belt

418
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,500
Don't pull down like you try to go...

419
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,060
Like this?
- But don't show your Huggies down there.

420
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,620
What kind of music do you listen to?

421
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,860
I like very much...
Do you know...?

422
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,740
You gotta lick it,
before you kick it.

423
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,540
Can you teach me speak like you?
- What you're trying to say?

424
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,220
How do you say How do you do?
- What's up with it.

425
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,510
Pull over and let's see
if we can stay here.

426
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,540
What's up with it, vanilla face?

427
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,220
Me and my homie Azamat just
park our slab outside,

428
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,500
We're looking for somewhere to post up
are black asses for the night.

429
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,220
So, bang-bang, skid, skid,
nigger.

430
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
We're just a couple of people

431
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,020
Leave now or we'll call the cops
and have you taken out.

432
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,200
We can't stay here,
they are 'player haters'.

433
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,340
You have a room for tonight?
- Yes, definitely.

434
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,180
So, come on in. Your friend also.

435
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,060
Beautiful house. This..
- All the paintings in the house I did.

436
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,420
What is this man?
- This is a yemenite jew, and he's working

437
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:18,660
on a piece of jewellry. The yemenites were
also jewellers.

438
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,300
Why do you have a picture of a jew?
- Because I'm jewish, so.

439
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,300
This is the room, and...

440
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,940
do you need two pillows?
- Yes.

441
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,500
Great. Thank you.
Lovely place.

442
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,300
They're Jews.
- I know that now.

443
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,275
Koukni se jestli tady mùžeme zùstat.

444
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:49,688
Nemùžeme tu zùstat, jsou to
maskovaní hajzlíci.

445
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,500
They'll kill us.
We need to escape.

446
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,700
Wait, wait.
- Ok.

447
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,020
Hello.
- How are you? - Great.

448
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,580
This is a special sandwich for you.
- I not so hungry.

449
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,860
He can eat this.
Here, fat.

450
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,140
Take a half.

451
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,060
Not so hungry.
- Eat a little bit.

452
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,740
Go ahead, eat something, because you're
hungry and you're a guest.

453
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,020
I don't want to see you go hungry.

454
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,020
What is this picture over here?

455
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,220
It is three in the morning, I am in
the nest with jews.

456
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,940
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

457
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,340
One of them has taken the form of a
little old woman.

458
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,140
You can barely see her haunts.

459
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,660
She have try to poison me already.

460
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,380
This rats are very clever.

461
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,320
Look, the Jews have
shifted their shapes.

462
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,277
OK, OK. How much shall
I give them?

463
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,000
I don't know.

464
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,525
More.
Give them more.

465
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Go, go.

466
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Let's go back to New York,
at least there's no Jews there.

467
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,200
Calm down.
We'll keep heading to California.

468
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,000
Why California?
What's so special about California?

469
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We are going to California!

470
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,500
And get killed on the way?

471
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,133
Relax Azamat!
I will get us protection.

472
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:10,808
Jedeme do Kalifornie!

473
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,780
What is the best gun to defend
from a jew?

474
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,580
I would recommend either a 9 mm
or a 45.

475
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,420
Very nice!

476
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,460
I, movie star, Dirty Harold.

477
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,420
Come on and make my name, jew.

478
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,340
But he would not sell me guns,
since I'm not american.

479
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,260
So I look for other protection.

480
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,660
What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

481
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,900
Is this a cat in a hat?

482
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,140
No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

483
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,180
I need the animal for protection.
What you have for me?

484
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,500
We're safe
Now we continue to California.

485
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Switch it off.
It's so annoying.

486
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,460
Happy times. We were safe and well
on our way to Pamela.

487
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,220
It was time to get back to work.

488
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Kazakhstan needs to learn about
American fine dining.

489
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,500
First, a lady will teach you
Southern manners.

490
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
How long have I got?

491
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,000
An hour. Then you have
dinner date with high society.

492
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,780
Hello and nice meet you. - Hello, it's so
nice to meet you. welcome to America.

493
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,100
Will you please teach me how to
dine like gentlemen?

494
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,060
Of course, I'll be happy to.

495
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,100
Is it polite to greet people when
I make entry? - Yes, it is.

496
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,860
Let me introduce you. Around.
You gonna have to say names.

497
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,260
Mike Chairman.

498
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,540
Bethany Westonová.

499
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,820
Jak se vede?
Já jsem Ben.

500
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:16,100
Should I pay interest in peoples
around the table sights? - Yes.

501
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,260
And if is a big table, a very long table,
you might want to restrict your conversation

502
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,340
to people right in your vicinity.
- Very nice.

503
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,460
So you are not yelling.

504
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,340
What do you do?
- I'm the pastor of church.

505
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,940
What do you do?
- I have spent years in construction,

506
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,460
I've recently retired.

507
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,620
You are retard?
- Yes.

508
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,380
Physical or mental?

509
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,340
Retired.
- Not retarded.

510
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,100
I don't work anymore.
- Stopped working.

511
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,140
Is very good yoy allow retarded with..

512
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:10,180
That's not what he was saying.
He is not what you refer to as retard.

513
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,780
Do you have a telephone in this village?

514
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,860
Should I show photos of my family?
- You have photos of your family. Wonderful.

515
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,180
This my favourite son,...

516
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,940
He looks happy.
- Yes.

517
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,580
He very strong.
- My goodness, is that him lifting you?

518
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,460
He grow 6 centimetreand now is
17 centimetre long.

519
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,780
I'm not sure one would show this photo to...

520
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,340
Should I pay compliments to the peoples?
- Yes.

521
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,660
But only if you truly agree with
that compliment.

522
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,700
You have a very gentle face,

523
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,260
and a very erotic physique.

524
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,220
That's a very good observation.

525
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,220
She is your wife?
- No, that's my wife.

526
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,540
In my country, they would go crazy.

527
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,380
For this two,
not so much...

528
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,940
What should I say if I need to
go to the shit-hole?

529
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,340
You mean to the restroom?

530
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,260
To the place to make the shit.
- Bathroom?

531
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,260
Not the bath to make dirty hands...
The brown... - The toilet.

532
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,780
Where you make, you understand...
bad, bad thing from.

533
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,500
What you do..
- Brown.

534
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,300
You say, excuse me, I need to go to the
restroom.

535
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:04,020
Excuse me, is it possible to go and do...

536
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,620
how you say in there, you know...

537
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,380
Excuse me a moment.

538
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,780
I think that the cultural differences
are... vast. - Exactly.

539
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,300
And I think he is a delightful man...
and it wouldn't take

540
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,260
a very large time for him to really
become americanized.

541
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:35,100
Thank you very much, I feel much better.
Cindy, where should I put this?

542
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,580
Excuse me for just a moment.

543
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,100
Like this. And you wipe your bottom.
And you put the paper.

544
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,780
I? - You. No, I wouldn't.
This is a very private thing.

545
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,820
The host cleans the anus of the other?
- No, no, no.

546
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,100
Nobody touches you except you.

547
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,980
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

548
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,460
If you have been invited to a home
or to a party... - Yes.

549
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,900
it is acceptable to bring a guest if
you ask your host in advance.

550
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,060
Hi, I'm looking for Borat.
- Yes, is me.

551
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,580
This my friend, Luennel.

552
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:47,180
I don't know exactly what all that we're
doing. It is getting very, very late.

553
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,980
You have to excuse me.
I have to go home.

554
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,380
It's getting very very late and it's time...

555
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,060
that we are ending our dinner party
and everything.

556
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,940
But can she come for desserts?

557
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,740
Absolutly not and neither can you!

558
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,100
The sheriff is on his way.
- I hope so.

559
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,180
Why you call police?
Has the retard escaped?

560
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,300
I want say I'm very sorry way treat
you in this house. - Thank you.

561
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,460
I was thinking maybe I just take the night
off and...

562
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,100
Why don't we just go out and have some
fun. What do you think about that?

563
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
You want to come with us?

564
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,000
Up yours!

565
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:44,780
Hi, my name Borat. This my
friend, Luenell.

566
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,580
She is a prostitute.

567
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,100
You were funny on this wolf.
Everybody almost see your underpants.

568
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,980
I never rode a bull before.

569
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,220
You wanna come in for a little while?

570
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,220
I would like very much...

571
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,700
but I in love with a woman in Malibu.

572
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,460
It would be nice to her for me to...

573
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,940
If you ever in town again,
look me up.

574
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,580
If I ever in town again, Luenell,

575
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,420
I would very much like to
pay you for sex.

576
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,020
Good night, Luenells.
- Good night, Borat.

577
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,180
You say my name right.

578
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,300
...she recently explained...

579
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,380
...I very spontaneous...

580
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,820
I'm very spontaneous too.

581
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,580
I needed a gift to give to Pamela so that
she would grant me entry into her vagin.

582
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,620
Therefore, I convince Azamat to let me
film a report in a american store.

583
00:49:58,089 --> 00:50:01,500
Don't spend more than 3 dollars.
We're low on money.

584
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,780
This your shops?
- Right, this is my antique shop.

585
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,940
Why do you have so many things with a flag?
- We're honouring our heritage.

586
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,900
And in here.
What is this?

587
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,940
These are a number of collectibles,
I mean, this is...

588
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,580
A lamp. You know, to use in your home.
This is a chinese closet...

589
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,140
And this is just a little decorative
derrick.

590
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,540
And... do you think..
you know... when they...

591
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,860
You need help?
- No, it's ok.

592
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,100
I sorry.

593
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,860
Don't worry, my friend...
he can make glue...

594
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,540
I don't think you gonna be able to glue
that stuff back, I think you gonna have

595
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,540
to pay for it.

596
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,180
Ok, I have digital watch from the future.

597
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,420
I will give you this.
We are small than all of this.

598
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,060
You broke 425 $ worth of stuff.

599
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,100
160,...170...

600
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,020
...180.
- That's not enough.

601
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,380
Do you want a hair?
- No, I don't want any damn hair.

602
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,860
This is the best hair in Kazakstan. Feel the
quality. - I don't want your damn hair.

603
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,580
This hair from pubis. I can get you
2000 bags by next friday.

604
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,580
We don't use that stuff in this country.

605
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,700
Have you offered them pubic hair?

606
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:35,700
- Yes!

607
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,580
Just gimme another 20, that's good
enough.

608
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,500
It was a mistake.

609
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
- You screwed up again!

610
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,100
I didn't see the truck.

611
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,100
I slipped on it and that was it.

612
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,100
- Only an idiot could do this.

613
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,420
Would you have believe this
if I have told you?

614
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,860
All right, go, go!

615
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,000
You have ruined this documentary
and almost bankrupt us!

616
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,000
- So call the Ministry
and get more money.

617
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,000
What?!  If I did that they
would kill us!

618
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,500
California better be as good as you
say, or we're finished.

619
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,500
You bastard!

620
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
What's the matter with you?!

621
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,000
How dare you make
hand-party over Pamela!

622
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Why do you care who I
pleasure myself to?

623
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Because I love this woman!

624
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
She's the reason
we travel to California!

625
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,500
What?

626
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,500
You lied to me!

627
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,247
You lied about California!

628
00:52:45,692 --> 00:52:47,142
Lhal jsi o Kalifornii!

629
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,800
Eat my asshole!

630
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:44,000
- Mortgage Brokers Annual Banquet -

631
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,580
So.. bad news.

632
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,100
Azamat leave.

633
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,660
And he also decide to take all money
and also my passport.

634
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,620
And, he leave me all this bag.

635
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,020
It's a hen.

636
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:05,660
And ticket to Kazakstan,
but no passport.

637
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,860
But at least he's...

638
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,540
man enough to leave me...

639
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,140
my beautiful.

640
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:28,620
Which I have cleaned since last night.

641
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,980
And I decide to continue
making documentary.

642
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:43,620
Making without Azamat I think it will
be better.

643
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,020
I will have a.... without.

644
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,700
I only want 17 cents, please.

645
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,220
I have no car, no money and
no Azamat.

646
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:56,740
The only thing keep me going was my dream
of one day holding Pamela in my arms

647
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,660
and then making romance explosion
on her stomach.

648
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:14,940
Aventually, I managed to hike a hichings with group
of young scholars also travelling across country.

You fuck the shit out of me.
And then you never call them again.

659
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,420
Why you don't call them, because they
do not have a telephone, yes?

660
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:06,420
They do not have my respect.
- So what do you do here in America?

661
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:15,020
They film me travel across US and A.
- I don't know what you're saying, man.

662
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,060
Let's get drunk!

663
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,500
Let me tell you game we play.

Are women your slaves in Russia?
- No.

671
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,180
Do you have slaves here?

672
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,740
Our country, the minorites actually
have more power.

673
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:34,500
Anyone that is minority has the uppper hand.
We have the jews, anybody that's against mainstream.

What she doing?
- She sucking some dick, man.

683
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,780
This is not her.
- I guarantee you that she's gonna have it.

684
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,740
That's her, Borat.
- Borat, I'm sorry.

685
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,580
She is not her.
This is her?

686
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,820
I'm sure it's her.
Let it go.

688
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,860
Come on, Borat.
Stay with us, buddy.

689
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,620
We'll remember you always.

690
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,020
You in America now.
You'll make it. You keep going.

691
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:48,620
You're bigger than a woman.
You're better than a woman.

692
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,780
We'll always be behind you.
- Do not let a woman ever...

693
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:57,660
ever make you who you are.
- Goodbye, my friend.

694
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:46,000
How will I get home?

695
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,780

Go.

697
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,380
Run to freedom.

698
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,140
Go! Go!
I leave you alive.

699
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,900
It is good to be here.

700
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,540
This is my tenth penticostal camp
meeting, a decade.

701
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,500
The bottom line is we're a
christian nation now,

702
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,660
we were a christian nation in the beginning,
and we gonna always be a christian nation

703
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,220
until good Lord returns. Amin.

704
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,940
I didn't evolve out of a monkey.

705
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,780
I didn't use to be a...,
I is what I is.

706
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,180
I don't care what the devil is done to you
or what he's trying to do,

707
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,580
all you have to do is step
out of that... now,

708
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:02,260
and make your way down to this altar,
let's have a little old time church right now.

709
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,540
I need somebody to play for me right now.
Come on, sir.

710
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,180
The blood over my neighbour.
I believe the blood over my church.

711
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:14,380
I want you to help to save me, please.

712
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,420
Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman standing
right here next to me, his name is Bolak,

713
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,940
would you greet him with a great big Jesus
name for just a couple of minutes.

714
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:24,980
Thank you.

715
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,940
I have no friends, I am alone
in this country.

716
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,300
Nobody like me.
My only friend Azamat

717
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,060
he take my money and my bear and
he leave me alone.

718
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,580
Not only this, the woman I love,
the reason I travel across the country,

719
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,180
she have do something terrible on a boat.

720
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,180
And now I can never forgive her.

721
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,420
Is there anybody who can help me?
- Yes.

722
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,780
One that who can help you is who we

723
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,500
Do Jesus like me?

724
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:06,060

725
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:10,460
Do Jesus love my retard brother, Bilok?
- He loves your brother Bilok.

726
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:15,780
Do Jesus love my neighbour, Nusultan
Tuliakbai? - Yes, he loves everybody.

727
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,820
Nobody love my neighbour
Nusultan Taliakbai.

728
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,860
Can Jesus heal the pain that is
in my heart?

729
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,140
Jesus can heal the pain in your
heart.

730
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,780
Make him heal the pain that is in my heart.
- Lift your hands.

731
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,340
And begin to worship.
As we pray in the name of Jesus.

732
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:37,300
I think I near I see him.

733
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,940
Cleanse me, God, cleanse me.

734
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,700
.. the Lord in the name of Jesus.

735
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,540
...let that tongue go.
Here comes!

736
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,700
Let that tongue go!

737
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,740
I will forgive Pamela.
And I will go to California.

738
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,700
I will go to Malibu with me
and my friend, mister Jesus.

739
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,780
And together, we will take her.

740
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:37,420
I took a bus to Los Angeles with
some friends of mister Jesus.

741
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,660
Finally, I have arrive.

742
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,020
Happy times.

743
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,220
Azamat?

744
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You traitor!

745
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Look, I can explain!

746
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You attack me.
My mustache still tastes of your ass!

747
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Calm down.
Let me explain.

748
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,500
What did you do with the bear?

749
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,000
She ran off! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

750
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Hey! Fuck off, Death!

751
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
You need to calm yourself.

752
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,800
You have to calm down.

753
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,940
Ok, ok. Take it easy.

754
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,500
Well thats another fine mess
you've gotten me into.

755
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:40,420
I have not come to Hollywood
to fight a man dressed as Hitler.

756
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,220
I have come to make Pamela
Anderson my wife.

757
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,500
So I forgave Azamat.

758
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,233
I knew that you'd make it, Borat.

759
01:08:51,233 --> 01:08:54,700
I felt so bad that I prepared this.

760
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,700
It's everything I could find about Pamela.

761
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Last friday she appeared for a group
who are against cruelty toward animals.

762
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,000
<i>Against</i> cruelty toward animals?

763
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,000
And tomorrow she's doing autographs.

764
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,500
She wrote a book.

765
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
What? A woman has written a book?

766
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,200
Dr. Yamak would never believe this.

767
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,500
I know.

768
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:38,266
We will go to this historical event
and I will marry Pamela there.

769
01:09:38,266 --> 01:09:41,324
...but in the traditional Kazakh way.

770
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:44,124
Azmat, let's prepare the wedding sack.

771
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:48,000
You forgive me then?

772
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,500
Yes

773
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:08,000
Having learnt many lesson from US and A,
I will now teach America

774
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,340
how to have a wedding kazaky style.

775
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,540

776
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,380

778
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,380
Thanks for coming, you guys.

779
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,020
Shoud I make it to someone?

780
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:24,740
My name Borat Sagdiyev,
I son of... Sagdiyev, and

781
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:30,180
Boltok the rapist, my former husband of
Oksana Sagdiyev who was daughter of

782
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,220
...Tarekbai and Boltok the rapist.

783
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,060

784
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:43,420

787
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,180
Pamela, will you marry me?

788
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,140
No thanks, sorry.

789
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,380
Get your own wife!

790
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:19,220
Pamela... Don't worry...

791
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,860
I never stood... my wife.

792
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,860
Pamela, I will give you your own plow.

793
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,180
Put your hands around your back.
- OK.

794
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,500
Pamela, I am not attracted to you
any more!

795
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,000
NOT!

796
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,500
I was humiliated.

797
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,000
It was time for me to return
to New York,

798
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,500
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.

799
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,901
While I sat on the bus, I thought of my
journey over the past three weeks.

800
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,040
The great times.

801
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,160
The good times.

802
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,120
And the shit times.

803
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,280
Mainly there were shit times.

804
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,320
I have come to America to learn
lessons for Kazakstan.

805
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,040
But what had I learn?

806
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,600
Suddenly, I realized.

807
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,520
I have learned that if you chase a dream,

808
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,720
especially one with plastic chests,

809
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,080
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.

810
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
8 Months Later.

811
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,920
Welcome back in my town of Kusek.

812
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,840
Since I return, there has been
much improvements.

813
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,280
We no longer here running of the jew,
it's cruel.

814
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:50,880

815
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,840

Hey, Toktan. Hi 5!

816
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,560

817
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,520

He's still asshole.

818
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,400

819
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,800

820
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,000
