1
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,801
All right.

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:14,501
The date is 6/11/07
at 12:28 hours.

3
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,300
You have the right
to remain silent.

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,767
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
Do you understand
each of these rights as I
explained them to you?

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,167
- I do.
- Do you wish
to talk to us at this time?

7
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,667
I do.

8
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,501
So let's start
from the beginning.
You went in the bathroom.

9
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,234
I went in the bathroom.
I got in a stall,
sat down.

10
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:45,267
Your foot came towards mine,
mine came towards yours.

11
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:47,167
Was that natural?
I don't know.

12
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,667
Did we bump?
Yes, I think we did.

13
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,934
The next thing I knew,

14
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:55,934
under the bathroom divider

15
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:58,434
comes a card
that says "Police."

16
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:05,100
- What about your hand?
- What about my hand?

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,167
I could see
the gold wedding ring.
I could see that.

18
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:14,133
Have you been successful
in these bathrooms here before?

19
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,734
No, absolutely not.

20
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:18,300
I don't seek
activity in bathrooms.

21
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,834
You're not
being truthful to me.
I'm kind of disappointed

22
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,968
in you, Senator.
I'm real disappointed
right now.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,634
Sir, we deal with people
that lie to us every day.

24
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,767
- Gentlemen, so do I.
- I'm sure you do.

25
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,667
I've never had to bring
anybody to jail

26
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,701
because everybody's
been truthful to me.

27
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,300
I don't want you
to take me to jail.

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,133
I'm not gonna
take you to jail

29
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,567
as long as you're
being cooperative.
People vote for you.

30
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,734
I'm a respectable person
and I don't do these
kinds of--

31
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,701
Where's your respect
right now though?

32
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:02,033
I-I-- I am not gay.
I don't do these
kinds of things.

33
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,667
- I saw--
- I don't do
those things.

34
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:15,234
AT ITS FUNDAMENTAL CORE,
AT ITS BASE,

35
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,934
IT IS SO PROFOUNDLY
UNHEALTHY.

36
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:22,300
BECAUSE IT GOES BACK
TO THAT SIMPLE MANIFESTATION,

37
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,434
THAT SIMPLE
SHAKESPEAREAN QUOTE:

38
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:26,100
"UNTO THINE OWN SELF
BE TRUE."

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,300
YOU HAVE TO BE
TRUE TO YOURSELF.

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,667
AND THEN, GOD WILLING,
TRUE TO YOUR LOVED ONES,

41
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,400
TO YOUR COMMUNITY,
TO YOUR PUBLIC.

42
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,567
...turning out at Washington,
DC, where the report

43
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,400
of the arrest
of Senator Larry Craig

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,234
is generating
a massive media frenzy.

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,334
Breaking tonight, a Republican
senator busted by police.

46
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,534
Craig's arrest
was first reported
about 24 hours or so ago.

47
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:29,067
A day later "The Idaho
Statesman"

48
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,133
published the story
it had been holding.

49
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,567
Republican Senator
Larry Craig from Idaho

50
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,434
again will be having
a news conference
in 45 minutes.

51
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:40,434
Thank you all very much
for coming out today.

52
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:44,467
First, please let me
apologize

53
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:47,734
to my family,
friends and staff

54
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:52,667
and fellow Idahoans
for the cloud placed
over Idaho.

55
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,934
Senator, what happened
in Minneapolis?

56
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,567
Hey, what if you are gay?

57
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,267
Come out
of the closet.

58
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:00,400
It's all right, man.
Come on, Larry. Be gay!

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,300
I THINK IT'S VERY SAD.

60
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,834
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS
LIVED IN THE CLOSET
HIS WHOLE LIFE,

61
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,634
HAS PROBABLY
CHEATED ON HIS WIFE
ANY NUMBER OF TIMES.

62
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,868
IT'S A TWISTED KIND OF

63
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:13,167
PSYCHOLOGICAL THING
THAT HAPPENS.

64
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,667
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CLOSET
AND LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE,

65
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,634
IT MAKES YOU DO
CRAZY THINGS.

66
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,734
AND FOR A UNITED STATES
SENATOR

67
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:22,601
TO BE SOLICITING SEX
IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM

68
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,701
IS A CRAZY THING.

69
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,667
TO UNDERSTAND HIS STORY
AND ALL OF THESE STORIES,

70
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,033
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE THE CULTURE WAS.

71
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,534
IN 1955,
MY NEWSPAPER REPORTED

72
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:36,100
ON A GAY SEX SCANDAL

73
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,400
INVOLVING ALLEGEDLY
UNDERAGE MEN

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,667
AND POWERFUL PEOPLE
IN BOISE.

75
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,167
AMONG THE HEADLINES
ON OUR EDITORIAL PAGE

76
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,634
WAS ONE THAT READ
"CRUSH THE MONSTER,"

77
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:49,033
THE MONSTER BEING
HOMOSEXUAL PERVERSITY.

78
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:52,968
THAT WAS 1955.
LARRY CRAIG WAS
10 YEARS OLD.

79
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:56,234
AND I IMAGINE HIM
THINKING THAT

80
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,734
THAT WAS AN ABJECT LESSON
THAT HE NEEDED TO HEED,

81
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:03,634
THAT HE COULDN'T ASPIRE TO BE
A UNITED STATES SENATOR

82
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:05,701
AND BE GAY
AT THE SAME TIME.

83
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:08,234
EVERY TIME HE WAS
UP FOR ELECTION,

84
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,634
THE QUESTION WAS RAISED--

85
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,033
WILL SOMEONE RAISE
THE ISSUE?

86
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,434
Good evening.
The Capitol Hill investigation

87
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:16,834
of sex and drugs
which had existed mainly

88
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,534
in the congressional
rumor mill

89
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,734
today took on
the attributes of a serious
and spreading scandal.

90
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,934
The FBI formed
a special squad

91
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:27,100
to investigate allegations
of homosexual activity

92
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,434
between congressmen
and teenage pages.

93
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:32,501
One congressman came forward
after rumors surfaced

94
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,567
that he was involved
in the case.

95
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,067
I have always been
aggressive and upfront
with what I believe in.

96
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,100
And when I have
people telling me

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,067
that a whole series
of false accusations

98
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,901
are made against
my character,

99
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:47,067
frankly,
it makes me mad as hell.

100
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,868
MANY OF THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE GAY

101
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,033
WHO ARE IN PUBLIC SERVICE
SEEM TO THINK

102
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,400
THAT THEY'RE IMMUNE
FROM BEING EXPOSED.

103
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,234
AND THEY GO OUT.
THEY GO TO BARS.

104
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,367
THEY GO TO CLUBS.
THEY EVEN GO TO BATHHOUSES.

105
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:02,501
WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG
IN D.C. BACK IN THE '80s,

106
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:05,267
ONE OF MY FAVORITE
PLACES TO GO BACK THEN

107
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,334
WAS "THE FOLLIES."

108
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,868
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF MEN
I SAW THERE FROM TIME TO TIME

109
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,567
AND HE WAS ONE OF THOSE.

110
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,334
HE HAD TAKEN
NOTICE OF ME

111
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,467
AND THEN HE SAID,
"LET'S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"

112
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:20,000
AND I PROCEEDED
TO FOLLOW HIM

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
TO HIS HOUSE
ON CAPITOL HILL.

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,100
THERE WERE PICTURES
OF FAMILY AROUND

115
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,133
AND A CARD THAT WAS
ADDRESSED TO SUZANNE CRAIG.

116
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:34,834
WE THEN WOUND UP
PERFORMING ORAL SEX
ON EACH OTHER

117
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,868
AND THEN HE WANTED
TO FUCK ME.

118
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:39,567
ONCE HE HAD COME,

119
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,901
IT WAS EVERYTHING
TO GET ME BACK OUT OF THERE.

120
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:46,901
HE GRABBED ME
BY THE SHOULDER
AND VERY BOLDLY SAID,

121
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,534
"REMEMBER,
YOU NEVER SAW ME.

122
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,067
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE."

123
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,100
AND HE REACHED
INTO HIS POCKET,

124
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
TOOK OUT A $20 BILL,

125
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,067
SHOVED IT IN MY BACK POCKET
WITH ONE FINGER

126
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,567
AND SAID,
"JUST REMEMBER,

127
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:02,467
I CAN BUY AND SELL
YOUR ASS 1,000 TIMES."

128
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:05,868
Let me be clear:
I am not gay.

129
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:08,367
I never have been gay.

130
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,868
IT'S VERY OFTEN THOSE
SELF-HATING GAY PEOPLE WHO,

131
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:13,601
IN THE CLOSET,
ARE THE MOST VICIOUS

132
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,367
TOWARDS OTHER GAYS
AND LESBIANS

133
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,601
AS A WAY TO KIND
OF DEFLECT ATTENTION

134
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:20,100
FROM THEIR OWN ORIENTATION.

135
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:57,200
THERE IS NOT ONE
CIVIL RIGHTS LAW

136
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,801
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL
THAT EXISTS

137
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:02,701
TO PROTECT GAY,
LESBIAN, BISEXUAL

138
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:04,601
OR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.

139
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:07,801
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NOT ONE LAW.

140
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,667
THE FACT THAT SENATOR CRAIG
AND THOSE LIKE HIM

141
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,901
CAN ENGAGE IN HOMOSEXUAL
ACTIVITY ONE MINUTE

142
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:17,200
AND THEN TRY TO WRITE US
OUT OF EXISTENCE THE NEXT--

143
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,968
THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT HARSH
ENOUGH AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

144
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,467
He was a powerful force
on senate committees,

145
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,934
a solid family-values
conservative.

146
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,834
The American people
already know

147
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,701
that Bill Clinton is
a bad boy,

148
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,133
a naughty boy.
I'm going to speak out

149
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,868
for the citizens
of my state who,

150
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:35,901
in the majority,
think that Bill Clinton

151
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:39,601
is probably even
a nasty bad naughty boy.

152
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,000
But in October 2006,

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,901
eight months before
the senator's arrest
in Minneapolis,

154
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,834
a gay activist named
Michael Rogers

155
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:50,100
who makes it
his business to out
conservative politicians

156
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,133
wrote in his blog that
he'd interviewed several men

157
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,434
who'd claimed to have had sex
with Senator Larry Craig.

158
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:59,834
IN OCTOBER OF '06
I OUTED LARRY CRAIG.

159
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:03,200
I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAD SEX
WITH LARRY CRAIG IN A RESTROOM
AT UNION STATION.

160
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,167
THAT, TO ME, IS THE CRUX
OF THE CASE RIGHT THERE.

161
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,334
RIGHT NOW I HAVE
A NUMBER OF OPEN FILES

162
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,767
OF FOLKS THAT
I'M ACTIVELY LOOKING AT,

163
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,133
FROM A U.S. CABINET OFFICIAL

164
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,567
TO OFFICES OF SOME PRETTY
ANTIGAY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

165
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,133
SO I'M HERE.
I'M GETTING READY

166
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,501
TO GO ON "HANNITY & COLMES"
TONIGHT AT 9:00.

167
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:23,300
DAVID'S WITH ME,
HELPING ME OUT ON SOME
OF MY TALKING POINTS.

168
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,534
- SAY HI, DAVID.
- HELLO.

169
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:28,200
CAN'T LET THE RIGHT WING BE
THE ONLY ONES WITH THE FLAG.

170
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,334
I ACTUALLY ONCE HAD SOMEBODY
ASK ME ON FOX NEWS,

171
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,067
"ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO WEAR THAT FLAG?"
"YEAH, I AM."

172
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:39,167
SO, DAVID, WHY DON'T YOU
FIRE ME A FEW QUESTIONS

173
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,434
LIKE HOW HANNITY'S
GOING TO DO THAT, YOU KNOW?

174
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:45,234
"MIKE, HOW IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING
DIFFERENT THAN McCARTHYISM?"

175
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,300
- THIS IS McCARTHYISM!"
- FIRST OF ALL,

176
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,167
SEAN, McCARTHY
WAS A LIAR.

177
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,300
McCARTHY PUT OUT
FALSE INFORMATION

178
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,334
- ABOUT AMERICANS.
- OH NO!

179
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:56,033
THAT'S JUST THE SAUCE.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CUT YOU
OFF RIGHT THERE.

180
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,267
- MIKE-- MIKE-- MIKE--
- SEAN-- SEAN-- SEAN--

181
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:01,300
- WE'RE OUTTA TIME.
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

182
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,000
YOUR MOUTH WILL OPEN,
BUT NOTHING WILL COME
OUT OF IT.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,467
Breaking news tonight.
Fox News has confirmed

184
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,434
that Senator Larry Craig
may be reconsidering his
decision to resign.

185
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,300
Joining us now
with reaction to this story

186
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,767
is blogger Mike Rogers,
who called for an investigation

187
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:16,100
into Craig last year.
All right, from the beginning.

188
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,300
HI, SEAN, AND GOOD EVENING.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.

189
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
Larry Craig is a hypocrite.

190
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,868
He is an antigay
closeted individual
who has sex with other men.

191
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:27,601
I read what you had
and apparently this tape
of this one guy

192
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,701
that "The Idaho Statesman"
followed up on.

193
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,234
- It was a-- wait,
hang on a second.
- It's not one guy, Sean.

194
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:35,467
It was an anonymous source--
why doesn't the guy go
on the record?

195
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,467
Sean, it's not one guy.
It's now three or four.

196
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,734
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

197
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:44,434
I HAVE HEARD PHYSICAL
CHARACTERISTICS REPEATED TO ME
FROM VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS.

198
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,968
I don't know
about Senator Craig.
I'm going to be honest,

199
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:49,734
- I don't have the details.
There is suspicion--
- I DO, I DO.

200
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:53,534
Are there others in the same
category as Larry Craig

201
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:56,234
who you think whose names
will be forthcoming

202
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,734
because of your work?

203
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,567
ABSOLUTELY.
THERE ARE NAMES
OF THE FOLKS IN CONGRESS

204
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:03,901
IN HIGH POSITIONS OF POWER
WHO ARE LEADING A SECRET
DOUBLE LIFE.

205
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:08,000
And what I would say to Sean is,
Sean, where do you stand
with Larry Craig?

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,267
And will you stand
in the same position

207
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,300
if other
two-lived hypocrites

208
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,367
ARE EXPOSED?
BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU

209
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,000
THAT THERE IS NO SHORTAGE.

210
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,467
MY FIRST VERY BIG CASE
WAS THIS CONGRESSMAN

211
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,601
IN VIRGINIA BY THE NAME
OF ED SCHROCK.

212
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,367
A MONTH LATER, I GOT A TIP

213
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,968
THAT THERE WAS
A CONGRESSMAN WHO WAS GAY

214
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:50,234
AND THAT HE WAS USING
AN INTERACTIVE PHONE
DATING SERVICE

215
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,901
TO FIND WHAT MAY BE
KNOWN AS INSTA-SEX,

216
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:55,200
OR, YOU KNOW, TO HOOK UP
WITH SOMEBODY FOR SEX.

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,534
AND THE FIRST THING
I SAID TO THE PERSON WAS,
"THIS IS INSANE.

218
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,434
I CAN'T PUT UP
THAT A CONGRESSMAN

219
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:03,033
IS USING AN INTERACTIVE
PHONE SERVICE WITHOUT PROOF.

220
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,067
I MEAN, THAT'S A HELL
OF A CHARGE TO LEVY."

221
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:09,334
AND HE SAYS, "I HAVE SEVERAL
RECORDINGS OF THE CONGRESSMAN

222
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:12,467
GOING ON THE PHONE LINE
TO MEET A MAN FOR SEX.

223
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,067
AND THEY'RE VERY EXPLICIT."
AND I WAS LIKE, WOW!

224
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,634
SO I TOOK THE RECORDINGS
AND WENT AHEAD

225
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:55,033
AND REPORTED
ON ED SCHROCK ON MY BLOG.

226
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,901
A case of the moral hunter
becoming the moral hunted.

227
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,567
Congressman Edward Schrock,
a Virginia Republican

228
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,334
who once co-sponsored a bill
to ban same-sex marriage,

229
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,934
dropped out of his bid
for re-election last month.

230
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:08,868
HE NEVER ADMITTED
THAT THEY WERE HIM,

231
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:10,934
BUT HE RESIGNED
FROM HIS RE-ELECTION.

232
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,734
THERE IT IS.

233
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:17,200
I AM GOING TO TELL PEOPLE
WHO THESE HORRIBLE TRAITORS ARE.

234
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,400
AND THEY ARE TRAITORS
TO THEIR PEOPLE.
I BELIEVE THAT.

235
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
AND I FELT
THAT IT WAS TIME

236
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,133
FOR ME TO START
REPORTING THAT AS HYPOCRISY.

237
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,200
NOT OUTING PEOPLE
WHO ARE GAY,

238
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,334
BUT REPORTING
ON INDIVIDUALS

239
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,434
WHO ARE WORKING
AGAINST THE COMMUNITY

240
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,300
THAT THEY THEN EXPECT
TO PROTECT THEM.

241
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,667
BE WAITING IN FRONT
OF 1600 BROADWAY.
THAT'S PERFECT.

242
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,100
MICHAEL HAS DECIDED
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

243
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,067
CHASING US FOR YEARS.

244
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,868
AND WHAT MICHAEL REPRESENTS IS,
"WE'RE GONNA CHASE BACK."

245
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,367
NOW THAT UPSETS THE RULES

246
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,234
BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS
THE HOUNDS CHASE THE FOXES.

247
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:54,534
WELL, THIS FOX IS
CHASING THE HOUNDS.

248
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,601
AND IT'S GOT THEM
ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE.

249
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,300
AND I SAY
MORE POWER TO HIM.

250
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
I THINK OUTING

251
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,467
IS A...

252
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,701
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG

253
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:10,534
AND DISHONEST THING TO DO.

254
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:14,501
NO ONE CAN EVER KNOW
OR UNDERSTAND

255
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:18,067
THE PERSONAL JOURNEY
THAT AN INDIVIDUAL TAKES

256
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:22,534
TO ACCEPTING THE FACT
THAT THEY ARE GAY OR LESBIAN.

257
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:25,834
I JUST FEEL SYMPATHY
WHEN THEY ARE EXPOSED THAT WAY.

258
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,934
I THINK EVERY GAY PERSON
KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE

259
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:33,834
TO HAVE YOUR PRIVACY
RIPPED APART.

260
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,133
THERE IS A RIGHT TO PRIVACY,
BUT NOT A RIGHT TO HYPOCRISY.

261
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:39,367
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT
THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE LAW

262
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,067
BE SUBJECT TO THE LAW.

263
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:44,334
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT
TO LAWS WILL MAKE HARSH LAWS

264
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,601
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
TO LIVE WITH THEM.

265
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,701
HAVING THE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE THE LAW

266
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,734
BE FULLY COVERED BY THE LAW

267
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,534
IS A SAFEGUARD
AGAINST UNFAIRNESS.

268
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:56,667
THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE
ON WHICH OUR DEMOCRACY
IS IN PART BUILT

269
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,601
THAT GAY PEOPLE
WHO SUPPORT HOMOPHOBIA
ARE VIOLATING.

270
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,367
And now to Campaign 2006.

271
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:09,968
He's been the state's
attorney general and education
commissioner and on Tuesday,

272
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:12,467
Charlie Crist hopes
to be elected governor.

273
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,300
Charlie Crist--

274
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,133
50, single, no kids,
doesn't own a home,

275
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,234
wants to live in
the governor's mansion.

276
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:20,734
I'm a consistent
conservative.

277
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:22,934
I can continue to stand
for the things that
I believe in.

278
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:26,200
At a stop in Miami,
the tone was urgent.

279
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,701
I need you to get it out there.
I need your vote.

280
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,734
I need your heart.
I need your passion.

281
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,734
Get out there,
get it done.

282
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:35,167
Viva Crist.  Let's win.
God bless you.

283
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,601
I believe that marriage
is a sacred relationship

284
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:50,234
between a man
and a woman.

285
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:52,734
I've always felt that way
and I still believe that now.

286
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:56,901
Marriage is a relationship
like my mother and father had,

287
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,834
like I had
before I got divorced.

288
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,334
It is one of those
unique institutions--

289
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:03,834
not only in America,
but across the world--

290
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,033
where a man and a woman
commit to one another.

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,701
Please leave a message.

292
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:39,968
HI, BRUCE.
THIS IS BOB NORMAN
WITH "NEW TIMES."

293
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:45,601
I AM A JOURNALIST WHO WORKS
IN THE ALTERNATIVE REALM.

294
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:50,234
I DO THE STORIES THAT
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
DOESN'T DO.

295
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:53,534
I HAD WRITTEN
ABOUT MARK FOLEY IN 2003.

296
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:56,868
THAT HAD GOTTEN A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION.

297
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:59,834
THAT WAS WHAT LED TO
MY INVOLVEMENT WITH CRIST

298
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,834
IN TERMS OF WRITING
ABOUT CRIST.

299
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,534
A SOURCE CONTACTED ME
VIA EMAIL.

300
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,767
THIS SOURCE WAS
AT A DINNER PARTY

301
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,100
AT A MULTIMILLION
DOLLAR MANSION

302
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,701
IN FORT LAUDERDALE.

303
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:14,534
AND HE WAS WITH A YOUNG STAFFER
NAMED JASON WETHERINGTON.

304
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,634
JASON WAS A YOUNG
REPUBLICAN STAFFER

305
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,334
WORKING FOR
KATHERINE HARRIS,

306
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:26,067
THE FAMOUS MASCARA'D QUEEN
OF THE 2000 ELECTION.

307
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:30,634
JASON SAID THAT HE HAD
MET CHARLIE CRIST,

308
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:35,734
HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM--
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM,

309
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:40,868
AND HE EXPECTED AFTER CRIST
WON THE ELECTION,

310
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:43,834
HE WOULD GET AN APPOINTMENT
TO CRIST'S ADMINISTRATION

311
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,968
AND THAT HE HAD HOPED
TO CONTINUE THE RELATIONSHIP.

312
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:50,400
I FELT THAT THIS SOURCE
WAS COMPLETELY EARNEST

313
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,267
AND HONEST.
SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING
TO GO SEE JASON WETHERINGTON.

314
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:59,067
HE WAS VERY, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE LINE OF QUESTIONING.

315
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:02,234
THAT WAS OBVIOUS.
HE INITIALLY SAID

316
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:05,534
THAT HE HADN'T SAID THAT
AT THE DINNER PARTY.

317
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,767
THEN HE HEDGED
THAT A BIT.

318
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:11,501
"WELL, YOU KNOW,
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRINKING."
THAT KIND OF THING.

319
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,501
HE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET

320
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:17,100
AND JUST SAID,
"DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO."

321
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,467
I know you've addressed
this question

322
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:22,501
once or twice before--
the whisper campaign
by your opponents

323
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,300
about whether
or not you're gay.

324
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,434
Now I don't care
whether you are or not--

325
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,167
It's fine.

326
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:38,267
AND THEN I GOT
ANOTHER PHONE CALL.

327
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:42,601
IT WAS FROM ANOTHER FRIEND
OF JASON WETHERINGTON'S.

328
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,400
THERE WAS A DINNER PARTY
THAT WAS HELD AT MY HOME

329
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,000
AND JASON WAS AT THE PARTY.

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,501
HE BEGAN TO ALLUDE
THAT THERE WAS A RELATIONSHIP

331
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:54,267
BETWEEN CRIST AND HIM
AND THAT IT WAS PHYSICAL.

332
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,267
NOW I'VE GOT TWO SOURCES

333
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,334
WHO ARE SAYING
THE EXACT SAME THING

334
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,167
WHO DON'T KNOW
EACH OTHER.

335
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,868
IT WAS REVEALED
THAT NIGHT

336
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:05,200
THAT HE-- THAT CRIST
DID HAVE A PARTNER

337
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,367
OR THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN
IN HIS LIFE.

338
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:09,367
IT WAS BRUCE
CARLTON JORDAN.

339
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:12,200
HE WAS FRIENDS
WITH JAY VASS,

340
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,901
A VETERAN
REPUBLICAN PILOT

341
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:17,501
AND JAY VASS'S GIRLFRIEND
DEE DEE HALL.

342
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:19,534
...the sworn statement
you give

343
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,200
will be the truth,
the whole truth

344
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,267
- and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
- Yes.

345
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:25,567
Do you know a gentleman
by the name of Bruce Jordan?

346
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,367
Yes, I do.

347
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,667
Did he tell you
that he was gay?

348
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,267
Yes. He brought up
the fact

349
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,167
that he was
in a relationship...

350
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,400
that he was involved
with Charlie.

351
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,100
I was like, "Okay."
He just stated his first name.

352
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,100
And he said,
"Maybe you've heard of him."
He said, "It's Charlie Crist."

353
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,801
I CONTACTED CHARLIE
ON THE PHONE

354
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:52,200
AND ASKED HIM DIRECTLY
ABOUT JASON WETHERINGTON

355
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
AND, UH...

356
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
AND BRUCE CARLTON JORDAN.

357
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,200
CHARLIE VERY SMOOTHLY
DENIED THAT HE KNEW

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
OR REMEMBERED KNOWING
EITHER ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.

359
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:28,634
The Governor-elect
of the State of Florida--
Charlie Crist!

360
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,200
Nearly 4,000 children are
waiting to be adopted

361
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,634
in Florida, but the state is
still turning away couples
looking to adopt.

362
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,501
Why?
Because they're gay.

363
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,367
Frank Gill is a gay
foster parent

364
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,300
who wants
to make it permanent.

365
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,901
Gill and his partner
have been foster parents
for four years

366
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:53,634
to these two boys,
now four and eight
years old.

367
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:56,534
They were neglected
and abandoned by their
birth parents.

368
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:59,767
Florida's the only state
in the country that
bans gay adoption.

369
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:03,400
Governor Charlie Crist has
supported the prohibition
on gay adoption

370
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,100
and tells "The Herald" he has
"no second thoughts" on that.

371
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:15,567
WELCOME BACK.
I'M MICHELANGELO SIGNORILE

372
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,567
ON SIRIUS OUTQ 109.

373
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,667
MIKE ROGERS,
THE MOST FEARED MAN
ON CAPITOL HILL

374
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,000
ACCORDING TO
"THE WASHINGTON POST,"

375
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,367
IS NOW HERE IN THE STUDIO.

376
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,400
HE IS THE MAN WHO GOT
THE BALL ROLLING

377
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,667
ON LARRY CRAIG
THE SENATOR FROM IDAHO.

378
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,701
- WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
- I HEARD YOU'RE GAY.

379
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,901
ARE YOU GONNA OUT ME NOW?

380
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:37,334
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

381
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:39,767
THIS IS ALWAYS A QUESTION
THAT PEOPLE PUT OUT THERE:

382
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:42,801
ARE YOU ONLY FOCUSED
ON REPUBLICANS

383
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,968
OR ARE THERE CLOSETED
DEMOCRATS DOING DAMAGE

384
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:47,000
AND HOW COME THEY'RE
NOT BEING EXPOSED?

385
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,100
WHAT I TELL FOLKS
IS THE REASON THAT 90%
OF THE CASES OR SO

386
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
ARE REPUBLICANS
SAYS A LOT MORE

387
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,834
ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
THAN IT DOES MY WORK.

388
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,200
AND WHAT WE'RE SHOWING
IS IT'S THE CLOSET.

389
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,734
IT'S NOT HOMOSEXUALITY.

390
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,834
IT'S THE CLOSET THAT
BREEDS THAT KIND OF--

391
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:03,367
- AND THE CLOSET OF HYPOCRISY.
- ABSOLUTELY.

392
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:06,868
AND IT HAS GIVEN A LOT
OF CREDIBILITY TO THE WORK
YOU BEGAN A DECADE AGO.

393
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,701
I WENT TO JOURNALISM SCHOOL,

394
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:13,100
LEFT, THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA GET THIS GREAT
SERIOUS NEWS JOB,

395
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,067
AND WOUND UP WORKING
FOR A P.R. FIRM

396
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,968
THAT SPECIALIZED
IN GOSSIP.

397
00:22:17,968 --> 00:22:20,467
AND IT WAS IN THAT WORLD,
IN THE '80s,

398
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,300
THAT I SAW HOW
THE GOSSIP WORLD

399
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,734
WOULD GLAMORIZE
HETEROSEXUALITY,

400
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:28,067
BUT ANYTHING ABOUT
ANY CELEBRITY

401
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:31,501
WHO WAS SECRETLY GAY,
WE WOULD HELP THEM COVER.

402
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:35,367
IT WAS THE ONE AREA WHERE
THEY DIDN'T DEMAND THE TRUTH.

403
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,667
EVERYWHERE ELSE, THEY WANTED
TO KNOW WHO WAS DATING WHO,

404
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,400
BUT WHEN IT CAME
TO GAY CELEBRITIES,

405
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,734
IT WAS ACCEPTED AND UNDERSTOOD
THAT YOU COVERED FOR THEM

406
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,400
AND YOU ACTUALLY
PUT OUT LIES.

407
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,400
I STARTED TO WRITE A COLUMN
CALLED "GOSSIP WATCH."

408
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,067
IT WAS A WATCH
OF THE GOSSIP COLUMNS.

409
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:58,234
IT WAS A LOOK AT HOW
THE GOSSIP COLUMNS,

410
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:01,067
WHICH ARE READ
BY MORE PEOPLE

411
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,934
THAN ANY OTHER FORUM
IN THE MEDIA,

412
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:06,767
ARE COMPLETELY
CONSTRUCTED AND CREATED

413
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,200
TO GLAMORIZE
HETEROSEXUALITY

414
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,901
AND KEEP HOMOSEXUALITY
INVISIBLE.

415
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,033
IN 1990 MALCOLM FORBES,

416
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:20,400
THE MULTIMILLIONAIRE PUBLISHER
OF "FORBES" MAGAZINE,

417
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,534
DIED AND THE MEDIA
IMMEDIATELY,

418
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,601
IN ALL OF HIS
OBITUARIES,

419
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:30,968
HELD HIM UP AS
A VERY SUCCESSFUL CAPITALIST

420
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:35,000
WHO WAS DATING
ELIZABETH TAYLOR FOR YEARS.

421
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,934
AND YET, THEY LEFT OUT
THE FACT THAT HE WAS GAY.

422
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,234
IT TOOK YEARS,
IN FACT,

423
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:43,234
FOR "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

424
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:46,033
TO FINALLY SAY THAT
MALCOLM FORBES WAS GAY.

425
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,501
I FELT THAT
THE HISTORICAL RECORD

426
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:51,167
HAD TO BE CORRECTED
IMMEDIATELY.

427
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,467
Michelangelo Signorile
is his name.

428
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:01,300
He's the one who outed
Malcolm Forbes after
his death,

429
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
writing that Forbes,

430
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,734
the very symbol of
establishment capitalism,

431
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:08,367
secretly was gay.

432
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:11,133
I'm certainly not doing
anything wrong. I think
in 20 years from now,

433
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,200
we're gonna look back
and say, "What the hell was
the big deal about?"

434
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,701
WELCOME BACK.
11 MINUTES BEFORE THE HOUR,

435
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:19,200
I'M MICHELANGELO SIGNORILE.
I'M HERE WITH MIKE ROGERS

436
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,167
IN STUDIO AND WE'RE
TAKING YOUR CALLS.

437
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,200
YOU'RE ON "THE MICHELANGELO
SIGNORILE SHOW."

438
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
What happens when
you guys expose

439
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,801
all of the closeted people
in the conservative movement?

440
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,334
You get all
the hypocrites out of there,
what have you got left

441
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:36,868
but just
the solid non-hypocritical
festival of hate?

442
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:40,767
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
MIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THANKS FOR THAT, GREG.

443
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:44,334
IN MOST CASES WHEN SOMEBODY
IS REPORTED ON, THEY BECOME
A PRO-GAY LEGISLATOR.

444
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:47,734
BUT "IS THERE A BACKLASH?"
WHICH IS WHAT HE'S ASKING.

445
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:50,267
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAVE
JUST THIS CORE OF HATE?

446
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:52,534
WELL, BARNEY FRANK
PUTS IT BEST:

447
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:56,400
"THE REASON PEOPLE HATE
GAY PEOPLE IS BECAUSE THEIR
LEADERS TELL THEM TO."

448
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,033
I THINK THAT EACH ONE
OF THESE OUTINGS

449
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:02,167
PUTS A LITTLE CHINK
IN THE ARMOR

450
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,934
OF THE ANTI-GAY SO-CALLED
"FAMILY VALUES" MOVEMENT.

451
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,801
I, RONALD REAGAN,
DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR...

452
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:10,801
"THAT I WILL
FAITHFULLY EXECUTE

453
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,033
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES."

454
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:15,133
...THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY
EXECUTE THE OFFICE

455
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,200
OF PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

456
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
THE ELECTION OF
RONALD REAGAN BROUGHT US

457
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,434
A FAIRLY LARGE NUMBER

458
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,267
OF HIGH-PLACED
BUT CLOSETED GAY MEN

459
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,167
IN THE REPUBLICAN
ADMINISTRATION

460
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,501
WHO FAILED
TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS

461
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:31,534
THE EPIDEMIC OF AIDS.

462
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:43,067
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES

463
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:47,367
WOULD NOT EVEN SAY
THE WORD "AIDS" PUBLICALLY

464
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,567
AS LATE AS 1987.

465
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,300
REAGAN HAD BEEN ELECTED

466
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,100
ON THIS FUNDAMENTALIST
CONSERVATIVE ROLE IN AMERICA

467
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,701
LED BY THE NATIONAL
CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL
ACTION COMMITTEE.

468
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:01,234
THE PRESIDENT OF NCPAC
WAS TERRY DOLAN!

469
00:26:01,234 --> 00:26:04,734
TERRY IS DANCING AT FLAMINGO
ON THE WEEKEND IN NEW YORK

470
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:06,734
AND PROPPING UP

471
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:09,634
THE MOST RIGHT-WING HOMOPHOBES
IN AMERICA BY DAY.

472
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,901
THIS IS A MAN WHO'S
RAISING MONEY

473
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:13,868
TO KILL US--
TERRY DOLAN.

474
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,901
I WENT TO A COCKTAIL PARTY
IN WASHINGTON AND THERE HE WAS.

475
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:21,367
I THREW A DRINK
IN HIS FACE.

476
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:24,667
I SAID, "HOW DARE YOU COME
TO A PARTY OF GAY PEOPLE

477
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,901
AFTER WHAT YOU'RE
DOING TO US?!"

478
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,734
RICHARD KRAUSE--
THE HEAD OF THE N.I.H.,

479
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:32,901
IN CHARGE OF ALL THE INFECTIOUS
DISEASES AT THE TIME
OF ADVENT OF AIDS,

480
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,467
WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING

481
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:38,467
THAT WAS REQUIRED
BY THE SITUATION,
ANYTHING HEROIC,

482
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:41,334
SIMPLY BECAUSE
HE WAS AFRAID HE'D SPEND
HIS ENTIRE CAREER

483
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,367
TRYING NOT TO BE
IDENTIFIED WITH US.

484
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:47,667
EVERYONE KNOWS RICHARD IS GAY.
HE'S GOT PICTURES OF BOYFRIENDS
ON HIS DRESSER AT HOME.

485
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:51,801
SO THAT CLOSET CAN KILL
OTHER PEOPLE AND IT HAS.

486
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:54,434
BEFORE AIDS,

487
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:58,000
WE WERE CONCERNED
WITH PRIVACY.

488
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,734
AFTER AIDS,
THAT WAS COLLUSION
WITH GENOCIDE--

489
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:02,334
BEING SILENT,
BEING INVISIBLE--

490
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:04,667
PARTICULARLY IN AN ELECTED
OR APPOINTED OFFICIAL,

491
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,033
PARTICULARLY
IN AN ELECTED
OR APPOINTED OFFICIAL

492
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:10,234
WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY
IT IS TO RESPOND TO THIS
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS--

493
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:13,200
AND THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE
THEY WERE CLOSETED GAYS.

494
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,200
# COME ON ALONG
AND LISTEN TO #

495
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,934
# THE LULLABY
OF BROADWAY. #

496
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:36,100
ED KOCH WAS MAYOR
OF NEW YORK CITY

497
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,000
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO LIFT
A HAND TO HELP GAY PEOPLE.

498
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,434
HE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING

499
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:43,434
THAT WAS REQUIRED
BY THE SITUATION.

500
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:45,534
FUCK YOU.

501
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:47,767
SAN FRANCISCO'S AIDS
ORGANIZATION

502
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,601
WAS GETTING MONEY FROM
THEIR MAYOR IN HUGE AMOUNTS.

503
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,100
WE WEREN'T GETTING ANYTHING.

504
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,033
AND IT PISSED ME OFF
MORE AND MORE AND MORE

505
00:27:55,033 --> 00:27:56,968
BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW
HE WAS GAY.

506
00:27:56,968 --> 00:28:00,734
NOW ED KOCH HAD ALWAYS
CONSISTENTLY IN HIS PUBLIC LIFE

507
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:04,701
REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY.

508
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:08,367
WHEN ED'S THIRD OR FOURTH
TERM WAS COMING UP

509
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:10,367
I WAS ASKED THEN

510
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,400
BY PRESS PEOPLE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

511
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,267
THAT RICHARD NATHAN
WAS ED'S FORMER LOVER.

512
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:20,033
AND SO I STONEWALLED THE PRESS
DURING THAT PRIMARY RACE

513
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,868
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
THE VOICE THAT OUTED
A CANDIDATE.

514
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,167
ABOUT '74 OR '75,
WHEN HE WAS IN CONGRESS,

515
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,400
ED KOCH WAS PLANNING
TO RUN FOR MAYOR

516
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,901
AND HE STARTED HAVING
SUNDAY-NIGHT POTLUCK SUPPERS

517
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:38,868
AT HIS APARTMENT
IN THE VILLAGE.

518
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:42,400
ONE NIGHT, RICHARD AND I
WERE AT ED'S HOUSE

519
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,067
AND AS WE WERE DEPARTING,
ED SAID, "OH, RICHARD, STAY."

520
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:50,267
AND RICHARD SAID,
"NO, ED.I HAVE TO GO.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER."

521
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:53,000
SO AS WE WERE WALKING ACROSS
WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK,

522
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,868
I SAID, "WHAT WAS
THAT ALL ABOUT?

523
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:58,667
YOU AND THE CONGRESSMAN?"
AND HE SAID, "WE'RE HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP."

524
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:02,033
AND I SAID, "YOU MEAN,
LIKE A 'RELATIONSHIP'?"

525
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:06,200
AND HE SAID, "YEAH."
AND I SAID, "WHY?

526
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,067
YOU'RE A NICE-LOOKING
YOUNG MAN.

527
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,701
HE'S AN OLD AND NOT TERRIBLY
ATTRACTIVE MAN."

528
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:14,300
AND HE SAID,
"IT'S A REAL APHRODISIAC

529
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,467
WHEN YOU GET A CALL
FROM CONGRESS SAYING,

530
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:19,367
'I'M COMING IN.  LET'S HAVE
DINNER FRIDAY NIGHT.'"

531
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:24,501
THE DAY ED KOCH
WAS INAUGURATED,
THERE WAS A PRIVATE PARTY.

532
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:27,634
WE WATCHED ED
COME IN WITH BESS,

533
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,701
CLUTCHING
THEIR PINKIES.

534
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,968
AND RICHARD SAID,
"I'M OUT OF HERE.

535
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:34,634
IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR TO ME
THAT I HAVE TO LEAVE TOWN,

536
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,634
OR AT LEAST
NOT BE IN THE PICTURE,

537
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:38,667
SO I'VE DECIDED TO MOVE
TO CALIFORNIA."

538
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:44,300
ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO
AFTER I GOT TO KNOW DICK,

539
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,467
HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING
HE WANTED ME TO KNOW.

540
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:50,334
OVER THE COURSE
OF A COUPLE OF YEARS,

541
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:53,601
HE HAD BEEN LOVERS
OF ED KOCH

542
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:57,300
AND AFTER THEY BROKE UP,
ED HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO WORK IN NEW YORK.

543
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,367
NO INSTANCE
OF HOMOPHOBIA

544
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,367
HURT HIM MORE

545
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:06,501
THAN THE TREATMENT BY THE MAN
HE WAS IN LOVE WITH.

546
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:12,000
I WAS AT A FUNDRAISING EVENT
IN LOS ANGELES IN '81.

547
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,667
A MAN CAME UP TO ME
AND SAID, "I'M DICK NATHAN."

548
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:18,100
THEN HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME
ABOUT HIS AFFAIR WITH ED KOCH

549
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,634
AND WHAT A PIG HE WAS,
AND THAT HE WAS PREPARED FINALLY

550
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:23,567
TO COME AND ANNOUNCE PUBLICALLY
THAT ED KOCH WAS GAY,

551
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,467
WHICH WAS WHAT WE NEEDED.

552
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,467
HE CAME TO NEW YORK.

553
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:30,334
AND, OH BOY,
WE WERE BESIDE OURSELVES.

554
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:34,601
AND DICK NATHAN CAME
AND SAID, "I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T DO IT."

555
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,868
DICK WAS WORRIED
ABOUT HIS SAFETY.

556
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,734
AND DICK DID FEEL
THAT IF HE WENT PUBLIC,

557
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:43,000
HE WOULD SUFFER.

558
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,300
DICK WAS THREATENED,
PHYSICALLY THREATENED,

559
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,767
AND FINANCIALLY.
AND HE CAME AND HE WAS TERRIFIED

560
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:49,834
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
LEAVING THE CITY.

561
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:35,434
I FIRST MET JIM McCRERY
IN THE FALL OF 1975

562
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:37,534
AT THE SIGMA NU
FRATERNITY HOUSE.

563
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:41,267
I KNEW FROM THE MOMENT WE MET
THAT HE WAS INTERESTED.

564
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:45,367
AND IT WAS THE NEXT SUMMER
DURING SUMMER SCHOOL

565
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,334
THAT IT BEGAN.

566
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:50,400
THE MOMENT I SPOKE TO GARY,
I KNEW HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,

567
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,934
BUT NONETHELESS,
FOR HIS OWN PROTECTION

568
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,968
AND FOR THE PROTECTION
OF THE MAGAZINE,

569
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:58,601
WE WANTED TO SOURCE IT
AS THOUGH "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
WAS DOING IT.

570
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,634
SO WE FOUND
SEVERAL PEOPLE

571
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:03,167
WHO ALSO HAD
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS
WITH JIM McCRERY

572
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,534
WHO HAD SIGNED
LEGAL AFFIDAVITS.

573
00:32:05,534 --> 00:32:08,968
JIM IS SEVEN YEARS
MY SENIOR.

574
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,467
HE WOULD JUST APPEAR
AT THE FRATERNITY HOUSE

575
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,234
FROM TIME-- YOU KNOW,
HIS ANNUAL PILGRIMAGE,

576
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,000
SO TO SPEAK, IN THE FALL.

577
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,701
JIM USED
THE FRATERNITY HOUSE
AS HIS GAY BAR.

578
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:23,200
HE WOULD FIND YOUNG MEN

579
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,267
WHO HE THOUGHT
HE HAD A GOOD CHANCE

580
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:27,634
AT HAVING
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH.

581
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:30,701
JIM WOULD COME
INTO MY ROOM AT NIGHTTIME,

582
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,400
COME TOUCH ME A LITTLE
INAPPROPRIATELY AT TIMES.

583
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,367
HE WAS MY FIRST
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP,

584
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:40,334
AS HE WAS A NUMBER
OF MY FRATERNITY BROTHERS.

585
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,734
McCRERY WAS AMBITIOUS
TO THE POINT

586
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:46,667
WHERE HE WOULD MAKE
MORAL COMPROMISES.

587
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,734
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THAT MORAL COMPROMISING

588
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,067
IS ABOUT
YOUR OWN IDENTITY?

589
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:55,434
THE JIM I HAD--
AND EVERYONE HAD
ALWAYS KNOWN

590
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:57,033
HAD BEEN AN ATHEIST.

591
00:32:57,033 --> 00:33:00,534
HE HAD GIVEN SPEECHES
ABOUT HIS LACK OF BELIEF.

592
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:03,200
HE WAS A DEMOCRAT,
VERY LIBERAL,

593
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,167
HAD NO PROBLEM

594
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:08,234
SAYING HIS OPINION

595
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:11,267
ON THE IMMORALITY
OF THE SODOMY LAWS,
THINGS LIKE THAT.

596
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:14,901
WHEN A GROUP OF BACKERS
CAME TO HIM

597
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:17,634
AND DECIDED THAT HE WAS GOING
TO BE THEIR CANDIDATE,

598
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:19,801
HE CHANGED HIS PARTY

599
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:23,234
AND THEN WENT DOWN
AND JOINED THE CHURCH
THAT HAD THE BIGGEST COLUMNS

600
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:26,033
FOR HIM TO HAVE
HIS CAMPAIGN PICTURES
TAKEN IN FRONT OF,

601
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:29,400
AND RAN AS A RIGHT-WING
CHRISTIAN COALITION
CANDIDATE.

602
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,000
HE BECAME A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

603
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:35,567
I'm Johnette McCrery.

604
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,767
I believe my husband Jim
is the kind of person

605
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,601
we need in Congress today.

606
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,033
He's good-hearted,
but he's not soft-hearted.

607
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:47,834
He's sensitive
without being foolish.

608
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:51,133
IN 1992,

609
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:55,200
JIM CAME TO MY HOUSE,
SPENT THE NIGHT

610
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,701
AND WE HAD SEX.

611
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:00,434
WE NEVER DISCUSSED
HIS POLITICAL PLATFORM

612
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:02,601
OR WHAT HE BELIEVED IN.
WE JUST HAD SEX.

613
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:05,901
Bottom line,
Jim's a good husband,

614
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:09,000
a good father
and a good congressman.

615
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
He gets my vote.

616
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,434
Would you please give him
yours on election day?

617
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:17,901
TO BE ABLE TO LIVE
THIS KIND OF A LIE,

618
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:22,434
THIS HAS GONE ON NOW
FOR 17, 18-- NO, 20!
--20 YEARS.

619
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:25,133
THAT'S THE MAIN THING THAT
ATTRACTED ME TO MITT ROMNEY

620
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:27,934
WAS HIS STRONG SENSE
OF PERSONAL COMMITMENT

621
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:29,534
TO HIS WIFE,
HIS FAMILY,

622
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,567
TO HIS VALUES.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
HE JUST TALKS ABOUT.

623
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,367
IT'S SOMETHING HE LIVES.

624
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:37,267
THE CLOSEST THING
TO A TURNING POINT

625
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:39,067
WAS WHEN I WENT TO THE GRAVE

626
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,434
OF A SIGMA NU BROTHER

627
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:43,701
THAT DIED OF AIDS.

628
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:45,701
JIM KNEW HIM WELL.

629
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:48,501
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS.

630
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:51,601
STANDING OVER THAT GRAVE,
IT DID A LOT.

631
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:54,200
IT LET ME KNOW
THAT I HAD TO DO IT.

632
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I HAD TO DO IT.

633
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,033
THERE WAS SOME ATTENTION

634
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:03,767
IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA,
VERY, VERY LITTLE ON
A LOCAL LEVEL.

635
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:06,634
THE NON-GAY PRESS SAW IT
AS SORT OF DISTASTEFUL.

636
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:08,300
THEY DIDN'T COVER
GAY LIFE AT ALL,

637
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,701
EXCEPT MAYBE THE MOST
DRAMATIC ELEMENTS OF IT.

638
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:12,334
IT WAS GARY

639
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:15,501
THAT REAPED ALL
THE HAVOC FROM THIS.

640
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,834
HE WAS SHUNNED
BY THE COMMUNITY.

641
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,701
HIS PARENTS RECEIVED

642
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,934
ALL SORTS OF HATE MAIL.
AND JIM--

643
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,734
NOTHING HAPPENED TO JIM.

644
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:26,534
HE WAS ELEVATED
EVEN HIGHER.

645
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,567
JIM IS RETIRING

646
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,968
FROM A GREAT
CONGRESSIONAL CAREER--

647
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:36,767
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF HONORS AND AWARDS.

648
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:40,834
HOW MANY OF THOSE
WOULD HE HAVE GOTTEN

649
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,467
IF HE HAD BEEN
TRUE TO HIMSELF?

650
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:00,300
WHAT I FEEL THAT I'M DOING
IN THIS OUTING WORK,

651
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,767
IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYBODY
WHO'S ALIVE TODAY.

652
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:04,701
IT'S ABOUT TOMORROW'S
GENERATION

653
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:06,400
AND THE ONE AFTER
AND THE ONE AFTER,

654
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,467
'CAUSE THIS HATE,
THIS VITRIOL,

655
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,968
IT'S GENERATIONAL
FOR THESE ANTI-GAY PEOPLE.

656
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,734
MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
OF THE GOOD ACTIVISTS--

657
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:15,534
IT IS ALL DRIVEN BY RAGE,

658
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:18,400
RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AND DYING

659
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,601
BECAUSE SOME
SELF-PROMOTING ASSHOLE
IS TELLING A LIE.

660
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:23,801
ACTIVISM IS ABOUT ANGER.

661
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:26,200
ACTIVISM
IS ABOUT RESPONDING

662
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,300
TO SOMETHING THAT YOU
KNOW IS WRONG

663
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,901
- AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

664
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:42,434
Sure.

665
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,567
We're here for the consideration
of H.J.RES.106

666
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,367
proposing an amendment
to the Constitution of
the United States

667
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:21,033
relating to marriage
as well as H.R.319...

668
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,834
DREIER'S VOTING
IS A MATTER OF RECORD.

669
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:25,868
IT IS WITHOUT QUESTION

670
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,467
SOMEWHAT HOSTILE TO GAYS.
AND, IN FACT,

671
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:32,400
HE IS A FRONTLINE MEMBER
OF A POLITICAL PARTY

672
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,167
WHERE A CONSIDERABLE WING
OF THAT POLITICAL PARTY

673
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,968
IS OPENLY HOSTILE TO GAYS.

674
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,467
DAVID DREIER OFFICIALLY
STILL DENIES BEING GAY,

675
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:47,167
DESPITE LOTS OF EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY.

676
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,801
YOU COULD HEAR IN THE NEWSROOM,
JUST OCCASIONALLY WHEN
A STORY WOULD COME UP,

677
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,167
THAT DREIER WAS QUOTE--

678
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:56,534
WHAT I REALIZED BEFORE LONG,
IT WAS CODE WORDS--

679
00:37:56,534 --> 00:38:00,801
"CONFIRMED BACHELOR,"
"CONSERVATIVE BACHELOR,"
"DAPPER BACHELOR."

680
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:03,434
ONE OF THE BIG TIPS I GOT WAS,
"CHECK OUT THE BOYFRIEND."

681
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:05,634
I'M LIKE,
"WHO'S THE BOYFRIEND?"

682
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:08,334
"THE CHIEF OF STAFF."
I'M LIKE, "OHH, THAT'S
INTERESTING."

683
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:11,000
SO THEN WE INITIATED
A WHOLE INVESTIGATION.

684
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:18,801
I GO DOWN TO THE CAPITAL
AND I COPY EVERY TRAVEL RECORD

685
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:20,801
OF BRAD SMITH,
WHO'S THE CHIEF OF STAFF,

686
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,067
AND DAVID DREIER,
WHO'S THE CONGRESSMAN.

687
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,133
THEY SAID, "OH WELL,
HE TRAVELS WITH HIM."

688
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,801
AND I'M LIKE,
"WELL, THESE ARE
DIFFERENT DATES...

689
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:31,067
ONE DAY APART
ON ALL THE TRIPS."

690
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:36,400
IF THERE WAS A CONGRESSMAN

691
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,434
WHO TRAVELED WITH HIS
CHIEF OF STAFF CONTINUOUSLY
AROUND THE WORLD,

692
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:43,100
TRAVELING ONE DAY
BEFORE OR ONE DAY AFTER,

693
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
THAT WOULD BE
IN THE NEWSPAPER.

694
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
BUT BECAUSE HE'S
SLEEPING WITH A MAN,

695
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,567
BECAUSE IT'S TWO DICKS
INSTEAD OF ONE,

696
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:52,067
THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM.

697
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:54,334
WE'RE NOT ASKING DREIER
WHAT POSITION HE LIKES,

698
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,701
HOW MANY LOVERS HE'S HAD,
WHERE HE LIKES TO GET IT ON.

699
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,901
THESE AREN'T THE QUESTIONS
WE WANT TO PUT TO DREIER.

700
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:01,067
THE QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD
BE PUT TO DREIER ARE:

701
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:05,300
"THIS IS YOUR VOTING RECORD.
THIS IS YOUR PARTY'S PLATFORM,
ITS PLANK, ITS POSITIONS,

702
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,601
AND IT SEEMS TO RUN
ABSOLUTELY CONTRADICTORY

703
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,834
TO THE WAY YOU'VE LIVED
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE."

704
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:14,434
WHEN HE CAME ON MY PROGRAM
DURING THE REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION,

705
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:16,501
I ASKED HIM STRAIGHT OUT.

706
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,667
There have been a lot
of rumors that you
yourself are gay.

707
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,834
And people feel it's
hypocritical of you--

708
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:25,968
- --to not speak up in favor
of same-sex marriage.

709
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:28,133
Are you saying
you're heterosexual?

710
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,567
A STRAIGHT GUY,
THERE'S NO WAY HE'LL
ANSWER THAT QUESTION

711
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,868
WITH, "I'M NOT REALLY
HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT."

712
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:39,133
HE'S GONNA SAY,
"YEAH, I'M STRAIGHT.
SO WHAT?"

713
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:41,133
Would you think
it's hypocritical

714
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:44,234
if a gay politician
were voting against
gay people?

715
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:51,100
YOU KNOW, I HAPPEN
TO LIKE DAVID DREIER'S

716
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,167
POLITICAL AND POLICY WORK
ON MANY FRONTS.

717
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,734
AND HE LOST OUT

718
00:39:56,734 --> 00:40:00,567
IN BEING THE NEW
REPUBLICAN LEADER

719
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,167
INSIDE A CAUCUS INSIDE
THE REPUBLICAN COMMUNITY

720
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,968
BECAUSE OF THE GAY
IDENTITY ISSUE.

721
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,234
Did you expect
to get the job

722
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:10,434
that Roy Blunt got?

723
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,367
No, this is not something
that I pursued.

724
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,367
I mean, yes, I was
talked to about this.

725
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,367
And frankly, I said no,
that I didn't want to do it.

726
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,067
Now who talked
to you about it?
Is this--

727
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:21,334
You know, I don't want
to get into that, Charlie.

728
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:23,501
THE EVANGELICAL CONSERVATIVE
WING OF THE PARTY

729
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,033
CAME IN AND SAID,
"NOT FOR ONE MINUTE.
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.

730
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:28,801
DAVID DREIER'S A CLOSETED GAY.
THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR US.

731
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,167
AND IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN."

732
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,501
I THINK IT WAS
A REAL SAD THING

733
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:03,334
THAT THE COUNTRY LOST
SOMEONE LIKE DAVID DREIER

734
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:06,801
MOVING INTO REPUBLICAN
LEADERSHIP OVER BEING GAY.

735
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:09,234
THE ULTIMATE IRONY?
I BELIEVE IF DAVID DREIER

736
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:13,133
CALLED A PRESS CONFERENCE
TOMORROW AND ANNOUNCED,
"THIS IS MY TRUTH--

737
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:17,334
30 YEARS IN COMING,
BUT THIS IS MY TRUTH."

738
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:19,767
I THINK HE'D PROBABLY
BE RE-ELECTED.

739
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:21,968
IF HE DECIDES
TO EVENTUALLY COME OUT,

740
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:24,501
HE'LL DO SO WHEN
HE DECIDES TO RETIRE
FROM THE HOUSE.

741
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:27,400
THAT'S A TRAGEDY.
IT'S MUCH BETTER

742
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,367
TO HAVE SOMEONE
OF DAVID DREIER'S

743
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:32,000
REALLY BRILLIANT
LEGISLATIVE SKILL

744
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,968
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
FINALLY COMING OUT OF HIS
OWN VOLITION.

745
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:37,968
SO IS THERE AN EFFORT?
PROBABLY.

746
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:40,234
HAS HE MOVED?
NO.

747
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:49,367
LESBIAN AND GAY ISSUES

748
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:53,834
ARE UNDER-REPORTED
AND UNDER-COVERED IN THE MEDIA

749
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:57,334
SOMETIMES BECAUSE
OUR ALLIES IN THE MEDIA

750
00:41:57,334 --> 00:42:01,467
ARE TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE
TO NOT OUT SOMEBODY.

751
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:04,200
ALL OF MY STRAIGHT
FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA

752
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
HANDLE THIS ISSUE BADLY,

753
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,033
UM, BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S DISCOMFITING.

754
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:11,100
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

755
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,367
Right after the break,
we're gonna interview
Erik Weihenmayer

756
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:17,367
who climbed the highest mountain
in the world, Mount Everest.

757
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,200
But he's gay!

758
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,868
I mean, he's gay--
excuse me. He's blind.

759
00:42:21,868 --> 00:42:24,200
So we'll hear
about that coming up.

760
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,467
PEOPLE WILL WRITE
ABOUT MY RELIGION.

761
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:29,868
THEY WILL WRITE ABOUT MY HEIGHT,
WRITE ABOUT MY SCHOOLING.

762
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:32,100
THEY WILL WRITE ABOUT
A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS.

763
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,167
IF THEY WON'T WRITE
ABOUT MY SEXUALITY,

764
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:37,300
THEY'RE IN EFFECT SAYING,
"THE POOR SO-AND-SO.

765
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,901
THAT IS SUCH A TERRIBLE FACT
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SECRET."

766
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:42,901
JOURNALISTS ARE IN THE BUSINESS
OF TELLING THE TRUTH.

767
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:48,801
THEY SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY
REEVALUATING WHAT THEY'RE DOING

768
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:53,234
AND LOOKING AT WHY
THEY TREAT HOMOSEXUALITY
AND HETEROSEXUALITY DIFFERENTLY.

769
00:42:53,234 --> 00:42:55,801
MY FAMILY JOKES THAT WHEN
THEY WATCH THE NEWS WITH ME

770
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:58,968
LIKE, "THAT REPORTER'S GAY."
IT PERMEATES THE MEDIA HERE.

771
00:42:58,968 --> 00:43:01,501
ALL THE REPORTERS ARE GAY.
YOU KNOW?

772
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:05,968
CNN AND FOX, THE SAME ONES
WHO ARE COVERING THE STORY,

773
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:09,601
THEY'RE PART OF
THE WASHINGTON CULTURE TOO.
SO FOR THEM TO BE AMBITIOUS,

774
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:13,000
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT
THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION
AND HAVEN'T FOR YEARS.

775
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,534
Live from New York,

776
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:17,367
this is "The Fox Report"
with Shepard Smith.

777
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:19,934
J-Lo's new song
"Jenny from the Block,"

778
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:21,868
all about Lopez's roots,

779
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:24,367
about how she's still
a neighborhood gal at heart.

780
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,734
But folks from
the Bronx section

781
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:29,100
sound more likely
to give her a curb job

782
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,467
than a blowjob--
or block party.

783
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,567
I'm sorry about
that slip up there.

784
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:36,534
I have no idea
how that happened,
but it won't happen again.

785
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:38,367
I WAS AT A BAR IN NEW YORK,

786
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,467
A GAY PIANO BAR
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE
CALLED "BRANDY'S."

787
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:43,467
WE SAT DOWN
NEXT TO THIS GUY

788
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:45,667
AND IT WAS SHEPARD SMITH
FROM FOX NEWS.

789
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,968
HE STARTED
CHATTING ME UP

790
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:50,434
AND BUYING ME DRINKS.

791
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:54,534
AND, UH, HE ASKED ME
IF I'D COME BACK TO
HIS APARTMENT...

792
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:56,434
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

793
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,000
A YEAR WENT BY AND HE STARTED
GETTING A LOT OF EXPOSURE

794
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,701
AS THE NEW RISING STAR
OF CABLE TV NEWS.

795
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:07,300
HE WAS GRANTING
INTERVIEWS TO REPORTERS

796
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,701
AND BEING PROFILED
IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

797
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:15,267
AND WAS BEING MORE THAN COY
ABOUT HIS SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

798
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,767
BECAUSE IT WAS ASKED,
AND HE WAS EITHER LYING

799
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,601
OR DODGING THE QUESTION.

800
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:21,501
IT WAS AT THAT POINT
THAT I SAID, "OKAY,

801
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,300
TIME TO COME OUT."

802
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,467
I THINK IT
TO THIS DAY REMAINS

803
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:29,200
THE MOST POPULAR COLUMN
THAT I'VE EVER WRITTEN.

804
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,267
EVERYONE LOVES
A GOOD OUTING.

805
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:35,400
THIS TOWN IS FULL
OF GAY PEOPLE.

806
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:47,767
I REMEMBER WHEN
I FIRST MOVED HERE
THINKING HOW GAY IT WAS.

807
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:51,133
SOMETIMES I THINK
WASHINGTON'S MORE GAY
THAN SAN FRANCISCO IS.

808
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:54,033
CAPITOL HILL IS PACKED

809
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:55,934
WITH GAY STAFFERS.

810
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:58,200
THERE ARE SO MANY
OF THEM.

811
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,234
YOU CAN'T SWING
A DEAD CAT

812
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:02,033
WITHOUT HITTING
A GAY STAFFER.

813
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,067
THERE'S A RUNNING JOKE

814
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,200
THAT GAY MEN MAKE
CAPITOL HILL RUN ON TIME.

815
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,467
THEY DON'T HAVE A WIFE
OR CHILDREN TO GO HOME TO,

816
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:10,567
SO THEY CAN WORK
REALLY LONG HOURS.

817
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,400
I THINK IF THEY
TRIED TO FIRE GAY STAFF

818
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,501
LIKE THEY DO BOOTING PEOPLE
OUT OF THE MILITARY,

819
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:19,033
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS
WOULD SCREECH TO A HALT.

820
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:21,501
TO THIS DAY, I HAVE NOT
SEEN ANY PLACE LIKE IT.

821
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,567
SO IT IS PROBABLY
THE MOST GAY PLACE.

822
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:26,534
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S PROBABLY
STILL THE MOST CLOSETED PLACE.

823
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:30,100
THERE ARE SCORES
OF CLOSETED REPUBLICANS

824
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,000
AND DEMOCRATS,
I MIGHT ADD,

825
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,033
WHO JUST BECAUSE
OF THEIR LIFE JOURNEY,

826
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:37,300
BECAUSE OF THEIR
GENERATIONAL EXPERIENCE,

827
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,767
BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIRE
NOT TO BE VULNERABLE

828
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:41,601
IN TERMS OF
GETTING RE-ELECTED,

829
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:44,000
HAVE CHOSEN TO STAY
IN THE CLOSET.

830
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,067
YEAH?

831
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:50,834
FROM THE DAY I FIRST GOT
ELECTED TO PUBLIC OFFICE

832
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:54,734
IN 1972, I WAS CLOSETED
FOR THE FIRST 15
OF THOSE YEARS.

833
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:56,734
MY ORIGINAL VIEW
WAS THAT I COULD BE

834
00:45:56,734 --> 00:46:00,234
PUBLICALLY
KIND OF NEUTRAL,

835
00:46:00,234 --> 00:46:02,734
AND PRIVATELY
I COULD LIVE THE LIFE
OF A GAY MAN.

836
00:46:02,734 --> 00:46:05,534
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE
REASONABLY PROMINENT,

837
00:46:05,534 --> 00:46:08,234
WHAT CAN YOU DO?
YOU CAN'T GO TO BARS
TO MEET PEOPLE.

838
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:10,801
YOU CAN'T--

839
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,501
YOU CAN'T MEET PEOPLE
WITHOUT OUTING YOURSELF,

840
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:16,868
SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO BE
PUBLIC AND CLOSETED.

841
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:21,667
THERE WERE LOTS OF RUMORS
THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND.

842
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,467
AND I WAS ALWAYS CONCERNED
ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF THINGS

843
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:27,267
WOULD COME UP IN A CAMPAIGN
OR WHAT THINGS MIGHT BE SAID.

844
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,667
SO, YOU KNOW,

845
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,934
THERE WAS THAT KIND
OF THING THAT GNAWS AT YOU.

846
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:34,367
IT'S JUST THERE.
IT'S SITTING ON YOUR SHOULDER

847
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:36,968
LIKE A LITTLE TWEETY BIRD
SITTING ON YOUR SHOULDER

848
00:46:36,968 --> 00:46:38,467
ABOUT TO CHIRP AT YOU.

849
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:40,467
AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
IT'S GOING TO DO THAT.

850
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:44,934
IF YOU ARE A LESBIAN
DEEPLY IN THE CLOSET

851
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:48,267
AND YOU'RE HAVING
A CONVERSATION ABOUT,

852
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:52,434
YOU KNOW, WHO YOU
SHARE YOUR LIFE WITH,

853
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,200
YOU EITHER HAVE TO LIE

854
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,200
AND SAY "HE"
RATHER THAN "SHE"

855
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,767
IN REFERRING
TO YOUR PARTNER,

856
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,868
BUT ALTERNATIVELY

857
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:03,334
USING GENDERLESS PRONOUNS.

858
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:07,267
"WE HAD A GOOD WEEKEND."

859
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:10,968
AND, YOU KNOW,
JUST SORT OF AVOIDING IT.

860
00:47:10,968 --> 00:47:14,501
AND REALLY, THAT TAKES
A LOT OF ENERGY TO DO

861
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,133
TO MAKE SURE
YOUR STORY'S STRAIGHT,
SO TO SPEAK.

862
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:24,601
WHEN YOU'RE LIVING
IN THE CLOSET,

863
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:26,734
THE FEAR IS THAT SOMEONE'S
GOING TO EXPOSE YOU

864
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:29,667
FOR THEIR POLITICAL GAIN
TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

865
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,000
AND SO YOU'RE ALWAYS
WONDERING,

866
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,267
"IS THIS THE CONVERSATION?
IS THIS THE PERSON?

867
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:36,234
IS THIS THE SITUATION?"

868
00:47:36,234 --> 00:47:38,467
WHEN I RAN FOR MAYOR
THE FIRST TIME,

869
00:47:38,467 --> 00:47:41,200
I RECEIVED THREAT LETTERS
AND THREAT PHONE CALLS.

870
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,634
I'VE SAVED THE LETTERS
AND ONE OF THEM SAID,

871
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:46,033
"WE'RE COMING
TO THE PUBLIC FORUM

872
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,033
AND WE'RE GOING
TO EXPOSE YOU

873
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:49,701
SO ALL YOUR SUPPORTERS
WILL KNOW

874
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,701
THAT YOU'RE
REALLY A GAY MAN."

875
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,434
FOR ANYONE TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GAY,

876
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:54,868
TO BE THE GAY "ANYTHING,"

877
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:57,200
WOULD BE THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

878
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,968
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR FAMILY.
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR JOB.
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR POWER

879
00:47:59,968 --> 00:48:02,267
OR POLITICAL POSITION.
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR SEAT
IN CONGRESS.

880
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:04,634
I'VE HAD MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

881
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:06,767
CRYING IN MY ARMS

882
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:08,968
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO COME OUT.

883
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:10,968
WHEN YOU TRY
TO COMPARTMENTALIZE

884
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:13,501
ALL THESE PARTS
OF YOUR LIFE

885
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,133
AND IF YOU TRY TO SHOVE YOUR
SEXUAL ORIENTATION INTO A BOX

886
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,634
AND KEEP IT FROM
YOUR CONSTITUENTS,

887
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:22,534
IT HAS VERY DEADLY
CONSEQUENCES.

888
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:32,667
Good afternoon.

889
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,501
Throughout my life,

890
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:39,534
I have grappled
with my own identity--
who I am.

891
00:48:39,534 --> 00:48:43,667
As a young child,
I often felt ambivalent

892
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:47,634
about myself,
in fact, confused.

893
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:50,300
From the first words out
of his mouth this afternoon,

894
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,934
it was clear Jim McGreevy,
the governor of New Jersey,

895
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:55,167
was making
very big news indeed.

896
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:58,434
At a point
in every person's life,

897
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:02,968
one has to look deeply
into the mirror of one's soul

898
00:49:02,968 --> 00:49:06,000
and decide
one's unique truth.

899
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,634
And beyond the facts
and allegations and anguish

900
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:10,601
immediately
surrounding his story,

901
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:12,400
what the governor
said today

902
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,300
also becomes part
of a larger story

903
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,400
at a turning point
for the country.

904
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,067
And so my truth is that
I am a gay American.

905
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:22,634
Another boundary
of American politics

906
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:24,367
has been crossed today.

907
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,801
With his wife by his side,
the governor announced

908
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:28,434
that he is gay,

909
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:31,167
that he had an affair
with a man, and that he
would resign.

910
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:34,801
His announcement
makes him the highest-ranking
American politician...

911
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:40,901
I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND
THAT EVEN IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL

912
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:43,200
THAT SOMEHOW I WAS
PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT.

913
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,901
NO ONE COMES UP TO YOU

914
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:47,434
AND TELLS YOU THAT
YOU'RE AFRICAN-AMERICAN,

915
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:49,501
OR JEWISH-AMERICAN
OR IRISH-AMERICAN.

916
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:52,367
YOU DISCOVER YOU'RE GAY

917
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,400
BY YOURSELF.

918
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,467
AND I WAS GOING
TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
AND LOOKING FOR

919
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:00,567
"WHAT IS HOMOSEXUALITY?
WHAT ARE ITS ORIGINS?"

920
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:03,200
AND HOW IT'S DESCRIBED.

921
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,701
IT WAS ALL HORRIFIC.
IT WAS ALL APOCALYPTIC.

922
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:07,701
IT WAS A CURSE.

923
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:10,968
I ACCEPTED ALL THOSE
MESSAGES OF SHAME

924
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:14,334
AND MESSAGES OF HATE,

925
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:16,167
MESSAGES OF IGNORANCE.

926
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:18,400
BUT YOU REALIZE
IT'S INTRINSIC.

927
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,267
IT'S WHO
AND WHAT YOU ARE.

928
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,267
AND SO YOU DENY
THIS THING,

929
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:25,033
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS
IT COMES OUT.

930
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:28,100
AND IT COMES OUT
IN DARK PLACES.

931
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,000
YOU BEGIN TO BELIEVE
THAT IT IS SHAMEFUL

932
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,701
BECAUSE YOU WERE ACTING,
FOR ME, IN SHAMEFUL WAYS.

933
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:34,701
I MEAN,
WHERE AM I HAVING SEX?

934
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:37,434
I'M HAVING SEX IN BACK ALLEYS
OF ABANDONED SYNAGOGUES.

935
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,634
I'M HAVING SEX
IN REST STOPS.

936
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:41,634
THE FACT IS
MY STRAIGHT FRIENDS

937
00:50:41,634 --> 00:50:43,868
WERE PICKING UP
THEIR GIRLFRIENDS

938
00:50:43,868 --> 00:50:46,667
IN BARS AND AT PARTIES
AND DOING IT WHEREVER.

939
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,968
I DIDN'T HAVE
THAT OPPORTUNITY

940
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:52,601
TO DO IT IN PUBLIC WAYS
THAT WERE HEALTHY,

941
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:54,701
THAT WERE SAFE
AND THAT WERE ACCEPTED.

942
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:57,400
AND SO BY DOING IT
IN SECRET CLOSETED WAYS,

943
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,267
I BELIEVE IT IS UNHEALTHY
FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY,

944
00:51:00,267 --> 00:51:02,033
IT IS UNHEALTHY
FOR THE BEING

945
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,968
AND IT WAS UNHEALTHY
FOR MY SOUL.

946
00:51:03,968 --> 00:51:08,467
Dave Karsnia over tape:
All right, so let's start
from the beginning.

947
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:11,234
- You went in the bathroom.
- I went in the bathroom.

948
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,234
I got in a stall,
sat down

949
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:16,067
and I started to go
to the bathroom.

950
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:20,033
Did our feet come together?
Apparently, they did bump.

951
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,934
Let me be clear:
I am not gay.

952
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:25,300
I never have been gay.

953
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,868
HE DOESN'T THINK HE'S GAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S NOT GAY.

954
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:30,200
MAYBE HE'S HOMOSEXUAL
OR SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW.

955
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,901
NOT "GAY" AS IN IDENTIFIED
POLITICALLY WITH OUR TRIBE.

956
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:35,601
WHO KNOWS IF LARRY CRAIG
IS GAY OR NOT?

957
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:38,200
BUT WHATEVER HE IS,

958
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,334
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
HE'S ACTUALLY PART OF US.

959
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:44,234
WE DON'T WANT HIM,
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE

960
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,767
HE'S ACTUALLY PART
OF OUR COMMUNITY.

961
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:49,300
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY
IN HIS GENERATION--

962
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,701
AND IT'S STILL POSSIBLE
IN YOUNGER GENERATIONS--

963
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:54,033
FOR PEOPLE TO BE
SO TERRIFIED INTERNALLY

964
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:55,901
OF THEIR OWN
SEXUAL ORIENTATION

965
00:51:55,901 --> 00:51:58,734
THAT THEY LITERALLY JUST
SUPPRESS IT TO SUCH AN EXTENT,

966
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:03,567
THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE
IT WHILE ACTING AS IT.

967
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,634
ARE YOU TECHNICALLY
NOT A HOMOSEXUAL?

968
00:52:06,634 --> 00:52:09,133
IS IT POSSIBLE
YOU'RE BISEXUAL?

969
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:11,000
IT'S NO TO BOTH.

970
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,501
THE OTHER QUESTION
IS DO YOU THINK

971
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:16,334
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING
THAT WOULD BE AWFUL?

972
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,767
IN OTHER WORDS,
DO YOU VIEW IT AS SOMETHING

973
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:21,434
THAT WOULD BE AWFUL
TO HAVE TO ADMIT

974
00:52:21,434 --> 00:52:23,567
THAT YOU WERE GAY?

975
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,868
I DON'T AGREE
WITH THE LIFESTYLE.

976
00:52:25,868 --> 00:52:29,167
AND I'VE SAID SO
BY MY VOTES OVER THE YEARS.

977
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:32,534
I THINK THAT FOR A LOT
OF GAY PEOPLE

978
00:52:32,534 --> 00:52:35,667
WHO MAY HARBOR SOME
VERY, VERY DEEP

979
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:38,834
INTERNALIZED HOMOPHOBIA,

980
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:41,901
ONE OF THE WAYS
THAT THEY FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THEMSELVES

981
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:45,601
IS BY ALIGNING THEMSELVES
WITH THE FORCES

982
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:49,167
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT
TO DO HARM TO THEM.

983
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,601
AS A TEENAGER,
I WAS LABELED A FAG.

984
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:54,601
AND WHAT I WOULD DO

985
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:58,434
IN ORDER TO BATTLE THAT
AND FIGHT THAT

986
00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:00,767
WAS I WOULD JOIN UP
WITH THE OTHER GUYS

987
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:05,667
WHO WOULD BASH
OTHER GAY BOYS

988
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:09,267
TO PROVE THAT
"HEY, I'M NOT A FAG.
I'LL EVEN BEAT UP ONE."

989
00:53:09,267 --> 00:53:14,334
AND THAT, GOING BACK,
IS REALLY WHAT WE SEE TODAY

990
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:17,467
IN SO MANY PEOPLE
WHO ARE IN CONGRESS

991
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:19,000
VOTING AGAINST GAY PEOPLE.

992
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,300
IT'S THE SAME THING
I WAS DOING AS A TEENAGER.

993
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,901
THEY ARE BASHING
OTHER GAY PEOPLE

994
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,667
IN ORDER TO PROVE
THAT THEY'RE NOT GAY.

995
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:28,968
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING IN HISTORY

996
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:33,534
THAT-- WHERE DEEPLY ANTI-
OR HOMOPHOBIC ACTIVITIES

997
00:53:33,534 --> 00:53:35,968
HAVEN'T BEEN AT SOME LEVEL
PERPETUATED OR FOSTERED

998
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:37,934
BY PEOPLE WHO WERE GAY.

999
00:53:37,934 --> 00:53:40,367
LOOK AT McCARTHYISM
AND THE WITCH HUNTS--

1000
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:44,667
LED BY A CLOSETED GAY:
ROY COHN, A TRUE EVIL BASTARD.

1001
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:48,868
THE TARGET GROUPS
OF WITCH HUNTS

1002
00:53:48,868 --> 00:53:51,567
AND PROSECUTION

1003
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:54,634
WERE COMMUNISTS
AND QUEERS.

1004
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:59,834
ROY COHN SUPPORTED LOTS
OF REALLY DREADFUL PEOPLE

1005
00:53:59,834 --> 00:54:02,167
WHO WERE COMPLETELY
HOMOPHOBIC,

1006
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:04,467
AND IN SOME WAYS
WAS HIMSELF HOMOPHOBIC.

1007
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:06,467
HE HAD A LOT
OF NEGATIVE FEELINGS

1008
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:09,534
ABOUT OUT GAY PEOPLE.

1009
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:13,367
ROY COHN IS NOT A HOMOSEXUAL.

1010
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:18,133
ROY COHN IS
A HETEROSEXUAL MAN, HENRY,

1011
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:21,434
WHO FUCKS AROUND WITH GUYS.

1012
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:22,934
I HAD TO TAKE
MY BEST SHOT

1013
00:54:22,934 --> 00:54:25,767
AT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW THAT COGNITIVE DISSONANCE

1014
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,868
IS NAVIGATED
INSIDE OF SOMEBODY.

1015
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:31,033
AND I FEEL LIKE I DID
A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT.

1016
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:34,634
I MEAN, THE SCENE
THAT EVERYBODY LOVES BEST IS
WHEN HE'S DIAGNOSED WITH AIDS

1017
00:54:34,634 --> 00:54:36,834
AND HE SAYS TO HIS DOCTOR,
"I'M NOT A GAY MAN."

1018
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:40,133
NOW TO SOMEONE WHO
DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS,

1019
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:43,634
HOMOSEXUAL IS WHAT I AM
BECAUSE I HAVE SEX WITH MEN,

1020
00:54:43,634 --> 00:54:46,000
BUT REALLY THIS IS WRONG.

1021
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,334
HOMOSEXUALS ARE NOT MEN
WHO SLEEP WITH OTHER MEN.

1022
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:55,267
HOMOSEXUALS ARE MEN
WHO IN 15 YEARS OF TRYING

1023
00:54:55,267 --> 00:55:00,667
CANNOT PASS A PISSANT
ANTIDISCRIMINATION BILL
THROUGH CITY COUNCIL.

1024
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:04,234
HOMOSEXUALS ARE MEN
WHO KNOW NOBODY

1025
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,534
AND WHO NOBODY KNOWS,

1026
00:55:06,534 --> 00:55:09,100
WHO HAVE ZERO CLOUT.

1027
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,400
THAT RATIONALE GOES
SOMETHING LIKE THIS--

1028
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,167
IT TOOK ME AWHILE
TO FIGURE IT OUT--

1029
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:15,501
BUT IT WAS SORT OF LIKE,
"RICH, YOU ARE A WEAK GAY

1030
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:19,300
BECAUSE YOU CAME OUT.
I AM A STRONGER PERSON

1031
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,934
BECAUSE I REMAIN
NOT PART OF A GAY
LIBERAL COMMUNITY.

1032
00:55:24,934 --> 00:55:26,767
I AM STILL
A CONSERVATIVE.

1033
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:29,501
I AM EVERYTHING I WANT.
I DON'T PUSH MY AGENDA
ON ANYONE.

1034
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:32,834
STRAIGHTS DON'T PUSH
THEIR SEXUAL LIVES.
WHY SHOULD WE?"

1035
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:35,501
AND IT'S VERY--
I'VE HEARD THIS
A MILLION TIMES,

1036
00:55:35,501 --> 00:55:37,367
AND IT'S VERY WARPED.

1037
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:40,467
BUT IT WAS SORT OF LIKE,
"YOU COULDN'T HAVE THE STAMINA

1038
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:42,267
TO STAY IN THE CLOSET."

1039
00:55:42,267 --> 00:55:44,968
THEY'RE VERY CAREFUL.
IT'S LIKE A BROADWAY SHOW.

1040
00:55:44,968 --> 00:55:47,234
POLITICS IS LIKE
A BROADWAY SHOW TO THEM

1041
00:55:47,234 --> 00:55:50,334
IN THAT EVERYTHING IS STAGED,
EVERYTHING IS PLANNED,

1042
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:53,000
EVERY WORD THAT COMES OUT
OF SOMEBODY'S MOUTH
IS SCRIPTED.

1043
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,567
Today is a special day
in my life.

1044
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:59,467
It's not just
Valentine's Day.

1045
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:03,067
It happens to be
the anniversary of
the first date

1046
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,167
I had with my wife
Suzanne.

1047
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:09,567
Am I a romantic?
Well, maybe just a little bit.

1048
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:11,934
Even after the Craigs
got married

1049
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:15,033
and he adopted
her three children
from a previous marriage,

1050
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:18,334
the rumors about
her husband persisted.

1051
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,033
THEY WERE SAYING
THAT IT WAS A MARRIAGE
OF CONVENIENCE.

1052
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:22,934
TO COVER
A GAY LIFESTYLE?

1053
00:56:22,934 --> 00:56:24,968
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

1054
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,334
I KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE
TO SAY IN PUBLIC

1055
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:29,200
AND I ACTUALLY
KIND OF ADMIRE 'EM

1056
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,901
FOR BEING ABLE TO GIVE
THAT PERFORMANCE.

1057
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,901
I'M SURE I COULDN'T.

1058
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:36,734
UH, BUT THAT'S
SOME WEIRD SHIT.

1059
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:39,601
PEOPLE KNOW ME

1060
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:41,534
AND KNOW THAT I
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

1061
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:44,667
THAT'S ALMOST
LIKE SELLING YOUR SOUL
FOR SOMETHING.NO!

1062
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,567
WHERE DO YOU FIND
THE SPOUSES

1063
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:48,367
OF THESE PEOPLE
WHO STICK WITH THEM?

1064
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:52,067
I MEAN, THAT IS SO BIZARRE.
HOW DO YOU STAND NEXT
TO YOUR HUSBAND

1065
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,934
AFTER HE'S BEEN
IN A STALL?

1066
00:56:53,934 --> 00:56:56,334
I MEAN, I WOULD HAVE
BEEN GOING TO--

1067
00:56:56,334 --> 00:56:59,667
I'D HAVE HEADED TO A SHOWER
FOR A "SILKWOOD" SCRUBDOWN

1068
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:02,100
OR CERTAINLY
TO AN STD CLINIC.

1069
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,734
I WOULDN'T BE
AT THE WHISTLE-STOP CAFE

1070
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,434
STANDING BY HIM.

1071
00:57:06,434 --> 00:57:08,701
IS SHE INSANE?

1072
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:11,200
WHAT INTERESTS ME MORE
AND I THINK WHAT IS MORE COMMON

1073
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,701
ARE THESE STRAIGHT WOMEN
WHO ARE MARRIED

1074
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,467
TO CLOSETED GAY MEN
WHO DON'T KNOW.

1075
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:19,200
I engaged in an adult
consensual affair

1076
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,868
with another man

1077
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:24,634
which violates
my bonds of matrimony.

1078
00:57:24,634 --> 00:57:27,701
I DATED JIM FOR FOUR YEARS
BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED,

1079
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:29,567
SO I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM.

1080
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:33,300
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY,
"OH, THERE HAD TO BE SIGNS."

1081
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,767
I HAD TO KNOW THIS WAS
AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.

1082
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,334
OUR SEX LIFE,
OUR RELATIONSHIP--
THERE WAS NOTHING--

1083
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:42,534
OUR INTIMACY--
THERE WAS NOTHING TO INDICATE
THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

1084
00:57:42,534 --> 00:57:44,767
I HAD NEVER
BEEN MARRIED BEFORE

1085
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:47,534
SO I COULDN'T COMPARE IT
TO ANOTHER MARRIAGE.

1086
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:50,567
BUT FROM TALKING
TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

1087
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,234
IT WAS A NORMAL
RELATIONSHIP.

1088
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:55,868
IF YOU'RE KEEPING
A DOUBLE LEDGER

1089
00:57:55,868 --> 00:57:57,801
FROM THE SECOND
OF YOUR MORNING BREATH

1090
00:57:57,801 --> 00:57:59,601
TO THE TIME
YOU GO TO BED AT NIGHT,

1091
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,734
IT'S LIKE A BAD
"STAR TREK" EPISODE--
YOU HAVE TO DISCERN

1092
00:58:02,734 --> 00:58:05,367
WHICH FOOT
IS IN WHICH UNIVERSE
AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

1093
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:08,300
YOU'RE PLAYING
IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE,

1094
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,300
BUT IT'S NOT INTEGRATED,
IT'S NOT HONEST,

1095
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,734
IT'S NOT WHOLESOME
AND IT'S NOT TRANSPARENT.

1096
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:15,234
NONE OF THAT WAS REAL.

1097
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:17,367
NONE OF THOSE FEELINGS
OF THOSE EMOTIONS

1098
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:20,300
WERE REAL
FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE.
IT WAS ALL AN ACT.

1099
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,734
WHAT PART OF MY LIFE
AND MY MARRIAGE WAS REAL?

1100
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,801
WAS THAT TRIP REAL?
WAS THAT VACATION REAL?

1101
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:29,834
WHAT ABOUT IT
WAS AUTHENTIC?

1102
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:34,067
IF YOUR HUSBAND LEAVES YOU
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN

1103
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:36,701
OR IF YOUR WIFE LEAVES YOU
FOR ANOTHER MAN,

1104
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:39,801
AT SOME POINT YOU HAD
FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER

1105
00:58:39,801 --> 00:58:43,267
SO AT SOME POINT
THERE WAS LOVE.

1106
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:47,234
IN MY CASE, I DON'T THINK
HE EVER FELT THAT FOR ME.

1107
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:51,534
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF PASSION,

1108
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:53,834
BUT AT THAT POINT,

1109
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:58,033
I WASN'T READY TO ACCEPT
EVEN WHO AND WHAT I AM.

1110
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,167
SO TO BE TOTALLY
OPEN WITH HER,

1111
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:05,300
I WOULD HAVE HAD
TO ACCEPT MYSELF

1112
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,000
AND THEN SHARE IT
WITH SOMEBODY I LOVED.

1113
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:11,567
TO A CERTAIN POINT
THEY ARE THE VICTIM,

1114
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:14,901
BUT THEY MADE
THEIR OWN CHOICES

1115
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:17,434
ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GONNA
LIVE THEIR LIVES.

1116
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:19,901
God the Father,
God the Son,

1117
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:22,667
God the Holy Spirit,
bless, preserve and keep you.

1118
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,167
WHEN I THINK, IT HAD
TO BE TORTURE

1119
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:28,467
FOR HIM TO GO THROUGH LIFE
TRYING TO LIVE AS SOMEONE

1120
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:32,200
HE CLEARLY WASN'T
COMFORTABLE BEING...

1121
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:40,167
...BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE
TO DESTROY MY LIFE

1122
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:42,400
OR MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE
OR ANYBODY ELSE'S LIFE.

1123
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,601
It was wrong.
It was foolish.

1124
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,634
It was inexcusable.

1125
00:59:47,634 --> 00:59:49,968
And for this,
I ask the forgiveness

1126
00:59:49,968 --> 00:59:53,234
and the grace of my wife.

1127
00:59:53,234 --> 00:59:58,100
She has been extraordinary
throughout this ordeal...

1128
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,501
I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED
TO SERVE PEOPLE

1129
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:04,634
OF THIS GREAT STATE
WE CALL FLORIDA.

1130
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,634
SHE IS THE STATE
WITH THE PRETTIEST NAME

1131
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:08,567
AND I LOVE HER.

1132
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:21,701
Testing testing,
one two three.

1133
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,033
At first glance,
Kelly Crosby Heyniger

1134
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:25,868
seems like a typical
suburban mom,

1135
01:00:25,868 --> 01:00:28,834
but what makes her unique
is the company she keeps.

1136
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:31,167
He's a great guy,

1137
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:33,801
a lot of fun.
He's real.

1138
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:36,133
He wants to make
a difference.

1139
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,400
"He" is Florida Governor
Charlie Crist.

1140
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,133
Kelly was set up on a date
with him for a charity event

1141
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:43,200
on Jupiter Island
several months ago.

1142
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,667
YOU'D ACTUALLY WANT RUMORS.

1143
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:48,133
I MEAN, I'D GO TO GO-GO BARS
WITH MY BUDDIES.

1144
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:50,434
MY GAY FRIENDS
SAID AFTERWARDS,

1145
01:00:50,434 --> 01:00:52,801
"WHAT DID YOU DO
FOR THOSE HOURS?"

1146
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:55,734
We have a good relationship.
I enjoy his company

1147
01:00:55,734 --> 01:00:57,734
and I think
he enjoys mine too,

1148
01:00:57,734 --> 01:01:00,334
but I don't like
to project.

1149
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:03,634
I WOULD SORT
OF PARSE WORDS WHEN PEOPLE
WOULD CONFRONT ME,

1150
01:01:03,634 --> 01:01:05,767
"OH, I HEAR RUMORS
THAT YOU'RE GAY."

1151
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:07,300
I'M LIKE,
"OH, THAT'S CRAZY."

1152
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,734
"YOU'RE A HOMOSEXUAL?"
"NO, THAT'S ABSURD.

1153
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:13,133
THERE'S RUMORS ABOUT
EVERYBODY IN POLITICS."
SO YOU'D BE DISMISSIVE.

1154
01:01:13,133 --> 01:01:16,033
Charlie, let me ask you this:

1155
01:01:16,033 --> 01:01:17,634
- Are you a homo?

1156
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:19,968
Okay, I didn't think so.

1157
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,234
I can attest

1158
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:25,667
because I've seen you
with some great-looking women.
I go...

1159
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:01,701
Rumors that Crist
is gay have been printed

1160
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:04,734
in alternative newspapers
and online. He denies it.

1161
01:02:04,734 --> 01:02:07,467
And Kelly doesn't give that
speculation a second thought.

1162
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:09,567
Do people say stuff
to you about that?

1163
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,000
Mm, they do,

1164
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,234
but when you put yourself
in front of the public eye,

1165
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:17,334
someone is always gonna have
something negative to say,

1166
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,367
whether it be true or not.

1167
01:02:46,968 --> 01:02:49,901
THE CLOSET FOR ME IN
THE CONTEXT OF POWER POLITICS

1168
01:02:49,901 --> 01:02:51,501
IS ACTUALLY
QUITE DANGEROUS.

1169
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,701
I THINK IT DEEPLY CONVOLUTES
YOUR PERSPECTIVE

1170
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:56,701
ON WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WHAT'S WRONG.

1171
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:58,934
I THINK IT MAKES YOU
LESS GENUINE.

1172
01:02:58,934 --> 01:03:02,234
I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSETED
AND INVOLVED IN POLITICS

1173
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:04,734
ARE INTERESTED
IN CONTINUALLY COVERING UP

1174
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:06,334
WHO THEY ARE
AND WHAT THEY ARE,

1175
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:10,200
WHICH I THINK DELIVERS
A VERY NEGATIVE PUBLIC POLICY.

1176
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,734
YOU KNOW, IN 1976,

1177
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:15,567
GERRY FORD AND JIMMY CARTER
WERE ABOUT EVEN ON GAY RIGHTS.

1178
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:17,868
SINCE THEN THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE GOTTEN BETTER

1179
01:03:17,868 --> 01:03:21,200
AND THE REPUBLICANS
CAPTURED BY THE RIGHT WING
HAVE GOTTEN WORSE.

1180
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,567
STARTING IN THE EARLY '70s,

1181
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,367
JOE COORS
AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

1182
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:30,634
PAID JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL
BEFORE HE WAS ON THE
SUPREME COURT

1183
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:34,200
TO WRITE WHAT WE CALL
"THE POWELL MANIFESTO."

1184
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,067
NOW IT'S BASICALLY
A CONCRETE BUSINESS PLAN

1185
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:41,167
ON HOW TO ENSURE
FREE ENTERPRISE IN PERPETUITY.

1186
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:43,300
AND WITH WHAT WE CALL
THE NINE FAMILIES--

1187
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,834
THE BRADLEYS, THE SCAIFES,
THE OLINS, THE COORS--

1188
01:03:45,834 --> 01:03:49,000
THIS HUGE
MACHINE WAS BUILT:

1189
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,667
MEDIA MONITORS
AND JUDICIAL WATCHES

1190
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:54,400
AND ELEGANT LEADERSHIP
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

1191
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,934
AND THINK TANKS
THAT COME UP WITH ISSUES

1192
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:59,167
THAT WILL PANDER
TO CERTAIN VOTERS.

1193
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:01,567
AND WHAT POPPED UP
FOR THEM

1194
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:05,667
LIKE A GIFT WAS
GAY MARRIAGE.

1195
01:04:13,634 --> 01:04:15,834
AND THEY WENT, "EUREKA!

1196
01:04:15,834 --> 01:04:17,634
THIS IS WHAT WE'LL USE."

1197
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:23,501
God, as California goes,
so goes the nation.

1198
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:27,200
A confrontation
between light and darkness

1199
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,801
will happen this November.

1200
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:34,167
A battle to save
the very sanctity of marriage.

1201
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:36,534
To the victor goes
the soul of the nation!

1202
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:38,968
These gays is going to hell!

1203
01:04:38,968 --> 01:04:41,334
This abomination
in the sight of God--

1204
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:44,434
This is what
the homosexuals can do.

1205
01:04:44,434 --> 01:04:47,400
They don't really care
about how much they destroy.

1206
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,033
WE SHOULD NOT LET 2%
OF THE POPULATION

1207
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:53,801
DETERMINE-- TO CHANGE
THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE

1208
01:04:53,801 --> 01:04:56,067
THAT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED
BY EVERY SINGLE CULTURE

1209
01:04:56,067 --> 01:04:58,734
AND EVERY SINGLE RELIGION
FOR 5,000 YEARS.

1210
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:01,767
RIGHT NOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
AND THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT

1211
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,701
ARE IN AN UNHOLY
ALLIANCE POLITICALLY.

1212
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:05,400
AND I THINK THEIR
UNHOLY ALLIANCE

1213
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
HAS BEEN
LARGELY FOCUSED

1214
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,033
ON THIS NOTION
OF BEING HOMOPHOBIC.

1215
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:13,567
In America the only
marriage to be recognized

1216
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:16,834
is the marriage between
a man and a woman!

1217
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:18,968
I SAW IT COMING

1218
01:05:18,968 --> 01:05:21,467
IN THE FALL OF '03

1219
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:24,133
WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS
COURT RULING

1220
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:27,934
WITH A CLOSE ELECTION.
I SAW IT COMING.

1221
01:05:27,934 --> 01:05:29,934
I REMEMBER THE DAY

1222
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:32,901
THAT PRESIDENT BUSH GOT UP
AND HELD THE NEWS CONFERENCE

1223
01:05:32,901 --> 01:05:35,267
ANNOUNCING HIS SUPPORT
FOR THE AMENDMENT.

1224
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:37,567
Marriage cannot be severed

1225
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:41,267
from its cultural, religious
and natural roots.

1226
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:43,367
SEEING THE PRESIDENT
ANNOUNCING

1227
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:46,601
THAT ONE OF HIS
TOP PRIORITIES IN CONGRESS

1228
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:48,601
WAS TO PREVENT ME
AND MY PARTNER

1229
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:51,467
FROM HAVING A LEGITIMATE
RELATIONSHIP,

1230
01:05:51,467 --> 01:05:53,467
THAT WAS
A POWERFUL THING.

1231
01:05:53,467 --> 01:05:55,300
IT'S A VERY
SURREAL EXPERIENCE

1232
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,167
TO WATCH THE STATE
OF THE UNION ADDRESS

1233
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:59,200
AND HAVE THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES

1234
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,167
ATTACK YOU AND DEMONIZE
YOU IN THAT SPEECH

1235
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:03,067
THAT'S BEING WATCHED
BY THE ENTIRE WORLD.

1236
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:05,601
IT JUST MADE YOU SICK.

1237
01:06:05,601 --> 01:06:08,434
IT REALLY IN MANY WAYS
WAS A GUT CHECK FOR ME.

1238
01:06:08,434 --> 01:06:11,067
I THINK IT WAS FOR A LOT
OF OTHER GAY REPUBLICANS TOO.

1239
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:14,801
I WAS JUST FURIOUS.
I FELT BETRAYED.
I FELT ANGRY.

1240
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:16,968
I GUESS IF I BELIEVED

1241
01:06:16,968 --> 01:06:20,100
THAT IT WAS A SINCERE
PERSONAL CONVICTION,

1242
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,300
I MIGHT HAVE FELT
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT IT.

1243
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,300
BUT TO JUST USE THAT
TO GET MORE VOTES...

1244
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,400
THIS WAS JUST
RAW POLITICS.

1245
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,701
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
NEED TO DO THIS TO
GET RE-ELECTED.

1246
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:33,033
I THINK THE FEDERAL
MARRIAGE AMENDMENT

1247
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:36,234
WAS THE MOST VIOLENT ATTACK
UPON GAY PEOPLE AND THEIR RIGHTS

1248
01:06:36,234 --> 01:06:39,567
IN THIS COUNTRY, EXPLICITLY,
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED.

1249
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:41,934
I cannot think of a better good

1250
01:06:41,934 --> 01:06:43,834
that this body
may pursue

1251
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,834
than to promote
and defend the idea

1252
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:49,501
that every child deserves both
a father and a mother.

1253
01:06:49,501 --> 01:06:53,767
EVERY ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST
GAY OR LESBIAN, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE

1254
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:58,033
USUALLY STARTS WITH
SOME FORM OF VERY VISIBLE
AND VERY LOUD DEFAMATION.

1255
01:06:58,033 --> 01:07:01,100
Anywhere in the world today,

1256
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,601
you can wake somebody up
in the middle of the night,

1257
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,534
you pick 'em,
and say, "Excuse me.
Wake up just a second.

1258
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:08,601
What is a marriage?"

1259
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:11,100
And they'll say, "A union
between a man and a woman."

1260
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:15,100
SO YOU HAVE THESE ANTI-GAY
LEADERS THAT ARE SPEWING
ALL THIS HATRED

1261
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,033
ABOUT GAY
AND LESBIAN PEOPLE.

1262
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,033
AND PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
REALLY ENGAGED

1263
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:22,300
AND DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
AND DON'T FOLLOW IT THAT MUCH

1264
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,501
HAVE A GENERAL
SAME VIEWPOINT AS THEM

1265
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:27,801
AND THEY JUST SORT
OF COPY AND THEY MIRROR IT.
AND THAT'S HOW IT TRANSFORMS.

1266
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:32,133
A charred truck, threats,

1267
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:34,901
"I'll be back,"
and in bigger writing

1268
01:07:34,901 --> 01:07:37,901
for everyone to see:
"Gay must go."

1269
01:07:37,901 --> 01:07:40,767
22-year-old James Nichola
who goes by "Janine"

1270
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:42,868
says he was the victim
of a hate crime.

1271
01:07:42,868 --> 01:07:45,334
He says the attackers
the whole time were yelling,

1272
01:07:45,334 --> 01:07:47,367
"We want you out
of our neighborhood!"

1273
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:50,534
San Jose, California:
Bill Kiley suffered

1274
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:52,367
repeated harassment
from a young neighbor.

1275
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:56,801
This is video of Neve
in the hospital

1276
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:59,601
just a few days after
he was brutally attacked.

1277
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:01,868
He spent several days
in Strong Hospital

1278
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:05,767
with a fractured skull,
nose, upper jaw and eye socket.

1279
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:09,000
On May 29, the 18-year-old
victim's body

1280
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,367
is discovered in the woods
behind his family's
Woodlawn home.

1281
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:15,601
Police say Steven Parrish
had joined a Bloods gang

1282
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:17,968
and was killed by two
members of his own group.

1283
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,968
Court documents say
it's because they thought
he was gay.

1284
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:25,434
That was four days
before his graduation from
Randallstown High School.

1285
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,901
Students marched
in Oxnard, California,

1286
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:29,901
in memory of
Lawrence "Larry" King,

1287
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:33,734
a 15-year-old student
police say was gunned down
by a classmate

1288
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:37,567
because he was openly gay.
14-year-old Brandon McInerney

1289
01:08:37,567 --> 01:08:40,734
allegedly shot King
in the head in the school's
computer lab.

1290
01:08:40,734 --> 01:08:42,434
It's over.

1291
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:44,934
King was pronounced brain-dead
at a local hospital.

1292
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:48,501
His body was kept alive
so his organs could
be donated.

1293
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:03,434
Today I call upon
the Congress to promptly pass

1294
01:09:03,434 --> 01:09:06,801
and to send to the states
for ratification

1295
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:09,734
an amendment
to our Constitution

1296
01:09:09,734 --> 01:09:13,968
defining and protecting
marriage as the union
of a man and woman

1297
01:09:13,968 --> 01:09:17,033
as husband and wife.

1298
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:18,934
DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH
THE 2004 STRATEGY

1299
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:22,601
AROUND ANTI-GAY ELEMENTS
OF THE BUSH CAMPAIGN,

1300
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:25,567
YOU WILL FIND A CADRE
OF GAY PEOPLE.

1301
01:09:25,567 --> 01:09:28,300
THE 2004 ELECTION
WAS A VERY ANTI-GAY--

1302
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,634
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A PARTY.

1303
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:33,200
AND KEN MEHLMAN
WAS LIKE THE M.C.

1304
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,167
Lifestyle issues.
Gay marriage.

1305
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:37,100
Is that an issue
in this campaign?

1306
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,100
I think it's an issue
in many races.

1307
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,567
IT WAS HARD BECAUSE THERE
WASN'T THE KIND OF EVIDENCE

1308
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:43,501
WITH KEN MEHLMAN THAT
THERE WAS WITH OTHER PEOPLE,

1309
01:09:43,501 --> 01:09:47,467
BUT IT WAS RELATIVELY KNOWN,
AND NOBODY WOULD EVEN ASK.

1310
01:09:47,467 --> 01:09:50,767
A lot of the chiefs
of staff,

1311
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:53,300
the people who really run
the underpinnings

1312
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,501
of the Republican party
are gay.

1313
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:58,100
I don't want to mention names,
but I will Friday night.

1314
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,100
You will Friday night?

1315
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:03,667
Well, there's a couple
of big people who I think
everyone in Washington knows

1316
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,834
- who run the--
- You will name them?

1317
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,834
Well, I wouldn't be
the first.

1318
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,834
I'd get sued
if I was the first.

1319
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:19,100
Ken Mehlman,
there's one I think
people have talked about.

1320
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,200
I don't think
he's denied it when
people have suggested it.

1321
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,801
- He doesn't say--
- I'm walking around
in a fog.

1322
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:27,000
- Come on.
- Ken Mehlman?
I never heard that.

1323
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,267
- But the question is--
- Maybe you don't go to
the same bathhouse I do.

1324
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,934
I'd get sued if I was
the first.

1325
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:35,200
Maybe you don't go to
the same bathhouse I do.

1326
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,167
Why would
someone who is gay

1327
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:40,300
take public
anti-gay positions?

1328
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,400
Why would you do that?

1329
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,167
Because, Larry,
hating yourself is
the greatest love of all.

1330
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:50,934
KEN MEHLMAN WAS THE GUY
THAT RAN THE CAMPAIGN

1331
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:53,033
THAT WAS SENDING OUT
THESE FLIERS,

1332
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:54,934
THAT WAS BAITING PEOPLE,
THAT WAS--

1333
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:57,767
PARTICULARLY IN OHIO AND ALL
THESE BATTLEGROUND STATES

1334
01:10:57,767 --> 01:11:00,501
WHERE IT WAS ALL ABOUT
"LET'S GET PEOPLE
TO VOTE FOR BUSH

1335
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,400
BY THIS GAY THING"
LED BY THE GAY GUY!

1336
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,334
AND FUNDED
BY THE GAY GUY!

1337
01:11:04,334 --> 01:11:06,534
AND POLITICALLY DIRECTED
BY THE GAY GUY!

1338
01:11:06,534 --> 01:11:10,000
YOU KNOW?
AND I THINK PEOPLE
DESERVE TO KNOW THAT.

1339
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,267
I THINK MARY CHENEY'S
OUTING WAS EFFECTIVE.

1340
01:11:14,267 --> 01:11:16,534
OH, I'M APPALLED
BY THE CHENEYS.

1341
01:11:16,534 --> 01:11:19,934
I FELT EXTREMELY
DISHEARTENED...

1342
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:27,200
THAT THEY WERE AS SUPPORTIVE
OF THE ANTI-GAY POLICIES
AS THEY WERE.

1343
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,234
WE ALWAYS THOUGHT
WE HAD SOME PROTECTION

1344
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:31,501
BECAUSE OF THE VICE
PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER.

1345
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:33,567
If your father was
not the vice president,

1346
01:11:33,567 --> 01:11:37,100
and you were a gay woman
in a gay relationship

1347
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,067
in the United States
in 2004, 2000,

1348
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:42,834
- would you have
voted for this ticket?
- Yes, I would have.

1349
01:11:42,834 --> 01:11:45,734
IF SHE WERE STRIPPED
OF HER FATHER'S TITLE,

1350
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:49,467
SHE WOULD BE SUBJECTED
TO THE SAME GRATUITOUS
DISCRIMINATION

1351
01:11:49,467 --> 01:11:52,234
THAT AFFECTS SO MANY
GAYS AND LESBIANS
IN THIS COUNTRY.

1352
01:11:52,234 --> 01:11:56,234
SHE IS PROTECTED
BY HER POSITION
AND HER MONEY.

1353
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:57,934
- And you have a partner.
- I do.

1354
01:11:57,934 --> 01:12:00,834
"Gay couples cannot file
jointly for federal taxes."
Is that true?

1355
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:03,067
- That is true.
- And your feelings
about that?

1356
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:05,467
I think it's wrong.
I think they should
be able to.

1357
01:12:05,467 --> 01:12:07,300
Did you talk to your
father about this?

1358
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,434
We have many conversations
about different issues.

1359
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:11,834
Maybe that's
the point.

1360
01:12:11,834 --> 01:12:13,834
I'm wondering
if people would rather

1361
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,901
you had talked about it
during the campaign

1362
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:18,667
as opposed to after
the campaign and putting
it in the book.

1363
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,100
Would it have
been more effective
to talk about it then?

1364
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,033
I honestly don't think
it would have been.

1365
01:12:24,033 --> 01:12:27,267
I'M COMPLETELY
UNIMPRESSED

1366
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:30,234
THAT SHE DOESN'T AGREE
WITH PRESIDENT BUSH

1367
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:32,167
OR HER FATHER DICK CHENEY,

1368
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:34,167
WHEN IN FACT SHE WORKED,

1369
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:36,200
SHE WAS A PAID OPERATIVE

1370
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,467
TO GET THEM ELECTED
AND THEN RE-ELECTED.

1371
01:12:39,467 --> 01:12:43,868
MARY CHENEY'S JOB
BEFORE HER FATHER RAN
FOR PRESIDENT

1372
01:12:43,868 --> 01:12:47,467
WAS TO BE THE GAY AND LESBIAN
LIAISON FOR COORS BEER.

1373
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:54,234
SHE MADE HER LIVING
FIGURING OUT

1374
01:12:54,234 --> 01:12:56,834
HOW TO DISSECT
THE GAY COMMUNITY

1375
01:12:56,834 --> 01:12:59,601
INTO NICHE MARKETS
AND SELL THEM COORS BEER.

1376
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:02,434
BUT SHE WASN'T
INQUISITIVE ENOUGH

1377
01:13:02,434 --> 01:13:04,400
AND DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH

1378
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,734
TO DISSECT
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

1379
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:09,067
AND THE ELITE
OF THAT PARTY

1380
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:12,701
TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET BASIC RIGHTS PASSED.

1381
01:13:12,701 --> 01:13:16,667
THERE IS PROBABLY NOT
A BETTER EXAMPLE

1382
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:19,501
OF SOMEONE WHO IS
SO STEEPED

1383
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:21,367
IN HYPOCRISY.

1384
01:13:21,367 --> 01:13:23,601
SHE COULD HAVE MADE
A HUGE DIFFERENCE

1385
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:25,534
AND DID NOT.

1386
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,701
I GOT A CALL FROM
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE

1387
01:13:31,701 --> 01:13:34,467
WHO TOLD ME THERE WAS
A GAY ACTIVIST

1388
01:13:34,467 --> 01:13:36,834
WHO WAS GOING
TO START A BLOG

1389
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,267
AND WAS GONNA START
OUTING REPUBLICANS.

1390
01:13:39,267 --> 01:13:42,567
DURING THIS TIME, I WAS
THE NATIONAL FIELD DIRECTOR

1391
01:13:42,567 --> 01:13:45,100
OF THE REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL COMMITTEE.

1392
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,267
ONE OF THE BIG
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT I HAD

1393
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:50,901
WAS HELPING TO OVERSEE
A DIRECT-MAIL PROGRAM.

1394
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:52,901
I WAS THE FIRST ONE
TO GET A PAMPHLET

1395
01:13:52,901 --> 01:13:55,501
FROM AN ARKANSAS
READER OF MY BLOG

1396
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:58,067
THAT SAID THE DEMOCRATS
WERE GONNA BAN THEIR BIBLE

1397
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:00,701
AND TURN STATES INTO
BASTIONS OF HOMOSEXUALITY.

1398
01:14:00,701 --> 01:14:03,868
AND THEY WERE SENDING
THIS TO CHURCH PEW ROSTERS
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

1399
01:14:03,868 --> 01:14:06,734
IT WAS SENT BY THE REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL COMMITTEE

1400
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:10,000
AND THEY DIDN'T
EVEN TRY TO HIDE IT!

1401
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
DAN GURLEY WHO HAD
ULTIMATE AUTHORITY

1402
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,601
OVER THESE UNBELIEVABLE FLIERS,
HE HAD A PROFILE ON GAY.COM

1403
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:19,033
THAT WAS STASHED FULL
OF A BUNCH OF HIS PICTURES.

1404
01:14:19,033 --> 01:14:23,200
AND HE WAS SEEKING
MULTIPLE PARTNERS FOR SEX.

1405
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,234
I GOT A CALL FROM HIM
AT HOME ONE SUNDAY NIGHT

1406
01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:30,501
SAYING, "YOU'RE THE ONE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE NEXT."

1407
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:32,968
HE POINTEDLY ASKED ME
IF I WAS A GAY MAN.

1408
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,801
AND I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS.

1409
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:36,767
UH, HE...

1410
01:14:36,767 --> 01:14:38,801
IMMEDIATELY
THEN STARTED TO...

1411
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:42,400
TO QUESTION ME ABOUT
DID I NOT HAVE A CONSCIENCE?

1412
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,234
DID I NOT FEEL
SOME SORT OF REMORSE

1413
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:49,601
OR REGRET FOR WORKING
FOR A POLITICAL PARTY,

1414
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:52,400
WORKING TO HELP ELECT
A PRESIDENT

1415
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,300
THAT DID NOT SUPPORT
EQUAL RIGHTS FOR GAY AMERICANS?

1416
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:58,033
I BASICALLY JUST SAID,
YOU KNOW,

1417
01:14:58,033 --> 01:15:01,601
"YOU DO WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO DO."

1418
01:15:03,033 --> 01:15:05,701
I WAS IN LINE FOR
A PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT,

1419
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,267
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
IN SOME POLICY ROLE SOMEWHERE.

1420
01:15:08,267 --> 01:15:10,701
BUT ONCE ROGERS
DID THIS POSTING ABOUT ME

1421
01:15:10,701 --> 01:15:12,634
THAT OPPORTUNITY
EVAPORATED.

1422
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,400
RECENTLY I GET AN EMAIL--

1423
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,667
"DAN GURLEY'S
ON THE BOARD

1424
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:22,033
OF NORTH CAROLINA EQUALITY."
I'M LIKE, "WHAT?"

1425
01:15:22,033 --> 01:15:24,601
I WENT TO THE WEBSITE,
I LOOKED IT ABOUT,

1426
01:15:24,601 --> 01:15:27,234
AND I'M LIKE,
"THIS IS HOT.

1427
01:15:27,234 --> 01:15:32,434
THIS IS WHY
I STARTED BLOGACTIVE."

1428
01:15:32,434 --> 01:15:34,200
HE'S AN OUT GAY MAN
AND HE'S PROUD

1429
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,133
AND HE'S ON THE BOARD
OF A STATEWIDE NATIONAL
GAY GROUP.

1430
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:41,434
THIS MAN IS USING HIS SKILL
TO SECURE GAY RIGHTS.

1431
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:44,067
WHAT COULD BE BETTER
AND WHAT BETTER EFFECT

1432
01:15:44,067 --> 01:15:46,167
COULD I HAVE
AS AN INDIVIDUAL?

1433
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:50,200
WHEN YOU COME OUT,
I GUARANTEE YOU

1434
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,667
THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE
BETTER THAN YOU EVER
DREAMED IT WOULD BE.

1435
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:57,100
IN A SENSE I CAME OUT,
I GUESS YOU MIGHT SAY,
IN STAGES.

1436
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,067
I LEFT A MARRIAGE
BACK IN 1991

1437
01:16:00,067 --> 01:16:02,400
AND THAT WAS
A BIG STEP FOR ME.

1438
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,334
I RECOGNIZED MYSELF
AND HER--

1439
01:16:05,334 --> 01:16:07,434
WHAT THE FEELINGS
THAT I HAD.

1440
01:16:07,434 --> 01:16:09,868
JULY OF '96 WAS
WHEN WE HAD A VOTE

1441
01:16:09,868 --> 01:16:12,501
ON WHAT WAS CALLED D.O.M.A.,
THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT.

1442
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,234
AND I VOTED FOR THAT.

1443
01:16:15,234 --> 01:16:18,767
AT THAT TIME "THE ADVOCATE"
MAGAZINE DECIDED THEY WOULD
WRITE AN ARTICLE.

1444
01:16:18,767 --> 01:16:22,601
AND APPROACHED ME ABOUT IT
AND TOLD ME THEY WERE
GOING TO DO SO

1445
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:25,467
AND NAME ME
AS ONE WHO WAS GAY.

1446
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:27,167
AND I BASICALLY JUST SAID,

1447
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:29,968
WELL, I THOUGHT THAT WAS WRONG
FOR THEM TO DO THAT.

1448
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:33,868
I SAID, "I'LL BEAT
YOU TO THE PUNCH HERE."
AND I JUST DID IT MYSELF.

1449
01:16:36,934 --> 01:16:41,133
IT WAS PROBABLY
THE MOST LIFTING EXPERIENCE
I'VE EVER HAD.

1450
01:16:41,133 --> 01:16:44,934
I HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLE,
INDESCRIBABLE

1451
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,934
SENSE OF PEACE AND CALM
COME OVER ME.

1452
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:51,100
AND I COULD LITERALLY
LITERALLY FEEL

1453
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:54,067
40 YEARS JUST LIFTING
OFF OF MY SHOULDER.

1454
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:58,200
I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN I DID
MY ANNOUNCEMENT SPEECH.

1455
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,601
MY MOTHER HAD
FOUND SOME PRAYER CARDS
FROM MY GRANDMOTHER,

1456
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:04,200
FOR WHOM
I WAS VERY CLOSE TO.

1457
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,467
AND I REMEMBER GOING
INTO THE BATHROOM

1458
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:10,767
JUST OUTSIDE
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

1459
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,801
AND, UM...

1460
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:18,267
PRAYING TO MY GRANDMOTHER.

1461
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,234
AND SAYING TO HER...

1462
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,801
"AT LONG LAST...

1463
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:33,334
THIS IS WHO GOD MADE ME

1464
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:37,000
AND THIS IS A GOOD THING."

1465
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,801
I ALWAYS REMEMBER
JOHN McCAIN.

1466
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:41,033
WHEN I STARTED TO SAY,
"JOHN, THERE'S SOMETHING

1467
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:43,200
I REALLY WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT AND TELL YOU ABOUT."

1468
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,601
HE JUST PUT UP
HIS HAND AND SAID,
"NEVER MIND, JIM. I KNOW.

1469
01:17:45,601 --> 01:17:48,167
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
YOU'RE A GOOD LEGISLATOR.

1470
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:50,634
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING
TO BE MY FRIEND."

1471
01:17:50,634 --> 01:17:53,434
AND I REMEMBER WALKING AWAY
FROM THAT CONVERSATION THINKING,

1472
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:56,534
"GOSH, THAT WAS PRETTY EASY.
THAT WASN'T VERY TOUGH
TO DO THAT."

1473
01:17:56,534 --> 01:17:58,934
AND SO EACH ONE WAS
KIND OF LIKE THAT.

1474
01:17:58,934 --> 01:18:02,400
AND IT GOT SO I JUST COULDN'T
WAIT TO PICK UP THE PHONE
TO MAKE THE NEXT CALL.

1475
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,968
I THINK IN THE CASE
OF A MEMBER OF CONGRESS,

1476
01:18:05,968 --> 01:18:07,868
THEY DO CHANGE
THEIR VOTING RECORD.

1477
01:18:07,868 --> 01:18:10,501
BECAUSE ONCE
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CLOSET,

1478
01:18:10,501 --> 01:18:12,868
YOUR DELUSIONAL THINKING
FALLS BY THE WAYSIDE.

1479
01:18:14,501 --> 01:18:17,334
The gentleman is recognized
for three minutes.

1480
01:18:17,334 --> 01:18:20,567
Mr. Speaker, we have not used
the amending process

1481
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:24,234
to limit the rights of citizens.
From the First Amendment
to the 14th,

1482
01:18:24,234 --> 01:18:26,734
the original framers
in the Congress that followed

1483
01:18:26,734 --> 01:18:30,000
have sought to expand,
to protect the rights
of citizens.

1484
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,434
This would be a unique amendment
in that it takes away rights
from one group

1485
01:18:33,434 --> 01:18:36,567
while specifically conferring
it upon another.

1486
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:39,200
Try to find another provision
in the Constitution

1487
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,367
that does this.
You will look in vain.

1488
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:44,067
Mr. Speaker, this Congress
and those after it should

1489
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:46,334
be about protecting
and expanding freedoms.

1490
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:49,767
This proposed amendment
to our Constitution is
about discrimination.

1491
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,567
It is about fear.
It is unnecessary,

1492
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:56,267
it is unwarranted and it
should be soundly defeated.

1493
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:16,133
Amendment 2 does
only one thing:

1494
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:20,000
defining marriage as a union
of a man and a woman.

1495
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,167
That's it.
When you vote,

1496
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:25,968
say yes to pass life
to the next generation.

1497
01:19:25,968 --> 01:19:29,801
Vote yes to keep marriage
one man, one woman.

1498
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:32,868
That's it.
No one loses benefits.

1499
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:35,667
Please vote yes
on Amendment 2.

1500
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:44,167
A big political announcement
out of Florida tonight.

1501
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:46,634
Republican presidential
candidate John McCain

1502
01:19:46,634 --> 01:19:48,767
has picked up
a major endorsement.

1503
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:53,100
I don't think anybody would do
better than the man who stands
next to me: Senator John McCain.

1504
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,667
Governor Crist,
just real quickly, are they
chatting with you

1505
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,567
about a possible
V.P. slot for you?
Come on, be shameless.

1506
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:02,534
- Tell us.
- We're chatting about
working hard for Florida.

1507
01:20:02,534 --> 01:20:05,767
Crist has obviously coveted
the vice-presidential spot

1508
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:08,400
- on the Republican ticket.
- Chris Matthews: "Try getting
married,"

1509
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,367
is that what
we're hearing this week?
Is this part of the excitement

1510
01:20:11,367 --> 01:20:13,601
and the build-up
to running for V.P.?
What's going on here?

1511
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:16,334
If your wife can't help you
in a campaign, who can?

1512
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:26,200
The state's most eligible
bachelor is officially
off the market

1513
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,234
this Fourth of July.
Governor Charlie Crist
is engaged.

1514
01:20:29,234 --> 01:20:32,367
He popped the question
yesterday to his girlfriend
of nine months.

1515
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:34,501
Her name is Carole Rome.

1516
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:38,000
Let me start by asking you
what made you decide

1517
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,767
to pop the question when
you did and, you know?

1518
01:20:40,767 --> 01:20:43,767
Well, I mean, I think you
pop the question like that

1519
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:46,133
when you're in love
and I am.

1520
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,334
And so that's why I did it.

1521
01:20:48,334 --> 01:20:50,934
And thank God she said yes.

1522
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:52,534
We couldn't be happier.

1523
01:20:52,534 --> 01:20:55,901
I TELL THEM TO NEVER LIE,
THAT IF THEY GET THE QUESTION

1524
01:20:55,901 --> 01:20:58,667
THEY SHOULD BE PREPARED
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HONESTLY

1525
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:01,567
AND DO NOTHING BUT ANSWER
THE QUESTION HONESTLY.

1526
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:04,968
What's your reaction over
some people's preoccupation,

1527
01:21:04,968 --> 01:21:07,400
and I'm not talking this time
about marriage,

1528
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,868
with your sexuality?
Both the rumors of-- you know,

1529
01:21:10,868 --> 01:21:13,200
the various rumors
that have been around?

1530
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,033
Sure. Well, you know,
when you're in the public eye,

1531
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:18,501
being Governor of Florida,
that's inevitable.

1532
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:21,601
And, you know, I just--
I don't really focus on it.

1533
01:21:21,601 --> 01:21:23,667
I'm just, uh, you know,

1534
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:26,834
damn glad to-- I found
such a wonderful lady.

1535
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:30,601
THE SAD THING ABOUT THE CLOSET
IS IT DOES, IN PART,

1536
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:33,267
GIVE YOU SKILLS THAT YOU CAN
APPLY AS A POLITICIAN,

1537
01:21:33,267 --> 01:21:37,033
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF POLITICS
TODAY IS POSITIONING

1538
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:40,801
AND SPINNING AND BEING ABLE
TO PIROUETTE ON AN ISSUE.

1539
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:43,033
One aspect is that
you were gay.

1540
01:21:43,033 --> 01:21:46,234
The other one is that you
were a serial philandering
heterosexual.

1541
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,868
Does that bother you?

1542
01:21:48,868 --> 01:21:52,801
Uh, well, lack of truth
always would be disturbing
to somebody.

1543
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:55,934
But I'm just pleased
that I found happiness.

1544
01:21:57,968 --> 01:22:01,100
I'VE WATCHED DECENT PEOPLE
STRUGGLE WITH COMING OUT

1545
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,534
AND BEING UNABLE TO DO SO.

1546
01:22:03,534 --> 01:22:06,934
THE CLOSET, PARTICULARLY
IN THE MIDST OF A CULTURAL WAR,

1547
01:22:06,934 --> 01:22:10,367
SUFFOCATES THE INTEGRITY
OF DECENT PEOPLE.

1548
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:34,367
"For this reason, a man will
leave his father and mother

1549
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:36,968
and be united with his wife

1550
01:22:36,968 --> 01:22:39,801
and they will
become one flesh."

1551
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:43,467
For God's design.

1552
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:47,434
On November 4th,
vote yes on Amendment 2.

1553
01:22:49,868 --> 01:22:54,234
With laws already on the books
to ban same-sex marriage
in Florida,

1554
01:22:54,234 --> 01:22:57,801
voters now added that ban
to the State Constitution.

1555
01:22:57,801 --> 01:23:01,200
OH, WITHOUT A DOUBT.
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GOVERNOR

1556
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,167
OF FLORIDA COULD HAVE CHANGED
THE OUTCOME OF THAT ELECTION

1557
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:07,901
HAD HE NOT TILTED TO
THE RIGHT AND DECIDED TO TAKE
THE POSITION THAT HE DID.

1558
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:09,701
YEAH, WITHOUT A DOUBT.

1559
01:23:17,968 --> 01:23:21,133
THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED
WITH GOOD INTENTIONS.

1560
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:24,534
BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.
AND DAMN IT,

1561
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:27,601
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE RIGHT VALUE IS?
THE RIGHT VALUE IS TRUTHFULNESS.

1562
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:30,033
THE RIGHT VALUE
IS HONESTY.

1563
01:23:30,033 --> 01:23:32,901
THE RIGHT VALUE ISN'T LIVING
SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRUTH.

1564
01:23:32,901 --> 01:23:34,734
IT'S LIVING YOUR TRUTH.

1565
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:40,334
WE DON'T HAVE RIGHTS.

1566
01:23:40,334 --> 01:23:43,033
GAY PEOPLE
DO NOT HAVE RIGHTS.

1567
01:23:43,033 --> 01:23:44,901
DON'T TELL ME THAT WE DO.

1568
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,934
THAT'S WHY
IT'S SO IMPORTANT

1569
01:23:47,934 --> 01:23:50,400
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THESE
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS

1570
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,434
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.
IT AFFECTS GOVERNMENT.

1571
01:23:53,434 --> 01:23:55,300
IT AFFECTS EVERYTHING.

1572
01:23:55,300 --> 01:24:00,133
THIS WHOLE ISSUE REALLY DOES
IMPACT THE PUBLIC-POLICY ARENA.

1573
01:24:00,133 --> 01:24:02,567
IT AFFECTS SOME OF OUR NATION'S
MOST SIGNIFICANT

1574
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:04,834
AND POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS
AND IT'S WHY

1575
01:24:04,834 --> 01:24:07,400
MY HOPE IS THAT
THIS NEXT GENERATION

1576
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,133
OF YOUNG AMERICAN LEADERS
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SUFFOCATED

1577
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:14,334
IN THE MIDST OF A CULTURAL WAR
THAT HOPEFULLY HAS ENDED

1578
01:24:14,334 --> 01:24:17,234
BY THE TIME THEY REACH
WASHINGTON, D.C.

1579
01:25:04,234 --> 01:25:07,033
I REALLY DO BELIEVE,
AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT THIS,

1580
01:25:07,033 --> 01:25:10,634
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
A GAY PERSON CAN DO

1581
01:25:10,634 --> 01:25:14,167
WITH RESPECT TO
THE SOCIAL-JUSTICE ISSUES
AROUND HOMOSEXUALITY

1582
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:16,133
IS SIMPLY TO BE OUT.

1583
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:19,033
AND IT STAGGERS ME TODAY
THAT SO MANY ARE NOT.

1584
01:25:19,033 --> 01:25:21,634
IF EVERY GAY PERSON WERE
TO COME OUT OF THE CLOSET,

1585
01:25:21,634 --> 01:25:23,968
THE GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENT
WOULD BE OVER.

1586
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:26,601
THAT'S THE SLEEPING GIANT
OF THE MOVEMENT--

1587
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:29,334
IS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
IN THE CLOSET COMING OUT

1588
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:31,501
EN MASSE
AND IT WOULD BE DONE.

1589
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,667
If every gay person
in this state

1590
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:36,968
came out--
came out to their family,
their friends,

1591
01:25:36,968 --> 01:25:39,801
we would win.

1592
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,334
But that means that every
gay person must come out

1593
01:25:42,334 --> 01:25:45,167
to their families
so their family doesn't
vote against them,

1594
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:47,567
to their friends, if they
are indeed their friends,

1595
01:25:47,567 --> 01:25:49,934
to their relatives,
to the people where
they work,

1596
01:25:49,934 --> 01:25:52,133
and to their
next-door neighbors.
Nobody else.

1597
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:55,534
If that happened across
the state, we'd win.
