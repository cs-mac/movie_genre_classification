1
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,828
My reminiscence.

2
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,540
I always thought that
for such a lovely river,

3
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,585
the name was mystifying,
Cape Fear.

4
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,006
When the only thing to fear on
those enchanted summer nights

5
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,008
was that the magic
would end

6
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,427
and real life would
come crashing in.

7
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,467
Okay, Cady, the moment
you've been waiting for.

8
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,035
Any people
coming for you, Cady?

9
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,037
What about
your books?

10
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,330
Already read them.

11
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,693
Hi. How are you?

12
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,615
This ropa limpia?

13
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,785
No, no, that means
"clean. " These are dirty.

14
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,122
The idea is to
resolve the tension.

15
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,667
I need to find a motif
that's about movement.

16
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,130
Not the most mind-blowing
concept for a travel agency,

17
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,048
but what the hey?

18
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,093
Like an arrow,
maybe?

19
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,511
Yeah, like an arrow.

20
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,221
Maybe.

21
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,017
But, see, then the other
aspect is stability,

22
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,935
a company
that you can trust.

23
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,480
So if you can
balance those ideas

24
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,109
in a way that's pleasing to
the eye, then you got a logo.

25
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,279
Okay,
movement, stability,

26
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,822
and an arrow.

27
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,827
Okay, I'll think of
something for that one.

28
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,706
Benjamin! Yes.

29
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,293
They switched babies on me at
the hospital, didn't they, huh?

30
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,753
So, how'd you do
in there?

31
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,463
Well, I got the judge to postpone

32
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,840
the alimony hearing
for another 21 days.

33
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,091
Great.

34
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,179
Well, I've got till Monday to find out
which S and L and which municipality

35
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,847
my son-in-law
stashed all that money.

36
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,182
Right. Right.

37
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,892
But, anyway, I thank you
and my daughter thanks you.

38
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,185
Oh, you're welcome, Tom.

39
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,147
Here's Daddy!

40
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,693
Good-bye, Junior!

41
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,705
Yes, that's very
creative, Junior.

42
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,379
He liked me.

43
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,716
All this time,
he actually liked me.

44
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,018
You can't go in.
Your father's making

45
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,271
a television appearance for his
campaign.

46
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,857
Dad! Dad, I've got to talk to you.

47
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,068
Oh, what the hell are you
doing here?

48
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,986
I'm about to go on the air.

49
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,988
What is this smoke?

50
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,411
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

51
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,751
Come on,
let's move our seats.

52
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,181
Okay, then I quit as your son.

53
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,103
So, do you believe
that annoying loser guy?

54
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,105
Dad, you should have
just punched him out.

55
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,273
What?
Just punched him out?

56
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,357
Yeah.

57
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,608
What do you mean?
You boxed.

58
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,402
You could've
shoved him around,

59
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,736
shut him up.
Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,029
I could take you.
Careful.

61
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,573
That's who
I could take.

62
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,283
You could've even
kicked him in the face.

63
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,534
Kicked him
in the face?

64
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,036
You know how to fight dirty.
You do that for a living.

65
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,206
Oh, real
cute, Leigh.

66
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,876
Let's sit outside.
How much do I owe you?

67
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,169
It's taken care of.

68
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,712
Taken care of? Who?

69
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,088
There.

70
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,521
Girls, girls, come on,
let's sit inside.

71
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,772
Yeah, let's sit inside.

72
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,925
Whoa, Mr. Perfect Form.

73
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,385
No, no, I don't. You've got to... What?

74
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,512
Look.
What?

75
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,764
You got to snap your
wrist on the backhand.

76
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,683
Usually I like a little
music at this point, Sam.

77
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,727
Sam, I want to play
in this lifetime.

78
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,104
All right, all right, all right.

79
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,606
You got to
snap your wrist.

80
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,774
Tag.

81
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,653
You know, we should stop
doing this for a while.

82
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,031
Doing... Doing what?
We're not doing anything.

83
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,866
Yeah, I know that.
Yet.

84
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,744
Okay. No, fine, fine.
Maybe you're right.

85
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,454
Why?
Does your wife mind?

86
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,873
Well, my wife doesn't
even know you exist,

87
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,959
which, most certainly,
is for the best, you know.

88
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,418
Why's that?

89
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,130
God, you know, Lori, you know
why you have to ask that question?

90
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,882
'Cause you've never been married. Why?

91
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,300
Is marriage synonymous
with deception?

92
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,718
No, no, no.

93
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,179
It's just that, you
know, when two people...

94
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,848
When two people
get married

95
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,476
and they live together for
a long time, you know...

96
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,815
I like hanging out with
you, you know, so sue me.

97
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,069
You're funny, and you're
cute, and, I don't know...

98
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,531
We talk about the courts
and which judge is senile

99
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,200
and which one wears a gun
under his robe and...

100
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,994
Oh, God.
You know, Lori,

101
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,372
another time, another place,
and who knows, you know?

102
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,250
Tomorrow?

103
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,334
Yeah,
it's a light docket.

104
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,128
No, no, no, no,
I won two out of three.

105
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,671
Let's make it
the best out of five.

106
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,882
All right, well,
that's good, actually,

107
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,968
because today
I let you win.

108
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,595
Sure you did.

109
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,929
See you.
Sure you did.

110
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,936
Hey.

111
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,938
Free as a bird,
apparently.

112
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,773
You go everywhere
you want with whomever.

113
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,400
That much freedom could maybe
get a fellow into trouble.

114
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,484
What do you think?

115
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,861
I'd like my keys.

116
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,030
Could it be
you don't remember me?

117
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,698
Oh, yeah, sure,
I remember you.

118
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,033
You were at the movie
house the other night.

119
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,243
Oh, I'm disappointed.
I'm hurt.

120
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,120
I would like my keys.

121
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,165
Max Cady.

122
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,043
You look the same.

123
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,253
Maybe 15 pounds heavier.

124
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,588
But they say
the average man

125
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,090
gains a pound a year
till he's about...

126
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,967
Come on.

127
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,888
Gains a pound a year
till he's about 60.

128
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,058
Me? I dropped a pound
every year of my sentence.

129
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,854
Atlanta, '77.
You got it. July.

130
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,191
Fourteen years since
I held a set of keys.

131
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,780
Well, you look good,
healthy.

132
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,659
Thank you. 'Cause it's a struggle
to stay healthy in the joint.

133
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,786
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you?

134
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,788
If you were me, they would
stick you with the white trash.

135
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,373
They don't strike
a lick of work all day.

136
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,378
In fact, this little
old cigar is my only vice

137
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,006
'cause I needed a vice in the
joint to remind me I was human.

138
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,843
So, what brings you
to New Essex?

139
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,553
Oh, the climate.

140
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,473
Boy, the South.

141
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,102
I'm thinking of settling right
down here in New Essex, Counselor.

142
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,688
Have you
been following me?

143
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,064
It's a small town.
Everywhere you turn,

144
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,732
I guess, we're gonna run into
each other.

145
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,109
Well, take care,
Mr. Cady.

146
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,360
You, too.

147
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,490
You're gonna learn
about loss.

148
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,991
What?

149
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,962
Dad, could you...

150
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,505
Hmm?

151
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,382
Oh, I'm sorry, Dani.

152
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,343
What're you working on?
It's English.

153
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,054
We're supposed to read
Look Homeward, Angel,

154
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,056
which is a kind
of reminiscence,

155
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,892
and we have to attempt
something in the same style.

156
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,021
What's it about,
your reminiscence?

157
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,733
The houseboat.

158
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,319
Oh, the houseboat.

159
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,326
It's not even
July 3rd yet.

160
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,411
Yeah.

161
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,787
Yeah. I was thinking
we ought to take

162
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,122
two weeks off and
go up to Wilmington

163
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,707
like the old times,
dock the houseboat.

164
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,459
I wanted to
in early June.

165
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,169
Remember you said you
didn't have time this summer.

166
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,295
I probably don't.

167
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,796
Yeah, well,
now I don't, either.

168
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,340
Besides, Dani's got summer
school till Labor Day.

169
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,842
Is it really
that critical

170
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,303
that she can't
miss two damn weeks?

171
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,930
Well, you know, the
alternative was to expel her.

172
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,767
Besides, maybe this Drama
teacher from the college

173
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,727
will get her excited
about something, you know?

174
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,854
Yeah, about him,
probably.

175
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,023
I mean, why'd they have
to make such a stink,

176
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,275
like she was on heroin,
or something?

177
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,527
I mean, marijuana,
what's marijuana?

178
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,571
You and I smoked a
little dope in our time.

179
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,739
Yeah.

180
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,073
You know,
in some cultures,

181
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,784
it's considered
almost a sacrament.

182
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,869
Of course, I realize
in ours, it's forbidden.

183
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:13,124
Right up there with incest
and necrophilia and bestiality.

184
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,626
Honey. Honey. Honey.

185
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,753
Worship of idols,
cannibalism.

186
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,921
Do that again.

187
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,714
What?

188
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,216
Do that again.

189
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,538
Sam. Sam, somebody's out there! What?

190
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,833
No, leave the light off.
Leave it off.

191
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,255
I saw him when
the fireworks went off.

192
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,633
What?

193
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,885
I think I talked to him
this afternoon. You know him?

194
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,181
I want you the hell
off my property!

195
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,528
He's gone.

196
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,829
He said, "I'm gonna make
you think about loss. "

197
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,333
Or, "I'm gonna make you learn
about loss. " Something like that.

198
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,335
That's very poetic.

199
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,629
So, who is he?
Where did he come from?

200
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,880
Well, he's from...

201
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,300
Come on, Leigh, get the
dog off. Ben, get down.

202
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,553
He doesn't
mind me at all.

203
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,138
Leigh, he's your dog.
Come on.

204
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,683
No, he shouldn't
be up on the table.

205
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,185
You're gonna have dog hairs
in the tea and everything.

206
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,020
Get down.
So where's he from?

207
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,898
Oh, he's from the hills,
Pentecostal crackers, you know.

208
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,068
What was he
in prison for?

209
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,488
I think it was battery.

210
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,031
You think it was battery? Yeah.

211
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,491
I mean, well,
who did he batter?

212
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,827
Did he batter a man? Did
he batter a woman? What?

213
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,995
I don't know.

214
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,248
It was 14 years ago.
You know, it's kind of...

215
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,917
I really don't remember.

216
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,087
What does he want
with you?

217
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,674
He's just trying to bug
us, just messing around.

218
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,093
You know, he's an
ex-con, so he's just...

219
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,597
You know, he's probably
upset at the lawyer.

220
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,683
Yeah, your clientele.

221
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,892
Yeah.

222
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,856
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Dani.

223
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,982
You look tired.

224
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,192
Thanks.
I needed that. Leigh.

225
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,069
Leigh, I don't want to alarm her,

226
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,196
but I'd rather Dani
didn't wander out alone

227
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,157
on her soul-searching
walks in the woods

228
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,700
at least till I've
started a few things,

229
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,201
maybe even talked
to the boss.

230
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,870
What if she takes
Benjamin with her?

231
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,496
What? Big Ben,
our guard dog?

232
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,457
What's he gonna do,
lick him to death?

233
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,083
Just tell her.
Tell her what?

234
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,918
I hardly know anything
about the man.

235
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,503
I don't mean
his biography.

236
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,921
Just there's
some creep around.

237
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,507
And if you see him again,
call the cops and then call me.

238
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,843
What about a weapon,
you know?

239
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,888
In case things get
exciting around here.

240
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,973
Look, Leigh, would you
really feel more secure

241
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,433
with a loaded gun
in the house?

242
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,852
We'd probably end up
using it on each other.

243
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,395
Or Dani would.

244
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,689
He's not gonna do anything.
He just got out of prison.

245
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,067
He doesn't want to go
right back. All right?

246
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,321
Call Lee Heller.

247
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,406
Lee is
a colorful character,

248
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,408
but he's still the best
criminal lawyer in the state.

249
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,660
Good. Bonnie, get me Lee Heller.

250
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,747
Sam, you defended
this guy, right?

251
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,790
Right.

252
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,750
So, what makes you think
he wants to harm you?

253
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,794
Yesterday I was
getting in my car.

254
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,630
The guy comes up, we have
a little conversation.

255
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,966
He says to me, "You're
gonna learn about loss. "

256
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,179
That'd hardly qualify under
the terrorist threat statutes.

257
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,307
Oh, come on, Tom, for Christ's
sake, the guy's an ex-con.

258
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,393
You know as well as
I do what that means.

259
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,188
I mean, last night, there he
was, he was behind our house.

260
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,940
Ah. Attempted B and E.

261
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,274
No, not exactly.

262
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,986
I mean, he was sitting on a
wall that bounds our property.

263
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,781
That's not
even trespassing, Sam.

264
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,491
I mean, come on.
What can I say?

265
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,159
I mean,
get a restraining order.

266
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,579
I did. I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in 10 days.

267
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,041
Good. Good. I mean, you
know, anything I can do.

268
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,210
Tom, 14 years ago

269
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,048
in this case I had a
report on the victim.

270
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,217
It was a rape case.
That's right.

271
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,636
Rape and
aggravated sexual battery.

272
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,471
Anyway, I had a report on this victim

273
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,558
and it came back that
she was promiscuous.

274
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,686
And...

275
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,313
I buried it.

276
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,983
Whew.

277
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,069
Anybody else know
about this?

278
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,320
No, no, no,
I buried it.

279
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,530
I mean, I didn't show it to the client,

280
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,824
I didn't show it
to the prosecution.

281
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,785
But if you had seen what this
guy had done to this girl...

282
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,038
"In every criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have

283
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,999
"the Assistance of
Counsel for his defense. "

284
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,250
I know
the Sixth Amendment.

285
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,668
I believe in
the Sixth Amendment.

286
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,296
I mean, that's why I left
the Public Defender's Office.

287
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,174
There was no way to serve
the law in that capacity.

288
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,258
Some folks just
don't have the right

289
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,426
to the best defense,
huh, Sam?

290
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,678
No! Of course they
deserve the best defense!

291
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,472
But, I mean, if you had seen
what he did to this girl...

292
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,765
You buried the report.

293
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,267
I mean, if it was
your own daughter, Tom.

294
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,353
Yeah, I mean...
Buried the report.

295
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,189
Jesus, Sam.

296
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,233
Oh, God.

297
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,157
But I don't see how
he could know that.

298
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,408
I mean,
he was illiterate.

299
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,660
I mean, I had to
read everything to him,

300
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,162
the probable
cause affidavit,

301
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,539
the arrest reports,
everything.

302
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,710
There's no way
he could know that.

303
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,059
Hey, Dani, it's so quiet out
here, and the light's so perfect,

304
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,312
why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?

305
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,480
Why?

306
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,982
I told you why.

307
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,320
Well, is it because he's like
a flasher or just a peeper?

308
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,198
What do you know about that? A flasher?

309
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,034
Oh, you don't think
I've been flashed before?

310
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,411
Oh, well, I certainly
didn't mean to insult you.

311
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,247
I'm sure you've
been flashed before.

312
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,124
Look, if you want to come out,
come on out. If you don't, go on.

313
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,252
Do whatever you want.

314
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,171
Oh, but don't
go outside.

315
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,929
Afternoon,
Counselor.

316
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,893
What do you want,
Mr. Cady?

317
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,612
They're great at
that age, ain't they?

318
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,156
All those discoveries
ahead of them.

319
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,533
You're lucky,
Counselor.

320
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,828
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

321
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,123
After I went inside, her
mama told her I was dead,

322
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,125
which, in a way,
I was.

323
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,546
Look, Mr. Cady, I
realize that you suffered.

324
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,758
I mean, I understand your
problem, but, I mean, why me?

325
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,220
I was your lawyer.
I defended you.

326
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,807
I mean, why not badger
the D.A. or the judge?

327
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,975
"Badger. "

328
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,101
Yeah. Why not them?

329
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,021
Yeah. Why not them?
"Badger. "

330
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,108
Best I remember, they was
just doing right by their jobs.

331
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,694
Oh, I didn't do my job?
Is that right?

332
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,489
Look, I pleaded you out to
a lesser occluded offense.

333
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,825
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

334
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,161
Oh, I'd have been up for
parole either way in seven years

335
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,454
according to the
Georgia penal code.

336
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,538
Rape is
a capital offense.

337
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,166
I mean, you could've gotten
life, you could've done death.

338
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,127
You could be sitting
on death row right now.

339
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,465
I learned to read
during my stretch.

340
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,677
First,
Spot Goes to the Farm,

341
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,056
then Runaway Bunny,
then law books, mostly.

342
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,185
Did you know that
after I discharged you,

343
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,103
I acted as
my own attorney?

344
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,689
Applied several times
for an appeal.

345
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,649
No, I didn't know that.

346
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,361
Mmm-hmm.

347
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,529
So, here we are,

348
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,116
two lawyers, for all practical
purposes, talking shop.

349
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,036
All right. How much
do you want, Mr. Cady?

350
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,872
How much
do I want what?

351
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,083
How much money
do you want?

352
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:01,003
Money? Counselor, do I
look destitute to you?

353
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,256
Well, I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

354
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,177
You ever been a woman?

355
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,637
A what?

356
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,763
A woman.

357
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,726
Some fat, hairy, ugly
hillbilly's wet dream?

358
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,190
Look, I realize that
you suffered in prison.

359
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,274
Suffered.

360
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,692
There's no question
about that. "Suffered. "

361
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,654
You don't know what
suffering is, Counselor.

362
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,573
Like it says
in Galatians 3,

363
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,493
"Have ye suffered
so many things in vain?"

364
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,870
Yeah.

365
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,914
I learned from the get-go
in the joint to get in touch

366
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,668
with the soft nurturing side
of myself, the feminine side.

367
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:50,386
Well, I'm open to some sort
of discussion on compensation.

368
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,056
What shall be
my compensation, sir,

369
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,351
for being held down and
sodomized by four white guys

370
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,395
or four black guys?

371
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,898
Shall my compensation
be the same?

372
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,026
What is the formula
for compensation, sir?

373
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,696
How about $10,000
in cash?

374
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,908
Do I...

375
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,622
Well, let's just break that down. No.

376
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,791
Now, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Let's just break it down.

377
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,251
You see, that figure just
came to the top of my head.

378
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,919
Well, let's just say,
for argument's sake,

379
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,131
let's say $20,000,
let's say $30,000.

380
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,341
Say... I'll tell you
what. Let's say $50,000.

381
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,803
$50,000 into 14 years.

382
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,640
Fourteen years times
365 days is about...

383
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,934
I say about 5,000 days.

384
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,397
Now, you divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $10 a day.

385
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,609
That's
not even minimum wage.

386
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,571
To say nothing about the family
that I lost, the respect that I lost.

387
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,990
I don't think you really,
really understand

388
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,159
what we're
talking about here.

389
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,744
Fourteen years.

390
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,748
Whoops. Uh-oh.

391
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,916
Gotta git.

392
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,792
I'm late
for another appointment.

393
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,050
Sam, my man,
I got some good news.

394
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,052
I got the bank,
I got the account number.

395
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,970
Great. I'll call your
son-in-law's lawyer,

396
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,138
tell him we're going
to court.

397
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,516
Mr. Bowden, your wife's on line one.

398
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,559
Ask her to hold. I got
to make a quick call.

399
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,728
I wouldn't make that
call, Sam. The way I'd...

400
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,897
Mr. Bowden,
she says it's urgent.

401
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,402
Yeah?

402
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,450
...these kind of horrible,
high-pitched howls.

403
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,161
They sounded like
he was screaming,

404
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,579
and then Dani
came running in,

405
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,914
and I...

406
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,125
I called the vet.

407
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,380
Then it was so weird
because

408
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,177
it was like
he was winding down,

409
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,390
just winding down
like an old clock.

410
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,726
And then, all of a
sudden, he just stopped.

411
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,355
He had this kind of...

412
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,318
His eyes just wide open,
and this kind of

413
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,114
surprised look.

414
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,325
And then...

415
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,330
And then he died.

416
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,794
He just died, before
the vet even got here.

417
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,673
What did the vet say?

418
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,466
That he was poisoned.

419
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,676
Poisoned?

420
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,636
What kind of a poison?

421
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,514
I don't know
what kind of poison.

422
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,599
Oh, Jesus!

423
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,142
Leigh, I told you not
to let him out.

424
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,476
I didn't let him out!

425
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,603
Well, then how...

426
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,605
I didn't let him out!
Stop!

427
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,858
I've got
an English Setter myself,

428
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,277
so I don't cotton
to dog killers.

429
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,405
Trouble is, poisoning
a dog is just a fine.

430
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,700
But if he's unemployed,
he got to have money

431
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,368
or we'll bust him
for vagrancy.

432
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,204
We'll give him
a full-body strip search.

433
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,750
Jerk a knot
in his tail.

434
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,793
All right.

435
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,882
They got so many ways on the
books to lean on an undesirable.

436
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,134
He'll feel about
as welcome around here

437
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,344
as a case
of yellow fever.

438
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,637
Hands
against the wall.

439
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,930
Spread them.
Spread them.

440
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,016
That him?
Face the wall.

441
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,893
One-way mirror,
Mr. Bowden.

442
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,519
He doesn't
know you're here.

443
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,396
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

444
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,315
Get the shirt off.

445
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,068
Come on, hurry up.

446
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,153
Let's go. Just pass it over to him.

447
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,948
Hand it to me.

448
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,533
All right.
Knock off the shoes.

449
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,079
Hand them to
the other officer.

450
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,083
Pass them to him.
Come on, come on.

451
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,629
All right.
Let's put the arms out.

452
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,589
Put your arms
out straight.

453
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,635
Roll your palms. OFFICER
Do what he says.

454
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,682
Turn around, slow.

455
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,860
I don't know whether to
look at him or read him.

456
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,740
Stand still.

457
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,162
One more step for
you. You know the routine.

458
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,791
Against the wall.

459
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,878
We searched his apartment. His car
registration and everything's in order.

460
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,549
There's no guns or any other
weapons. But we found these.

461
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,053
Cady's
savings account.

462
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,930
$30,000?

463
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,891
Yeah, well, see, his mother
died while he was serving

464
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,060
and the farm got sold
off. He got the proceeds.

465
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,230
Well, he's got money.
Where does that leave us?

466
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,065
Well, at the very
least, we nail him for the dog.

467
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,191
Now, what happened?

468
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,026
You let the dog out.
Cady abducted him.

469
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,153
No.

470
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,364
We didn't
let the dog out.

471
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,616
Cady came
into your house?

472
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,452
That's illegal entry
with intent.

473
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,747
Yeah. But he didn't
come in the house.

474
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,668
Look, I'm not a cop. I don't
know exactly how he did it.

475
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,212
I just know that
he did it somehow.

476
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,465
That's not good enough,
Mr. Bowden.

477
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,675
Now, you're a lawyer.
You damn well know that.

478
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,427
Get off the pants.

479
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,309
Sooner or later,
he's gonna screw up.

480
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,019
I mean, the sheriff
assured me

481
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,104
that they always do.
He's an ex-con.

482
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,690
And then he's going to get the
message in no uncertain terms.

483
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,275
I'd still like
to kill him.

484
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,802
Now, Dani, how come you didn't
join up with them? You can tap.

485
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,012
Yeah, you can do that.
You can tap dance.

486
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:11,225
I wanted to once,
but I don't know...

487
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,611
Son of a bitch.

488
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,737
What?

489
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,160
He's staring at you.

490
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,495
What are you
talking about?

491
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,377
What the hell
are you doing?

492
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,754
Hot as a firecracker
on the 4th of July.

493
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,050
You're damn lucky
to have her, boy.

494
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,552
You son of a bitch.

495
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,262
Where did he go?

496
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,972
Son of a...

497
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,855
Watch my arm. Watch my
arm. It might be broke.

498
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,356
What's with you, buddy?

499
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,191
You have no right to be
pushing me around like that.

500
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,317
I was just
watching the parade.

501
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,485
I wasn't pranking
on nobody.

502
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,945
You son of a bitch!

503
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,364
What are you getting
so upset about?

504
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,199
You're lucky
I don't sue you.

505
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,578
All right.
All right.

506
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,662
Settle down.

507
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,038
I am. I am.
I am settled down.

508
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,292
Sam,
what are you doing?

509
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,376
Oh, it's nothing.

510
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,420
Who was that?
It's no one.

511
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,921
Who was that?
No one. Come on.

512
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,133
The fellow with the tie,
his wife took him away.

513
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,677
I think
he really hurt his arm.

514
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,928
Mom!

515
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,808
LORl: That's an awfully strong
drink you've got there, mister.

516
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,435
You said it, boy.

517
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,105
You just put a little goldfish
in it, and you'll be fine.

518
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,901
You seem to be
having a good time.

519
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,402
I've been practicing.

520
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,862
Practicing for what?

521
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,697
How to fall
on the floor?

522
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,115
A life of debauchery.

523
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,283
"Debauch," what?

524
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,328
Debauchery. It's a
three-syllable word. Yeah.

525
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,582
Making fun of me?
That's okay. No problem.

526
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,833
No, I'm not. I'm not.

527
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,918
I made you blush.

528
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:01,960
Blush?

529
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,714
Yes. You're now the color
of your shirt, scarlet.

530
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,637
I had no business getting
stuck on a guy who was married.

531
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,305
You certainly did not.

532
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,932
I don't know
what I was thinking.

533
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,017
God only knows.

534
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,603
Now aren't I the bozo
on this bus?

535
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,107
Oh, God. Lest you think that
I slept with this particular

536
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,109
married guy... That's
your business. Not mine.

537
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,569
I don't want to
make it sound like

538
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,987
I've been through
a busload of them.

539
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,032
That's the way
it sounded to me.

540
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,408
He was the first.

541
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,534
Oh, yeah.

542
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,078
He was, I swear.

543
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,287
Oh, yeah.

544
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,206
Oh, boy.
Tell it to the judge.

545
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,628
Actually the rat
stood me up today.

546
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,712
Did he?

547
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,255
Yes!
What a shame.

548
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,548
I know.

549
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,718
So, now it's my turn.
Where are you from?

550
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,886
Where am I from?
Yes.

551
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,972
You're gonna love this.
Yes.

552
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:59,351
I'm from the Georgia State
Correctional Facility.

553
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,026
Now you think I'm joking?
That's the truth.

554
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,486
I just got released
from prison.

555
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:13,365
Oh, my God. This is the way
my day has been turning out.

556
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,994
Actually, it reminds me of a joke.

557
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,204
Do you want to hear it? Tell me.

558
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,789
Liven up the night.
All right.

559
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,001
An unmarried woman...

560
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,711
Wait a minute, that's not
it. An unmarried woman...

561
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,379
Come on, get the joke
straight, darling.

562
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,256
Shut up. Shut up.
Let me do it.

563
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,216
An unmarried woman,
she meets a guy

564
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,177
and he tells her he
just got out of prison.

565
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,013
"What did you do?"
she asks.

566
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,849
"I hacked my wife into 52
pieces with a chain saw. "

567
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,146
She says,
"So, you're single?"

568
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,898
That's even funnier.
Thank you.

569
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,317
Could I ask you something? What?

570
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,028
What did you do? I knew
you were going to ask that.

571
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,655
I hacked my wife
into 52 pieces.

572
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,741
I was afraid you were
gonna say that.

573
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,119
Well, I'm a very small
person, so maybe...

574
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,705
Maybe I can hack you
into 40 pieces.

575
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,711
What did you do,
really?

576
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,796
"No, really,
but what did you do?"

577
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:16,094
No, I just... There was this protest
march on this nuclear power plant,

578
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,722
and so when they came
to arrest us,

579
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,391
this macho sheriff got a tad
rough with the lady behind me,

580
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,477
so, I popped
the little bastard,

581
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,312
so they gave me
a little time for it.

582
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,691
I'm drinking a Sea Breeze.
I hope you can afford them.

583
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,942
But you gotta
stay sober.

584
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,071
If you ain't sober, then
you're taking your chances.

585
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,156
Because I'm just
one hell of an animal.

586
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,200
Yeah? Do tell.

587
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,872
Get you on this side,
doll. Let's do this.

588
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,665
Who is Loretta anyway?

589
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,126
That's the love of my life.
She's no longer with us.

590
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,419
I thought I was the love of your life.

591
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,380
Chopped her up
into 52 pieces.

592
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,553
He hurt you like this,
that married guy?

593
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,638
No.

594
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,764
He hurt you like this?

595
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,100
I told you,
we never did anything.

596
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,601
He hurt you like this?

597
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,770
Oh, scandal.

598
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,480
He's a rough one.

599
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,524
How's this feel?

600
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,196
Oh, my God.
Am I under arrest?

601
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,200
Not quite, darling.

602
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,039
Officer, I swear,
it's all a mistake.

603
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,919
That married guy
hurt you like this?

604
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,547
Because what he did to me
hurt a lot worse than this!

605
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:35,924
No!

606
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,975
I've got you now,
bitch!

607
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,654
Dani, when did
this key stop working?

608
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,740
What? Oh, I don't know.

609
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,703
No wonder.
A wire's missing.

610
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,248
A piano wire
is missing.

611
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,292
Was somebody fooling
around with the piano?

612
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,418
What?

613
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,422
Yeah? ELGART ON PHONE: Mr. Bowden.

614
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,091
I think we might could
have a little break here.

615
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,217
Good. Good.

616
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,678
I can be there
in a half hour.

617
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,971
All right, fine.
Thank you.

618
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,723
Who was that?

619
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,057
Cady raped another girl.

620
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,103
Rape? I thought
you said it was battery.

621
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,023
Well, yeah, the case was
wobbly. I got it reduced.

622
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,442
Oh, I remember those
days, old slippery Sam.

623
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,945
I'm sorry, Leigh. I just didn't
want to alarm you or Dani.

624
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,197
Why? How old
was that girl?

625
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,448
Sixteen.

626
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,241
Sixteen, what?

627
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,292
Well, my birthday
is coming up.

628
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,377
Neighbors heard screams
and called us.

629
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,297
When the perp drove off,
somebody made his plate.

630
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,382
Max Cady.
Good. Great.

631
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,677
We got one bitty problem.
The girl is scared.

632
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,555
She's claiming she
fell down some stairs.

633
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,979
Sam.

634
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,317
Don't...
Don't look at me.

635
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,987
Oh, my God.

636
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,157
You two know
each other?

637
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,455
Yeah, we work together.

638
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,083
I'll be outside.

639
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,797
I'm so stupid.

640
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,131
Oh, Lori, don't.

641
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,430
You stood me up at
the club the other day.

642
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,475
And then
you didn't call.

643
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:57,565
And by last night, I was
feeling pretty reckless.

644
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,903
I thought about what you said, you know,

645
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,991
that your wife, she
didn't know I existed.

646
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,454
And I felt like I was going to show you.

647
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,418
I guess I showed you,
all right, didn't I?

648
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,338
I guess
I really showed you.

649
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,804
Lori, listen to me,
okay?

650
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:33,977
Now, look, this guy Cady, he's
done this kind of thing before.

651
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,606
Now, he's going to do
this over and over again

652
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:42,027
unless you testify and
we take him to court...

653
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,278
No. No. No.

654
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,947
And press charges
and testify.

655
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,824
Lori.
Sam.

656
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:52,287
Sam, I know, I know how it
works. I see it every day.

657
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,915
Only this time,
I'm on the other side.

658
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,628
I don't want to explain
why I was in a bar

659
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,215
and how much I had to drink
and what I was wearing.

660
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,593
Not by the people
I work with.

661
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,847
Not by the guys that I see
cross-examine other people on the stand,

662
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:15,685
just crucify them and
just laugh about it later.

663
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,439
They'll even ask
about you.

664
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,194
Lori, listen to me.
I don't care about that.

665
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,404
Well, I care about that.

666
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,574
I'm sure you do, too.

667
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,077
I'm...

668
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,414
I'm terribly sorry, Lori.
I'm just terribly sorry.

669
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
Look.

670
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,588
If all this is
something personal

671
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,215
between you and
the girl and Cady...

672
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,800
Personal? I mean...

673
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,177
All right, come on,
Lieutenant.

674
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,512
All right.
What are you implying?

675
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,013
Only that there
are some things

676
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,015
that are better
handled quietly.

677
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,767
Not by the police.

678
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,561
This Cady guy is
planning to rape my wife,

679
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,813
but it's not
your problem anymore?

680
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,399
I can't bust someone for
planning to rape your wife.

681
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,984
You're a lawyer, Mr. Bowden.
You know that damn well.

682
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,320
Thanks all the same.
The way I'd handle it...

683
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,572
What, file a restraining
order? I already did.

684
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,741
Just think of this
fellow Cady as a tiger.

685
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,160
The trick is to get
him out of the brush.

686
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,703
Now how do we
do that?

687
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,623
You stake out a couple of
your goats and hide in a tree.

688
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,999
What are you suggesting,
Lieutenant?

689
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,586
That I use my family
as bait? And then what?

690
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,755
What? I'm gonna hope
that this psychopath

691
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,590
attacks my wife
and child?

692
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,259
And then what?
Blow his head off?

693
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,385
I'm a law officer.

694
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,763
It would be unethical
of me to advise a citizen

695
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,849
to take the law
into his own hands.

696
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,351
So, I suppose you must've
misunderstood me.

697
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,853
Oh, I guess I must've.

698
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,148
Well, pardon me
all over the place.

699
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,385
And he's been harassing
my family, but he's clever.

700
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,346
I mean, cleverly, so that
the law can't touch him.

701
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,140
Also I believe
that he's able to slip

702
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,892
into the house
and out undetected.

703
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,643
Although, is he out?
I can't tell.

704
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,521
He's either out or
he's in. I'm not sure.

705
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,106
Well, I can't see
through walls, Mr. Bowden.

706
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,776
I'm not asking you to see
through walls. That's fine.

707
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,862
I mean, why can't anybody
do anything for me?

708
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,906
What good are cops
and laws...

709
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,741
Sam, Sam, Sam,
calm down.

710
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,659
Let me explain
something to you.

711
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,496
See, the system is set up to
handle generalized problems

712
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,623
like burglary
and robbery.

713
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,543
But if some lone creep out there
targets you for some obscure reason,

714
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,963
the system is slow and
skeptical. It's pathetic even.

715
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,925
What's your connection
with this fellow?

716
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,428
I was his lawyer,
his public defender.

717
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,472
But you shafted him
somehow, right?

718
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,350
Well, at least that's the
way he perceives it. Sam, Sam.

719
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,102
I don't care what you
did. What did he do?

720
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,688
He raped
a 16-year-old girl.

721
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,399
Do you have a daughter
around sixteen?

722
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,568
She's fifteen.

723
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,612
All right.
Here's the deal.

724
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,155
I'll do a background check
on him,

725
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,282
follow him for about a week and
write you up a risk assessment.

726
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,617
All right, good.
Great, great.

727
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,701
Now, the cops...

728
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,119
I can find him.

729
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,829
His name's Max Cady.
You already told me.

730
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,249
Just take it easy.
Stay calm.

731
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,835
Now, Dani, you can
just relax because

732
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,631
your daddy has a private
investigator on the payroll.

733
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,758
Isn't that right?

734
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,637
What's your feeling about
him? What, Sam Spade?

735
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,473
Mickey Spillane?
Peter Gunn?

736
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,393
Dirty Harry?
Perry Mason?

737
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,061
No, no, no, no.
Perry Mason...

738
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,479
Perry Mason
was a lawyer.

739
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,398
No, the minute I walked
in this guy's office,

740
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,732
I felt totally relaxed.

741
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,818
I mean, this guy is
totally in charge.

742
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,861
Kersek deals with these
types for a living.

743
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,072
He looked like he was going to enjoy...

744
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,743
Yes?
Yeah, it's me.

745
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,204
After you left, I had this
interesting conversation

746
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,039
with a C.O. over at
Statesboro prison.

747
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,584
Mmm-hmm. Seems our man Cady
had a job in the kitchen.

748
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,668
Right.

749
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,295
There was this other inmate
working in there with him,

750
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,088
he was an obstinate S.O.B. Right.

751
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,923
He hated Cady's
cigar smoke

752
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,467
and he was always bitching
and moaning about it.

753
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,719
Well, one day,
they found him

754
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,679
with his neck broke
and his tongue bit off.

755
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,472
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah.

756
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,521
They never could place
Cady near the scene of the accident,

757
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,858
if you want to call it
that, at least not out loud.

758
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,237
But the parole board, they kept
him in for another seven years.

759
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,115
Uh-oh. The subject is on the
move. Get a good night's sleep.

760
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,993
Who was that?
Our private eye.

761
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,870
I thought
we were relaxed now.

762
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,832
New Essex County Hospital.

763
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,252
Yes, room 5036, please.

764
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,378
One minute, please.

765
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,588
All right.

766
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,173
LORl ON PHONE: Hello?

767
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,716
Hi, Lori,
it's me, Sam.

768
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,052
Lori, I just
feel God-awful

769
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,470
you got dragged
into this thing.

770
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,638
It's not your fault.

771
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,432
If I had any idea
that Cady would hurt you

772
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,643
to get at me,
I would have warned you.

773
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,646
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm glad you called.

774
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,397
Yeah. Yeah, well.

775
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,191
I'm so sorry
about this.

776
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,942
I feel the same way.

777
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,988
So, are you
really determined

778
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,657
about moving back
to Connecticut?

779
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,659
Well, I've thought
about it a lot.

780
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,370
I just think it's
probably the best thing.

781
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,831
I thought that maybe I
could go back to school.

782
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,210
I'm really going
to miss you, though.

783
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,212
Right.
Excuse me, Lori.

784
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,172
You know, that sounds real good. Yeah.

785
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,341
That's gonna work out fine.
I'll get right back to you.

786
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,259
Okay. Bye.
All right, bye.

787
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,517
Well, I just don't know
what I hate more,

788
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:52,939
that insipid tone or your
stupid, sophomoric infidelities.

789
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,858
Who was that? Huh?

790
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,527
The girl that
got beat up?

791
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,778
Yes, it was the girl that got beat up.

792
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,238
Lori Davis.
I already told you.

793
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,573
She works at the county
courthouse. She's a clerk.

794
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,410
And what?
You're fucking her?

795
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,788
Interesting choice, Sam.

796
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,707
Calling from
our bedroom phone.

797
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,709
You know, Leigh,
why is it that

798
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,086
whenever I have a private
phone conversation,

799
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,464
you assume that I'm fucking
someone, huh? Why is that?

800
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,925
That's why that psychopath
chose her, right?

801
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,094
Yes, yes, that's why
he chose her.

802
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,263
But I'm not fucking her in any way.

803
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,476
Well, you sleazy
son of a bitch!

804
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,894
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

805
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,896
Goddamn you!
You son of a bitch!

806
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,273
Stop it! Leigh!

807
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,734
Dani is
right downstairs.

808
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,195
Oh. Oh, honey, there's
nothing the matter.

809
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,030
Yeah, I can see, Dad.

810
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,076
I thought you promised to
leave all that shit behind in Atlanta.

811
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,494
What shit?

812
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,210
Christ,
what a waste!

813
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,171
The humiliation
we went through

814
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,089
confessing all our
dirty little secrets

815
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,258
in those horrible sessions
with Dr. Hackett.

816
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,594
Yeah. We talked that one damn
incident to death, didn't we?

817
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,803
Yeah.
Why did you bother?

818
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,221
Because you
asked me to go.

819
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,556
I mean,
why did you bother?

820
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,183
Why did you bother?

821
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,020
Why did you bother with you
and me? With the marriage?

822
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,982
Uprooting me and Dani?
Moving?

823
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,859
Because that's
what we decided to do!

824
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,069
You said that you wanted to get
out! You don't get it, do you, Sam?

825
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,279
All right, Leigh.
What is it I don't get?

826
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,489
You just don't get it.

827
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,365
What...
What don't I get?

828
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,368
Why put us
through all of that! Why?

829
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,704
Nadine?

830
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,206
It's Dani.

831
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,917
Nothing.

832
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,337
I'm just
losing my mind here.

833
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,090
You don't have
the balls to walk out,

834
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,801
if that's what you
wanted. Oh, what I wanted?

835
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,428
Like I was going to split, with
you acting the way you acted.

836
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,888
Acting?
Yeah.

837
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,016
You did some acting. I don't
remember doing any acting.

838
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,476
Oh, you don't remember
doing any acting?

839
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,269
Well, hey, let me refresh your memory.

840
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,522
Do you remember not taking
any work for three months?

841
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,524
Do you remember that? You
remember not fixing any meals?

842
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,567
I'm not on
fucking trial here!

843
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,904
Do you remember crying every goddamn
morning, afternoon, every evening?

844
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,739
Do you remember that?

845
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,452
I scared you, huh?

846
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,747
What did you think, Sam?

847
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,668
What did you think? You thought
maybe I was going to kill myself?

848
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,419
Over you?
Who else?

849
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,629
You pompous ass.

850
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,464
Oh, God damn it, Leigh, who
knew what you were gonna do?

851
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,632
You wouldn't
leave the bedroom!

852
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,467
Yeah. I wish you
could say the same.

853
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,428
Now, look, isn't this what
Dr. Hackett talked about?

854
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,264
Digging up the past.

855
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,434
I mean,
the relevant issue here

856
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,436
is whether I've been
messing around in New Essex.

857
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,105
And I have not been.

858
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,525
As far as this girl goes,
Lori, she's just a kid.

859
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,985
Well,
that shouldn't stop you.

860
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,570
She's a baby.

861
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,029
I mean, you know when
you gravitate to people

862
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,197
in the same world
as you...

863
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,866
You gravitate to women.

864
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,284
Oh, come on, Leigh,
for Christ sake,

865
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,452
I'm a lawyer, she's a
clerk. She looks up to me.

866
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,330
She's just infatuated.
I can't help that.

867
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,754
Look, Leigh,
I'm scared.

868
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,799
I think this
whole thing has...

869
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,722
I keep feeling that there is
some animal out there stalking us.

870
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,766
I think he wants to
hurt us in the worst way

871
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,437
and that's got me
frightened to death.

872
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,276
You really are scared,
aren't you?

873
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,736
Yeah.

874
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,946
Somebody finally
got to you.

875
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,825
Look, Leigh,
I think...

876
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,952
I think that this guy
beat and raped her

877
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,039
because he knew that
she wouldn't testify,

878
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,666
that she wouldn't
press charges,

879
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,835
because she knows
the system.

880
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,587
I mean,
she works in it.

881
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,089
She knows that
she'd be on trial.

882
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,470
And then, because she wouldn't
testify, you would assume that

883
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,932
there was something
going on between us

884
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,934
and it would
cause a rift.

885
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,773
That we'd be much more
vulnerable to him.

886
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,739
I'm glad we talked
about this,

887
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,908
because now
we can work together.

888
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,451
We can beat that
son of a bitch,

889
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,871
the two of us together,
working as a team.

890
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,334
Jesus Christ.

891
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,129
Oh, yeah, this is great.
This is something else.

892
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,798
Oh. Oh.

893
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,716
Oh, shit!

894
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,145
Here you go.

895
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,480
I'm sorry,
I haven't ordered yet.

896
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,692
That fellow over there sent
this over, paid for and all.

897
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,859
Who?

898
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,319
Which one?

899
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,113
That guy who
is just leaving.

900
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,784
Excuse me.

901
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,787
Hey. Cady, come here.

902
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,289
Wait up a second.

903
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,835
I've been in a real bad
mood lately. Shame, ain't it?

904
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,169
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

905
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,423
No. Get the hell out of here.

906
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,466
I don't mean just
this whole town,

907
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,343
I mean the whole
goddamn state.

908
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,095
I don't want to see you,
I don't want to hear you

909
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,055
and I don't want to
smell you. Now, leave.

910
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,182
I like...
Are you my friend?

911
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,892
No, I'm not your friend.

912
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,186
Oh. 'Cause I thought
maybe you were my friend

913
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,439
because I like to plan my
comings and goings with friends.

914
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,690
But if you're
not my friend,

915
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,816
and you're planning
my comings and goings,

916
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,984
I'd call that
presumptuous.

917
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,236
In fact, I'd call it
downright rude,

918
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,946
because I ain't
your porch-baby, buddy.

919
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,824
Gee golly gosh. I sure
am sorry I offended you,

920
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,784
you white trash
piece of shit.

921
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,746
Ooh-ooh. I got the all-over
fidgets on that one.

922
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,582
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shivering all over.

923
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,500
Ooh.

924
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,920
It's not necessary to lay a
foul tongue on me, my friend.

925
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,549
I could get upset. Things
could get out of hand.

926
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,635
And then, in self-defense,
I could do something to you

927
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,387
that you would not like,
right here.

928
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,514
Anytime you feel
squirrelly, you just jump.

929
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,308
You threatening me?

930
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,518
You threatening me?

931
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,353
You catch on fast.

932
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,397
'Cause I'm well
within my rights

933
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,940
to be here
and you know it.

934
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,817
If I stay here,
what you going to do?

935
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,070
I don't give a rat's ass
about your rights.

936
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,405
You just watch your step, and
you know what I'm talking about.

937
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,157
What are you gonna do?
Arrest me?

938
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,076
You a cop?
Or were you a cop?

939
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,328
Or were you not good enough
to remain on the force?

940
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,455
'Cause, you know that's the
feeling I'm getting here.

941
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,502
Hope you enjoyed
your breakfast.

942
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,261
Ma'am,
this belong to you?

943
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,304
Can I help you?

944
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,722
I just found it.

945
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,433
I thought you
might need it back.

946
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,727
Not to frighten you,
but if a dogcatcher

947
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,395
comes across a dog
without a license,

948
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,605
he's liable to
think he's a stray

949
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,316
and do God knows
what to it.

950
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,362
You know,
our dog is...

951
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,614
He passed away.

952
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,032
Oh, what a shame.
Yeah.

953
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,576
Man's best friend and all.
Woman's, too.

954
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,747
Even without closing my
eyes, I can picture him,

955
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,793
big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet,

956
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,586
keeping you company
while you're trying

957
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,714
to finish up those
pesky little sketches.

958
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,178
Oh, you're Max Cady,
aren't you?

959
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:27,226
You know, you better get the hell
out of here before I call the police.

960
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,019
I'm not doing nothing.

961
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,437
Just giving you back
your dog collar.

962
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,772
I'm not on
your property.

963
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,983
Oh, what'd you come out here
for, you want to look around?

964
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,152
Go ahead, Mr. Cady,
take a good look.

965
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,237
Nice house.
Yeah.

966
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,240
It is a nice house. You
satisfied now you've seen it?

967
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,077
Or is there more? Huh?

968
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,538
Is that it?

969
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,999
There is going to be more,
isn't there, Mr. Cady? Huh?

970
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,459
You won't stop
until you're happy.

971
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:56,172
How can I be happy, Leigh,
when you're not happy?

972
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,216
You don't know
anything about me.

973
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,509
I know what I see,
ma'am.

974
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,594
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

975
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,472
I wanted to know
what you looked like.

976
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,141
I've been waiting
to see your face,

977
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,059
but you know now
that I see you,

978
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,646
you are just repulsive.

979
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,356
I understand.
Yeah.

980
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,358
I'm not your type.
No.

981
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,694
All that prison time
made me coarse.

982
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,614
Guess I'm covered in
too many tattoos, huh?

983
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,699
But, you see, there's
not a whole hell of a lot

984
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:27,244
to do in prison but
desecrate your flesh.

985
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,538
Of course it didn't have to
be that way for either of us

986
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,333
if your husband
hadn't betrayed us both.

987
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,044
Who knows? We might have
been different people.

988
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,504
We might have
been happy, Leigh.

989
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,798
Mom, someone's
on the phone!

990
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,008
Dani!

991
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,927
Don't come out here!

992
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,940
Sam. Hey, Sam.
Yo, Sam.

993
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,651
Sam, I thought
I'd catch you here.

994
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,862
Well, that little
smart aleck made me.

995
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,947
He what?

996
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,031
Well, it wasn't
my fault.

997
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,366
He was looking
to be covered.

998
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,201
You're right. There is
a lot of cutsie-cutsie

999
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,369
in that little prick,
isn't there?

1000
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,453
Yeah, I told you.

1001
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,663
You know
where he was today?

1002
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,832
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra

1003
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,043
by Friedrich Nietzsche,
he's this German philosopher.

1004
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,253
He said that
God is dead.

1005
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,420
God is dead. Right.

1006
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,172
Look, we can keep
going this way,

1007
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,383
but it's going to get
awful expensive, Sam.

1008
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,636
Well, look, I'm not so
concerned about days.

1009
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,513
Just stay on him a few
more nights, will you?

1010
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,682
Look, do you really want
to resolve this situation?

1011
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,892
Yes, I'd love
to resolve it.

1012
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,143
Then I got
a suggestion.

1013
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,522
There's men that
can be hired, by me,

1014
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,607
to do a little job on Cady,
a little hospital job.

1015
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,655
What are we
talking about here?

1016
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,365
Two pieces of pipe
and a bicycle chain.

1017
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,451
Sam.

1018
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,370
He won't be
so scary after that.

1019
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,496
I'm a lawyer, right?

1020
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,706
We agree that I'm a lawyer? Yeah.

1021
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,541
You know,
maybe 2,000 years ago,

1022
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,876
we'd have taken this guy out and
stoned him to death.

1023
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,297
I can't operate outside the
law. The law is my business.

1024
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,430
Hi, I'm home!
Where is everybody?

1025
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,639
In here.

1026
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,102
Evening, ladies.
Oh, chicken.

1027
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,148
How is everything?
Is everything okay?

1028
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,025
Yeah.
Good. Good.

1029
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,740
He was here today.

1030
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,623
Hello?

1031
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,791
Hello, Danielle?

1032
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,752
Is this
Miss Danielle Bowden?

1033
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:40,919
Yeah.

1034
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,172
This is your
new teacher calling.

1035
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,673
From English or Drama?

1036
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,799
Drama.

1037
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,593
So how you doing?

1038
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,677
Fine.

1039
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,804
Well, I'm just
going down the list,

1040
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,806
greeting my
summer students.

1041
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,100
You sound kind of down.

1042
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,352
No.

1043
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,522
There's just been stuff going
on around here, that's all.

1044
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,232
I see.
Anything I can do?

1045
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,525
I doubt it.

1046
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,779
I mean, shit happens, you
know, like the T-shirt says.

1047
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:07,946
Yeah.

1048
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,243
Well, you know, Danielle, all
that negativity, you can use that.

1049
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,580
What do you mean?

1050
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,457
Well, I'm the kind
of teacher that takes

1051
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,250
a very personal interest
in his kids.

1052
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,960
And don't mind me if
I tell you everything

1053
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,838
you're going through,
it's okay, go with it.

1054
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,048
The awkwardness
you feel, say,

1055
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,216
when you're walking
down the street

1056
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,552
and some leering fool is
making fun of your sexuality,

1057
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,554
the turmoil you feel,
extra bad when

1058
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,723
that particular time of
the month comes around,

1059
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,017
the anger you feel
that your mom and dad

1060
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,310
won't let you
just grow up

1061
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,562
and be yourself,
be a woman.

1062
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,898
Go with it. Don't suppress or deny it.

1063
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,442
Use it in your life
and your work.

1064
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,987
Okay. I mean...

1065
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,991
That's... I'll have to
think about all that.

1066
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,080
So, class is tomorrow
in Room 110, right?

1067
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,417
No, it's been changed
to the theater.

1068
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,460
I mean, what better place
for drama, right?

1069
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,837
Yeah.

1070
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,173
And remember, Danielle,

1071
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,552
you can use all those fears
to draw upon and learn.

1072
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,930
You know
this little tune?

1073
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,557
If you want a

1074
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:23,188
Do-right-all-day woman

1075
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,941
Woman

1076
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:33,365
You've got to be
a do-right-all-night man

1077
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,702
Man

1078
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,457
Now, you can trust in me,
because I'm a do-right man, okay?

1079
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,210
Okay, 'night now.

1080
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,172
Okay. Good night.

1081
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,970
You know, honey, I think
maybe I should walk you in.

1082
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,640
No, it's okay, Mom. There's
a lot of people here.

1083
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,809
I'll be right here
at 4:00 to pick you up.

1084
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,853
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

1085
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,858
I didn't think summer session
was gonna be so crowded.

1086
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,485
It's not. They're just
having a big meeting

1087
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,945
about next fall's
chorus program.

1088
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,989
I have to go downstairs
for Drama. Bye.

1089
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,407
Okay, bye.

1090
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,454
Hello.

1091
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,252
Nadine?

1092
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,435
I'm here for
the Drama class.

1093
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:32,776
Hi.

1094
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,653
Oops.

1095
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,405
Am I busted?

1096
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,115
No.
I hope not.

1097
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,243
You can't smoke grass
in school.

1098
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,495
Privilege of
the profession.

1099
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,374
Eases inhibitions.
You down here for Drama?

1100
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,542
Yeah.

1101
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,169
Are you
the Drama teacher?

1102
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,088
And you're,
let me guess.

1103
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,509
Cecile James?

1104
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,597
No, I'm Danielle Bowden.

1105
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,349
Danielle.
Oh, we spoke last night.

1106
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,851
Yeah.

1107
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,187
Oh, I'm sorry.
How rude.

1108
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,648
It's okay.

1109
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,233
Um...

1110
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,989
I think
we're alone now...

1111
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,578
Okay.

1112
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,925
Thanks. Here.

1113
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,803
I'm going to
give this to you.

1114
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,264
Ow.

1115
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,310
Little trick I learned.
Take it.

1116
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,649
You know when we spoke
on the phone last night?

1117
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,941
Mmm-hmm.

1118
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:59,071
You really
made sense to me

1119
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,823
and I thought a lot.

1120
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,159
Those are human truths,
darling.

1121
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,410
That's what
it's all about.

1122
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,788
And that's what
we deal with here.

1123
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,582
See the book you have,
Thomas Wolfe?

1124
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,211
It's all about self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

1125
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,756
I like the end

1126
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:24,262
where Eugene's journey... It
was really mystical, you know,

1127
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,058
and it was almost
like a pilgrimage.

1128
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,019
Almost like a cop-out,
if you ask me.

1129
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,189
Although those were
the facts of Wolfe's life.

1130
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,859
The novel is what you
would call a roman  clef.

1131
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,820
You know what that is?

1132
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,614
Sure.

1133
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,033
Well, nonetheless,
you can't escape

1134
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,910
your demons just
by leaving home.

1135
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,997
Although writers do find new
freedom when they relocate abroad.

1136
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,042
Take Henry Miller. Have
you read his trilogy?

1137
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,627
Plexus, Nexus
and Sexus?

1138
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,256
No. No. You haven't read that?

1139
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,842
You're missing
something.

1140
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:06,638
Well, you know what? I
did read Tropic of Cancer.

1141
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,224
Just parts of it,
though,

1142
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:13,145
because I had to sneak it off
my parents' shelf, you know?

1143
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:18,316
But his descriptions are
pretty vivid, I would say.

1144
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,445
In one of the novels,
I don't recall which,

1145
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,364
he describes an erection as a
piece of lead with wings on it.

1146
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,159
I didn't read
that part.

1147
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,994
Of course not.
You're not allowed.

1148
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,121
Your parents don't want
you to achieve adulthood.

1149
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,247
That's natural.

1150
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:35,500
They know the pitfalls of
adulthood, all that freedom.

1151
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,627
They know it
only too well.

1152
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,381
Temptation to stray, deflecting
their guilt and anger onto you

1153
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:44,926
for a crime that's not even
a crime, for smoking grass.

1154
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,184
Wait a second.

1155
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:54,936
Where are you from?

1156
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,647
Where am I from?

1157
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,524
Yeah. Where do you think I'm from?

1158
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,110
I don't know, but...

1159
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,488
If I told you, you
going to get mad at me?

1160
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,031
No.

1161
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,372
I'm from
the black forest.

1162
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,544
That's funny.

1163
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:23,757
You're not the Drama teacher, are you?

1164
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,551
Maybe I'm
the big bad wolf.

1165
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,679
Umm...

1166
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:34,893
So you're that guy that's
been hanging around the house?

1167
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,271
You're the one that
killed my mom's dog?

1168
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:40,732
Your mom's dog
was killed?

1169
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,983
Yeah.

1170
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,320
I didn't even know
anything about that.

1171
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,905
That's a shame.

1172
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,782
That's a damn shame.

1173
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,159
Yes, it was.

1174
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,411
What kind
of dog was it?

1175
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,498
I don't know.
He was just...

1176
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,792
He was fluffy, and...

1177
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,419
Fluffy?

1178
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,880
Mmm-hmm.

1179
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,093
So you didn't do that?

1180
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,262
Of course
I didn't do that.

1181
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,393
Okay.

1182
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:17,769
I wouldn't do that.

1183
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,356
So why... What are
you doing here, then?

1184
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,860
Well, I came to meet you,
to be honest with you.

1185
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:29,781
Why? I mean...

1186
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,866
Because

1187
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,871
I wanted to meet you,
see what you're like.

1188
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,957
I see you're a nice person. That's all.

1189
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,962
You're not going
to hurt me, are you?

1190
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,047
I'm not going to
hurt you at all.

1191
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,216
There's no
hurting here, Danielle.

1192
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,928
Between us, there's no anger, nothing.

1193
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,014
Just a search
for truth.

1194
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,226
I mean, did you judge me,
did you get angry at me

1195
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,978
when you caught me
smoking the grass?

1196
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,187
Hmm?

1197
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,355
No.

1198
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,734
But your parents,
they judged you.

1199
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,944
They got plenty angry
at you, didn't they?

1200
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,237
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

1201
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,282
They punished you
for their sins.

1202
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,743
What did they do?

1203
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,994
They...

1204
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,415
My dad... They just yelled a whole lot

1205
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,126
and my mom cried

1206
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,755
and my dad said I couldn't
drive the Cherokee.

1207
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,215
I would say they punished
you for their sins,

1208
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,634
and you resent that,

1209
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,719
and you should
resent it.

1210
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:36,848
But Professor do-right has
a little advice for you.

1211
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,767
You shouldn't
damn them.

1212
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,602
Don't judge them.
Just forgive them,

1213
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,729
for they know not
what they do.

1214
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,774
Oh...
Um...

1215
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,108
Why do you
hate my father?

1216
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,862
I don't hate him at all.
Oh, no. I pray for him.

1217
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,323
I'm here to help him.

1218
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,785
I mean, we all make mistakes, Danielle.

1219
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:00,163
You and I have. But at
least we try to admit it.

1220
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,873
Don't we?

1221
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,458
Yeah.

1222
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,752
But your daddy,
he don't.

1223
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,132
Every man carries a circle of
hell around his head like a halo.

1224
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,384
Your daddy, too.

1225
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:17,472
Every man, every man has to go
through hell to reach his paradise.

1226
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,266
You know
what paradise is?

1227
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,519
No.
Salvation.

1228
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,064
'Cause your daddy's
not happy.

1229
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,565
Your mommy's
not happy.

1230
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,319
And you know what?
You're not happy.

1231
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:33,989
Are you?

1232
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,198
No, I'm not.

1233
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,038
You thought about me
last night, didn't you?

1234
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:46,459
Um...

1235
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:48,712
Yes, I did.

1236
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,755
I know.

1237
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,720
You know, I think I might
have found a companion,

1238
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,974
a companion for that
long walk to the light.

1239
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,479
Do you mind if I put my arm around you?

1240
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,027
Um...

1241
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,327
It's okay.

1242
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,123
No, I don't mind.

1243
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,459
Okay.

1244
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,632
Kersek, where the hell have
you been, for Christ sake?

1245
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:59,134
He came at my daughter
at school.

1246
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,260
You asked me to
watch him nights.

1247
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,512
I'm watching him nights.
What happened?

1248
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,140
My wife, Leigh,
she found some marijuana

1249
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,558
in one of
Dani's schoolbooks.

1250
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,477
We don't know if Cady gave it
to her or exactly what happened,

1251
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,312
but she's scared and
she won't talk about it.

1252
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,731
But now this has gone far
enough. It's got to stop!

1253
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,816
You phone the cops?

1254
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,401
No, I didn't
phone the cops.

1255
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:17,652
I mean, what did
you call them?

1256
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,654
You call them "Slow,
skeptical, pathetic, even. "

1257
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,573
Dani. No, Leigh, that's all right.

1258
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,533
Just hold on a minute.

1259
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:28,621
Kersek, look, I want to
hire those three guys,

1260
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,290
you remember,
the hospital job.

1261
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,084
Consider it done,
the sooner the better.

1262
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,545
Three men's going
to cost you a grand.

1263
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:36,796
Now I know that's
not chicken feed,

1264
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,381
but you don't wanna go
with less than three.

1265
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,508
It's better to
overdo it.

1266
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,385
Okay. You'll have the
money in the morning.

1267
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,179
All right. Then we'll
be on for tomorrow night.

1268
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,515
And Sam, you'll feel good about this.

1269
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,395
All right.

1270
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,869
Do you notice
these young people?

1271
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,454
They don't
look very happy.

1272
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,165
They're committed to their
professions and to their ambitions,

1273
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,708
but they're not
committed to each other.

1274
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,793
Cady, shut up
and listen.

1275
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,047
If you don't leave...

1276
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,382
If you don't
leave my family alone

1277
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,593
and if you don't
get out of here,

1278
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:26,804
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1279
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:29,766
Could you repeat that?

1280
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:30,892
I said,

1281
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,144
if you don't
get out of here,

1282
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,605
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1283
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,899
A threat?
Yeah.

1284
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:39,734
You bet your ass
that's a threat.

1285
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,778
Well, I have thought of relocating

1286
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,906
somewhere where I'd be more
appreciated, California, perhaps.

1287
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,659
I could teach
earthquake preparedness.

1288
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,704
But then it hits me, I
love New Essex, Counselor.

1289
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,083
I mean, where else could
I just casually confer

1290
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,334
with an old colleague?

1291
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,796
We're not colleagues. Do you
understand that? We're not colleagues.

1292
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,005
Still think you're
better than me.

1293
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,382
No, I don't think
I'm better than you.

1294
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,925
That's not
the goddamned point.

1295
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,885
Good. 'Cause if
you're not better than me,

1296
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,679
then I can have
what you have.

1297
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,514
What do I have?

1298
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,641
A wife, a daughter.

1299
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:17,188
I'm going to teach you
the meaning of commitment.

1300
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,649
Fourteen years ago,
I was forced to make

1301
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,567
a commitment to
an eight-by-nine cell

1302
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,696
and now you're going to be
forced to make a commitment.

1303
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,240
You could say I'm here
to save you.

1304
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,619
Fine.

1305
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,872
Check out the Bible,
Counselor,

1306
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,749
the book between
Esther and Psalms.

1307
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:45,550
Dani? Dani?

1308
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,512
You all right?

1309
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:51,806
What? Is everything all right?

1310
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:52,974
Yeah.

1311
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,438
This isn't going
to work, you know.

1312
01:11:58,522 --> 01:11:59,981
What isn't going
to work?

1313
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,734
Locking us in,
hiding us from the world.

1314
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,736
Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Dani.

1315
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,654
Making me stay out
of school.

1316
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,656
You're going back
to school tomorrow.

1317
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:09,866
And put
some clothes on.

1318
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,451
You're not
a little kid anymore.

1319
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,203
Yeah? Then why am I going
back to school tomorrow?

1320
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,538
What are you
going to do?

1321
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:18,082
That's none of
your concern, Dani.

1322
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:24,756
Dad, he didn't force
himself on me, you know.

1323
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,592
I know you'd like
to think that he did.

1324
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,636
But I think he was...

1325
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,974
I think he was just trying
to make a connection with me.

1326
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,309
You know?
Now, Dani,

1327
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:38,436
I want you to
listen to me.

1328
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,105
All right? No.
Do you understand?

1329
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:45,485
No. There will never
be any connection

1330
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:48,571
between you
and Max Cady.

1331
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,949
You understand that?

1332
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:02,794
Did he touch you?

1333
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:09,550
What are you laughing
about? Why are you smiling?

1334
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:12,261
I'm asking you a question.
Did he touch you?

1335
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,306
Dani, wipe that
smile off your face!

1336
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,767
I'm asking you,
did he touch you?

1337
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,776
No, no, no, wait, Dani.
I'm sorry.

1338
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,986
No, I'm sorry.

1339
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,948
Wait, honey.
I'm sorry.

1340
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,534
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

1341
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,308
Max?

1342
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,603
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1343
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,021
Come on.

1344
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,259
Counselor?

1345
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,263
Counselor?

1346
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,516
Is that you?

1347
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,352
Counselor?

1348
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:28,314
Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

1349
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,830
I ain't no white trash
piece of shit.

1350
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,874
I'm better
than you all.

1351
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,546
I can out-learn you.

1352
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,966
I can out-read you.

1353
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:59,762
I can outthink you, and I
can out-philosophize you.

1354
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,390
And I'm going
to outlast you.

1355
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:03,849
You think
a couple of whacks

1356
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,602
to my good-old-boy gut's
gonna get me down?

1357
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,397
It's going to take a hell of a
lot more than that, Counselor,

1358
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,732
to prove you're
better than me!

1359
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:18,281
"I am like God,
and God like me.

1360
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,075
"I am as large as God.

1361
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:24,161
"He is as small as I.

1362
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:28,583
"He cannot above me
nor I beneath him be. "

1363
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:33,754
Silesius,
17th century.

1364
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,011
Counselor?

1365
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,347
Counselor?

1366
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,727
Could you be there?

1367
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:51,022
Could you be there?

1368
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,778
Counselor?

1369
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,455
I wonder
if you're here.

1370
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,215
Fuck it.

1371
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:22,678
If you're here, what the
fuck's the difference?

1372
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,847
Fuck it!

1373
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,442
I've got
Mr. Kersek on one.

1374
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:37,735
Good.
I'll take it.

1375
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:38,903
Tom.

1376
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,530
Sam, you look tired.
You get that writ?

1377
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:44,992
No, no, we got to get into
that. Let me just grab this.

1378
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,869
Kersek. Look, I'm damn
sorry about last night.

1379
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:48,037
That son of a bitch
could survive

1380
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:49,246
a preemptive
nuclear strike.

1381
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,623
All right. Hang on a
second. Hang on a second.

1382
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:53,250
Tom, I'm not doing it.
I pulled a fast one

1383
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,920
and it's come back and it's bit
me on the ass in a major way.

1384
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,046
What you did was dumb.

1385
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,257
What I'm asking here is no big
deal, Sam. This is my daughter!

1386
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,009
No, Tom, it's perjury
and it's bullshit

1387
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,552
and I'm not doing it!
Now, excuse me.

1388
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,763
All right? All right.
I'll be in my office.

1389
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,099
Tom, who was that
top criminal lawyer?

1390
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,934
Lee Heller.
Kersek.

1391
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,185
We need to talk.
Trouble is

1392
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,562
if word gets out how Cady
bushwhacked those poor bastards,

1393
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,189
it's gonna be a bitch to
line up three new guys.

1394
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,775
I don't want three new guys.
No more guys, you hear me?

1395
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,652
Mr. Heller,
it's Sam Bowden

1396
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:21,445
from Broadbent
and Denmeyer.

1397
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:23,656
Tom speaks
very highly of you.

1398
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,990
In fact,
he says you're the best,

1399
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,283
and the best is
what I need right now.

1400
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,619
We froze
our butts together in Korea.

1401
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,037
How can I help you,
Sam?

1402
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,873
Well, it's a simple petition
for a restraining order,

1403
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,750
but there's been
some complications.

1404
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,210
Now, I know this is short notice,

1405
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:38,212
but look,
I need this injunction.

1406
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:40,881
You see, there's an ex-convict
by the name of Max Cady,

1407
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,007
he's been
harassing my family.

1408
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:45,636
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden. I can't
continue this conversation.

1409
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,430
Well, is there
a more convenient time?

1410
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:50,099
No, no. The damn thing
is I have a conflict.

1411
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,976
Now, what would that be? Well, you see,

1412
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,895
Mr. Cady retained my
services as of yesterday.

1413
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,021
He what?

1414
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,023
In fact,
I see on my phone sheet

1415
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,650
Mr. Cady called
this morning,

1416
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:00,818
so I'm sure
he'll fill me in...

1417
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:04,530
But wait a minute, Lee. Now,
look, this man is a psychotic.

1418
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:08,159
It appears I'll be seeing
you at that hearing after all.

1419
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:11,162
Could you repeat that?

1420
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,414
I said
if you don't leave...

1421
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,250
If you don't
leave my family alone

1422
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,502
and if you don't
get out of here,

1423
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,672
you're gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1424
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:23,632
A threat?

1425
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:26,135
Yeah, you bet your ass
that's a threat.

1426
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:31,432
You need only
glance at my client to know

1427
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,477
that Mr. Bowden
made good

1428
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,897
on his heinous
and cowardly threat.

1429
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,775
Just as God arose
to judgment

1430
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,651
to save all the meek
of the earth,

1431
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,654
I hope and pray you
will do the same, sir.

1432
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,323
Your Honor,

1433
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:51,285
Mr. Cady wouldn't have
surreptitiously taped our meeting

1434
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:53,496
unless he knew
that he'd...

1435
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:59,043
This court
does not condone

1436
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:04,048
feuds, vendettas
or vigilantism.

1437
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:09,428
Let me quote our great Negro
educator, Mr. Booker T. Washington.

1438
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:14,475
"I will let no man
drag me down so low

1439
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,062
"as to make me
hate him. "

1440
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,230
Yes.

1441
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,733
I will grant
the restraining order

1442
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:26,320
not to validate
the malice between you,

1443
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:31,492
but in the interest
of Christian harmony.

1444
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,163
You may not come
within 500 yards

1445
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:40,835
of Mr. Maximilian Cady

1446
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:46,340
until such time as the court
may lift the injunction.

1447
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:51,929
King Solomon could not have
adjudicated more wisely, Your Honor.

1448
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:57,393
I am so offended by the
philistine tactics of Mr. Bowden,

1449
01:20:57,477 --> 01:21:01,689
I petitioned the A. B.A.
for his disbarment

1450
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,191
on the grounds of
moral turpitude.

1451
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,528
Now, if you will
excuse us, my client...

1452
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:08,612
Come on, son...

1453
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:10,447
Is due back
at the hospital

1454
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:17,496
for the results of
his numerous X-rays.

1455
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,208
Kersek, I want a gun.

1456
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:22,877
I need a gun.
I want a gun.

1457
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,128
You want a gun?

1458
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,296
Yeah, I need a gun.

1459
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,047
Know anything about guns? No.

1460
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,215
No, I don't believe
in them.

1461
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,758
I never had them around
the house or anything.

1462
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:30,885
All right,
I'll get you a gun.

1463
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,386
What kind of gun you
want? Now, calm down.

1464
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,471
Well, just something simple,
something I can handle.

1465
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,558
Let me see
what fits you. A.45...

1466
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,934
Let me see your hands.
Okay.

1467
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,063
A.38 snub-nosed special.
Yeah. All right. Good.

1468
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,399
That'll do. I can even
teach you how to use it.

1469
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,359
All right. Great. The
first lesson is this.

1470
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,237
Don't think of it as shooting
a man or trying to kill him.

1471
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:52,406
Right. Think of it as an
extension of your fist.

1472
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:54,491
You're just reaching out
and knocking the man down.

1473
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,160
All right.

1474
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,370
Later on we can go out to the
woods and shoot some trees, okay?

1475
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:01,123
That'd be great.
That'd be great. Good.

1476
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,002
What is it? What?

1477
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,921
Well, Sam...
Yeah?

1478
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,465
I give you a gun.
You pull it on Cady,

1479
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,591
and it's gonna
dawn on you

1480
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:11,675
that shooting a man
is different

1481
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,552
than blowing holes
in some tree.

1482
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,846
Next thing, you know, you
don't have my gun, Cady does.

1483
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:17,389
No, no, no.
You're gonna teach me.

1484
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,891
I know how
to handle a gun.

1485
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:20,100
He won't take it
away from me.

1486
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,145
Best-case scenario,
you kill Cady dog-dead.

1487
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:27,524
Fifteen years to life. Do
you realize that, Counselor?

1488
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:36,200
Oh, Jesus! It's all fucked up, Kersek!

1489
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,327
I mean,
the law considers me

1490
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:40,245
more of a loose cannon
than Max Cady!

1491
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,623
Some big-shit attorney
has whipped

1492
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:44,959
the A. B.A.'s ethics
committee into a frenzy.

1493
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,295
There's an emergency session
in Raleigh over the assault.

1494
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,381
How did they link that
to you?

1495
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:54,677
I went to warn Cady. I thought
it was the decent thing to do.

1496
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,721
Maybe I'd scare him.
And he was wired.

1497
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,309
Goddamn fools.

1498
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:07,648
This hearing,
it's real important?

1499
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:13,404
Only if I want to continue
to practice law. Yeah.

1500
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:15,572
Cady isn't
expected there, is he?

1501
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:19,368
Oh, no, no, no. Mr. Cady,
he's beyond reproach.

1502
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,161
But you're required to be there. Yeah.

1503
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:23,497
When is this hearing?

1504
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,666
It's Thursday morning,
9:00.

1505
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,502
The torture begins
and lasts for two days.

1506
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,005
You have to fly up
the night before?

1507
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,132
Right.

1508
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,843
Cady's an opportunist.

1509
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:37,886
If he thinks you're gonna
be out of town for two days,

1510
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,681
that's going to be as tempting
to him as shit is to a fly.

1511
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,017
If Cady breaks
into your home,

1512
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,810
he can be killed.

1513
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:46,270
Justifiably.

1514
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:51,066
But he won't show unless he's real
sure you're not gonna be there.

1515
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:01,303
Have a good trip.

1516
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:03,097
All right. Bye-bye.

1517
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,181
Call us tonight, okay?

1518
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:05,599
All right.

1519
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:17,611
I didn't miss
the 9:20 to Raleigh?

1520
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:19,988
I'm afraid you did, sir.
But there's a 10:20.

1521
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,156
Oh, it's not that.

1522
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:24,201
I just have some very, very
important papers for Samuel Bowden.

1523
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:25,953
Was he on the 9:20?

1524
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,580
We can't give out
that information, sir.

1525
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:30,874
Well, it's just...

1526
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,544
I guess I could send it
to him overnight,

1527
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:37,381
but he might be back, for all I
know, tomorrow morning, and I...

1528
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:40,050
See, I...

1529
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:43,720
My wife and I have been in an
accident, and he's our lawyer.

1530
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:47,975
And if I don't get in touch with
him, we could lose this case.

1531
01:25:48,059 --> 01:25:50,978
We've already lost
our little daughter, Dani.

1532
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,355
Is...

1533
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,233
Is there any way
I can find out

1534
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:59,027
if he was on that flight
and when he's coming back?

1535
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,238
It'd really,
really help us.

1536
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:13,333
He'll be back the day
after tomorrow, sir.

1537
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:15,711
Bless your heart.

1538
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:32,519
Go on. Go on in.

1539
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,773
Get down, Sam.

1540
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,406
Leigh.
Leigh, give me a cigarette.

1541
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:46,950
You better
slow down, Sam.

1542
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,994
You're outpacing me two-to-one
since you started smoking.

1543
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:51,705
Just keep track of
how many I owe you.

1544
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,750
So, how'd it go
at the airport?

1545
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:56,043
Well, we did our thing,

1546
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,461
but we don't know
if he saw us,

1547
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,588
we don't even know
if he was there.

1548
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:02,132
Set the trap
and we'll see.

1549
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:03,842
What if we don't
want to see?

1550
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,594
Dani!
What?

1551
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,763
Maybe he
poisoned the dog.

1552
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:10,057
Dani... Sam, watch out for the windows.

1553
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:13,143
Yeah, you're not allowed
to stand up, Dad, remember?

1554
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:20,901
Didn't Cady
go after her?

1555
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:22,152
You don't know Dani.

1556
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,238
If she finds a palmetto
bug in her bedroom,

1557
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,073
she takes it outside.

1558
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:28,533
You know, she could
never kill anything.

1559
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:30,077
Even a six-foot
palmetto bug?

1560
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:34,498
Oh, God.

1561
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:44,341
What is that?

1562
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:49,054
It's a monofilament line. I
got it from Sam's fishing gear.

1563
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:51,807
See, what I do is I stretch it
across the windows and the doors

1564
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:53,892
and tie it to
Dani's teddy bear here.

1565
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,560
If the bear moves
a quarter of an inch,

1566
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:57,187
I'll know if the holy
ghost is sneaking in.

1567
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,179
What are you reading?

1568
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:36,435
Why? Did Kersek quit?

1569
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:37,602
No.

1570
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,480
It's just
that Cady said...

1571
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,399
You want some answers.

1572
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:45,110
Me, too.

1573
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:52,284
I'd like to know just how
strong we are or how weak.

1574
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:56,705
But I guess the only way
we're going to find that out

1575
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:59,958
is just by
going through this.

1576
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:07,591
It's just that Cady said to read
the book between Esther and Psalms.

1577
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,135
Which is which one?

1578
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:12,262
The Book of Job.

1579
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,268
Job was a good man.
He believed in God

1580
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,396
and God tested
his faith.

1581
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,107
He took away
everything he had,

1582
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,486
even his children.

1583
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,713
It's hideous,
this plan. I mean, barbaric.

1584
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:50,300
They're crazy. My dad's
turned into some kind of...

1585
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,551
I don't know what.

1586
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:52,928
Barbaric.

1587
01:29:56,307 --> 01:30:00,560
Listen to your father. Do what
they say. What else you can do?

1588
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,605
Leave. We could go to
the houseboat, you know,

1589
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:05,732
and get lost
in any inlet.

1590
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:11,988
Dani, come on.

1591
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,199
Don't stay outside.

1592
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:25,335
You wanna know what really
disturbs me? It's killing this guy.

1593
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:28,797
I mean,
taking a man's life.

1594
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:33,343
I don't know if
I can live with that.

1595
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,554
You may have to.

1596
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,722
Sam, just remember the
plan. I know the plan.

1597
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,184
Damn, it's premeditated.
It's...

1598
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,855
It makes me an accomplice,
an accessory, an abettor.

1599
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,232
It's also excessive force.

1600
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:50,110
Sam, the only thing
excessive we could do to Cady

1601
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:53,113
would be to gut him
and eat his liver.

1602
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:54,322
That might
be excessive.

1603
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:56,658
Jesus Christ,
Kersek, I'm serious.

1604
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:58,952
No, you're scared.

1605
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:02,998
But that's okay. I want
you to savor that fear.

1606
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,917
You know,
the South evolved in fear.

1607
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:10,213
Fear of the Indian, fear of the
slave, fear of the damn Union.

1608
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,551
The South has a fine
tradition of savoring fear.

1609
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:33,862
What's the matter?

1610
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,531
Don't look over!
Don't look.

1611
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,867
She's making me nervous.

1612
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:41,828
What would
she normally do

1613
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,663
if Sam wasn't around
to run her home?

1614
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:45,415
She'd stay...
She'd stay over.

1615
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,335
Well, then,
she stays over.

1616
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:22,030
Leigh?

1617
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:26,076
What?
Leigh.

1618
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:28,536
I know how
the dog died.

1619
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,373
Sam, are you dreaming?
No. No.

1620
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:32,874
I just had
the weirdest feeling

1621
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,210
he was already
in the house.

1622
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:52,268
Can't sleep,
huh, Miss Graciela?

1623
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:53,603
Yeah. It's hot.

1624
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:57,315
You know,
I think it's the humidity

1625
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,317
that makes us all
so thirsty.

1626
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:02,237
Excuse me.

1627
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:05,156
My pop was a cop.

1628
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,617
Twenty years.

1629
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:10,328
This was his favorite drink
when he was on a stakeout.

1630
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:32,350
I learned that
in prison. You like?

1631
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,561
White trash
piece of shit.

1632
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:45,530
Stay here, Leigh.

1633
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:52,746
Kersek?

1634
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:58,793
Kersek?

1635
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:10,722
Dani, Dani, go back to your
room. Go back to your room.

1636
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:12,348
Lock the door.

1637
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,394
Kersek?

1638
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,732
Don't go
down there, Sam.

1639
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:22,275
No, it's all right.

1640
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,034
Kersek?

1641
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:39,918
Sam?

1642
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,429
Dani, don't look.

1643
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:53,598
Oh, my God, Graciela!

1644
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:55,892
Dani, don't look.
Don't look, Dani.

1645
01:36:57,436 --> 01:36:58,603
Oh, my God.

1646
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:01,189
Oh, my God!

1647
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:04,317
Oh, my God!

1648
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:09,614
Oh, my God!

1649
01:37:24,755 --> 01:37:25,839
It's the piano wire.

1650
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:30,093
Sam!

1651
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:34,055
I'm going to get
this son of a bitch!

1652
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:35,431
Sam!

1653
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:38,726
No! No! No!

1654
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,229
No!

1655
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:42,647
I'm gonna slit
that son of a bitch!

1656
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:45,900
Tell him to stop!

1657
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:51,322
God, he might be out here!
He might be out here!

1658
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,488
Now, listen, I've
got Kersek's gun with me

1659
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:36,367
and you're gonna find the piano
wire that Cady used in the house.

1660
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:38,578
Yeah, I know how this looks. I know it.

1661
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:41,289
You're not supposed
to flee a murder scene.

1662
01:38:41,373 --> 01:38:43,958
Listen, Lieutenant, now, you
may know this and you may not,

1663
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:46,836
but in the law, there's a
thing called force majeure.

1664
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,422
It means
an unforeseeable act of God

1665
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:52,216
and it cancels all
promises and obligations.

1666
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:54,677
So, legally speaking,
all bets are off.

1667
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:58,181
You find Max Cady
and we'll come back.

1668
01:39:00,851 --> 01:39:01,893
What did he say?

1669
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:03,061
He said we're fugitives.

1670
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:04,103
What's that mean?

1671
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:05,980
That means we're
doing something right.

1672
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:37,220
Where's that old mongrel
dog of yours, Mrs. Bowden?

1673
01:41:58,028 --> 01:42:00,321
Tomorrow,
I'll catch some fish.

1674
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:02,323
Oh, you know,
you don't have to.

1675
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:04,283
I've got enough food
here to last us a week.

1676
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,002
But it'd be nice.

1677
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:17,213
Good.

1678
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:28,850
It's only rain.
A sheet of rain.

1679
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:34,147
What was that?

1680
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:35,314
It's just a squall.

1681
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:38,151
I'll go check
the anchor.

1682
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:39,485
Wait, Dad.
Don't go out.

1683
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,446
No, Dani. Now, look,
everything is okay. All right?

1684
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,073
Yeah. We're on
the river now, baby.

1685
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:45,658
It's just a squall
kicking up.

1686
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:13,644
Graciela has a brother.

1687
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:15,438
I mean, she had...

1688
01:43:18,483 --> 01:43:19,901
Oh, sweetie.

1689
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:23,779
We'll get in touch
with him right away.

1690
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:27,158
Sam?

1691
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:29,952
We're making some tea.

1692
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:35,791
Sam?

1693
01:43:36,919 --> 01:43:38,085
Dad?

1694
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:42,798
I can't hear you.
It's windy out.

1695
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,216
What's that?

1696
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,009
Are we moving?

1697
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:28,511
Sam?

1698
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,516
Evening, ladies.

1699
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:36,394
You know my husband
has a gun?

1700
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:38,187
Not this gun?

1701
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:39,522
Is it this gun?

1702
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:40,690
Where is he?

1703
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:43,401
Resting up. He had
a long, difficult day.

1704
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,988
Danielle, I told you,
you can't escape

1705
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:48,781
your demons just
by leaving home.

1706
01:44:49,866 --> 01:44:51,158
I didn't.

1707
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,202
My parents
brought me here.

1708
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:54,370
Of course.

1709
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:56,872
Where's Sexus?

1710
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:58,666
Back at the house.

1711
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:00,001
Shame.

1712
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:03,212
I had hoped we could read
aloud from it together.

1713
01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:06,590
Well,

1714
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:09,427
I memorized some
for you.

1715
01:45:09,511 --> 01:45:10,511
Did you?

1716
01:45:10,887 --> 01:45:12,722
Yeah.
Did you?

1717
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:16,100
Yeah.

1718
01:45:16,184 --> 01:45:17,226
Well, I'm impressed.

1719
01:45:18,937 --> 01:45:19,979
Which part?

1720
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:24,066
The part...

1721
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:27,236
You know what part,
you know.

1722
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:31,073
I don't think
you did your homework.

1723
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:32,575
I did.

1724
01:45:32,909 --> 01:45:34,744
What parts were they?

1725
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:38,289
The good parts?

1726
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:39,999
Yeah. They were...

1727
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:41,250
Were you a good girl?

1728
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:42,418
I was.

1729
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:44,712
I knew you'd
follow me here and...

1730
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:46,464
You know me pretty well,
don't you, darling?

1731
01:45:46,548 --> 01:45:48,632
Yeah. I do.

1732
01:45:49,259 --> 01:45:51,010
You're gonna get to know
me a lot better, too.

1733
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:59,852
Are you offering me
something hot?

1734
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:03,272
Let's get
something straight here.

1735
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:09,028
I spent 14 years in
an eight-by-nine cell

1736
01:46:09,112 --> 01:46:11,822
surrounded by people
who were less than human.

1737
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:14,700
My mission
in that time

1738
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:16,911
was to become
more than human.

1739
01:46:18,288 --> 01:46:19,538
You see?

1740
01:46:20,957 --> 01:46:23,751
Granddaddy used to
handle snakes in church.

1741
01:46:23,835 --> 01:46:25,211
Granny drank strychnine.

1742
01:46:25,295 --> 01:46:29,006
I guess you could say I had a
leg-up, genetically speaking.

1743
01:46:37,307 --> 01:46:39,975
I'm gonna forgive you,
Danielle, honey.

1744
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:42,895
'Cause I know that wasn't
the real you, the true you.

1745
01:46:42,979 --> 01:46:45,773
But I would like you
to wait in the hold.

1746
01:46:47,275 --> 01:46:50,820
Danielle, Danielle,
get in the hold.

1747
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:53,697
Danielle!

1748
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,283
Stop!
No!

1749
01:46:58,328 --> 01:46:59,620
No!

1750
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:07,253
Ready to be born again,
Mrs. Bowden?

1751
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:12,758
A few minutes alone
with me, darling,

1752
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:15,010
and you will be
speaking in tongues.

1753
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:35,591
Excuse me, Mrs. B.

1754
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:37,384
Please don't
take umbrage,

1755
01:48:37,677 --> 01:48:40,429
but in the plan
that I have formulated,

1756
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:43,974
there's much more to it than
just you and I just making love.

1757
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:48,229
I mean, that's just so
commonplace and dreary.

1758
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:52,441
Here and now,
we have an opportunity.

1759
01:48:52,984 --> 01:48:54,818
"What is that opportunity?"
you ask.

1760
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:57,196
Why, here and now,
we have an opportunity

1761
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,282
to depict
and dramatize...

1762
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:01,742
No!

1763
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:05,120
...both the heights
and the depths

1764
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:10,501
of a mama's true love of her
daughter, if you all get my meaning.

1765
01:49:10,585 --> 01:49:13,295
Come on out, babe. Come
on, darling. Let's go.

1766
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:16,131
Get out.
Get up here.

1767
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:17,550
Cady, listen to me.
This is between

1768
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:19,176
you and me.
Leave them out of it.

1769
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:23,013
This is my night, Counselor.
Don't you step on my lines.

1770
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:25,683
No! Stop! Stop!

1771
01:49:28,144 --> 01:49:29,478
Yes, Leigh?

1772
01:49:30,146 --> 01:49:33,315
Listen to me, Max.
Listen to me.

1773
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:38,904
You know, Max,
since all this started,

1774
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:40,614
I've thought
about you all the time.

1775
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:46,287
I've tried to imagine what
it must have been like for you

1776
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:48,080
all those years,
locked up in jail.

1777
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:53,794
I've tried to imagine
you and even your crimes

1778
01:49:53,878 --> 01:49:57,298
and how you must have felt in
those moments that you did them.

1779
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:02,136
See, I know
about loss, Max.

1780
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:06,849
I know about losing time,
even losing years.

1781
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:11,103
And I know it
doesn't compare to jail,

1782
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:16,567
but I can understand and I
could share this with you.

1783
01:50:17,235 --> 01:50:21,572
Because of that, whatever it
is that you've got planned,

1784
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:24,700
I want you to do
it just with me,

1785
01:50:26,244 --> 01:50:27,745
not with her,

1786
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:33,375
because we have
this connection.

1787
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:47,431
What do you think,
Counselor?

1788
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:50,225
No!

1789
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:54,938
That was real eloquent,
Leigh.

1790
01:50:57,067 --> 01:50:58,442
Brave, too.

1791
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:02,905
I wanna thank you for conveying
to me your very powerful emotions

1792
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:05,157
because

1793
01:51:10,955 --> 01:51:13,374
I'm gonna enjoy this
all the more.

1794
01:51:23,301 --> 01:51:24,551
Oh, my God!

1795
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:39,358
Oh, God!

1796
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:25,529
The people call
Samuel J. Bowden!

1797
01:52:29,242 --> 01:52:30,492
Do you swear
to tell the truth

1798
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:32,244
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

1799
01:52:32,328 --> 01:52:33,662
Cady, somebody's
got to man the boat.

1800
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:34,955
We're heading into
unprotected water.

1801
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:36,248
Do you swear?
I'll do it, Dad.

1802
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:38,083
You sit, Danielle!
Don't you make light

1803
01:52:38,168 --> 01:52:39,918
of your civic duty,
darling. You're the jury.

1804
01:52:41,504 --> 01:52:42,671
All right,
all right, okay,

1805
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:44,673
I swear to tell the truth.
What do you wanna know?

1806
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:46,884
Was a prior sexual history ever prepared

1807
01:52:46,968 --> 01:52:48,510
in connection
with my defense?

1808
01:52:49,345 --> 01:52:51,930
Was a prior sexual history ever prepared

1809
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:53,265
in connection
with my defense?

1810
01:52:53,349 --> 01:52:54,475
It's...

1811
01:52:56,144 --> 01:52:58,604
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I
agree. That was argumentative.

1812
01:52:58,688 --> 01:53:00,606
An investigator
did prepare a prior

1813
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:02,608
sexual history on
the alleged victim.

1814
01:53:02,692 --> 01:53:03,692
True?

1815
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,778
I can ask leading questions, Your Honor.

1816
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:07,446
He is a hostile witness.

1817
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:09,031
Would you care
to tell the court

1818
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:10,949
what the gist was
of this report?

1819
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:13,660
Cady, it was 14 years ago.
I can't remember that.

1820
01:53:14,996 --> 01:53:18,040
How can he answer when
you're hitting him like that?

1821
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:19,708
Because he's perjuring
himself, Your Honor.

1822
01:53:19,793 --> 01:53:21,668
He knows damn well
exactly what it said.

1823
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:22,795
Don't you?

1824
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:24,671
It said that
she was promiscuous.

1825
01:53:24,756 --> 01:53:27,216
It said that she had three
different lovers in one month.

1826
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,134
At least three!
At least three!

1827
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:31,553
And did you show
this report to the D.A.?

1828
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:33,013
No, no!

1829
01:53:35,934 --> 01:53:39,186
I only discovered it by chance
when I started representing myself

1830
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,813
six years
into my sentence!

1831
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:42,481
But there it was
in the court file.

1832
01:53:42,565 --> 01:53:45,025
But back in '77, you
buried it, Counselor.

1833
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:47,778
Would you care to
tell the jury why?

1834
01:53:49,697 --> 01:53:51,907
Would you care to
tell the court why?

1835
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,995
Because I know he brutally
raped her and he beat her.

1836
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,914
Talk to me!
I'm standing here!

1837
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,500
Just because she
was promiscuous

1838
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:03,043
didn't give you
the right to rape her!

1839
01:54:03,127 --> 01:54:05,254
You bragged to me
that you beat two prior

1840
01:54:05,338 --> 01:54:06,880
aggravated rapes.
You were a menace!

1841
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:10,050
You were my lawyer!
You were my lawyer!

1842
01:54:10,134 --> 01:54:12,928
That report could
have saved me 14 years.

1843
01:54:13,012 --> 01:54:14,012
You're probably right.

1844
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:15,931
You self-righteous fuck!

1845
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:24,273
I'm Virgil, Counselor, and I'm
guiding you through the gates of Hell.

1846
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:28,110
We are now in the 9th circle,
the circle of traitors.

1847
01:54:28,194 --> 01:54:31,530
Traitors to country,
traitors to fellow man,

1848
01:54:31,614 --> 01:54:33,699
traitors to God!

1849
01:54:33,783 --> 01:54:35,909
You, sir, are charged

1850
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:38,203
with betraying the
principles of all three!

1851
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:40,998
Can you please quote for me
the American Bar Association's

1852
01:54:41,082 --> 01:54:43,792
Rules of Professional
Conduct, Canon seven?

1853
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:47,337
"A lawyer should
represent his client... "

1854
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:49,423
"Should zealously
represent his client

1855
01:54:49,507 --> 01:54:51,216
"within the bounds
of the law. "

1856
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:54,094
And I find you guilty,
Counselor,

1857
01:54:54,178 --> 01:54:56,555
guilty of betraying
your fellow man,

1858
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,557
guilty of
betraying your country,

1859
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:00,601
guilty of
abrogating your oath,

1860
01:55:00,685 --> 01:55:03,562
guilty of judging me
and selling me out!

1861
01:55:03,646 --> 01:55:07,399
And with the power vested
in me by the kingdom of God,

1862
01:55:07,483 --> 01:55:11,945
I sentence you to
the 9th circle of Hell!

1863
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,740
Now you will learn
about loss,

1864
01:55:14,824 --> 01:55:18,660
loss of freedom,
loss of humanity.

1865
01:55:19,203 --> 01:55:22,998
Now you and I will truly
be the same, Counselor.

1866
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:25,167
Danielle,
get down on your knees.

1867
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:26,585
Both of you
take off your clothes!

1868
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:28,253
Down on your knees now!

1869
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:29,421
No, no, no.

1870
01:55:29,505 --> 01:55:30,672
Down on your knees!

1871
01:55:31,007 --> 01:55:32,966
Take off your clothes!
Get down on your knees!

1872
01:55:34,802 --> 01:55:38,263
No! Don't!

1873
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:44,102
Now, take off your clothes!
Off with your clothes!

1874
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:48,899
You, Leigh, take off
your clothes. Now!

1875
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:50,609
No!

1876
01:55:50,693 --> 01:55:52,694
Come on!
Git! Git!

1877
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:54,404
No!
Git!

1878
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:56,823
Tonight, you're gonna
learn to be an animal,

1879
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:59,034
to live like an animal
and to die like one.

1880
01:56:03,206 --> 01:56:04,873
Give me your hand!

1881
01:56:38,282 --> 01:56:39,825
No!

1882
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:41,410
Go! Go!

1883
01:59:06,097 --> 01:59:09,141
Did you forget about that
restraining order, Counselor?

1884
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:11,810
You're well
within 500 yards!

1885
01:59:18,484 --> 01:59:20,318
Well, here we are,
Counselor,

1886
01:59:20,403 --> 01:59:23,446
just two lawyers
working it out!

1887
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:39,087
I'm going to kill you!

1888
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:42,591
You already sacrificed me, Counselor.

1889
02:00:28,095 --> 02:00:31,056
On Jordan's
stormy banks I stand

1890
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:34,059
Oh who will come
with me?

1891
02:00:34,143 --> 02:00:36,394
I am bound for
the promised land

1892
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:41,733
I am bound for
the promised land

1893
02:00:44,153 --> 02:00:47,656
I am bound for
the promised land

1894
02:02:39,602 --> 02:02:44,064
We never spoke about what
happened, at least not to each other.

1895
02:02:45,483 --> 02:02:51,363
Fear, I suppose, that to
remember his name or what he did

1896
02:02:51,447 --> 02:02:54,115
would mean letting him
into our dreams.

1897
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:58,328
And me, I hardly dream
about him anymore.

1898
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:03,750
Still, things won't ever be the
way they were before he came.

1899
02:03:04,377 --> 02:03:06,294
But that's all right

1900
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:10,340
because if you hang onto the
past, you die a little every day.

1901
02:03:11,258 --> 02:03:12,801
And for myself,

1902
02:03:13,302 --> 02:03:15,136
I know I'd rather live.

1903
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,597
The end.
