Four? They're crazy.
I should just get up
and walk out right now.

3
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,490
Okay, calm down.

4
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,725
Honestly, we put
a solid offer
on the table.

5
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,727
My clients are selling
for four,

6
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,896
Leaving half a million
in equity.

7
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,264
Now, this is the deal.

8
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,099
No. No.

9
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,968

12
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,179
I'll show this to my clients.

13
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:58,383
Don't know if it'll fly,
but we'll see.

14
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,020
Hey, how's it going
in there? Anything
i can do?

15
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,589
Listen. When
bill and nora leave,

16
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,158
I want you to
pop your head into
the conference room

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,293
And i want you to say
these exact words--

18
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,695
"Your clients are leaving."

19
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:13,398
Sure. Anything else
i need to know?

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,234
No, not yet.

21
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:18,137
Hmm.

22
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,104
Well?

23
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,239
3.5 million.

24
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,774
We already came down
from four.

25
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:26,879
We'll only break even if we
agree to three and a half.

26
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:27,779
Do you trust me?

27
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,480
We know you're working

28
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,050
As hard as you can
to close this deal,
but that richard guy

29
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,118
Is taking
advantage of us.

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,655
I know. That's
why if you trust me,

31
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,558
I want you to do exactly
what i'm about to tell you.

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,993
In 10 minutes i need
for you to get up,

33
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:45,998
Walk out of this office,
past the conference room,
and out the door.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,002
I don't understand.
We're in the middle
of negotiating.

35
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:50,802
Trust me.

36
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:54,206
Haven't you ever
done something without
knowing the outcome?

37
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,009
Wait 10 minutes
and go home.

38
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,844
The next time
you'll hear from me

39
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,013
Will be me calling
to congratulate you.

40
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,247
<I>do you understand now?</I>

41
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,148
Not really.

42
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,920
Bill, let's just do
what she asks.

43
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,291
'Kay. 10 minutes.

44
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,827
Let me call you back.

45
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,562
Well?

46
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:19,898
Do we have a deal or not?

47
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,734
What is it with you
and this paper?

48
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:27,973
Can't you speak?
What did they say?
Do we have a deal or not?

49
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,077
You're crazy!
No, they're crazy!

50
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,481
4.2 million?
What is going on here?

51
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,951
We made a fair offer and
they're going up in price?

52
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:42,087
They're tired of
this back and forth,
push and pull.

53
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:46,024
And they said if you do not
agree to it in 10 minutes,

54
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,294
The deal's off the table.

55
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,696
I don't believe you.

56
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,632
3.7 million
is a lot of money.

57
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,202
<I>i mean, who's gonna</i>
<i>walk away from that?</I>

58
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,072
Your clients?
They're leaving?

59
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,075
They're walking out
of the building right now.

60
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,076
Well, i guess that means
the deal's off.

61
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:08,780
What? After all the time
and work i put into this?

62
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:09,314
Go. Go get them.

63
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,017
As i explained, they told me
if i didn't come back,

64
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:17,289
- They were walking.
- Meghan, your clients
are leaving.

65
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,859
Okay, four. Four,
and we go to close today.

Mr. Whitaker, we have
a lot riding on our deal.

83
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,726
I understand. Meghan is
my top investment banker
here at the firm.

84
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,428
We've revised
our business plan

85
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,365
To include photos
of the extended land
in the mojave.

Any interesting opportunities
you can throw my way?

464
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:50,167
I'll sign your deal before
the land goes to auction

465
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,836
So you can get your
big commission check.

466
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,739
Listen, take the check,

467
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,474
Gather your christian folk,

468
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:01,779
And go build a church
in a new location.

469
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,783
Near a city where
people actually live.

470
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:07,985
Ms. Doherty,

471
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:11,088
I know as long as i
don't put my signature
on that document,

472
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,792
I have a fighting
chance to keep what's
rightfully mine.

473
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:19,029
No, it's not over
till god says it's over.

474
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,633
And god hasn't
told me anything.

475
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,034
All right.

476
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:28,672
So, why would me staying here
for six days

477
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:31,241
Make any difference in whether
or not you sign this deal?

478
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:34,445
You'll be able to see
what we do here with
your own eyes.

479
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:39,283
Maybe then you'll understand
why i'm willing to put my
faith in god

480
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,486
And fight to keep
this place open
to help people in need.

481
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:47,891
To you, this is just
another business deal.
This is my whole life.

482
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:52,129
If it's more money you want,
let me call mr. Whitaker.
Let's up the offer.

483
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:59,336
You have my offer.
Six days and i'll sign. That's
my promise to you and to god.

484
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,940
One condition. The deal
remains between you and me.

485
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:03,807
You can't tell anybody else.

486
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,276
I don't want people
around here to judge
or treat you

487
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:09,913
Any differently than
the rest of the guests.

488
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,620
All right.

489
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,389
Deal.

490
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,893
Okay.

491
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:26,430
I just need
to make a few calls.

492

[Beeping]

493
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,718
Meghan.

[Gasps]

495
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,488
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

496
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,891
Sorry. We have a camp
meeting in five minutes.

497
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:58,829
About this deal,
i need to go and make
a call to my office.

498
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:00,931
I need to go home and
get some extra clothing,

499
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,400
Because the only clothing
i have is what i'm wearing.

500
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,737
<I>now, do you have a phone</i>
<i>in your office i can use?</I>

501
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:09,273
Five minutes. And you
can leave all your stuff
in the car.

502
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:13,610
No one's gonna mess
with it. Five minutes.

503
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,085
[Phone beeping]

504
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:27,257
Hasn't anyone ever told them
that staring isn't polite?

505
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,197
Meghan, listen,
why don't you join my
church's congregation?

506
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,398
You can be
our special guest.

507
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,069
Maybe you could teach my kids
a little something about
whatever it is that you do.

508
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,671
They love your car.

509
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,406
Sure. Whatever you say.

510
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,607
Awesome. Thank you.

511
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,241
[Beeping]

512
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:48,312
I guess somebody didn't get
the memo about appropriate
attire.

513
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,848
I'm jacob. Everyone
around here calls me jake.

514
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,485
Well, jacob, you can
keep your smart comments
to yourself.

515
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,621
Look, i just saw you walk
in here with my father,

516
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,256
And i can tell by the
way that you're dressed

517
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:02,559
That you're obviously not one
of the church group leaders.

518
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,360
So, why are you here?

519
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:07,130
I'm here for the same reason
as everyone else.
Enlightenment.

520
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,266
Now i don't know
who you are, but--

521
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:13,070
I'm sorry, did you just say
that was your father?

522
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,572
Yeah. I run this place
with my parents.

523
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,175
I'm the head counselor here.

524
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,810
Sorry. Meghan doherty.

525
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:24,248
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to god's country.

526
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,452
I want you to shake away
all the worries of your
day-To-Day rat race

527
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:31,722
And peer pressure, and
especially video games,

528
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,323
Social networking, and uh--

529
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:34,625
[Phone beeps]

Texting.
[Clears throat]

531
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,795
You're here to relax,
make friends,

532
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:43,433
And most of all, discover
that real inner love of self
and god's spirit.

533
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:48,906
Before we begin, i want you
to turn to the person
to your right and left,

534
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,509
And give them a big
welcoming hug.

535
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,946
Hey.
Oh!

536
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,051
Okay.

537
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,120
Oh my--
[Girl squeals]

[Graham laughs]

539
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:08,358
Meghan, i'd like to introduce
my better half over here

540
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,162
For almost 25 years now,
caroline.

541
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,299
She's sort of the mother hen,
caretaker of the camp.

542
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:20,404
So if you get sick, bitten,
or just plain homesick,
she's--

543
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,138
Honey, stop it.
Bitten?

544
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,141
He's just pulling your leg.
If it was the summer time,
yes,

545
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:27,844
But in the cooler months
we don't have that problem.

546
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,146
Good to know.

547
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,180
Oh, hey, meghan,
this is geri.

548
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:34,251
- She's one of the counselors
here. You guys should--
- Hi.

549
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:35,485
Are you a model?

550
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,486
You're so pretty.

551
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:39,222
I know your feet must be
killing you in those
high heels.

552
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,557
Geri, go fetch meghan
a pair of your boots.

553
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,893
- No.
- They'll probably
be a little too big,

554
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,696
But they'll give your feet
a much needed rest.

555
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:51,535
Just show me to my room
so i can get on my laptop
and make a few calls,

556
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,803
And i'll be awesome.

[All laughing]

558
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:57,374
Meghan, you're kind of missing
the point of what we do here
in god's country.

559
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,976
And that is--

560
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,377
Off the grid.

561
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:01,712

Those are for you.

I'll take you
to your trailer.

567

You're gonna want those.

My dad asked me
to come check on you.

meghan, are you all right?

778
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,772
I'm gonna come in.
Are you dressed?

Oh, i'm all right.

783
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,284
I just strained my back
from pulling weeds yesterday.

784
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,253
I thought i had some
ibuprofen in the car.

785
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:38,421
Well come on, let's
get you some aspirin.

786
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:43,092
You wouldn't happen to know
where there would be a phone
i could use.

787
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:46,028
Yeah, well, the only phone's
in my father's office.

788
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,600
Other than that the closest
phone's about 10 miles away
in the nearest town.

789
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:52,401
I could ask him if you like.

790
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,002
Oh. Oh, no.

791
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:56,172
I guess i could drive
you to town if it's
that important.

792
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,040
Yes, it is that important.

793
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,141
Just far enough until
i get some cell signal,

794
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,544
- And then i could
make the call.
- Yeah, sure.

795
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:05,481
Come on. We'll take my car
and we'll be
back before lunch.

00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:53,329
Yeah. All of a sudden
i just feel sick.

00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,799
Maybe carol can help you
with her sudden sickness.

807
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,302
You know, i think
i'll be okay.

808
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:02,705
I just need to
sit down and rest.

She scared of breaking a nail?

813

So how do you feel?

814
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,255
I still feel a little dizzy.

815
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:55,291
I understand if you
want to leave, but--

816
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:56,892
I wasn't trying to leave.

817
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:59,261
I will be here
until next saturday,

'Cause we agreed
that you would sign that deed.

And i'll be here to
personally hand it to you.

820

It sure looked like you
were trying to leave today.

821
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,771
I wasn't trying to leave.
I was making a call.

822
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:12,274
A job is at stake
and i needed to let
mr. Whitaker know

823
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:13,676
It's taking a lot longer
than i thought.

824
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:18,447
Meghan, the point is
to leave that behind.

825
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,616
You being here
is about resting

826
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:22,418
And getting in touch
with god.

827
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,720
Calling whitaker
is not gonna change that

828
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:26,188
Or speed up the process.

829

You are just so in control.

figured out?

how bad things
are around here.

One of the things
that i remember the most

i had my sister here.

Cousins everywhere.

869
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,535
I never felt crowded.

I felt love.
I felt togetherness.

I just don't think there's
anything that can replace
that feeling,

I do have a question
for you.

What's going on? Why is
my father

When i came here i told
him that i needed help.

And so he agreed to help me
and treat me like everyone
else.

I'm not being nosy,

Don't worry. I'm not
a drug addict or anything.

I'm a workaholic.

And hence i'm
up here for rest.

of years to go to

And then i came back
to help my mother and
father run it.

911

Where did you go
to business school?

00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,411
Harvard.

913
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:19,515

Okay.

So, this is my vision.

923
00:55:52,283 --> 00:55:54,616
I want to build
a christian college with
full student housing.

924
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:59,988
The campus will be a state
of the art college with
full academic curriculum.

925
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,290
And the students, they
can earn college credit

926
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,892
And they can earn scholarships
by working at the camp
during the summer.

927
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:11,200
This is a day care center
for single mothers that
want to attend the college.

928
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:14,136
This is student housing,
and look at this.

929
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:17,773
That's the student activity
center.

930
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:21,243
I'm impressed.
Does your father
know about this?

931
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,811
Yeah, of course he does.
We spent thousands

932
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:26,248
Putting together
a business plan with
some really solid projections.

933
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,517
And we can get state funding,
tax relief.

934
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,687
I'm talking about building
an entire infrastructure here,

935
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:37,726
I mean electricity, sewage,
water, paving a road that goes
all the way to the highway.

936
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,229
I'm sorry. Am i boring you
with this?

937
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:40,629
No! No.

938
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:43,699
So why haven't you
put this plan into action?

939
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:46,735
Graham estates is
a nonprofit organization.

940
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,971
It raises most of our money
through church offerings.

941
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:52,408
With the economy hitting
all churches, big and small,

942
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,943
It's put our entire
organization into flux.

943
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,479
What we need is
a venture capitalist
to invest,

944
00:56:57,481 --> 00:57:00,482
But so far efforts
have fallen on deaf ears.

945
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:05,587
Our vision is
not their vision.
My family--

946
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:09,858
We really believe in helping
those who need help.

947
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,494
It's god's way.

00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,675
Nothing. Adam, i'm worried.

Okay, hold on.

956
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,750
Yes.
Ms. Doherty?

957
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,718
Valentina hasn't
heard anything.

958
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,021
...and she is. She is
very impressive indeed,

959
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:43,325
- And right now she's away.
She's handling...
- Uh--

960
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,993
...some very detailed
business...

961
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,728
i don't know what to do
or how to reach her.

962
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,432
Why doesn't someone just
drive down there and make
sure she's all right?

963
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:54,970
- Uh...
- ...i can assure you that
everything is going to plan,

964
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:59,408
And the closing will
take place on time.

965

How's the weather
over there, hoshi?

966
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:04,980
Mr. Whitaker doesn't want
to go down and interfere.

967
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,982
He'd prefer for meghan
to call in.

968
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,218
She's working on some
really big deal for the firm.

969
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,322
I don't know much about it,
though, other than it's
worth a lot of money.

970
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,891
Forget whitaker and how much
money this deal is worth.

971
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:18,694
What if she's in trouble?
What if she needs our help?

972
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,629
- Uh--
-  <I>anything could have</i>
<i>happened to her.</I>

973
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:24,233
You get on that phone
and call the state police

974
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:26,835
And place a missing persons
report.

975
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,972
Don't just sit around
and do nothing.
You hear me?

976
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:34,042
Okay, well, look, mr. Whitaker
says if she doesn't call in
the next couple of days,

977
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:39,548
He'll go down there himself.
All right? I gotta go, though.
Okay, bye.

978
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,484
You can't keep
putting this off.
What are you going to do?

979
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:48,690
I don't know. We've tried
her cell many times.
There's no answer.

Adam, our friend is missing.

981

If you're not going
to call 911, i will.

You decide.

If i call 911 and she's okay,

I'm calling the police.

i get to see how he helps
people out of tight spots.

1038

Why, 'cause i'm not
all glamorous like you?

I always wanted to fit in

It's just, i have
four brothers.

It's just easier
to play rough, you now?

Yeah, we can,
we can go shopping,

And--

1048
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:29,845
We could find you a new

We could have some girl time?

i was about your age.

01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,806
I did everything
with him, and then

1060
01:02:57,808 --> 01:03:00,208
When he died i just lost
interest in everything.

1061

Hey, you know what? You seem
too nice to be a lawyer.

1062
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,450
All the lawyers i know
are just ruthless.

1063

There's good and bad in
everything and everyone.

1064
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:12,921
I want to be a lawyer
so i can--

1065
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:17,692
So i can fight for
the people that can't afford
to fight for themselves.

1066
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:18,760
You know, for example,

1067
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:21,630
Say there's this big bank
that locks an elderly couple
into a bad mortgage,

1068
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:27,169
And then tries to evict them
from their home for the money
'cause they're greedy.

1079
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:18,280
This is what
i was talking about, jake.

1080
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,549
Luke 10:23.

1081
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,251
<I>"blessed are the eyes</i>
<i>that see what you see."</I>

1082
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:27,088
- How are you doing
this morning?
- Great. Good to see you.

1083
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,190
<I>yeah?</I>
hey, jake.

1084
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:30,125
The truck. Where is it?

1085
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:31,159
<I>right in front of the office.</I>

1086
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,994
<I>yup.</I>
keys inside?

1087
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,963
Thanks, man.

1088
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:39,401
<I>[eden] come in, meghan.</I>

1089
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:43,271
- Eden?
- Hi, meghan.
Have a seat.

1090
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,740
I have a confession to make.

1091
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:50,545
Mr. Whitaker didn't send me
down here just
to make an offer.

1092
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:53,248
There's a pair of businessmen,
the yakamoto brothers,

1093
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,983
And they're here
to develop the land.

1094
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:57,886
They want to turn it
into a casino and resort.

1095
01:05:57,888 --> 01:06:00,722
It's a $100 million deal
and i don't see any way

1096
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:01,923
That you could stop it
from happening,

1097
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:06,761
Especially since tomorrow
is the auction.

1098
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:10,031
Thanks for
the information, meghan.

1099
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:13,335
There's nothing left
for me to do but pray.

1100
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,503
Will you stop it?

1101
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,539
Right now is the decision!

1102
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:18,873
Mr.
Whitaker is gonna come down

1103
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,275
The road any
second now and just

1104
01:06:20,277 --> 01:06:22,777
Shut down
the entire operation,

1105
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:25,413
Including me.

1106
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:27,949
I get it. I understand.

1107
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:32,020
There is something really
special about this land.

1108
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,322
But you have to be proactive.

1109
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:39,461
Jake shared with me the entire
vision you have to build
a christian college.

1110
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,429
You've got to find someone
to invest in it,

1111
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:45,166
To pay up the debt,
to buy this
land so you can put this camp

1112
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:48,603
I've tried everything.
I've called everyone
i know with money

1113
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:51,740
That could maybe bail me out,
but so far, no one.

1114
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:55,844
All i have left is
my faith in god.

1115
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:59,014
Don't you understand?
That's all i have left.

1116
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:02,984
But what about jake
and everyone else?

1117
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:04,786
Jake trusts you.

1118
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:11,359
He trusts that
you and him are gonna
complete this vision.

1119
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:20,902
You're right.
You're right. You're right
about the whole situation.

1120
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,372
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna tell my family
tonight.

1121
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:28,443
It's not fair t hide things
from the ones you love.

1122
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,245
It's just not fair.

1123
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:31,379
They have the right to know.

1124
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,680
Okay.
You're right.

1125
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,850
No. I want you
to come with me.

1126
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:44,492
Can i have your
attention, everyone?

1127
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:54,536
In john chapter 8,
the passage states,

1128
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:59,441
"Then you will know
the truth, and the truth
will set you free."

1129
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:04,813
Well, i have a confession to
make about god's country.

1130
01:08:04,815 --> 01:08:05,980
We're in foreclosure.

1131
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:08,216
<I>and as of saturday</i>
<i>we will be no more.</I>

1132
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:15,123
<I>the land will got to auction</i>
<i>to the highest bidder.</I>

1133
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,424
But the good news is,

1134
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,959
They made us an offer,
and with the money,

1135
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:19,994
<I>we'll be able to</i>
<i>start over in a new city.</I>

1136
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:24,332
Sure we can start over
in a different city,
but i love this land.

1137
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:29,737
Wait. Why can't just call
the bank and ask them to work
something out with us?

1138
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:31,773
Because i am the bank.

1139
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:37,212
And my boss won't
bail you out of debt.

1140
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:43,718
There are some businessmen and
they have made a very large
offer for the land-- Jake!

1141
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:45,753
You lied to me.

1142
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:46,488
I didn't lie to you.

1143
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,824
- I just didn't
know how to tell you.
- Lying and not telling

1144
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,961
Are the same thing to me.

1145
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,270
[Sobbing]

1146
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:08,576
Jake, wait.

1147
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,081
It's not her fault.

1148
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,549
Yeah? And whose fault is it?

1149
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:16,117
You hid this from me!
What about the college?

1150
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,553
<I>what about the vision</i>
<i>that we had?</I>

1151
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:19,654
Son, i know--

1152
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,288
Know what?

1153
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,424
That we're losing everything
that we've worked for and you
didn't have enough respect

1154
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:26,594
For me or the workers
to tell us?

1155
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:47,282
Meghan, how could you
do this to us?

1156
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,584
Geri, it's not her fault.

1157
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,519
<I>she was just doing her job.</I>

1158
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,254
Eden, how did
all this happen?

1159
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:57,926
I tried everything
i could to stop this.

1160
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:02,230
But uh, our time is short.

1161
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:05,133
I meet with ms. Doherty
tomorrow

1162
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:07,368
To finalize
the paperwork.

1163
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,171
So, um,

1164
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,273
Let's enjoy the rest
of the camp.

1165
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:15,009
Pastor, could you lead us
in prayer?

1166
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:16,844
Sure.

1167
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,950
Dear heavenly father,

1168
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:24,118
We ask for your guidance
and your wisdom,

1169
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:29,257
And that you may pour
your blessing upon your work,

1170
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:35,163
Your land, and your people.

1171
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,835
In jesus' name we pray.

1172
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,837
[All]
amen.

1173
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:44,939
Amen.

1174
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:50,878
It's okay.

1175
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,580
I'm sorry.

<I>[motor humming]</i>

1177
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,153
Hey.

1178
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:41,396
You know, as long
as i can remember,

1179
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:44,866
This has been my spot to come
and get away from the world,

1180
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:50,972
Clear my mind from
any worries, doubts,

1181
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,341
Fears.

1182
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,278
I'm sorry.

1183
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:02,483
I didn't mean to mislead
you why i was here.

1184
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:05,553
I'm just doing my job.

1185
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:07,755
I should have known.
Right? Like,

1186
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:09,724
Who drives up here
in a ferrari?

1187
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:12,093
It's gotta be
a banker or a lawyer,

1188
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:14,162
Somebody self-Oriented.

1189
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,563
Yeah, that would be me.

1190
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:20,201
I was exactly that person
you just described when
i came here.

1191
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:22,003
I was on a mission
to close on this deal

1192
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:27,475
And get back in time
to have drinks with
my friends in the city.

1193
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:31,412
But something changed.

1194
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,116
After seeing all this,

1195
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:37,285
And you sharing your--

Your vision with me,

1197
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:40,755
And meeting everyone,
i understand why

1198
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:45,493
Your father
doesn't want to part
with this land.

1199
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:50,331
This really is god's country!

1200

Look, i know i can't
blame you,

1201

But i don't
have to like it.

I feel so bad.

1205
01:13:41,718 --> 01:13:46,487
Don't. I realize that you
were just doing your job.

1206
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:54,162
And that i need to forgive
like jesus would have.

1207
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,735
Do you want
to forgive me?

1208
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:04,405
Yes. Yes, i do.

1209

I really enjoyed
what we shared together.

1210

And i learned that there's a
lesson in every part of life

1211
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,381
And it is not your fault
that this camp is broke.

That's something that jake

have to deal with.
