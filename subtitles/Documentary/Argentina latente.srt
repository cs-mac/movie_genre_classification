1
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,839
When Orfeo bought his wife
back from the underworld

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,879
He was told he must not look back
at her whatever happened.

3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,359
Orfeo!

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,519
But at last he could not resist...

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,599
the sound of her voice
calling his name.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,798
Turned back and so lost her forever.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,199
They say that they are subversives.
Let them show their faces and say why.

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,759
My son was not subversive. He worked
and studied, That's what he did...

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,759
When the military dictatorship
fell in 1983 here in Argentina...

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,319
We were told that
we should never look back.

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,279
Yes, there was injustice.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,279
Yes, mistakes were made.

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,599
But if we looked back
the pain would never end.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,273
The wounds would never heal.

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,079
The Generals had already changed
the meaning of the words to disappear.

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,159
For them things disappeared,
people disappeared...

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,479
But they spoke of disappearing people.

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,880
Disappearing their enemies.

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,719
They had changed the language...

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,360
and now they wanted
to disappear the past.

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,559
They told us we must never look back.

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,679
But we have to look back.

23
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,991
It is our sacred duty to look back.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,999
If they're ill, If they're cold, If they're
hungry. We don't know anything.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,319
And we are desperate sir,
we don't know who to ask.

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,279
Consulates, Embassies,
Ministeries, Churches...

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,319
All doors are closed to us

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,999
This is why we beg you, we beg you

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,399
You are our last hope

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,959
Please help us, Help us, Please...

31
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,917
You are our last hope

32
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,591
Carlos!

33
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,319
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,674
Sorry. Let's go from the top.

35
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I'll see you Silvio.

36
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,039
Bye bye Carlos. Hey,
what time is the call tomorrow?

37
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,119
Ten. See you tomorrow.

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,951
Bring it down two.

39
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,639
Cecilia.

40
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,237
Cecilia?

41
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,237
What's the matter?

42
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,999
Where's Mama?

43
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,439
You say she's been receiving
threatening phone calls?

44
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,320
Two, Yes

45
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,879
Did you report them?

46
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,639
No, no.

47
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,479
Perhaps she left of her own free will.

48
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,759
Have you quarelled recently?

49
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,239
No, I told you.
Pedro saw 3 men taking her away.

50
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,319
Yes, in a green Ford Falcon.

51
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Did you get the plate number?

52
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,199
There were no plates.

53
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,999
Are you sure about this?

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,759
I think so.

55
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,910
You think so.

56
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,159
I hope you don't believe
all that crap about people disappearing

57
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,519
Just propaganda, you know.

58
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,399
Well this article of my wife's
is about people disappearing.

59
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,559
Perhaps she's just
trying to prove her point.

60
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,879
And you're a writer also, are you?

61
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,599
Yes, I am a writer.

62
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,359
Don't worry.

63
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,479
We'll find your wife.

64
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,470
If she's to be found.

65
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,519
You are very stubborn.
I don't see the point of it.

66
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,959
They are frightened, Silvio.
That's the point.

67
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,599
It's just going to cause trouble.
Why are you doing this?

68
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,039
Because our government has managed

69
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,999
somehow to invent
a new kind of infamy.

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,159
What... what do you mean?

71
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,359
Okay, somebody
just disappears and they say

72
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,119
Oh my god how terrible,
we're doing everything we can.

73
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,999
And you know and they know,
they ordered the arrest.

74
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,039
Well you know, politics is like dogshit.
You don't want to step in it!

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,679
No, no, I don't feel that way at all.

76
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,479
You see, I agree with
every word you say in this piece...

77
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,159
I still don't think you should publish it.

78
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,079
Carlos, why not?

79
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,239
It's just too provocative.

80
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,759
Carlos, these were school children
protesting about bus fares.

81
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,959
About bus fares!
Vanished without a trace.

82
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,119
Will this bring them back?

83
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
But that's not the point.

84
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,519
But what is the point?

85
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,279
Somebody has to say something.

86
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,479
All I am saying is...
around that corner in the Casa Rosada

87
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,959
is a gang of insane paranoics...

88
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,919
who that think Gerald Ford
is a member of the

89
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,519
International Communist Conspiracy.

90
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,199
Cecilia you are acting on
the assumption they are rational.

91
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,999
They are not.
They're mad dogs. They bite.

92
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,879
Hey, Ruben.

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,439
Silvio.

94
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,999
Hello Ruben. How are you doin'?

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,119
There's some kind of demonstration
going on in the Plaza.

96
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,800
Really?

97
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,239
Old women in headscarves.

98
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,719
How's your movie?

99
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,999
Same old crap.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,439
Well, I'm going to have a look.

101
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,439
Me too.

102
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,719
Are you coming?

103
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,039
No.

104
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,439
Goodbye.

105
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,159
Back in 10 minutes.

106
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,480
Watch out for dog shit.

107
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:43,359
Let's go, Let' go, everybody out
Let's all get out

108
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,479
There were rumours
this was going to happen.

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,399
Who are they?

110
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,959
The mothers of the disappeared.

111
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,159
If those mothers in
the square aren't afraid

112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,119
Shouldn't I have the courage
to tell the truth?

113
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,239
But it's different for them.

114
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,959
Why? What do you mean?

115
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,919
For them the disaster
has already happened.

116
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,359
And it wasn't something
they provoked themselves, was it?

117
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,079
Next thing, you'll be saying
they're a lot of trouble makers...

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,439
who probably deserve
to be disappeared.

119
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,719
No. You know

120
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,680
that's not what I meant!
But this is what...

121
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:14,079
Hey, can we talk about
something else please?

122
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,239
Listen, those school
children who complained

123
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,799
about the bus fares were Teresa's age.

124
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,719
Suppose it had happened to Teresa?

125
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
Suppose what had happened to me?

126
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,599
You're not thinking
what you're saying. Let's eat.

127
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,799
Are you trying to
tell me I'm not allowed

128
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,439
to talk about these
things in my own home?

129
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,439
Suppose what had happened to me?

130
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,638
Nothing. You know what she's like
when she gets like that.

131
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,839
You are right.

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,399
Of course.

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,119
You are right.

134
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,871
Yes.

135
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,875
All the same, I felt I had to...

136
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,070
I don't know. Say something...

137
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,839
Carlos...

138
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,591
I love you.

139
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,391
Teresa?

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,195
I couldn't sleep.

141
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,880
Mind if I sit with you?

142
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,476
I should have stopped her
writing those things.

143
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,919
How could you have stopped her?

144
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,595
It's what she does.

145
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,911
Come here.

146
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,639
Excuse me just a second.

147
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,360
Have you seen this woman...

148
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,439
She disappeared 8 weeks ago?

149
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,317
No, no.

150
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,479
Sir, have you seen this woman?

151
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,399
They were not the guilty ones.

152
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,599
Now, Now we presume
the unthinkable.

153
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,071
We want to see them alive
and punish the guilty.

154
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,159
How did it go?

155
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,599
All right.

156
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,959
Well... 2nd act was a little sluggish.

157
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,999
Sorry I missed it.

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,479
You would have been
of more use here

159
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,999
instead of wandering
around in the rain.

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,070
What's Enrico doing?

161
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,999
He's waiting to see you.

162
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,354
You have a problem.

163
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,880
What is it, Enrico?

164
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,759
You have to release
me from the play.

165
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,679
I don't come anymore.

166
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,431
Why?

167
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,120
I don't want to talk about it.

168
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,109
They have taken your father.

169
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,359
Who told you? I Nobody told me.

170
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,276
But... you tell me what happened.

171
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,759
They broke into the apartment
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

172
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,477
Yes, yes...

173
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,711
Tonight, they will arrive
in his cell. 3 of them.

174
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,439
One of the men,
a colonel, will tell your father...

175
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,909
to be more careful about
what he says to his students.

176
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,879
He will make him admit
that a professor is

177
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,439
not capable of understanding
the government's intention.

178
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,519
He will ask him to promise never,

179
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,513
never to criticise
the government again.

180
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,349
Your father will promise.

181
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,679
Later, tonight, they will release him.

182
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,559
And drive him back close
to where you live.

183
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,156
Believe me.

184
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,518
Carlos? Are you alright?

185
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,716
I don't know.

186
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,440
I told Enrico his father
would be released tonight.

187
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,115
You did what?

188
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
Why did you do that?

189
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,874
I know you are going
through hard times, Carlos, but...

190
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,637
I couldn't stop myself, Esme.

191
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,359
It was like a hallucination,
like I have seen...

192
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,840
The whole thing in a movie.

193
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,759
It was like I was watching...

194
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,759
Like I was remembering...

195
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,591
the future.

196
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,519
No, no no, I asked you.

197
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,679
You didn't! Yes...

198
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,919
My God, I can't believe

199
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,679
you've forgotten this. I asked you.

200
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,599
Impossible, Impossible. How?

201
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,839
I said will you marry me, you fool.

202
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,119
No, I mean how did it arise?

203
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,999
How could I have left that sacred
task in your hands?

204
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,319
It arose out of me explaining why
I wanted to be a journalist.

205
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,239
You can't remember?

206
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,719
I said I wanted to be a journalist so
I could ask difficult questions.

207
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,079
And you said, ask me a
difficult question then.

208
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,559
And I said, will you marry me?

209
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,236
No? It's so typical that you
can't remember. It's so hurtful.

210
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,959
So, what did I say?

211
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,637
You went bright red
and made a puffing noise like a train.

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,239
And that was all?

213
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,391
No. You kissed me.

214
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,272
That was the best kiss I ever had.

215
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,439
It happened, it happened,
Senor Rueda, exactly what you said.

216
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,954
The colonel, everything.

217
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,274
Thank you, thank you.

218
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,434
I'm very pleased.

219
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,557
Listen, Enrico.

220
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,278
Go downstairs and
I'll see you in a minute.

221
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,752
Yeah.

222
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,919
It was probably a coincidence.

223
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,557
No.

224
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,039
We want to see them alive
and punish the guilty. Now. Now.

225
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,119
We are assuming the unthinkable

226
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,639
We want to see them alive.
And punish the guilty.

227
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,710
Please come this evening.

228
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,040
I may be able to help you.

229
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,759
Thanks to all of you...

230
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,319
For coming here to my house.

231
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,079
I don't know how
to explain this to you... because...

232
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,958
because I don't know
how to explain it to myself.

233
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,079
All I can say is...

234
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,479
That I may be able to
help some of you

235
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,759
whose loved ones have disappeared...

236
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,080
with information.

237
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
I need their names

238
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,359
and the circumstances
of the disappearance.

239
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,751
And if I fail, I will have
to ask you to forgive me.

240
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,919
But we have nothing...

241
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,879
so it seemed worth the attempt.

242
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,559
My grandson's name is
Octavio Marquez. He's an athlete.

243
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,359
They took him last month
from the stadium.

244
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,670
He's not interested in politics.

245
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,870
I'm sorry. It's not working.

246
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,199
Senor Rueda.

247
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,799
It's just not working.

248
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,677
I'm sorry.

249
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,159
My son.

250
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,516
My son's name is Victor Madrid.

251
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,072
He's 15 years old.

252
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,439
Sometimes he says stupid things

253
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,397
about subjects he doesn't understand.

254
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,392
And last Friday he didn't
come home from school.

255
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,435
Victor Madrid?

256
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,514
Yes, they picked him
up at the school gates.

257
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,160
They drove him out into the pampas.

258
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,394
They took him to a
place they often use.

259
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,479
They were preparing to kill him.

260
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,073
No, no, no, no

261
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,669
He's gone!

262
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,511
Because it was a known killing ground

263
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,195
it was being watched.

264
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,199
And Victor was rescued.

265
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,359
He's still in hiding, but soon...

266
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,831
he will find a way to get
a message to you.

267
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,200
Yes.

268
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,795
Senor.

269
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,359
My daughter is called Julia Obregon.

270
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,399
She is a social worker.

271
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:48,718
They took her
from her office 3 weeks ago.

272
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,875
I'm sorry...

273
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,839
I'll tell you later, if you want...

274
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,833
any detail that you need to know.

275
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,319
My mother's name is Cecilia Rueda.

276
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,236
They took her
from this house on May 23rd.

277
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:25,112
My father came home
from the theatre and she was gone.

278
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,991
Your hands.

279
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,793
Teresa... she's strong.

280
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,479
She's so strong.

281
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,519
The way she fights them is by never...

282
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,876
letting go of the idea of escape.

283
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,109
And last night...

284
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,911
Last night, she succeeded.

285
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,990
Jump, jump.

286
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,154
Run, run.

287
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,960
Run, run. Go go, go, go, go.

288
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,597
Yes

289
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,234
Run, run.

290
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,799
Yes.

291
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,755
Carlos.

292
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,399
I have lost her.

293
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
No, no.

294
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
You fainted.

295
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,159
Are you alright?

296
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,399
I'm sorry.

297
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,800
Maybe I shouldn't have asked you.

298
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,719
You were right.

299
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,439
It was the right thing to do.

300
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,155
But I lost her.

301
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,559
Why did I lose her?

302
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,040
You're very tired.

303
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,039
Say it Silvio. Say it.

304
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,839
It isn't right, Carlos.

305
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,439
Even if what you say is true,
it still isn't right.

306
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,999
And I don't see how it can be true.

307
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,279
It is true. Don't ask me
how I know, I just do.

308
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,759
It's not rational.

309
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,319
You have only ever
believed in what is rational.

310
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,959
I have to believe in this
because it's happening.

311
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,839
This is absurd.

312
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,279
Oh, Silvio. I don't have
the energy to quarrel with you...

313
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,879
just please... go.

314
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,759
Are you coming?

315
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,035
I'll stay a while.

316
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,679
A foghorn.

317
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,397
What?

318
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,720
I heard a foghorn.

319
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,312
They must be keeping her
somewhere near the docks.

320
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,956
I'm alright, just get some water.

321
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,359
I knew she'd been there.

322
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,919
I could feel her in that room.

323
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,876
Keep still.

324
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,839
Why did the trail go cold?

325
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,559
Why should I be able
to trace complete

326
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,039
strangers and not find my own wife?

327
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,720
Why is that?

328
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:49,479
You should get some sleep.

329
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,598
Teresa. You get ready for school.
I'll look after your father.

330
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,917
No, no, no.
I'd better go into the theatre.

331
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,319
Don't even think about it.

332
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,639
You go, Esme.
I'll stay home and take care of him.

333
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,440
Well, I...

334
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:04,238
I guess we should do as we are told.

335
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,079
This gift, Teresa...

336
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,799
Maybe I'm not supposed
to spend it on myself.

337
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,319
You'll find Mama.

338
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,640
I know you will.

339
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,479
I don't think I could get
through this without you.

340
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,596
My baby.

341
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:17,799
They took them alive,
We want them back alive.

342
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,229
He's still alive.

343
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,075
Thank you very much.

344
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,199
Now that the number
of disappearances...

345
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,279
recorded by our
organization exceeds 2000.

346
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,039
We feel it essential to register
the following demands

347
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,960
Your wife?

348
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:48,559
1. We require a full list of detainees

349
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,319
- Together with details of any charges
- My sister.

350
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,999
Which may have been
made against them...

351
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,679
Or a firm date for their release.

352
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,149
I don't know if I can
go on living without Marta.

353
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,479
- 2. We must be allowed visiting rights.
- Do you know about my garden?

354
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,919
I've been trying to
find the courage to come.

355
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,719
I want to read you a draft of our
petition to General Guzman

356
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,839
Well, I'll expect you next Thursday.

357
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,279
I just want to thank you all

358
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,399
for allowing me to grieve with you...

359
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,914
and giving me hope.

360
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,559
And something else I never
had before the courage.

361
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,916
The courage to stand up for myself.

362
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,474
Excuse me sir, what is this?

363
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,160
I'm gonna get one of those shits.

364
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,196
Wait! Hey, hey, hey.

365
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,599
Let me go! Let me go!

366
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,716
No, no, no, no.

367
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,799
General Guzman is a very busy man.

368
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,919
But nevertheless
I would like you to tell him

369
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,355
that Carlos Rueda wishes
to see him, please.

370
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,519
A man called
Carlos Rueda wants to know

371
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,000
if the minister will see him.

372
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,719
What can I do for you?

373
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,479
I'm here to protest
the arbitrary arrest of 9 women

374
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,199
Including 2 nuns from
the Church of the Holy Cross.

375
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,270
Do sit down.

376
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,159
When was this alleged occurrence?

377
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,599
This morning. I was there.

378
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,879
Well it's too soon to expect
me to know anything about it.

379
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,792
I've never claimed to be omniscient.

380
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,159
Nuns, you say?

381
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,516
Yes. I have all the names.

382
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,752
Thank you.

383
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,032
I will look into it myself.

384
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,439
Now, I understand you run
a theatre for children.

385
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,839
Yes, yes

386
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,359
I say I understand, in fact I know.

387
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,679
My nephew was once in
one of your plays. I saw it.

388
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,119
I don't remember what it was about...

389
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,600
but it was most enjoyable.

390
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,879
My wife has disappeared.

391
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,279
How terrible?
I can appreciate your concern.

392
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,679
What is her name?

393
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,434
Cecilia. Cecilia Rueda. A journalist.

394
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,192
No. There is no one of that name.

395
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,559
She was arrested.

396
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,631
Why? Is she a terrorist?
Has she committed a crime?

397
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,759
No. She's not a terrorist.

398
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,599
There are leftist groups
who are kidnapping

399
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,991
and even killing people
to make us look bad.

400
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,997
They don't care what they do.

401
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,319
What happened to your arm?

402
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,720
I was bitten by a dog.

403
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,197
What a colourful life you lead.

404
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,955
What do you think when you see
those mothers in the square?

405
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,759
Even animals have mothers.

406
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,679
Well they want their children back.

407
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,239
And I want my wife back.

408
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,719
Naturally I am very concerned
about your wife.

409
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,952
I've made a note to investigate
the matter personally.

410
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,919
In the meantime I think
you should get back to your theatre.

411
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,519
I can't say I like
the sound of your new act.

412
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,917
What new act?

413
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,839
The clairvoyance. The conjuring tricks.

414
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,879
If you dislike my new act,
it's because it's a sign of

415
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,199
something you cannot kill...

416
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,959
Something you do not possess...

417
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,795
Something which will
eventually destroy you.

418
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,311
And what is that?

419
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,676
Imagination.

420
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,036
Cecilia!

421
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,156
Cecilia!

422
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,000
Cecilia Help. Help.

423
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,274
Cecilia.

424
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,471
You were crying.

425
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,395
Now I'm alright.
I'm alright. It was just a dream.

426
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,597
Hold on.

427
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,077
Mind your feet.

428
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,959
Don't worry, hey Don't worry.

429
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,959
They're just trying to intimidate us.

430
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,031
Alright. That's all.

431
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,473
Eh, are you okay?

432
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,079
Yeah. Go and get dressed.

433
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,196
I think we should get out of here.

434
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,199
I'm sorry, Esme.

435
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,520
I hope I didn't scare you.

436
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,715
Come in. Come in.

437
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,911
I don't think it's safe for her
in the house any more.

438
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,959
You can stay here as long as you like.

439
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,757
Both of you.

440
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,756
Thank you. Thank you.

441
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,919
So you're going to drive
out to the pampas

442
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,999
because you had a
dream about an owl?

443
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,196
I have to trust the signs, Silvio.

444
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,999
I don't know what else I can do.

445
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,840
I don't know.

446
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,639
The theatre is not a business
that runs by itself, you know.

447
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,119
Unless you want to do your
Thursday evening shows here

448
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,236
and charge admission.

449
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,999
Listen, we'll run things here.

450
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,799
You go find your owl.

451
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,950
I'll find something.

452
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,590
I don't know what,
but I know I'll find something.

453
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,633
Welcome to La Esperanza.

454
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,753
My name is Amos Sternberg.

455
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,960
This is my wife, Sara.

456
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,316
Carlos Rueda.

457
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,830
What brings you here?

458
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,393
I am looking for my wife.

459
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,039
It will take some time to explain.

460
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,757
Yes.

461
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,114
I'm sorry to bring such horrors
to a place like this.

462
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,439
What if you never find her, Carlos?

463
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,669
I will find her.

464
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,399
That is a conviction, or a hope?

465
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,119
I make no distinction between the two.

466
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,839
Stay to dinner. Stay the night.

467
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,638
Thank you.

468
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,591
Thanks.

469
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,359
She prefers to eat on her own
when we have guests.

470
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,714
Which by the way is hardly ever.

471
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,599
Is she your daughter?

472
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,399
No.

473
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,519
She's the daughter
of old friends of ours.

474
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,399
We were all together in Auschwitz.

475
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,879
She's very shy, you see.

476
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,996
She cannot speak.

477
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,839
She asked an SS man for
a drink of water one day.

478
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,797
So he cut out her
tongue with his bayonet.

479
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,198
Now can you see why we understand
what you were telling us?

480
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,359
What made you choose
to come to Argentina?

481
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,599
This estancia has been in my family
for over a hundred years.

482
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,670
We have a son here.

483
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,959
We sent him over to Amos's cousin

484
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,079
in the thirties when
he was quite small.

485
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,599
Because we saw the way things
were going in Germany.

486
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,919
We were going to leave ourselves,
but we left it too late.

487
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,079
He's a silversmith.
He has a shop in La Boca.

488
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,754
You must go and see him
when you get back to Buenos Aires.

489
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,319
Thank you. I will.

490
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,879
My cousin died in the forties
and the estancia came to us.

491
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,079
People say to us, how can you bear

492
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,311
to live out there, lost in the pampas?

493
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,079
But I say I like to see as far as

494
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,436
I can in every direction nowadays.

495
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,914
Why all the birds?

496
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,679
There used to be
these birds at Auschwitz.

497
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,639
Non-descript little brown birds,
like our finches.

498
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,999
They came every morning
and sat on the wire.

499
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,719
And reminded us of freedom.

500
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,999
Then the Nazis electrified the wire:

501
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,439
And for a whole summer's day,

502
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,079
to the great amusement of the guards

503
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,799
The birds turned into
vivid spurts of flame.

504
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,519
After a day, they never returned.

505
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,039
When we arrived in Buenos Aires,

506
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,999
we went to La Boca, to the market...

507
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,639
bought every bird that was for sale

508
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,999
and ferried them down here.

509
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,999
For us they contain the
souls of all our friends

510
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,037
who did not come
back from the camps.

511
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,919
How can anybody survive that?

512
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,479
If you live in a nightmare,

513
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,399
you have to try to re-imagine it.

514
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,839
That's why your
stories are so important.

515
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,911
They may be keeping her alive.

516
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,071
Go on telling your stories.

517
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,871
Celia?

518
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,276
Cecilia.

519
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,439
Then I lost track of her.

520
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,199
It wasn't like
last time at the warehouse.

521
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,350
The trail went cold.

522
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,111
But this time I didn't
feel so desperate.

523
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,555
I knew she was somewhere close.

524
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,880
But I also knew
I would never be able to find her.

525
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,919
Because for some reason
I can't understand...

526
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,631
my instinct is telling me,
that she has to find me.

527
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,119
All yours.

528
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,430
No, I'll take her back.

529
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,040
You don't know what you're missing.

530
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,079
I'm just trying to help you.

531
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,519
Too late for help wouldn't you say?

532
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,599
Well don't think
I like what goes on here.

533
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,799
Then why be part of it?

534
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,039
It's my job. I've always been
a prison guard. Like my father.

535
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,759
I imagine the job must have changed

536
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,599
a lot in the last few years, hasn't it?

537
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,319
Yes, out of all recognition.

538
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,639
Well, then.

539
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,359
I have children. I need to work.

540
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,239
I'm sure, if you really wanted to,

541
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,152
you could find something else to do.

542
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,595
Exercise time.

543
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,999
I don't want to go.

544
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,439
Why?

545
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,119
Let me stay in.

546
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,879
Alright. I'll tell them you are not well.

547
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,677
Yes.

548
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,319
Yeah, but... what are you doing?

549
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,679
Remembering.

550
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,879
Oh, I see.

551
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,639
Not the past. I don't mean the past.

552
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,519
This. I'm remembering all of this.

553
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,559
Every detail.

554
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,358
It mustn't ever be forgotten.

555
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,438
Gustavo.

556
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,957
Go ahead.

557
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,879
My sister Marta worked
in General Guzman's secretariat.

558
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,679
One day she was alone in his office

559
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,799
and she found something on his desk.

560
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,439
I don't know what it was because

561
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,715
she was too frightened to tell me.

562
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,199
Guzman walked in and saw
what she was reading.

563
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,116
He hit her and fired her on the spot.

564
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,071
That same evening they took her
from her apartment.

565
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,951
Please help me.

566
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,355
I know you can find her for me.

567
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,830
I can't see Marta very clearly yet.

568
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,880
There is something else.

569
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,593
It is Guzman I can see.

570
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,599
Guzman who believes
his fatherland is in danger.

571
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,831
And that it is his
sacred duty to protect it.

572
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,199
It's unusual for me to see the
oppressors rather than the victims.

573
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,229
Have you ever been an actor, Gustavo?

574
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,717
No.

575
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,391
You have never been in my theatre?

576
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,110
Never. Does this...?

577
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,678
I think I can see Marta now.

578
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,916
She's a tiny blonde girl, isn't she?

579
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,635
So slight, you'd think
they would break her in half.

580
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,152
That's right.

581
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,999
Why do you suppose Guzman is so

582
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,276
frightened of tiny girls like Marta?

583
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,079
Well, as she was waiting
in the basement

584
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,359
at the Naval Mechanics School...

585
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,239
something extraordinary
happened to Marta.

586
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,879
She recognised the young officer
who was supervising her torture.

587
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,239
And realised she was
a figment of his imagination.

588
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,959
And the officer was you, Gustavo.

589
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,439
You have no sister.

590
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,954
You're here as a spy.

591
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,639
I... I thought you were
supposed to help us.

592
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,154
We are all victims here, you know.

593
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,559
How can you just say a thing like that.

594
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,999
You have a tape recorder
underneath your shirt.

595
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,435
If I am wrong, I will apologize.

596
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,360
I can explain.

597
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:44,879
Murderer! Murderer!

598
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,479
No, no, no, no!

599
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,639
Leave it! Sit! Not in my house.

600
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,552
No stop it, stop it!

601
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,395
This is a message to
you General Guzman

602
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,839
We are not subversives.

603
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,799
We want the return of our families.

604
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,640
And you have our sympathies.

605
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:18,792
It must be strenuous to be so full
of hatred and suspicion.

606
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,358
Go!

607
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:26,720
He's laughing.

608
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,360
Wait, wait.

609
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,032
Hold it, hold it.

610
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:50,871
Who is next?

611
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,719
We ought to have killed
that bastard this evening.

612
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,995
No, Sylvio, no.

613
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,239
Am I crazy to feel
a little better tonight?

614
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,479
Can I stay here tonight?

615
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,359
No, you should go back to Esme's.

616
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,956
Papa, please let me stay.
Just for tonight.

617
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,192
Okay. Come here. Come here.

618
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,439
Papa, Papa. Let me go!

619
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,112
Teresa!

620
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,240
No, Papa, Papa.

621
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:32,718
Teresa!

622
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,237
Teresa!

623
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:35,880
No!

624
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:36,996
Please, please.

625
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,520
Someone please help me,
please. Papa!

626
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,832
Take me, take me.

627
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,797
No, please.

628
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,279
It was all my fault.

629
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,999
What, what did you say?

630
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,399
It was my fault. It was all my fault.

631
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,039
Carlos, once they decided to take her...

632
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,479
it wouldn't have been hard
for them to find her.

633
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,159
At school, at my place,
wherever she was.

634
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,239
Teresa.

635
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,152
Mama! Mama!

636
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,639
Up! Come on, quickly. Not you.

637
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,313
Just the fresh meat this time.

638
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,037
Alright.

639
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,679
We work here by
a very simple principle.

640
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,239
If you know something, sing.

641
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:48,718
If not...

642
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,438
Suffer.

643
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:11,672
First thing is for you
and me to get to know each other.

644
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,117
Senor Rueda! Senor Rueda!

645
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,319
No, it's okay. I know this man.

646
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:09,912
How are you?

647
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,516
He's taking you for a walk? Goodnight.

648
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,319
Oh, my lovely girl.
How are you, darling?

649
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,879
It's so good to see you.

650
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,472
How was your day?

651
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,191
Teresa.

652
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,511
Cecilia.

653
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,679
Teresa. Cecilia.

654
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,320
Teresa. Cecilia. Teresa Cecilia

655
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,639
They'll close us down. I know it.

656
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,039
Why do you insist on
courting disaster?

657
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,559
I agree with Carlos.

658
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,473
You do? What a surprise.

659
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,397
What's the matter?

660
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,439
Maybe you're right.

661
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,519
Oh, please. Stop agreeing with me

662
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,113
or I would not know where I am.

663
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,359
Right, it's very important today.

664
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,077
Okay?

665
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,711
There they are coming
into the 3rd row.

666
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,390
Well, I'd be worried
if they hadn't send anybody.

667
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,000
Do you think they'll notice.

668
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,950
Break a leg!

669
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,037
Alright, places.

670
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,478
Good luck.

671
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,439
Red Death had long
devastated the country.

672
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,159
No pestilence had ever
been so fatal or so hideous.

673
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,439
Scarlet stains upon the body
and face of the victim

674
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,717
Shut him out from the aid
and sympathy of his fellow men.

675
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,999
But the Prince Prospero was happy.

676
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,039
He summoned to his presence
a thousand light-hearted friends...

677
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,119
and retired to one of his
castellated abbeys.

678
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,519
Towards the 5 or 6 month
of his seclusion...

679
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,199
While the pestilence raged
most furiously abroad...

680
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,999
Prince Prospero entertained
his thousand friends...

681
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,200
At a masked ball of the
most unusual magnificence.

682
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,790
Who are you?

683
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,750
Seize that man.

684
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:57,877
Silvio?

685
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,477
Silvio?

686
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,680
They've taken Silvio.

687
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,319
I told them.

688
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,279
I said there must be some mistake.

689
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,439
That he is not interested in politics

690
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,591
but it was his name on the list.

691
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,159
Why didn't they take me?

692
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,153
I wanted them to take me.
Motherfuckers!

693
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,992
Fuck! Shit!

694
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,959
Carlos, they've closed us down.

695
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,032
In the interest of public morals,
they've closed us down.

696
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,554
I will have to see if they'll
give me back my old job.

697
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,630
What will you do?

698
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,475
I'll find something.

699
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,550
I have known him since I was a child.

700
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,840
We were lovers for a while.

701
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,159
3 or 4 years ago.

702
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:55,911
I know.

703
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,478
Can you see what happened to him?

704
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,278
Ask me tonight in the garden.

705
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:40,399
I have a colleague called Silvio Ayala.

706
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,279
He's the technical director
of the children's theatre.

707
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,280
They came today

708
01:17:45,281 --> 01:17:47,670
and they took him from his office.

709
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,999
They are holding Silvio in the basement

710
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,354
of the Naval Mechanics School.

711
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,399
They have blindfolded
him for no reason...

712
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,394
Except to disorient him
and increase his fear.

713
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,559
He has already decided to say
whatever it is they want to hear.

714
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,110
To denounce everybody,
anything to stop the pain.

715
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,879
It will be more than a week

716
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,239
before they take him along...

717
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,679
to the room at the end of the corridor.

718
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,279
And in that time a strange thing

719
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,919
will happen to Silvio.

720
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,954
He will become angry.

721
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,999
So angry that whatever they do to him

722
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,593
he will never say a word.

723
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:47,359
Finally, in about a month,

724
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,396
they will give up on him.

725
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,000
I am Silvio Ayala. An Argentinean.

726
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,231
I'm sorry.

727
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,189
Really. I'm sorry, Esme.

728
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,639
The minute you spoke his name
I knew there was nothing

729
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,676
I could do for him.

730
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,631
I knew.

731
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,079
Would you mind walking a little way?

732
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:51,592
No.

733
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:58,999
Are you Avrom?

734
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,119
Yes. Do I know you?

735
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,679
I spent some time with
your parents at L'Esperanza.

736
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,839
Oh, you are Carlos Rueda?

737
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,400
That's right.

738
01:20:07,401 --> 01:20:09,919
My mother wrote to me about you.

739
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,559
Walk home with me.

740
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,240
Sure.

741
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:15,079
It's only a few streets away,

742
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,439
and I'll make you some coffee.

743
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,719
Thank you.

744
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,039
The time I spent with
your parents was amazing.

745
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,559
I thought maybe
I imagined the whole thing.

746
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,950
Oh no. They are very, very real.

747
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,797
What's the matter?

748
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,280
What is that?

749
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,316
The shoe?

750
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,919
How long has it been here?

751
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,919
She put it up sometime last year.

752
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,759
I must speak to her.

753
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,717
- Carlos, it's after midnight.
- It's very important.

754
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:40,951
Yes.

755
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,799
The shoe, senora.

756
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,399
What about the shoe?

757
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,559
The woman it belonged to.

758
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,639
What did she say
when they took her away?

759
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,597
What she said was Carlos

760
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,359
Are you Carlos?

761
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,237
Yes.

762
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,316
She's my wife.

763
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,196
Then you ought to take the shoe.

764
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,995
She's still alive.

765
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:25,960
Mama.

766
01:22:25,961 --> 01:22:26,996
Silencio

767
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,192
Sir.

768
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,790
I've decided.

769
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,399
It's time to pass your daughter on,

770
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,197
but to whom?

771
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,556
So I thought it was only fair
to leave the choice to you.

772
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,359
Choose.

773
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,119
I'm not going to choose.

774
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,959
You're here to be punished.

775
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,599
Choosing is part of your punishment.

776
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,399
Let them take me.

777
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,999
They're bored with you.

778
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,599
And I'm bored with her,

779
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,557
so there's really no alternative.

780
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:48,953
Hey!

781
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,876
I'm waiting.

782
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,039
Alright. Duarte, you take her.

783
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,397
Be strong.

784
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:40,319
We want them back alive
They took them alive

785
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:48,193
Let them say where the missing are

786
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,470
We want them back alive

787
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,516
We want them back alive
They took them alive

788
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,150
No, no, no.

789
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,119
No, no no no no

790
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:31,239
No, no, no!

791
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,950
No, no.

792
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,676
She's gone.

793
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,719
I suddenly understood, Esme.
Don't ask me how.

794
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,199
That if I killed myself I was
condemning her to death.

795
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,919
So I fought my way back to the shore.

796
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,799
And when the time comes,

797
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,315
you'll know when,
ask me your question.

798
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,079
Cecilia Rueda was taken from

799
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:59,759
this house on May 23, 1976.

800
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,399
Her husband found her glasses

801
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,754
on the bedroom floor.

802
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,879
Take her away.

803
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,719
Yes, sir.

804
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,110
Bring me number... 17

805
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,791
Goal!

806
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,074
They were very hard on you.

807
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,197
Are you able to
spend the night with me?

808
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,037
I'm very lonely.

809
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,479
I can't stay all night.

810
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,790
I just want someone
to hold me for a while.

811
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,519
No. Turn your back.

812
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,119
But I'd like to undress you.

813
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,719
Otherwise it's like all the others.

814
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,471
All right.

815
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,439
This must be our last meeting.

816
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,799
Things are changing very fast.

817
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,479
And I want you to think
about those Generals...

818
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,559
who will never be troubled

819
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,479
by those who have disappeared.

820
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,879
Or care that to many of us

821
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,839
they have left nothing

822
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,320
but a remembered face.

823
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:14,079
Soon, they will be trying
to forget these years.

824
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,799
Pretending they never happened at all.

825
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:23,876
So, it will be up to us
to keep the truth alive.

826
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,313
They know their days are numbered

827
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,597
So they are emptying the prisons

828
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,951
and burying the bodies
and destroying the records.

829
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,159
They are inviting the foreign journalists

830
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,519
and the human rights people.

831
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:49,759
And saying, look, the press is free,
and the theatres are open.

832
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,559
And there is a carnival in
the streets and it is all over.

833
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,599
And what they really mean...

834
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,560
Is that it will only
be over until the next time.

835
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,071
Good night.

836
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,439
I don't think we should
have these repaired.

837
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,274
I want them to remember.

838
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,157
So we'll start again with the Orfeo?

839
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,599
Well first I would like
to do some rewriting.

840
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,636
Does it need it?

841
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:36,991
Orfeo!

842
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,078
Orfeo!

843
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,119
I think I want to give it a happy ending.

844
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,559
Like in Monteverdi's opera, remember?

845
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,799
In the end the Gods forgive him,
and bring him back his wife.

846
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,756
Why don't we try that?

847
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,314
Which one would you like?

848
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,631
All of them.

849
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,358
Carlos!

850
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,510
Carlos!

851
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:07,592
Never again!.
