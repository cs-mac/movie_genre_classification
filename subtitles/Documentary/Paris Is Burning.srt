1
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,333
She's ready to...

2
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:29,370
<i>Right?</i>

3
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,048
<i>I'm... I remember</i>
<i>my dad used to say,</i>

4
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,617
<i>"you have three strikes</i>
<i>against you in this world.</i>

5
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,285
<i>"Every black man has two...</i>

6
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:46,122
<i>"that they're just black,</i>
<i>and they're a male.</i>

7
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:49,359
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>a hard  time."</i>

8
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:51,595
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"if you're gonna do this,</i>

9
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:56,067
<i>than you ever imagined."</i>

10
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:08,381
May have to open the door.

11
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:11,050
Y'all have to open
that door, too.

12
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:42,486
<i>Get off the floor.</i>

13
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:45,323
<i>Get off the floor!</i>

14
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:47,225
<i>Learn it,</i>

15
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:51,162
<i>and learn it well.</i>

16
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:00,573
All right, miss Heather!

17
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,642
Ohhh!

18
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:21,229
<i>Girl, give me those</i>
<i>mother heel!</i>

19
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,278
Do you want me to say
who I am and all of that?

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,316
"I'm Pepper Labeija,
and I'm..."

21
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,718
<i>I am Pepper Labeija,</i>

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,224
the legendary mother
of the house of Labeija.

23
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:47,793
Not the founder...
crystal was the founder.

24
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:50,463
I... I just rule it now...

25
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:53,366
With a soft glove.

26
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:55,202
And it's important
to me to be the mother,

27
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:58,171
'cause there's so many little
kids that I have to look out for.

28
00:02:58,173 --> 00:02:59,574
Although they
don't listen to me,

29
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,742
and they buck my authority,

30
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,578
I still think
I rule it pretty well.

31
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,612
They like me.

32
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,648
I'm one of
the more popular ones,

33
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,384
and I've been around
for two decades...

34
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,853
reigning, that is.

35
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:13,522
You know, I've got more
grand prizes than all the rest.

36
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:21,231
<i>Gay people... men...</i>

37
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:28,339
<i>and decide to have a</i>
<i>competition amongst themselves.</i>

38
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,675
<i>Balls.</i>

39
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,546
<i>I went to a ball.</i>
<i>I got a trophy.</i>

40
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,851
<i>And now everybody</i>
<i>wants to know me.</i>

41
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,622
<i>This movie is about</i>
<i>the ball circuit</i>

42
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:45,492
<i>and the gay people</i>
<i>that's involved in it</i>

43
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:51,532
and how each person's life
brought them to this circuit.

44
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:55,303
It's like crossing into the
looking glass in wonderland.

45
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:59,909
You go in there, and you feel...
you feel 100% right...

46
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:01,377
as... of being gay.

47
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,812
And that's not what
it's like in the world.

48
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:05,381
That's not what it's like
in the world.

49
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:06,917
That's not what it's like
in the world.

50
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,452
You know, it should be
like that in the world.

51
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:11,755
This society, going to
a football game, basketball...

52
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:13,390
that's their entertainment.

53
00:04:13,392 --> 00:04:15,626
You know, a ball is ours.
We prepare for a ball.

54
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:17,562
We may spend more time
preparing for a ball

55
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:20,398
than anybody would spend
preparing for anything else.

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,434
You know,
a ball is like our world.

57
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,569
The balls, to us,

58
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,572
is as close to reality
as we're gonna get

59
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:28,807
to all of that fame and fortune

60
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,877
and stardom and spotlights.

61
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,913
<i>I'd always see the way</i>
<i>that rich people lived.</i>

62
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,249
<i>And I'd feel it more,</i>
<i>you know...</i>

63
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,551
it would slap me in the face.

64
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,486
<i>I'd say,</i>
<i>"I'd have to have that."</i>

65
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,488
<i>Because I never felt</i>
<i>comfortable being poor.</i>

66
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,628
<i>Or even middle class</i>
<i>doesn't suit me.</i>

67
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,663
<i>Seeing the riches,</i>

68
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:52,868
<i>seeing the way people</i>
<i>on "dynasty" lived...</i>

69
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,638
<i>And I would think,</i>

70
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,573
<i>"these people have 42 rooms</i>
<i>in their house.</i>

71
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,610
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>What kind of a house is that?"</i>

72
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,311
<i>And we've got three.</i>

73
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:03,347
<i>So why is it that</i>
<i>they can have it and I didn't?</i>

74
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:06,583
<i>I always felt cheated</i>
<i>out of things like that.</i>

75
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:10,622
<i>You have space to do</i>
<i>all that you intend to.</i>

76
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,690
<i>Now, the categories are...</i>

77
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:16,929
<i>butch queen, 1 through 17.</i>

78
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:20,499
<i>And for the girls,</i>
<i>18 through 30.</i>

79
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,769
As far as
all of y'all not walking,

80
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:26,606
please realize that we all...
at one time or another...

81
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:30,511
<i>have lusted to walk</i>
<i>a ballroom floor.</i>

82
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,980
<i>So give the patrons</i>
<i>and the contestants, you know,</i>

83
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,816
<i>a round of applause for nerve.</i>

84
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,053
'Cause with y'all
vicious mother,

85
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:40,055
it do take nerve.

86
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,456
Believe me.

87
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,859
We're not going to be shady,
<i>just fierce.</i>

88
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,662
Those balls are more or less
like our fantasy

89
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:47,864
of being a superstar.

90
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,666
You know, like the oscars
or whatever.

91
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:52,703
Or being on a runway
as a model.

92
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,605
You know, a lot of those kids
that are in the balls,

93
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:56,740
they don't have two of nothing.

94
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:59,043
Some of them don't even eat.

95
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,845
They come to balls starving.

96
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,782
<i>And they sleep</i>
<i>in the under-21,</i>

97
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:06,584
<i>or they sleep on the pier</i>
<i>or wherever.</i>

98
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:07,987
<i>They don't have</i>
<i>a home to go to.</i>

99
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,689
But they'll go out,
and they'll steal something

100
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:11,791
and get dressed up and come
to a ball for that one night

101
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:13,859
and live the fantasy.

102
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:18,498
<i>A ball is the very word...</i>

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,669
<i>whatever you want to be,</i>
<i>you be.</i>

104
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:24,772
So at a ball, you have a chance
to display your arrogance,

105
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:27,375
<i>your seductiveness,</i>
<i>your beauty, your wit,</i>

106
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:30,646
<i>You can become anything</i>
<i>and do anything</i>

107
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:35,351
<i>right here, right now,</i>
<i>and it won't be questioned.</i>

108
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:40,023
<i>I came. I saw. I conquered.</i>

109
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,859
<i>Give her what she want.</i>

110
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,895
<i>She'll bring it to you</i>
<i>every ball.</i>

111
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:47,465
<i>Why y'all gagging so?</i>

112
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:48,999
I guess I like
the excitement.

113
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:53,839
You know, it's them cheering
and screaming if you were good.

114
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:57,142
And that's what got me,
'cause I like the competition.

115
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:59,479
Makes me stronger.

116
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:01,581
It makes me think more.

117
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,418
Makes me want to come back
and get them.

118
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,454
It's not just the winning.

119
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:10,858
It's... it's the giving, too.

120
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,429
'Cause I feel that I give
a lot of enjoyment

121
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,664
to a lot of people
that go to balls.

122
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,733
And they enjoy to see it,
and I enjoy to walk for them.

123
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:24,874
So that's my... Philosophy,
<i>as I should say.</i>

124
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,676
<i>To be legendary is like...</i>

125
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:29,111
their goal is to be legendary.

126
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:31,848
You know, let you know,
"I'm legendary, you're not."

127
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,851
That's... you know,
it feels good to them.

128
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,453
An Oscar.
A Oscar, right.

129
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,855
<i>It's the same thing.</i>
<i>You know?</i>

130
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,557
<i>Become a legend...</i>
<i>you have an Oscar.</i>

131
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,492
<i>It's the same thing.</i>

132
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,063
<i>I don't really</i>
<i>consider myself a real legend.</i>

133
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,801
I... I've been at the balls
with the legendary children,

134
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:51,771
and I've stamped myself
with the legendary children.

135
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,106
But I'm really...

136
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:54,908
I'm one of top,
upcoming children... legendary.

137
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,910
<i>You have legendary children</i>

138
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:58,812
<i>and upcoming legendary children.
Right.</i>

139
00:07:58,814 --> 00:07:59,914
<i>We're the upcoming ones.</i>

140
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,081
<i>We've been out longer</i>

141
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,883
<i>than the ones</i>
<i>that are here now.</i>

142
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:06,587
And we done had our... we have
our status in the ballroom.

143
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:14,129
How long did it take you
to do the tank top?

144
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:17,767
An hour?
<i>Yes.</i>

145
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,168
You don't do that.

146
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,805
It usually doesn't take you
an hour to do a shirt,

147
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,575
especially a tank top?

148
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:27,478
Mnh-mnh.
That's not your speed.

149
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,879
<i>Kim pendavis!</i>

150
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,983
<i>Statement... future legend.</i>

151
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,656
Kim and me have...
we've been together...

152
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:38,791
and it's more or less me,

153
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:42,094
I'm the one
that's Kim's protége,

154
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,698
because I go with Kim
to the balls,

155
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,966
help him out, help him iron.

156
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:48,168
'Cause if I don't go
to a ball with him and iron,

157
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,803
I mean, he'll be here wrinkled.

158
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:52,707
<i>Or he'd be there ironing.</i>

159
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,575
<i>But, you know,</i>

160
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,545
it helps out when somebody else
is there in your corner,

161
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,515
at your side,
to say, "yeah, you can do it."

162
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:00,782
"You're gonna be fine.

163
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:03,085
Just go out there and do
what you usually do."

164
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:09,092
<i>Just simple, you know,</i>
<i>joy and satisfaction.</i>

165
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:13,530
<i>you know,</i>
<i>I don't really ask much.</i>

166
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:15,966
And then, from time to time,
later on I can wear the outfit.

167
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:19,303
Yeah!

168
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,671
Work!

169
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:32,652
<i>Liz Taylor is famous...</i>

170
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:35,788
<i>So is Pepper Labeija.</i>

171
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:42,829
<i>In a sense, so am I.</i>

172
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:47,769
<i>But a very much</i>
<i>different quantity.</i>

173
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:52,274
<i>No magazine's gonna run up to
cover me if I go to a premier.</i>

174
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,077
<i>But it's still a fame.</i>

175
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,111
It's a small fame.

176
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:59,649
But you absorb,
and you take it.

177
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,318
And you like it.

178
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,654
You like the adulation,
the applause...

179
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:06,924
The people cheering you on...

180
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,593
The winning.

181
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:11,095
It's like, uh, a physical high.

182
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:14,633
It's... you know,
it's a good high.

183
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:18,136
It's an addictive high,
like all highs...

184
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,305
in the long run...
turn out to be.

185
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:24,644
But it's a high
that won't hurt you.

186
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:29,015
If everybody went to balls
and did less drugs,

187
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:31,685
it'd be a fun world,
wouldn't it?

188
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:34,855
I'm dressing, of course,
to go do a show.

189
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:37,692
Because I've always
done this professionally.

190
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:39,094
And I was a dancer.

191
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:43,031
And I'm trying to remember
when the first time I went to

192
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,767
a ball.

193
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,705
That was the early-type ball,
when everybody just walked,

194
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:52,042
<i>and they gave away,</i>
<i>like, four or five prizes</i>

195
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:55,112
<i>in a very limited category.</i>

196
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,415
And the children now...
most of them...

197
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:01,386
75% of the children
you see at the ball

198
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:04,956
wouldn't know what a ball was
if it knocked them in the head.

199
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,027
When I first started
<i>going to balls,</i>

200
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,194
it was all about drag queens,

201
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:10,996
and they were interested
in looking like

202
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,831
Las Vegas show girls...

203
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,301
backpieces, tailpieces,
feathers, beads, and all that.

204
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:19,239
But as the '70s rolled around,
the thing started changing.

205
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,774
It started coming down

206
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,443
to just wanting to look like
a gorgeous movie star,

207
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:24,145
like Marilyn Monroe,
Elizabeth Taylor.

208
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:27,114
And now they've went from that
to trying to look like models

209
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:29,250
like Iman and Christie Brinkley

210
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:30,819
and maud Adams
and all those children.

211
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:33,689
Everyone couldn't be
a Las Vegas show girl.

212
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:35,357
<i>Everyone couldn't put on</i>
<i>a stack of feathers</i>

213
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,893
<i>and a big headpiece.</i>

214
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,896
So they made the categories
<i>where everybody...</i>

215
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,765
<i>that's what really made</i>
<i>the balls change.</i>

216
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,100
<i>So there was more involvement.</i>

217
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:47,004
Everyone that goes to one of
<i>these affairs now</i>

218
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,440
<i>damn near participates.</i>

219
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,041
Eventually, over the course
<i>of a year's balls,</i>

220
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,913
they've all walked the runway

221
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,147
in some category or another.

222
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,983
Either you've got a nice body

223
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,987
or you are very fashionable

224
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,055
<i>or you're very pretty</i>

225
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:06,092
or you're very real-looking.

226
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:09,763
But there's always something
<i>there for everyone.</i>

227
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:14,367
<i>And it's like...</i>
<i>it's like in nature...</i>

228
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,504
<i>I'm such a nature fan...</i>

229
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:19,140
the young ones are always
bucking to move the...

230
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:21,175
the old bulls out of the way.

231
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:25,013
<i>go through</i>
<i>all these mad categories</i>

232
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,315
<i>that I never can</i>
<i>stay awake for.</i>

233
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,320
<i>Upcoming pretty girl... 1986.</i>

234
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:32,155
<i>Take it to the floor.</i>

235
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:34,457
<i>They're showing off</i>
<i>for the press.</i>

236
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,395
<i>Audience, please back up</i>
<i>and give them air!</i>

237
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,001
Next category... high fashion
winter sportswear,

238
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,872
the poconos
versus the catskills.

239
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:50,909
<i>is there anyone walking?</i>

240
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:53,112
Some children were asking me

241
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,814
what I meant
by "miss cheesecake."

242
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,250
That means you must
not only have a body,

243
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:01,188
but you must be sexy.

244
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:18,040
Going to school.

245
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,308
School.

246
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,343
<i>Elementary.</i>

247
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:24,247
<i>College.</i>

248
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:27,317
<i>Not here.</i>

249
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:28,418
School.

250
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,930
<i>Looking like a girl</i>
<i>going to school.</i>

251
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:41,233
<i>Do she look like a girl</i>
<i>going to school?</i>

252
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:47,507
<i>Town and country.</i>

253
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:50,176
<i>Exclusively done.</i>

254
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:54,949
Dupree! Dupree! Dupree!

255
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,183
<i>...get into their suits.</i>

256
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:59,554
I said, the well-dressed men
<i>of the '80s,</i>

257
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:03,124
<i>get into the suits</i>
<i>and get into the pumps.</i>

258
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:06,996
<i>In real life, you can't</i>
<i>get a job as an executive</i>

259
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:09,532
<i>unless you have</i>
<i>the educational background</i>

260
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,534
<i>and the opportunity.</i>

261
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:13,603
Now, the fact that
you are not an executive

262
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:17,274
is merely because of
the social standing of life.

263
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:18,876
That is just pure thing.

264
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:21,578
Black people have a hard time
getting anywhere.

265
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,116
And those that do
are usually straight.

266
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:28,453
<i>In a ballroom, you can be</i>
<i>anything you want.</i>

267
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:32,191
<i>but you're looking like</i>
<i>an executive.</i>

268
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,093
And therefore you're showing
the straight world that

269
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,895
"I can be an executive.

270
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:38,131
"If I had the opportunity,
I could be one,

271
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,000
because I can look like one."

272
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,135
<i>And that is like a fulfillment.</i>

273
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,337
<i>Your peers,</i>
<i>your friends are telling you,</i>

274
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,543
<i>Is this the businessman</i>
<i>of the '80s or what?</i>

275
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:53,548
<i>High-fashion Parisian.</i>
<i>Model's yvette.</i>

276
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,450
<i>Chanté, chante.</i>

277
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:58,253
<i>Chanté, chante, chanté,</i>
<i>chanté, chante.</i>

278
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:01,424
<i>Model!</i>

279
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,560
<i>Thin! Streamlined!</i>

280
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,529
<i>Trim!</i>

281
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,965
<i>Model!</i>

282
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,934
<i>The category is...</i>

283
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,337
You know what I mean!

284
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:15,674
You know what Paris means.

285
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:17,275
Exactly!
Butch queen!

286
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:18,343
Butch queen.

287
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:19,244
Butch queen!

288
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:21,646
Butch queen.
Butch!

289
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:26,152
First time in drag at a ball...
that's what I wanted for me.

290
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:35,696
<i>The military scene</i>
<i>is a basic scene.</i>

291
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:37,098
<i>It doesn't call for</i>

292
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,734
a bunch of
flamboyant Turkey boas

293
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:42,603
and bugle beads, rhinestone.

294
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:45,641
<i>It's a basic category.</i>

295
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:48,077
<i>The more natural you are,</i>

296
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,547
<i>the more credit</i>
<i>your outfit is given.</i>

297
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:54,250
<i>Come on, now,</i>
<i>it is a known fact</i>

298
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:58,088
<i>that a woman do carry</i>
<i>an evening bag at dinnertime.</i>

299
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,158
<i>There's no getting around that.</i>

300
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,997
<i>between "all my children"</i>
<i>and "jeopardy!"...</i>

301
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,033
<i>"Another world," "Dallas,"</i>
<i>and the whole bit.</i>

302
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,735
<i>A evening bag is a must.</i>

303
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:14,707
You have to carry something.
No lady is sure at night.

304
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,777
With the current children...
the children that are young...

305
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,780
they've gone
to television, you know?

306
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:24,084
I've been to several balls,

307
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:27,187
and they've actually
had categories...

308
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,256
"dynasty"...

309
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:33,695
you know, want you to look
like Alexis or Krystle.

310
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:41,437
And I guess that's just, um,
a statement of the times.

311
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:44,407
When I grew up, you wanted to
look like Marlene Dietrich,

312
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,742
Betty grable.

313
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,712
Fortunately, I didn't know

314
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:52,049
that I really wanted to look
like Lena horne.

315
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,153
When I grew up, of course,
you know...

316
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:59,424
Black stars were stigmatized.

317
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:03,162
Nobody wanted to look
like Lena horne.

318
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:07,200
Everybody wanted to look
like Marilyn Monroe.

319
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,285
<i>When you're a man</i>
<i>and a woman,</i>

320
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,187
<i>you can do anything.</i>

321
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,421
<i>You can... you can almost</i>
<i>have sex on the streets</i>

322
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,824
<i>if you want to.</i>

323
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:31,227
<i>The most somebody will say is,</i>
<i>"hey, get a hump for me."</i>

324
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:35,398
<i>But when you're gay,</i>
<i>you monitor everything you do.</i>

325
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,768
You monitor how you look,
<i>how you dress,</i>

326
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,703
how you talk, how you act.

327
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:43,874
<i>"Did they see me?</i>
<i>What did they think of me?"</i>

328
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,652
<i>To be able to blend.</i>

329
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:56,856
<i>That's what realness is.</i>

330
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,199
<i>If you can pass</i>
<i>the untrained eye...</i>

331
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:08,302
or even the trained eye...

332
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,872
<i>and not give away</i>
<i>the fact that you're gay,</i>

333
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:12,707
<i>that's when it's realness.</i>

334
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:13,908
Fangie.

335
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,310
Looking like the boy
that probably robbed you

336
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,847
a few minutes before
you came to Paris' ball.

337
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:25,788
<i>The idea of realness</i>
<i>is to look as much as possible</i>

338
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,224
<i>like your straight counterpart.</i>

339
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:30,361
Shake the dice
and steal the rice!

340
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:31,729
Right here.
Come on, baby.

341
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:34,265
Yes, daddy.

342
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:36,233
I got my food stamps
and card waiting.

343
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:37,569
All right.

344
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,905
Dust, coke, base,
soap, rolaids... he got it.

345
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:42,774
<i>The realer you look,</i>

346
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:45,811
<i>it means you look like</i>
<i>a real woman.</i>

347
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,748
<i>Or you look like a real man...</i>

348
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,319
<i>A straight man.</i>

349
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:57,858
<i>Sweetheart,</i>
<i>with the cigarette,</i>

350
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,428
you're giving me
a banji girl effect.

351
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,864
This is banji.

352
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:04,899
You know, the girls
that be on the corner

353
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:06,467
talking about your man.

354
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:07,803
One that can hang out
<i>with the roughest...</i>

355
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:12,274
<i>It's not a takeoff</i>
<i>or a satire.</i>

356
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,612
<i>No, it's actually being</i>
<i>able to be this.</i>

357
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,648
Brenda Xtravaganza.

358
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,386
Looking like a banji girl.

359
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:22,987
Banji.

360
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,855
Banji girl realness.

361
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:27,858
You know, one that can take her
<i>little baby brother to school.</i>

362
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,660
One that say,
"you know, like, um, hey.

363
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:31,630
I saw a bunch of those things
walking down the street."

364
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:36,868
<i>It's really a case of
going back into the closet.</i>

365
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,838
10! 10!

366
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,673
10! 10!

367
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:42,375
Are there any more?

368
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:45,312
Okay, girls,
have we come to a decision?

369
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,914
<i>They give the society</i>
<i>that they live in</i>

370
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:52,520
<i>Rather than have to go through</i>
<i>prejudices about your life</i>

371
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:53,755
<i>and your lifestyle,</i>

372
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,724
<i>you can</i>
<i>walk around confidently,</i>

373
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:57,726
<i>blending in</i>
<i>with everybody else.</i>

374
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:00,296
<i>You've erased all the mistakes,</i>

375
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,698
<i>all the flaws,</i>
<i>all the giveaways</i>

376
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,001
<i>to make your illusion perfect.</i>

377
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,338
Bernie... Diane...

378
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,674
<i>My mother knew</i>
<i>I had trophies,</i>

379
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,743
but I was telling her
I won them for basketball.

380
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,444
<i>And I had won trophies</i>
<i>for running track.</i>

381
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,849
I was walking up 145th street
<i>with my girlfriends.</i>

382
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:21,386
I had on white hot pants,
<i>a chiffon blouse,</i>

383
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,721
a pony tail.

384
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,957
And my father was waiting
for the light in his car.

385
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,925
And he saw me.
He recognized me.

386
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:30,063
And he went straight to my house
before I could get there

387
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,032
and told my mother,

388
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:33,366
<i>"your son is a woman."</i>

389
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:36,069
She didn't press it then.

390
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,938
But, like,
maybe a few months later

391
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,608
when she noticed
that I had breasts,

392
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,344
everything started
coming together.

393
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:45,781
She really was devastated.

394
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:47,015
"How could you have breasts
bigger than mine?

395
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:49,084
"You're growing nails.

396
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,920
"You're becoming a woman
right before my very eyes.

397
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,523
"I can't hold my head up.

398
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,392
<i>And she still loved me,</i>

399
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:57,960
but the nagging and the...

400
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:01,498
oh, my God,
about this women's clothes.

401
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,401
And when I had women's clothes
stashed in my closet

402
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:06,537
and she found them,
she would destroy them.

403
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,939
She burnt up a mink coat.

404
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:10,675
I was, oh... Devastated.

405
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,844
She smelled the perfume
in it that I liked to wear...

406
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,679
which was jungle gardenia
<i>at the time...</i>

407
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:17,516
and she said, "this ain't no girl's coat.
This is your coat."

408
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:20,386
Took it downstairs
in the backyard of the building

409
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:21,687
and burned it.

410
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:22,889
And I stood there and cried
like a baby.

411
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:25,992
As long I have the mustache
and all that,

412
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,494
it's cute for me.

413
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,829
She don't want me being
in no girls' clothes.

414
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,432
She can't take it.

415
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:35,002
<i>When they're undetectable...</i>

416
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:36,904
<i>when they can walk</i>
<i>out of that ballroom</i>

417
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:39,475
<i>into the sunlight</i>
<i>and onto the subway</i>

418
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:42,144
and get home and still have
<i>all their clothes</i>

419
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:45,048
<i>and no blood running</i>
<i>off their bodies...</i>

420
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,618
<i>those are</i>
<i>the femme realness queens.</i>

421
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,690
And usually it's a category
<i>for young queens.</i>

422
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:55,559
Some of them say
that we're sick,

423
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,794
we're crazy.

424
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,396
And some of them think

425
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:01,933
that we are the most gorgeous,
special things on earth.

426
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,107
<i>I would like to be</i>
<i>a spoiled, rich white girl.</i>

427
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,710
<i>They get what they want,</i>

428
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:12,111
<i>whenever they want it.</i>

429
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:16,617
And they don't have to really
struggle with finances

430
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,186
<i>and nice things</i>
<i>and nice clothes.</i>

431
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:22,957
<i>And they don't have to</i>
<i>have that as a problem.</i>

432
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:27,162
I don't feel that there's
anything mannish about me,

433
00:22:27,164 --> 00:22:30,933
except maybe what I might have
between me down there,

434
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:34,470
Which is
my little personal thing, so...

435
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:36,939
<i>I guess that's why</i>
<i>I want my sex change...</i>

436
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:39,843
<i>to make myself complete.</i>

437
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:42,546
I was about 13, 14 years old,

438
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:45,583
<i>and I used to do it</i>
<i>behind my family's back...</i>

439
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:48,753
<i>till finally</i>
<i>they caught on with it.</i>

440
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:50,555
<i>And I didn't want to</i>
<i>embarrass them,</i>

441
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,791
so that's when I moved away.

442
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:57,729
<i>I moved to New York,</i>
<i>and I continued doing it.</i>

443
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,501
When someone has rejection

444
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:03,136
from their mother and father,
their family,

445
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:07,240
they... when they get out
in the world, they search.

446
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:09,143
They search for someone
to fill that void.

447
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,612
I know this for experience,

448
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:16,518
because I've had kids come to me
and latch hold to me

449
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,021
like I'm their mother
or like I'm their father.

450
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,125
'Cause they can talk to me,
and I'm gay, and they're gay.

451
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:25,862
And that's where
a lot of that "ballness"

452
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,831
and... and the mother
business comes in.

453
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:33,003
Because their real parents
give them such a hard way to go,

454
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:38,009
they look up to me
to fill that void.

455
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,012
<i>How old are you?</i>

456
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,780
I'm 15.

457
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:44,682
What time is it?

458
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:46,685
Right here, homeboy.
Look at the time over there.

459
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,721
2:26. And y'all...
how old are you?

460
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:49,755
Me? I'm 13.

461
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:51,223
13?! And you're
out here at 2:26?

462
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:52,258
Yeah.
Where you live?

463
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,793
Me, I live in Harlem.

464
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:55,529
And why you down here?
Where's your mother?

465
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:57,130
Hanging out.
I don't have a mother.

466
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,533
Everybody has a mother,
or we wouldn't be here.

467
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:01,035
Where's your mother?
She's gone.

468
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:03,070
Where's your father?
He's gone, too.

469
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,272
So who you live with?

470
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:05,239
With a friend.

471
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,274
And you too?

472
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:07,676
I live with my mother
in the Bronx.

473
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:08,877
And y'all just hanging
out like this at...

474
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:11,013
Just hanging out.
Right there inside.

475
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:15,585
<i>they come from such</i>
<i>sad backgrounds, you know -</i>

476
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,954
<i>broken homes or no home at all.</i>

477
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,622
And then the few
that do have family,

478
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,090
when the family finds
that they're gay,

479
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,027
they "X" them completely.

480
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,630
<i>A house?</i>

481
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:30,001
<i>Let's see if we can</i>
<i>put it down sharply.</i>

482
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:32,671
<i>They're families.</i>
<i>You can say that.</i>

483
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:37,075
<i>For a lot of children</i>
<i>who don't have families.</i>

484
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,981
But this is a new meaning
<i>of "family."</i>

485
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:43,282
The hippies had families,

486
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:45,886
<i>and no one thought</i>
<i>nothing about it.</i>

487
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:48,322
<i>It wasn't a question of</i>
<i>a man and a woman and children,</i>

488
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:51,358
<i>which we grew up knowing</i>
<i>as a family.</i>

489
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,831
<i>It's a question of a group of</i>
<i>human beings in a mutual bond.</i>

490
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:10,914
You know what a house is?

491
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,016
<i>I'll tell you what a house is.</i>

492
00:25:13,018 --> 00:25:16,253
<i>A house is a gay street gang.</i>

493
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:19,223
<i>Now, where street gangs</i>
<i>get their rewards</i>

494
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:21,292
<i>from street fights,</i>

495
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:25,230
a gay house street-fights
<i>at a ball.</i>

496
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:30,737
<i>And you street-fight at a ball</i>
<i>by walking in the categories.</i>

497
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:39,246
<i>The houses started</i>
<i>because you wanted a name.</i>

498
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:42,249
The people that the houses
<i>are named after</i>

499
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:48,123
<i>were ball walkers</i>
<i>who became known for winning.</i>

500
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:53,295
<i>Work... Paris... Dupree.</i>

501
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:57,266
<i>After the first</i>
<i>few houses were started</i>

502
00:25:57,268 --> 00:25:59,268
<i>and named after people</i>
<i>who had won trophies,</i>

503
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,204
<i>they also would create houses.</i>

504
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:04,408
Like, a new group of kids
would just create a house,

505
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,310
then they'd work at building
its name up, which worked...

506
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:09,347
the house of Xtravaganza,
the house of Saint Laurent.

507
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,916
Overness.

508
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,317
Pendavis.

509
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:13,851
Adonis.

510
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:15,788
Lamay.

511
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,756
Pendavis.

512
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:18,724
Saint Laurent, of course.

513
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:24,297
Dupree.

514
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,233
They saw me,
and they all liked me...

515
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:29,836
all the rest
of the Xtravaganzas...

516
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,374
and they decided, "well, if you
want to become an Xtravaganza",

517
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:35,910
"you have to walk
a ball for us.

518
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:37,746
"And if you snatch a trophy,

519
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:39,214
then you can become
the Xtravaganza."

520
00:26:39,216 --> 00:26:43,351
That's how it's supposed to
work with any... everyone.

521
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,288
But, uh...

522
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,322
Like, that wasn't with me.

523
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:50,927
I just became an Xtravaganza.

524
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,497
<i>He's the one who started</i>
<i>the house.</i>

525
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:58,102
<i>He was the first gay man</i>
<i>I ever met.</i>

526
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:00,038
The first time he took me
to the village...

527
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,039
which was my birthday...

528
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,875
I had just turned 15 years old.

529
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:08,347
And he threw a party
for me out there.

530
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:09,949
He bought me a cake.

531
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:13,753
I met a lot of drag queens,
<i>transvestites,</i>

532
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:16,223
that I didn't believe were
because they were so beautiful.

533
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:19,793
<i>And that kind of</i>
<i>sunk into my head.</i>

534
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:21,128
And I guess that's why

535
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,362
it kind of made me
want to even do it more.

536
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:26,033
They treat each other
like sisters, mm-hmm.

537
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:28,369
Sisters...
Or brothers...

538
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:32,374
Or mothers or...

539
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:36,211
You know, like, I say,
"oh, that's my sister,"

540
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,414
because she's gay, too,
and I'm gay,

541
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,885
<i>and she's a drag queen</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

542
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:43,987
My mother
is Angie Xtravaganza,

543
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:47,291
and my father
is David Xtravaganza.

544
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:50,294
The house of Xtravaganza
has done a lot.

545
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:52,798
It's made me feel like
I have a family.

546
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,466
We're always together.
We're always...

547
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:57,936
if we're not together,
we always speak on the phone.

548
00:27:57,938 --> 00:27:59,404
My name is Angie Xtravaganza,

549
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:01,440
and I am the mother
of the house of Xtravaganza.

550
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:04,844
<i>When there's a ball,</i>

551
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:06,546
I'm always doing something
for everybody in my house.

552
00:28:06,548 --> 00:28:08,482
I do that one's hair,
the other one's makeup.

553
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:13,153
<i>Their accessories.</i>
<i>I always offer advice.</i>

554
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:14,922
You know, I mean,
as far as what I know

555
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:17,859
and what I've been through
in gay life.

556
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:19,961
You know, I ran away
from my house when I was 14,

557
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,030
and I've learned all sorts
of things... good and bad.

558
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:26,402
And how to survive in gay world,
you know, it's kind of hard.

559
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,874
Xtravaganza power!

560
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,374
I bought her her tits.

561
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,343
I paid for them.

562
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,451
Our mother even nurses us!

563
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:41,519
She's a good woman.

564
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,062
From the house
of xtravaganza,

565
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,231
for "mother of the year,"

566
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:53,900
keeping her children intact,

567
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:58,371
can we have Angie xtravaganza?

568
00:29:01,643 --> 00:29:03,010
Work for us, girl.

569
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:05,646
Work that runway.

570
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:08,116
This is from
Andre Christian, girl.

571
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:09,618
<i>My birthday will come,</i>

572
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,387
<i>and I always get</i>
<i>a birthday gift from Angie.</i>

573
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:14,923
<i>Won't get one</i>
<i>from my real mother.</i>

574
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:16,359
Like when I got thrown out
<i>of my house,</i>

575
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:20,563
Angie let me stay with her
until I got myself together,

576
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:21,364
<i>and I got working.</i>

577
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,567
<i>She always fed me.</i>

578
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:26,136
She can be a pain in the ass
<i>at times,</i>

579
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:28,058
but I wouldn't trade her in
for any other mother.

580
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:32,176
<i>Ninja.</i>

581
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:34,445
You know, you have to
have something to offer

582
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:36,114
in order to lead.

583
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:40,486
<i>because she's usually</i>
<i>the best one out of the group.</i>

584
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,322
I'm Willi Ninja, the mother
of the House of Ninja.

585
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,458
<i>Give him what he wants!</i>

586
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,461
<i>I am the mother</i>
<i>of the house of Ninja</i>

587
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:52,198
<i>because they say</i>
<i>I'm the best voguer out.</i>

588
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,935
<i>To be the mother of the house,</i>

589
00:29:53,937 --> 00:29:55,536
<i>you have to have</i>
<i>the most power.</i>

590
00:29:55,538 --> 00:29:57,004
<i>Take a real family...</i>

591
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:59,307
<i>it's the mother</i>
<i>that's the hardest worker,</i>

592
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:01,944
<i>and the mother</i>
<i>gets the most respect.</i>

593
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:05,681
As far as my naming my house
"the house of Ninja"...

594
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:09,085
<i>Ninjas hit hard,</i>
<i>they hit fast...</i>

595
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:14,958
<i>And that's what we are.</i>
<i>We come out to assassinate.</i>

596
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,594
The house of Labeija
is <i>the</i> legendary house

597
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,029
above all of them.

598
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:20,965
I have the most members,
I'm the most popular.

599
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:23,702
New York City is wrapped up
in being Labeija.

600
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:26,471
So... It speaks for itself.

601
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:28,139
And I am the fiercest mother
out of all of them.

602
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:29,307
Labeija?

603
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:31,744
I wouldn't be caught dead
in that house.

604
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,245
I'm sorry.
I don't see that house.

605
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:37,016
Only reason I see my house...
pendavis...

606
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:38,518
is because Kim and avis.

607
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,420
'Cause both of them walked.

608
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,590
And at the last ball,
avis showed her goddamn ass off!

609
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:47,028
They call them competitions.

610
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,430
But believe me, they're wars.

611
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:53,135
And they often
do lead to fights.

612
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:54,603
The emotions be very high.

613
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:58,007
They're very intense,
very intense affairs.

614
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:00,042
But I guess
that's what makes them fun.

615
00:31:00,044 --> 00:31:03,580
Like a good movie...
if there's no emotion...

616
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:05,749
You don't enjoy it.

617
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:07,217
I don't talk too much
about the ball kids

618
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:10,688
because I want them to
talk about me.

619
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,456
Because I haven't walked yet.

620
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,059
And it's like,
well, William says,

621
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:17,696
"I want you to walk in my ball.
I want you to walk in my ball."

622
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:20,465
And I keep telling William,
I say, "I'll walk when I walk."

623
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,567
"I'll walk when I want,
not when you want.

624
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:23,803
I'll walk when I want."

625
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:26,672
And so far, I don't know
when I'm gonna walk.

626
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:32,413
I'm thinking somewhat around
the time of the legends ball.

627
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:34,081
But don't quote me on that.

628
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,750
<i>I mean, it really</i>
<i>causes hate, actually,</i>

629
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:38,086
between two individuals.

630
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:41,289
It's like a war on the floor.

631
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,824
Like world war III.

632
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:44,506
But the only thing about it...
they're gay.

633
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:55,739
<i>Now... cut the music...</i>
<i>now, I said...</i>

634
00:31:55,741 --> 00:32:00,344
<i>I said, "men's garments"!</i>

635
00:32:00,346 --> 00:32:03,247
He looked like
he had on a man's fox coat.

636
00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:04,682
Tell this child,
where are the men's garments?

637
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:07,251
<i>I paid for it,</i>
<i>mother!</i>

638
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:08,487
<i>A man bought it!</i>

639
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:09,721
It buttons on the right side!

640
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:11,390
<i>The judges...</i>

641
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:13,559
it buttons on the right side!

642
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:16,729
Someone came up
and told the emcee...

643
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:17,730
Are you a judge?!

644
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:19,332
That it was a woman's coat.

645
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:21,768
I thought it was kind of silly

646
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,105
to nitpick.

647
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:25,706
<i>Ooh, that's shady!</i>

648
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,275
They're throwing shade at him.
I can't believe it.

649
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:29,343
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

650
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:32,380
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, now.

651
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:34,382
Let's not get loud.

652
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:38,554
<i>Now, David.</i>
<i>David. David.</i>

653
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,824
That's the one thing that
I find faulty with the balls.

654
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,559
After they've laid down
these little categories,

655
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,430
<i>then they try to</i>
<i>become a stickler</i>

656
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,798
for exact interpretation...

657
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,768
merely a point to discredit
the contestant.

658
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,640
Like in an Olympics
where the Russian judge

659
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,310
brought to the fact
that the American coach

660
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:00,746
had stepped onto the floor,

661
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:05,184
and that was a disqualification
for the contestant...

662
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:07,353
just as picky as a ball.

663
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:09,589
So those little flaws
like that...

664
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:12,225
that's because
that's a part of shade.

665
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:14,694
That's the idea...
knock them out if you can.

666
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,864
Get them any way you...
hit them below the belt.

667
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:17,732
It was typed out!
The second...

668
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,767
where is it?
Where is it?

669
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:21,502
Where is it?
Where is it?

670
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:22,503
Stop! No ball.

671
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:25,941
Shade comes from reading.

672
00:33:25,943 --> 00:33:28,210
Reading came first.

673
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:34,551
Reading is the real
art form of insult.

674
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:37,720
Now, you want to
talk about reading?

675
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:39,857
Let's talk about reading.

676
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,359
<i>What is wrong with you, Pedro?</i>

677
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:43,361
<i>Are you going through it?</i>

678
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:44,361
You're going through
some kind of

679
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:47,499
psychological change
in your life?

680
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:48,733
She went back to be a man.

681
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,635
Oh, you went back
to being a man.

682
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:52,872
Touch this skin, darling.

683
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:54,473
Touch this skin, honey.

684
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:55,575
Touch all of this skin.

685
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,610
Okay?

686
00:33:57,612 --> 00:33:59,679
You just can't take it.

687
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:03,283
You're just
an overgrown orangutan.

688
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:04,585
You get in a smart crack,

689
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:07,421
and everyone laughs
and kee-kees

690
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:10,291
because you found a flaw
and exaggerated it...

691
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,393
then you've got
a good read going.

692
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:13,928
I am a person just like you.

693
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,564
You cut me,
I bleed the same way you do.

694
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:16,665
I bleed the same color.

695
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,634
<i>If it's happening between</i>

696
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:20,536
<i>the gay world</i>
<i>and the straight world,</i>

697
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:25,775
<i>It's more of an insult,</i>
<i>a vicious slur-fight.</i>

698
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,611
See, see? There go my
sister right there.

699
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:30,013
She don't even want to even
admit that she my sister.

700
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:31,749
She a bulldagger.

701
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:34,552
<i>But it's how they develop</i>
<i>a sense of how to read.</i>

702
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:38,023
That's my husband right there.

703
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:39,658
And that's my girlfriend
right there.

704
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,261
They may call you a faggot
<i>or a drag queen.</i>

705
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:43,862
<i>You find something</i>
<i>to call them.</i>

706
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:48,268
<i>But then when you are</i>
<i>all of the same thing,</i>

707
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,703
then you have to go
to the fine point.

708
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:53,540
In other words, if I'm a black
queen and you're a black queen,

709
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,542
we can't call each other black queens
'cause we're both black queens.

710
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:57,544
That's not a read.
That's just a fact.

711
00:34:57,546 --> 00:35:00,749
So then we talk about
your ridiculous shape.

712
00:35:00,751 --> 00:35:02,917
Your fa... saggy face.

713
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,452
Your tacky clothes.

714
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:05,720
Let me see what you are...
spreading lies!

715
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:06,888
Let's see. Oh!
No paint!

716
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,024
Yes, it's paint!
It's paint!

717
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:09,525
No mother paint, girl!

718
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:12,528
What? She wears more
makeup than my mother did!

719
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,899
Then reading
became a developed form

720
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,501
where it became shade.

721
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:20,604
Shade is
"I don't tell you you're ugly,

722
00:35:20,606 --> 00:35:24,842
but I don't have to tell you
because you know you're ugly."

723
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:26,544
And that's shade.

724
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,383
<i>Pump...</i>

725
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:33,085
<i>Dip...</i>

726
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,653
<i>Spin...</i>

727
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:37,456
<i>Pump...</i>

728
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,392
<i>Dip...</i>

729
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:41,361
Voguing is
the same thing as, like,

730
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:44,064
taking two knives
and cutting each other up,

731
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,499
but through a dance form.

732
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:50,705
<i>Pump... Dip... Spin... Vogue.</i>

733
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:51,672
Dip.

734
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:55,544
<i>Go... Turn... It... Out.</i>

735
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:56,778
Voguing came from shade

736
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,815
because it was a dance
that two people did

737
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:00,683
because they didn't
like each other.

738
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:02,752
Instead of fighting,

739
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:05,021
you would dance it out
on the dance floor.

740
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:06,522
And whoever
did the better moves

741
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:09,426
was throwing the best shade,
basically.

742
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,395
<i>No touching.</i>

743
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:12,896
<i>Neither one of you.</i>

744
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:15,533
If you touch, I'm chopping you.
I'm telling you right now.

745
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:18,403
<i>You could take the</i>
<i>pantomime form of the vogue...</i>

746
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:20,138
this is what, generally,
sometimes I do

747
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,907
is I make my hand
into a form like a compact

748
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,143
or a makeup kit.

749
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:25,511
And I'm, like,
beating my face with blush,

750
00:36:25,513 --> 00:36:28,814
shadows, or whatever,
to the music.

751
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:31,918
Then, usually, I'll turn
the compact around

752
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,453
to face that person...

753
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:35,789
meaning, like, almost like
my hand is a mirror...

754
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,391
for them to get a look.

755
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:38,726
Then I'll start doing
their face,

756
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:41,963
<i>because what they have</i>
<i>on their face right now</i>

757
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,098
needs a dramatic makeup job.

758
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,503
So voguing's like a safe form
of throwing shade.

759
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,571
<i>Paris... Dupree.</i>

760
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:52,641
<i>Work.</i>
<i>Paris... Dupree.</i>

761
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,544
<i>Work. Whoo!</i>

762
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,713
<i>All right, miss...</i>

763
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,647
<i>Don't knock Paris.</i>

764
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,662
<i>Come on, baby, take your time.</i>

765
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:13,565
<i>Bring it to the judges.</i>

766
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,668
Judges, get into the form
<i>and the style.</i>

767
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,171
<i>Work.</i>
<i>Let's hear it for her.</i>

768
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:20,940
The name was taken
from the magazine "vogue,"

769
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:23,544
because some of the movements
of the dance

770
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:27,014
<i>are also the same as</i>
<i>the poses inside the magazine.</i>

771
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:27,881
Work, damn it!

772
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:33,087
The name is a statement
in itself.

773
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:34,589
I mean, you really
wouldn't go to a ball

774
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:37,492
to do the "mademoiselle."

775
00:37:37,494 --> 00:37:39,128
No way.

776
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,932
Now I want all y'all
<i>up on the floor!</i>

777
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:45,869
<i>New York and Jersey!</i>

778
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:50,540
<i>Wake up!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

779
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:51,708
<i>Whoo!</i>

780
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,612
<i>Brother.</i>
<i>This is Saint Laurent.</i>

781
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:57,014
Adonis.

782
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,883
Overness.

783
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:00,519
Bobby lamay.

784
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,225
<i>Whoo, I wish I knew</i>
<i>how to do that.</i>

785
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:07,626
<i>Mm-mm-mmm.</i>

786
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,664
Ouch!
Work! Work!

787
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:16,203
<i>Work! Work! Work!</i>

788
00:38:17,173 --> 00:38:22,877
<i>the dance takes</i>
<i>from the hieroglyphics</i>

789
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,679
<i>of ancient Egypt.</i>

790
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:28,583
<i>It also takes from some
forms of gymnastics.</i>

791
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:32,955
<i>They both strive for
perfect lines in the body,</i>

792
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:36,592
<i>awkward positions, but it
goes one step further.</i>

793
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,062
<i>It's starting to make</i>
<i>a name for itself,</i>

794
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:41,965
<i>but I want it</i>
<i>to be known worldwide,</i>

795
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,801
<i>and I want to be on top</i>
<i>of it when it hits.</i>

796
00:38:44,803 --> 00:38:50,074
<i>I want to take voguing not</i>
<i>to just Paris is burning,</i>

797
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:53,112
but I want to take it
to the real Paris

798
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:55,314
and make the real Paris burn.

799
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:57,016
That's what I want to do,

800
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:00,754
<i>and not just there,</i>
<i>but to other countries as well.</i>

801
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:03,924
My house name is Ninja,

802
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:06,059
and I would really like to take
my whole house

803
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:07,861
and go to Japan...

804
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:10,565
And really let loose and do it
and have them accept it there.

805
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:14,001
I want to be a big star.

806
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:21,009
Uh, known, generally,
every corner of the world.

807
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,816
You know, maybe
as a choreographer,

808
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:28,918
a famous dancer,

809
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,855
a singer, or all of them.

810
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:34,024
<i>What the balls</i>
<i>has to do with that,</i>

811
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:35,926
as far as the dance field,

812
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:38,797
is maybe perfecting my craft
<i>a little better,</i>

813
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:41,700
<i>to learn new things,</i>

814
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:43,168
new ideas,

815
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,339
and bring them
to the real world.

816
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:52,778
It's been really unbelievable,
my life.

817
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,982
If I was to die today
or tomorrow,

818
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:57,351
I could not say I've not had
an exciting life.

819
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,155
I have had a fabu...
and I'm not rich, mind you.

820
00:40:01,157 --> 00:40:02,690
Just imagine
if I had the dollars.

821
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,793
<i>Ooh, it'd be too much</i>
<i>for the world.</i>

822
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:08,397
<i>If I had the riches</i>
<i>and I had the fame, trust me,</i>

823
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:11,066
all of y'all in here
would be rich...

824
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:12,701
'Cause I'm very generous.

825
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:13,936
You know, I can't...

826
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:16,840
I wouldn't enjoy
having a whole lot of money,

827
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:20,210
like being a millionaire
and hoarding it, you know?

828
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:21,411
I'd share it
with all my loved ones.

829
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,981
You know, I'd want them
to have it, too.

830
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:25,316
We'd all have to go.

831
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:27,318
I'd want to charter a plane,
and we all fly to Paris.

832
00:40:33,393 --> 00:40:38,665
O-p-u-l-e-n-c-e...

833
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,199
opulence.

834
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:47,841
You own everything.

835
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:54,015
Everything is yours.

836
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:16,340
<i>This is white America.</i>

837
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:20,878
<i>Any other nationality</i>

838
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,116
<i>that is not of the white set</i>

839
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:27,352
knows this and accepts this
till the day they die.

840
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:32,892
That is everybody's dream
and ambition as a minority...

841
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:37,964
<i>to live and look</i>
<i>as well as a white person.</i>

842
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:41,469
<i>It is pictured as being</i>
<i>in America.</i>

843
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:43,204
<i>Every media you have,</i>

844
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:47,242
<i>from TV to magazines</i>
<i>to movies to films...</i>

845
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,445
<i>I mean, the biggest thing that</i>
<i>minority watches is what?</i>

846
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:52,514
"Dynasty" and "the Colbys."

847
00:41:52,516 --> 00:41:55,384
<i>Um, "all my children,"</i>
<i>the soap operas.</i>

848
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:57,420
<i>Everybody have</i>
<i>a million-dollar bracket.</i>

849
00:41:57,422 --> 00:42:01,225
<i>When they showing you</i>
<i>a commercial from honey grahams</i>

850
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,161
<i>to crest or lestoil</i>
<i>or pine-sol,</i>

851
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:07,231
<i>everybody's in their own home.</i>

852
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,768
<i>The little kids</i>
<i>for fisher-price toys,</i>

853
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,970
<i>they're not</i>
<i>in no concrete playground.</i>

854
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:15,206
<i>They're riding around the lawn.</i>

855
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:18,244
<i>The pool is in the back.</i>

856
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:20,346
<i>This is white America.</i>

857
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:22,448
<i>And when it comes</i>
<i>to the minorities,</i>

858
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,384
<i>especially black...</i>

859
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:28,488
<i>We, as a people</i>
<i>for the past 400 years,</i>

860
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,126
<i>is the greatest example</i>
<i>of behavior modification</i>

861
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:34,996
<i>in the history of civilization.</i>

862
00:42:34,998 --> 00:42:38,433
<i>We have had everything</i>
<i>taken away from us,</i>

863
00:42:38,435 --> 00:42:43,071
<i>and yet we have</i>
<i>all learned how to survive.</i>

864
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:46,309
<i>That is why,</i>
<i>in the ballroom circuit,</i>

865
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:49,379
<i>it is so obvious</i>

866
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:54,552
that if you have captured the
<i>great white way of living...</i>

867
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:57,288
<i>Or looking...</i>

868
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,860
Or dressing or speaking...

869
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:05,130
<i>You is a marvel.</i>

870
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:10,436
I think if I could just be
on TV or film or anything,

871
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:13,472
I'd do that
instead of the money.

872
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:15,208
Of course, I do want the money

873
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,477
because I want the luxury
that goes with it.

874
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:20,447
But...

875
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:22,950
I want to be wealthy.

876
00:43:22,952 --> 00:43:25,486
If not wealthy,
content, comfortable...

877
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:28,556
You know?

878
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:30,458
I want to be somebody.

879
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,894
I mean, I am somebody.

880
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:35,631
I just want to be
a rich somebody.

881
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:38,902
You ain't gonna tell me,
you see her in the supermarket,

882
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:41,504
<i>and you're gonna say,</i>
<i>"that's a hag."</i>

883
00:43:41,506 --> 00:43:45,475
Women don't go out of their way
because they are women.

884
00:43:45,477 --> 00:43:47,945
I went out my way
because I wasn't,

885
00:43:47,947 --> 00:43:50,381
<i>and I felt that I wanted to be</i>
<i>the best I can be.</i>

886
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:53,352
<i>The Virginia slims girl</i>
<i>is here.</i>

887
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:54,519
This was not a game
for me or fun.

888
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:57,289
This is something
that I want to live.

889
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,292
<i>She's here in person.</i>

890
00:44:00,294 --> 00:44:02,061
Hopefully, God willing,

891
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:06,232
by 1988, I fully hope to
become a full-fledged woman

892
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:07,934
of the United States.

893
00:44:10,138 --> 00:44:13,173
You look at all these models
on the wall.

894
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:15,676
Every one of them are gorgeous.

895
00:44:15,678 --> 00:44:18,380
Every one of them
are beautiful.

896
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:21,316
But every one of them
have their own look.

897
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:24,120
This is my idol...
Paulina.

898
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,289
Someday I hope to be
up there with her.

899
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:28,157
If that could be me,

900
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:30,192
I think I would be the happiest
person in the world,

901
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:34,064
just knowing that
I can compare to Paulina,

902
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:36,533
to stand next to her
and to take pictures with her.

903
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:39,437
And I look at her here,
and I'd say she's seductive,

904
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:42,340
and she's alluring.

905
00:44:42,342 --> 00:44:46,478
I look at her there, and I say
she's sexy and provocative.

906
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,113
I look at her here,

907
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:50,950
and I think that she's childish
and little-girl type.

908
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:54,321
You know, and I look at her
here, and it's the same.

909
00:44:54,323 --> 00:44:57,657
And I look at her here,
and I think of wicked beauty.

910
00:44:57,659 --> 00:44:59,626
You know?
That's how I see her.

911
00:44:59,628 --> 00:45:01,529
I-I admire her...

912
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:05,666
you know, the red-hot fire
of hair and...

913
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:06,701
The whole bit.

914
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:10,605
<i>If you're not</i>
<i>really trying hard enough,</i>

915
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,507
<i>then I become hard.</i>

916
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,744
<i>Do not believe just because</i>
<i>I'm a guy that I cannot do it.</i>

917
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,680
In order to be a teacher
and show girls how to do it,

918
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:19,315
I have to know how to do it.

919
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,117
I've taught for various shows,

920
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,186
like for F.I.T.,
I've taught models.

921
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,989
Girls that are
from various agencies...

922
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:25,990
they've come to me
by word of mouth.

923
00:45:35,768 --> 00:45:40,006
<i>New York City women are a little
bit harder than most women.</i>

924
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:42,675
Basically, I'm trying to bring
their femininity back

925
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:44,477
and bring some grace and poise.

926
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:46,213
<i>You know, whether</i>
<i>they become models or not,</i>

927
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:49,583
it's nice to know because
it's more attractive to men.

928
00:45:49,585 --> 00:45:51,218
The walk that she's doing...

929
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,622
it's basically to get more
movement in your hips naturally.

930
00:45:54,624 --> 00:45:56,157
Don't exaggerate.

931
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:07,603
<i>Most likely,</i>
<i>she'll get what she wants.</i>

932
00:46:07,605 --> 00:46:09,773
You know, especially
if she's in a man's world,

933
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:11,775
she can still have
her equal rights,

934
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:14,577
but be able to manipulate a man
by using her feminine wiles.

935
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,050
<i>Are they soft?</i>

936
00:46:19,052 --> 00:46:22,453
Looking from head to toe,
<i>would you know?</i>

937
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:25,057
- Is this realness or not?
- Let it be mother hot.

938
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,698
Miss octavia, you don't feel
<i>this realness?</i>

939
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,769
<i>Where are you at, sister?</i>
<i>Oops, you're right there.</i>

940
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:51,820
<i>Labeija...</i>

941
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:53,689
<i>Candy Labeija.</i>

942
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,858
<i>Realness in the daytime,</i>
<i>darling.</i>

943
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,828
<i>She goes to school as a woman.</i>

944
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,396
<i>Get into it.</i>

945
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:05,302
Get into both of them
and see which one is realer.

946
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:07,404
<i>Feel the flesh</i>
<i>or whatever it may be.</i>

947
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:09,474
<i>Is it soft or not?</i>

948
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:13,544
It's soft.

949
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:14,879
Come, come, come.

950
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:17,716
<i>Score miss octavia first.</i>

951
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:20,385
<i>Step forward</i>
<i>to accept your scores.</i>

952
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:23,389
<i>10, 10, 10, 10, 10.</i>

953
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,391
<i>Score Tennille.</i>

954
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:32,266
<i>9, 10, 10.</i>

955
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,406
<i>grand prize, octavia.</i>

956
00:47:38,408 --> 00:47:39,908
<i>First place, Tennille.</i>

957
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:46,849
There's people
who sit home all day.

958
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:48,818
They have potential, okay?

959
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,854
I mean, they go to the balls, and they
prove that they have potentials on

960
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:54,825
actually selling
a garment, okay?

961
00:47:54,827 --> 00:47:57,928
But they, like, "being
that I have this potential",

962
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,730
"the ballroom tells me, okay,

963
00:47:59,732 --> 00:48:03,768
the ballroom tells me
that I'm somebody."

964
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,937
But when the ballroom is over,
when you come home,

965
00:48:05,939 --> 00:48:08,841
you have to convince yourself
that you are somebody,

966
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:10,843
and that's where they get lost.

967
00:48:21,223 --> 00:48:23,824
It's also in a magazine.

968
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:25,826
What's the name
of the magazine?

969
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:38,207
<i>when you could spend</i>
<i>a great deal of time</i>

970
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:41,344
<i>making outfits</i>
<i>and preparing for something.</i>

971
00:48:41,346 --> 00:48:43,279
Now they come very quickly,

972
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:46,383
<i>and the moods change</i>
<i>very quickly.</i>

973
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:49,386
I come from the old school
of big costumes...

974
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,722
feathers and beads...

975
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:53,558
and they don't have that
anymore.

976
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,893
Now it's all about designers,

977
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:57,529
and it's not
about what you create,

978
00:48:57,531 --> 00:48:59,831
it's about
what you can acquire.

979
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:04,537
What do you think?

980
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:07,406
Isn't that beautiful?

981
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:13,880
$559... how's that
for a simple dress?

982
00:49:13,882 --> 00:49:16,451
If you have on a label,
it means that you've, uh,

983
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,721
you've got wealth,
when it doesn't really,

984
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,023
'cause any shoplifter
can get a label.

985
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,659
You can't come down the runway

986
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:26,929
in something
for $14.99 or $49.99

987
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,897
and say, "well, I'm lovely,"

988
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,668
and expect to win.

989
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:35,005
Okay, to describe...
explain "mopping."

990
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:38,943
Mopping, you go into a store,

991
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:42,346
and...

992
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:45,916
Just look for... look for
whatever you want to see,

993
00:49:45,918 --> 00:49:47,486
look for whatever.

994
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:49,688
Mopping is stealing.

995
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,556
General stealing.

996
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:54,294
However it's done,
it's stealing.

997
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:55,395
If you're working every day,

998
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:58,431
you're struggling
to buy this outfit.

999
00:49:58,433 --> 00:50:01,602
When you walk, you're like,
"this is me."

1000
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,671
And your facial expressions

1001
00:50:03,673 --> 00:50:06,607
as well as your means
of projection of your outfit...

1002
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:09,544
it shows if you actually
stole it or you purchased it.

1003
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:11,012
<i>You can actually tell?</i>

1004
00:50:11,014 --> 00:50:13,315
You can actually tell.

1005
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:16,485
Faggots are a stunt
in themselves, regardless.

1006
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:17,853
Make no mistake.

1007
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:20,323
First, it come...
okay, when it comes to a stunt,

1008
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:22,925
it goes in...
it goes in order.

1009
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:26,530
It goes faggots,
then girls, then boys,

1010
00:50:26,532 --> 00:50:28,098
because boys are the stupidest.

1011
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,334
They don't know how
to do a stunt right.

1012
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:32,036
Now, faggots will do a stunt,

1013
00:50:32,038 --> 00:50:36,341
and I mean, you will never catch
up with it until years later.

1014
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:37,675
And then, I mean,
you'll be like,

1015
00:50:37,677 --> 00:50:41,347
"oh, , this faggot
pulled this stunt on me."

1016
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:43,115
We went down there.
We had fun.

1017
00:50:43,117 --> 00:50:45,417
We just act stupid
and came back.

1018
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:48,722
But I think the best thing
we did was Roy Rogers.

1019
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:49,856
That was fun.

1020
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:51,624
You would have had
something to eat,

1021
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:52,926
'cause how much did you pay
for that sandwich?

1022
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,029
<i>I don't remember...</i>
<i>maybe $5.</i>

1023
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:57,998
Around $5?

1024
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,037
That... make no mistake,
we got your $5 back.

1025
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,073
I had two
double cheeseburgers,

1026
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:09,512
two fries, a coke, a sprite,
and an orange,

1027
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:10,813
chicken, and chips.

1028
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:12,048
Just going back and forth...
I lived on that line.

1029
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:15,785
We got over... around...
around...

1030
00:51:15,787 --> 00:51:18,722
say, around $200 in food.

1031
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:21,058
<i>See, they put cheese</i>
<i>on the meat.</i>

1032
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:25,997
I hope after this,

1033
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,701
Roy Rogers does not change
how it has its food

1034
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:30,902
because if it does
by this interview,

1035
00:51:30,904 --> 00:51:33,873
I will be so upset.

1036
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,841
I will be so upset.

1037
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,043
I'll be...

1038
00:51:38,045 --> 00:51:39,980
I'll be hurt, I'm telling you.

1039
00:51:39,982 --> 00:51:42,916
I really will be,
'cause I mean it.

1040
00:51:42,918 --> 00:51:46,421
Where else can you go in,
get it done your way,

1041
00:51:46,423 --> 00:51:49,824
<i>Carla xtravaganza said...</i>

1042
00:51:49,826 --> 00:51:53,695
<i>will you please return</i>
<i>her black patent-leather shoes,</i>

1043
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,664
<i>size 7?</i>

1044
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,868
<i>There is a reward.</i>

1045
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,838
<i>She want her pumps.</i>

1046
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,607
<i>She said it's not going to</i>
<i>work, taking her shoes.</i>

1047
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:06,142
<i>Give them back.</i>

1048
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:09,680
Daytime, if they go out,
they're only going out...

1049
00:52:09,682 --> 00:52:13,584
To try to hustle up
a quarter or two...

1050
00:52:14,586 --> 00:52:18,223
To get their things for the ball
or go to a little job.

1051
00:52:18,225 --> 00:52:19,791
A lot of them
have little jobs now.

1052
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:21,126
They work.
Don't think they're lazy.

1053
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:25,631
In New York City,
you work, or you starve.

1054
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:28,634
You work...
some kind of work...

1055
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:29,769
Legal or otherwise,

1056
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:34,208
but you have to work
to sustain yourself.

1057
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,611
<i>The legendary Tennille dupree</i>

1058

<i>Grand march is at 7:00 A.M.</i>

1065
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:08,112
<i>the boys are usually later
because of the fact</i>

1066
00:53:08,114 --> 00:53:12,150
that we're waiting for the
working girls to get there.

1067
00:53:12,152 --> 00:53:14,786
And what is it
those girls are doing?

1068
00:53:14,788 --> 00:53:16,623
Well, they're making
money for the balls,

1069
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:19,692
<i>or they're making their
costumes, their outfits,</i>

1070
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:22,695
<i>or, you know, getting
it together like that.</i>

1071
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:24,164
What's their profession?

1072
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,700
<i>Usually showgirls...</i>

1073
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:28,636
<i>usually, they're,</i>
<i>you know, showgirls.</i>

1074
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,273
Uh-huh. Anything else? You know?

1075
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:34,242
Well, it depends.
It depends.

1076
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,610
I don't know a lot
of their professions,

1077
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:39,982
but usually they're
showgirls... usually.

1078
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:42,251
The thing that helped me
make my most money

1079
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:45,054
through the escort service
is being that I'm so little.

1080
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:49,092
I'm so petite and tiny.

1081
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:53,330
Um... The blond hair
and the light skin

1082
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:56,200
and the green eyes
and the little features.

1083
00:53:56,202 --> 00:53:59,837
And the client's hands
will be bigger than my hands

1084
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,207
while they would hold my hand
or something.

1085
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:03,676
You know, they like feeling

1086
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:07,112
that they're with something
perfect and little,

1087
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:09,916
and not someone
that's bigger than them,

1088
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:13,887
because I guess
that kind of disturbs them.

1089
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,125
Most all the drag queens
that are involved in the balls,

1090
00:54:18,127 --> 00:54:22,863
<i>they... 90% of them...</i>
<i>are hustlers.</i>

1091
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:24,199
<i>I guess that's how</i>
<i>they make their money</i>

1092
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:28,036
<i>to go to the balls</i>
<i>and get whatever they need.</i>

1093
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:31,039
I used to hustle in New York
<i>to make my money.</i>

1094
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:34,344
I was with a guy, and he was
playing with my titties

1095
00:54:34,346 --> 00:54:36,913
<i>till he touched me down there.</i>

1096
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:39,950
He felt it, and he seen it, and
<i>he, like, totally flipped out.</i>

1097
00:54:39,952 --> 00:54:43,787
He said, "you fucking faggot!
<i>You're a freak.</i>"

1098
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:46,825
<i>"You're a victim of aids, and</i>
<i>you're trying to give me aids.</i>

1099
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:49,828
<i>You're a homo.</i>
<i>I should kill you."</i>

1100
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,030
You know, stuff like that.

1101
00:54:52,032 --> 00:54:55,735
<i>And, like,</i>
<i>I was really terrified.</i>

1102
00:54:55,737 --> 00:54:57,837
<i>So I just jumped</i>
<i>out the window.</i>

1103
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,339
<i>I grabbed my bag</i>
<i>and just jumped out the window.</i>

1104
00:55:00,341 --> 00:55:02,376
<i>But see, now I don't like</i>
<i>to hustle anymore.</i>

1105
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:05,679
<i>I don't, and I'm afraid</i>
<i>of what's going on...</i>

1106
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,883
<i>the aids...</i>
<i>and I don't want to catch it.</i>

1107
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:12,120
Like, later on this evening,
I'm supposed to meet someone...

1108
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:14,956
a friend of mine,
a very good old friend of mine.

1109
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:19,161
He's a young, very good,
attractive, handsome young man.

1110
00:55:19,163 --> 00:55:24,868
And, um, he's taking me out
to dinner later on this evening,

1111
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:28,238
<i>or for cocktails</i>
<i>after midnight.</i>

1112
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,375
I know he'll give me
some money...

1113
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:35,246
Just for me to maybe buy a pair
of shoes and a nice dress

1114
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:40,018
so that the next time
he sees me...

1115
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,221
He'll see me looking more
and more beautiful...

1116
00:55:43,223 --> 00:55:46,024
the way he wants to see me.

1117
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:48,828
But I don't have to go
to bed with him

1118
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,430
<i>or anything like that.</i>

1119
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:52,198
<i>At times,</i>
<i>they do expect sexual favors,</i>

1120
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,235
but that is between myself
<i>and them,</i>

1121
00:55:55,237 --> 00:55:58,238
so I do not wish to further
speak about that...

1122
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,374
If they do.

1123
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:05,013
But at most times,
99% of the time, they don't.

1124
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:08,784
95% of the time, they don't.

1125
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:12,288
But I feel like...

1126
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:17,227
If you're married...
a woman in the suburbs,

1127
00:56:17,229 --> 00:56:21,998
a regular woman...
Is married to her husband,

1128
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,939
and she wants him to buy her
a washer and dryer set...

1129
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:29,340
In order for him to buy that,

1130
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:32,311
I'm sure she'd have to go
to bed with him anyway

1131
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:37,382
to give him what he wants
for her to get what she wants.

1132
00:56:37,384 --> 00:56:42,088
So, in the long run,
it all ends up the same way.

1133
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:50,064
If money wasn't so important
in the world today...

1134
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:51,932
<i>To survive...</i>

1135
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:56,838
I guess I wouldn't want
anything but what I have now.

1136
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,875
<i>But since money does...</i>

1137
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:04,113
I hope that the way I look
puts money in my pocket.

1138
00:57:04,115 --> 00:57:05,548
<i>You know?</i>

1139
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,049
<i>I'm really working hard.</i>

1140
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:10,087
I'm gonna work even harder.

1141
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:14,124
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>There we are.</i>

1142
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:16,059
<i>That is lovely.</i>
<i>Still.</i>

1143
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:18,897
<i>Great.</i>

1144
00:57:18,899 --> 00:57:20,298
Couldn't be better.

1145
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,866
There... oh, it's beautiful
like that for the light

1146
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:23,468
when you kind of, you know,
do this to the light.

1147
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,105
I want people to look at me as,
"there's the model octavia.

1148
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:28,541
"There's the actress octavia.

1149
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:31,878
There's miss supermodel
of the world, octavia."

1150
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,481
Is this endless,
this catalog of poses?

1151
00:57:34,483 --> 00:57:37,851
I could keep going
longer than you could.

1152
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:40,188
<i>Yeah, just there.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i>

1153
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:44,025
I don't want to end up
an old drag queen

1154
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,194
with nothing going for me

1155
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,931
but trying to win
grand prize at a ball.

1156
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:49,965
<i>Yeah, no, back a little bit</i>
<i>like you did.</i>

1157
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,334
<i>Yes, that.</i>

1158
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:55,305
<i>just coming around...</i>
<i>yeah.</i>

1159
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:57,073
Right.
Couldn't be better.

1160
00:57:57,075 --> 00:58:01,311
I don't think the world
<i>has been fair to me...</i>

1161
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:05,216
<i>Lovely.</i>
<i>Lovely.</i>

1162
00:58:06,218 --> 00:58:09,254
I've been a man, and I've been
a man who emulated a woman.

1163
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:10,388
I've never been a woman.

1164
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:15,060
I never had that service
once a month.

1165
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:17,029
I've never been pregnant.

1166
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:19,131
You know, I can never say
how a woman feels.

1167
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:21,467
<i>I can only say how a man</i>
<i>who acts like a woman</i>

1168
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:23,871
<i>or dresses like a woman feels.</i>

1169
00:58:23,873 --> 00:58:25,405
I never wanted to have
a sex change.

1170
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,909
That's just taking it
a little too far, you know?

1171
00:58:28,911 --> 00:58:31,311
<i>Because if you decide later on</i>
<i>in life to change your mind,</i>

1172
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:34,082
<i>you can't...</i>
<i>once it's gone, it's gone.</i>

1173
00:58:34,084 --> 00:58:36,985
A lot of kids that I know, they got
the sex change because they felt,

1174
00:58:36,987 --> 00:58:40,956
"oh, I've been treated so bad
as a drag queen.

1175
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:43,392
"If I get a"...
excuse the expression...

1176
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,327
"I'll be treated fabulous."

1177
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:47,397
But women get treated bad.

1178
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:48,632
You know, they get beat,

1179
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:50,100
they get robbed,
they get dogged.

1180
00:58:50,102 --> 00:58:53,069
So having the vagina,

1181
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,039
that doesn't mean that you're
gonna have a fabulous life.

1182
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:58,509
It might, in fact, be worse,
you know.

1183
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,977
So I've never recommended it,

1184
00:58:59,979 --> 00:59:01,914
and I myself would have
never, ever got it,

1185
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:04,583
and I'm so thankful
that I was that smart,

1186
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:06,385
because right about now,

1187
00:59:06,387 --> 00:59:09,188
this next 40 or so years
that I'm gonna be here,

1188
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,556
I'm gonna live.

1189
00:59:10,558 --> 00:59:12,558
And for those children
that can't take the fact

1190
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,662
that I still look youthful,
ha! Suffer.

1191
00:59:15,664 --> 00:59:19,633
No bags, no lines.
Lovely.

1192
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:25,140
<i>America's nice.</i>

1193
00:59:25,142 --> 00:59:27,509
You can do what you want
if you have the money.

1194
00:59:27,511 --> 00:59:29,544
You can be what you want,
certainly.

1195
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,681
Look at me.

1196
00:59:31,683 --> 00:59:34,483
In, um, '84,

1197
00:59:34,485 --> 00:59:38,354
I've had a nose
reconstructed... job.

1198
00:59:38,356 --> 00:59:40,324
I've had my cheekbones risen.

1199
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:43,593
I've had a chin implant
and breast implants.

1200
00:59:43,595 --> 00:59:45,529
Yes, tell them like it is.

1201
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:49,667
The most important factor
in my life

1202
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,436
that has been completed
recently

1203
00:59:51,438 --> 00:59:54,273
is that I've had
a transsexualism operation.

1204
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:56,475
That means
I've had a sex change.

1205
00:59:56,477 --> 00:59:58,444
I'm no longer a man.

1206
00:59:58,446 --> 01:00:00,112
I am a woman.

1207
01:00:00,114 --> 01:00:02,549
I feel great.

1208
01:00:02,551 --> 01:00:05,418
I'm very happy.
She has to rub it in.

1209
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,655
And I feel like the part
of my life that was a secret

1210
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:10,024
is now closed.

1211
01:00:10,026 --> 01:00:11,125
I can close the closet door.

1212
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:13,094
There are no more skeletons
in there.

1213
01:00:13,096 --> 01:00:15,129
And I'm as free as the wind

1214
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:18,400
that's blowing
out on this beach.

1215
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:26,576
Except that voice
is still there.

1216
01:00:26,578 --> 01:00:28,578
Oh!

1217
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,013
As free as this beach.

1218

Yes.

01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,244

01:01:08,158 --> 01:01:11,293
<i>the seventh search</i>
<i>of this type.</i>

1230

<i>who hope to become</i>
<i>the supermodel of the year.</i>

1233
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:22,539
Clients like models
who will be helpful,

1234
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:25,376
who never say the clothes
are terrible even if they are,

1235
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:28,379
because after all,
not everything is perfect.

1236
01:01:28,381 --> 01:01:31,716
They... they have to make
the least perfect of clothes

1237
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:33,285
look like a dior.

1238
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:35,620
And so they can't just say,

1239
01:01:35,622 --> 01:01:38,090
"that's the worst thing
I've ever seen."

1240
01:01:38,092 --> 01:01:40,626
You know, they
have to make it look good.

1241
01:01:40,628 --> 01:01:43,162
They have to be very,
very cooperative.

1242
01:01:43,164 --> 01:01:44,530
And they have to be cheerful.

1243
01:01:44,532 --> 01:01:46,099
Nobody likes to go in and hear
your troubles, you know?

1244
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:48,302
When people ask you
how you feel,

1245
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,838
don't tell them if you're sick
'cause they don't really care.

1246
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,239

1249
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:59,514
the feet of the '80s
did some waiting...

1250
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:01,216
half an hour
and round the block,

One of these young ladies

What about men?
Do they take you seriously?

1258
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:22,440
Or when they hear
you're a model,

1259
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:23,908
how does their reaction
change to you?

1260
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,745
What about,
like I asked before,

1261
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,847
does this square
with the women's lib movement?

Hi, Janet. So you
want to be a model?

1267
01:02:40,263 --> 01:02:42,530
Yes. So you need an application.

1268
01:02:42,532 --> 01:02:43,831
Actually, I was in this contest.
That's how I started.

1269
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:46,200
That's me.
I can't believe that.

1270
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:48,803
Yeah, that's 5 years ago.
You still look great.

1271
01:02:48,805 --> 01:02:49,938
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,841
We look at 75,000 pictures.

1273
01:02:52,843 --> 01:02:55,478
Well, you know,
that's the average amount

1274
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,647
that we look at each contest.

1275
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:00,716
What have girls become? Are
they... are they the same?

1276
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:02,319
How are they different?

1277
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:06,623
Girls are not different from
yesterday or the day before.

1278
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:09,227
Everybody who's young
has a hope and a dream...

1279
01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:12,530
And I don't think that
it's ever been any different

1280
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:14,199
in the history of the world.

1281
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,905
I believe that
there's a big future out there

1282
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:24,744
with a lot
of beautiful things...

1283
01:03:24,746 --> 01:03:27,714
A lot of handsome men...

1284
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:29,783
A lot of luxury.

1285
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:32,353
I want a car.

1286
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:34,956
I want to be with a man I love.

1287
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,959
I want a nice home
away from New York,

1288
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:41,797
up the Peekskills
or maybe in Florida...

1289
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:44,566
somewhere far
where no one knows me.

1290
01:03:44,568 --> 01:03:47,303
I want my sex change.

1291
01:03:47,305 --> 01:03:50,006
I want to live
a normal, happy life,

1292
01:03:50,008 --> 01:03:53,009
whether it's being married
and adopting children,

1293
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:58,415
whether it's being famous
and rich.

1294
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:02,921
I want to get married
in church in white.

1295
01:04:03,723 --> 01:04:04,889
Sometimes I sit,
and I look at a magazine.

1296
01:04:04,891 --> 01:04:07,926
I try to imagine myself
in the front cover

1297
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:11,964
or even inside.

1298
01:04:11,966 --> 01:04:13,899
I want to be a complete woman,

1299
01:04:13,901 --> 01:04:19,473
and I want to be a professional
model behind cameras

1300
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:21,875
in the high-fashion world.

1301
01:04:21,877 --> 01:04:26,047
I want so much more.
I want...

1302
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:31,286
I want my name
to be a household product.

1303
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:36,025
I want everybody to look at me
and say, "there goes octavia."

1304
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:38,894
I want this.
This is what I want.

1305
01:04:38,896 --> 01:04:42,632
And I'm gonna go for it.

1306
01:04:49,509 --> 01:04:51,742
<i>Oh, me!</i>

1307
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:57,049
<i>Amy xtravaganza!</i>

1308
01:05:00,788 --> 01:05:04,791

1309
01:05:04,793 --> 01:05:06,826

<I>Previously,</I>
<I>I, uh, introduced rap music</I>

1315
01:05:23,046 --> 01:05:25,414
along with dancing...

1316
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:30,353
To Japanese people,
and they really loved it.

1317
01:05:30,355 --> 01:05:32,656
This, ladies
and gentlemen, is voguing,

1318
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:35,792
<i>a form of dance</i>
<i>that has its roots in Harlem...</i>

1319
01:05:35,794 --> 01:05:37,394
a takeoff on runway modeling,

1320
01:05:37,396 --> 01:05:40,465
<i>which they had plenty of</i>
<i>last night as well.</i>

1321
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,802
<i>Voguing is an attitude,</i>
<i>a style.</i>

1322
01:05:44,804 --> 01:05:46,672
<i>It's... It's...</i>

1323
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:48,874
A kind of an institutionalized
showing off.

1324
01:05:48,876 --> 01:05:50,909
But not without
its entertainment value.

1325
01:05:50,911 --> 01:05:54,848
Something very spectacular,
very important... Art form.

1326
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,015
Very important.

1327
01:05:56,017 --> 01:05:59,018
It's just so theatrical,
and the energy...

1328
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,854
oh, it's just terrific.

1329
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,391
In addition to perhaps
putting voguing in vogue,

1330
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:07,128
<i>this love ball sponsored by the
design industries foundation for aids</i>

1331
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,599
raised more than $350,000
<i>for research</i>

1332
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:12,167
and housing for the homeless
<i>who have aids.</i>

1333
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:15,937
<i>And I have never seen anything</i>
<i>quite like it.</i>

1334
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:18,841
<i>I'm Connie Collins,</i>
<i>news 4, Manhattan.</i>

1335
01:06:18,843 --> 01:06:23,679
Two years ago, I was
working in a health-food store,

1336
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:26,450
still teaching and trying to
<i>perform on my own.</i>

1337
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:31,455
But now, my foot is, like,
in every little doorstep

1338
01:06:31,457 --> 01:06:32,123
that you can think of.

1339
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,192
Um...

1340
01:06:34,194 --> 01:06:37,429
I'm doing a lot of runway work,

1341
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:40,900
um, dancing... performing
for Malcolm Mclaren,

1342
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:44,036
<i>various other people,</i>
<i>doing choreography,</i>

1343
01:06:44,038 --> 01:06:46,205
<i>helping people</i>
<i>put their shows together.</i>

1344
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:47,774
<i>So it's going very good.</i>

1345
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:52,879
<i>This earring</i>
<i>that I have here, is...</i>

1346
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:54,215
I bought this in Japan.

1347
01:06:54,217 --> 01:06:56,784
As you can see,
it says "house couture."

1348
01:06:56,786 --> 01:06:59,086
I can't read the rest of it.
It has a scissor

1349
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:01,155
and it has "Jr. Gaultier, '89"
on there, of course.

1350
01:07:01,157 --> 01:07:03,192
It's a Gaultier label emblem.

1351
01:07:03,194 --> 01:07:07,729
I bought it, mind you.
I have the receipt still...

1352
01:07:07,731 --> 01:07:09,632
where, I don't know,
but I bought it.

1353
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:18,476
<i>The balls have kind of</i>
<i>gotten toned down</i>

1354
01:07:18,478 --> 01:07:20,478
<i>compared to what it used to be.</i>

1355
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Now when I tell people
what it is,

1356
01:07:22,482 --> 01:07:25,650
and they go, and it's not
what they expect, you know,

1357
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:28,854
it's like they feel, like, a
little bit of a letdown, you know?

1358
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:31,791
And they say, "it was long, it
was dragged out, it was boring."

1359
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:33,826
Okay, the balls are always long
and dragged out,

1360
01:07:33,828 --> 01:07:38,164
<i>I really do kind of miss</i>
<i>the street element.</i>

1361
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,000
<i>I mean, but everything changes,</i>

1362
01:07:40,002 --> 01:07:42,202
<i>and everything's</i>
<i>been changing drastically.</i>

1363
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:48,276
You know, um, New York's
not even the same anymore.

1364
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,944
I always said to her, "Venus,
you take too many chances.</i>"

1365
01:08:18,946 --> 01:08:20,812
"You're too wild with people
<i>in the streets.</i>

1366
01:08:20,814 --> 01:08:24,918
<i>But that was Venus.</i>
<i>She always took a chance.</i>

1367
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,886
<i>She always went</i>
<i>into strangers' cars.</i>

1368
01:08:26,888 --> 01:08:31,624
<i>She always did what she wanted</i>
<i>to get what she wanted.</i>

1369
01:08:32,627 --> 01:08:35,763
I had a booking
for a Christmas show at Sally's,

1370
01:08:35,765 --> 01:08:39,935
and the D.T.S came to me
with a picture of her murdered,

1371
01:08:39,937 --> 01:08:41,570
and they were
about to cremate her

1372
01:08:41,572 --> 01:08:44,005
'cause nobody had came
to verify the body,

1373
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:46,207
and I was the one that
had to give all this information

1374
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:48,811
down to her family.

1375
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:50,780
Actually, they found her dead
<i>after 4 days,</i>

1376
01:08:50,782 --> 01:08:54,318
<i>strangled under a bed in a</i>
<i>sleazy hotel in New York City.</i>

1377
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,286
I'm hungry.

1378
01:08:56,288 --> 01:09:02,894
<i>and, you know, she was like my right
hand, as far as I'm concerned.</i>

1379
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:05,730
<i>I miss her. Every time</i>
<i>I go anywhere, I miss her.</i>

1380
01:09:05,732 --> 01:09:07,799
That was my main...

1381
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:10,202
the main daughter of my house,
in other words.

1382
01:09:10,204 --> 01:09:11,971
But that's part of life,

1383
01:09:11,973 --> 01:09:16,709
as far as being a transsexual
in New York City and surviving.

1384
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:25,353
I always had hopes
of being a big star.

1385
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:29,223
And then I looked...

1386
01:09:29,225 --> 01:09:32,327
as you get older,
you aim a little lower.

1387
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:35,964
And I just say, "well, yeah, you
still might make an impression."

1388
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:38,634
Everybody wants to leave
something behind them...

1389
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:42,005
some impression,
some mark upon the world.

1390
01:09:42,007 --> 01:09:44,273
Then you think...

1391
01:09:44,275 --> 01:09:47,311
You've left a mark
on the world...

1392
01:09:49,714 --> 01:09:52,249
If you just get through it...

1393
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:57,422
And a few people
remember your name.

1394
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,392
Then you left a mark.

1395
01:10:02,763 --> 01:10:05,931
You don't have to bend
the whole world.

1396
01:10:07,668 --> 01:10:11,104
I think it's better
to just enjoy it.

1397
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:15,409
Pay your dues...

1398
01:10:16,277 --> 01:10:19,781
And enjoy it.

1399
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:24,185
If you shoot an arrow
and it goes real high,

1400
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:26,288
hooray for you.

1401
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,303
bring the cameras closer,
Mr. Demille.

1402
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:13,141
I'm ready for my closeup.
And so...

1403
01:11:32,499 --> 01:11:35,399
Okay, winter sportswear...

1404
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:38,936
Preferably fur,
but if not, you know,

1405
01:11:38,938 --> 01:11:41,206
you can... natural fibers.

1406
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:43,342
If... if you choose a
polyester, God help you.

1407
01:11:43,344 --> 01:11:45,344
You know how the children are.

1408
01:12:07,037 --> 01:12:10,039
okay, you add "U-G" at the end
of your word, right?

1409
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:12,074
But you have to take off
the first letter

1410
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:14,944
or the first letters
until you get into a vowel.

1411
01:12:58,895 --> 01:13:02,332
I'm not looking for anything.
I think all men are dogs.

1412
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:03,633
I honestly do.

1413
01:13:03,635 --> 01:13:07,937
You know, every man starts
barking sooner or later.

1414
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,178
I'm a quiet person.

1415
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,146
And if you believe that...

1416
01:13:16,148 --> 01:13:18,416
you know, I own that island
right over there, too.

1417
01:14:03,368 --> 01:14:05,269
They want to be
with their kind.

1418
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:08,472
Right.
They want to be gay.

1419
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:10,275
'Cause partly, like,
just like...

1420
01:14:10,277 --> 01:14:13,211
all right, just like, again,
just like a community.

1421
01:14:13,213 --> 01:14:14,379
In a religious community,

1422
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:17,650
they want to pray
together a lot, right?

1423
01:14:17,652 --> 01:14:20,320
Well, this gay community
might want to...

1424
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:24,959
or... or they, like,
want to be together.

1425
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:02,735
<i>All right! All right!</i>

1426
01:15:28,498 --> 01:15:32,068
<i>Work at it! Work!</i>

1427
01:16:02,837 --> 01:16:05,305
