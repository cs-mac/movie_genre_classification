00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:35,281
Cities today have been doing
the same thing

3
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,035
that they've done for
three, four, five thousand years.

4
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,240
They've been the place where

5
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,251
the flows of people,
the flows of money,

6
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,731
the flows of goods have coalesced.

7
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:53,294
Cities are always
the physical manifestation

8
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:55,950
of the big forces at play.

9
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,672
Economic forces,

10
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,153
social forces,

11
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,444
environmental forces.

12
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:12,072
The thing that attracts us to the city
is the chance encounter,

13
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:15,444
it's the knowledge that you'll
be able to start here,

14
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:17,782
end up there, go back there,

15
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,974
but that something unexpected
will happen along the way,

16
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:22,860
that you'll make a discovery.

17
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:27,340
That, in a way, is the magic of cities.

18
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,947
Urban design is really
the language of the city.

19
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,274
When you walk down a street,

20
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:31,487
everything you see has been designed.

21
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:35,741
The width of the sidewalk,
where trees are planted,

22
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:39,795
the scale of the trees,
how the street furniture interacts.

23
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,542
How many stores you have per block,

24
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:46,467
the height of the buildings,
where they set back.

25
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,929
Each one of these things
has been thought about.

26
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,805
The thing about urban design
is that unlike it being

27
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:58,098
a solitary enterprise of an
artist sitting in her or his studio,

28
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:01,399
what you really have is
a multi-disciplinary group of people

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,799
coming together working
on the same project

30
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:06,019
but coming from very different
perspectives,

31
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,977
having different agendas,
and different roles.

32
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,161
So you've got the architect.

33
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:15,247
You've got the developer
or group of developers.

34
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:19,377
You have state and federal
and city agencies.

35
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:25,049
You have the public,
which is a major component.

36
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:29,174
You have landmarks or other
historically minded groups.

37
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,674
And they all come together
to work against and with each other

38
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,619
in order to bring the project
to fruition.

39
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:42,900
These can range from small,
temporary interventions

40
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,656
to massive large-scale
infrastructural projects.

41
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:51,197
Forces of change are happening
on every level.

42
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:56,657
Technological change, new forms and
modes of transportation.

43
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:02,504
The eventualities of man-made
and natural disasters.

44
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:08,378
These are all things that are going
to be addressed by urban design.

45
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:20,084
The world today is changing
pretty dramatically,

46
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:23,298
shifting toward more and more
people living in cities.

47
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,993
Cities accelerated relatively slowly
from pre-Greek, pre-Roman times.

48
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,464
It took centuries

49
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,823
to reach those numbers which might
be something like a million.

50
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:38,934
By the 20th Century

51
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,234
10% of the population
of the world was living in cities.

52
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,622
Only two years ago it was 50%.

53
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:48,040
And if we continue at the pace
we are, which we will,

54
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:52,573
it will be something like 75%
in forty years' time.

55
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:03,563
The pace now is putting an enormous
amount of pressure and strain

56
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:07,905
on any system
which has limited resources.

57
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,488
33%, roughly,

58
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,367
of new urban dwellers today
live in slums.

59
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:19,787
That's a third of the world's
population...

60
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:21,237
without the most basic amenities,

61
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:23,343
without sewers,
without water, without sanitation.

62
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,369
Today Mumbai has the same number
of people as the whole of London

63
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,916
living in slum conditions.

64
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,274
And Mumbai is set to become
the biggest city in the world in 2050,

65
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,632
therefore bigger than Tokyo.

66
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:38,140
That means the slum population,

67
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,259
if it were to be the same
or roughly like it,

68
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:43,858
would be New York and London
put together.

69
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:49,481
What you have in this city
is a situation where...

70
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,693
the real estate developers
on the one hand

71
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,949
and the slum dwellers on the other
are actually carving out

72
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,576
the design of the city.

73
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:00,829
The poor people are doing it because
the plan has no space for them.

74
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:08,755
The construction industry produced
a huge housing boom for the top 10%

75
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,753
and then increasing crisis
for everyone else.

76
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:16,759
The big downside
of informal settlements

77
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,037
which needs
to be urgently resolved

78
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:20,953
is the question of health
and hygiene.

79
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:23,811
How do you bring sanitation and
how do you bring water supply, etc.

80
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:28,237
That is I think what makes
them inhuman, unlivable,

81
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,915
and I think a complete reflection

82
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:33,926
of the failure of this society
to create human habitat.

83
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:41,034
The city says that if there is
one toilet for fifty people,

84
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:45,462
that is 10 families
have one toilet seat,

85
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:48,214
it means they have
is adequate sanitation.

86
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,044
But in 1989

87
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:57,371
the ratio of people to a toilet seat
was 900 people to a toilet seat.

88
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,311
Today it's come down to 600.

89
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:01,592
Our local politicians say,

90
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:03,339
"Oh, we don't want to build
toilets in slums,

91
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,311
because it will encourage people
to come."

92
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,609
As if people come to shit.

93
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,959
You have a situation in which

94
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:14,683
an informal settlement
gets ignored for a very long time.

95
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:18,739
And because there is no space
for growth

96
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:23,293
it gets denser and denser and denser.

97
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:27,748
The issue is that you've got all
this growth over the next 20, 30 years,

98
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,958
basically a doubling
of the urban population.

99
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:34,047
At the same time, you haven't dealt
with the people who are already there.

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,133
You know, it's very easy to get
incredibly pessimistic

101
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,265
and dark about the prospects
looking forward,

102
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,393
because if you just look at the
numbers and the trend lines,

103
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:46,191
it is profoundly depressing, I mean,

104
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,896
you just want to slit
your wrists basically,

105
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:55,076
so this is not a healthy area of
research and engagement.

106
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,824
But that said, at the same time,
we know from history

107
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:02,659
is that you really need a small group
of innovators, a small group of people

108
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:05,710
that can demonstrate
how to do things differently,

109
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:10,712
and once that gets mainstreamed,
change happens really quickly.

110
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:40,783
If we do not take care

111
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:44,840
how the process of migration
towards cities is going to happen,

112
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:50,375
the process of urbanization is going
to happen in the form of slums.

113
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,381
So we're in an urgency to

114
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:56,089
generate the conditions
so that the flow

115
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:58,550
of people into cities
happens in a good way.

116
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,570
With the Lo Barnechea project the main
priority was location.

117
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:21,770
Behind me you see the group
of families in the situation before,

118
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,924
meaning they live in a slum.

119
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,689
What we are trying to do
is that knowing

120
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:29,220
that the location is so important,

121
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,461
because schools, transportation,
jobs are in this part of the city,

122
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:36,297
which is actually
the richest part of the city.

123
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:40,518
What we were looking for was to find
a design that was able to pay

124
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:43,265
for very expensive land, but keep
all those networks.

125
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:48,817
So much more important then an extra
square meter of house,

126
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:54,399
was a better located square meter
of land, which tends to be expensive.

127
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:58,911
With a subsidy that is about $10,000

128
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:01,002
that is given to a poor family

129
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:04,256
that will then become
an owner of the house,

130
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:08,625
we had to buy the land,
provide the infrastructure,

131
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,422
and build the houses.

132
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:14,878
Instead of producing tiny units,
we asked ourselves

133
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:18,761
"Why don't we think of it
as half of a good house?"

134
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,685
And we thought it was efficient
to make the half

135
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,638
that a family could never achieve
on their own.

136
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:31,190
And then allow families to do
the other half, on their own,

137
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,944
with their own timing,
according to their own needs.

138
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:38,325
We call it participatory design.

139
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:45,492
To have a participatory design means
to have families sitting at the table

140
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:49,580
to help us decide what are we going
to deliver from day one

141
00:10:50,162 --> 00:10:54,509
and what can be left so that families
themselves take care of that.

142
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:23,471
We asked families
what was more important:

143
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:25,974
a water heater or a bathtub.

144
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:28,748
There was not enough money for both.

145
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:31,641
Decision makers, or politicians,
or professionals

146
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,919
they normally tend to answer
the water heater.

147
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:40,443
And in 100% of the cases
when we asked the families

148
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,367
they preferred the bathtub
over the water heater.

149
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,519
You have to understand

150
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,513
that they are coming
from no water, no sewage.

151
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:53,190
A shower meant to have a can with
water in the courtyard.

152
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,893
So they are going to have privacy.

153
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:58,950
More important than that,
when they move in,

154
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:05,395
they do not have money to pay
the gas bill to heat the water.

155
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:07,707
So knowing that in their priorities,

156
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,510
bathtub is much higher
than water heater,

157
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,994
let's do the bathtub,

158
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,678
and allow them over time
to buy the water heater.

159
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,901
Think about the final stage

160
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:34,266
and how design
can facilitate families' lives

161
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,077
to achieve that middle income
standard in the future.

162
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,119
That's how quality
should be measured.

163
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:45,372
And that is definitely not the way
social housing was

164
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,077
being measured, not the way
it was being designed.

165
00:12:56,626 --> 00:13:00,756
Historically cities have come into
being for many different reasons.

166
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:05,427
Cities grow up around
logistical issues,

167
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,058
for example, on a port.

168
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,566
Or somewhere that is advantageous
specifically for trade.

169
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,770
It's almost always
an economic question.

170
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:21,239
By the mid-1800's industrialization
had been a reality

171
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:25,368
for a couple of decades already in the
major cities of Western Europe,

172
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:29,397
and the congestion,
the insalubrity,

173
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:33,094
the un-livability of those cities

174
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:36,175
made it such that there needed to be
some sort of a solution.

175
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:42,800
In Paris, Baron Haussmann comes in
and radically demolishes the city

176
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:45,347
eliminating all
of its medieval streets,

177
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:48,746
its slums, and rebuilds the city

178
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:54,277
with the roundabouts and the other
iconic elements of Paris.

179
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,759
Unlike Europe,

180
00:13:55,867 --> 00:14:00,892
America's cities didn't have
a really strong architectural legacy.

181
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,289
City Beautiful was a movement

182
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:07,900
to bring the grand boulevards
and large civic arenas

183
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,622
of classical architecture
into American cities.

184
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:14,377
To encourage a kind of civic pride.

185
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:17,952
The next major shift would be
the Garden City movement,

186
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:21,167
which is happening right
at the end of the 19th century.

187
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:25,093
The idea would be to separate out the
different functions of the city

188
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:29,555
with concentric roadways
and greenbelts.

189
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,160
The Garden City proved
to be incredibly influential

190
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,587
on the Modernist movement.

191
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,483
Modern city/urban planning

192
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,870
is very similar
to modern graphic design

193
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:43,902
or modern industrial design.
It's minimalist,

194
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,285
very ordered, very rational,
separate everything out.

195
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:52,578
Brasilia was the ultimate
Modernistic city,

196
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:59,130
built on all the ideas of
the Modernistic manifests.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,157
It looks fantastic from the airplane,

198
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:04,584
but if you are down at eye level

199
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:08,009
on your feet and going
from one place to another,

200
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:10,561
Brasilia is a disaster.

201
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:15,645
Every distance is too wide,
things are not connected.

202
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:19,275
You have to trample
for endless miles and miles

203
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,732
along completely straight paths.

204
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:26,569
Nobody ever started to think about

205
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:33,039
what it would be to be out in Brasilia
in between all these monuments.

206
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:37,501
Of course it makes a certain logic
to separate things out.

207
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:42,052
You don't want cars and pedestrians in
the same place, it's not safe.

208
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:43,924
But as we've certainly
come to experience,

209
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,542
if you design the city

210
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:50,743
so that every single trip
has to made by car,

211
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,584
suddenly you aren't zipping
around anymore,

212
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:56,601
you're stuck
in enormous traffic jams.

213
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:13,034
The 1950's is when the automobile
starts to have a real impact

214
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:17,964
on cities, especially American cities,
and a largely a detrimental effect.

215
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,009
Not only do you have increased means
of access to the city,

216
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,839
bringing more cars, and creating
congestion, and noise,

217
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:29,050
but also radically changing the way
cities are designed.

218
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:33,284
And this is becoming increasingly
a global issue,

219
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:35,296
especially in developing countries.

220
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:56,249
Many things about cities are very
counterintuitive, for example

221
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:58,046
it seems to us that making bigger
roads, or flyovers,

222
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:02,548
or elevated highways
will solve traffic jams.

223
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,880
And clearly it has never been the case.

224
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:10,221
Because what creates traffic is
not the number of cars,

225
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,174
but the number of trips
and the length of trips.

226
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,318
So the more road infrastructure
you do,

227
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:17,558
the traffic will become even worse.

228
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:22,313
The only way to solve traffic jams
is to restrict car use.

229
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:27,990
And the most obvious way to restrict
car use is restricting parking.

230
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:32,916
People seem to imagine
that parking is...

231
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:35,363
a right, almost a fundamental right

232
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:38,133
to be included
in the United Nations Charter.

233
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,629
In our Constitution,
there are many rights:

234
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,337
the right to housing,
the right to education, to health,

235
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,593
but I don't find the right to park.

236
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:51,142
I don't see any Constitution which
includes the right to park.

237
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:55,480
So if you ask me where you should park,
the Mayor can tell them,

238
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,447
it's almost if you're asking me

239
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,018
where should put
your food or your clothes,

240
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:02,087
This is not a government problem.

241
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:06,734
Before I was Mayor,

242
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:11,213
I have never been in a city
which hated itself more than Bogota.

243
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,250
There was a total lack of self-esteem
and lack of hope.

244
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,251
So when I was elected mayor we
started investing in people.

245
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,040
In sidewalks, in parks,

246
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,538
in great schools, in libraries.

247
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:29,177
And also we created a bus-based
public transport system.

248
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:55,660
We copied a system from Curitiba,
a small city in Brazil.

249
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:59,287
We called it TransMilenio,
we gave it a name.

250
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:03,421
Because buses in most places have a...

251
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,087
stigma, a bad image of being
for the poor,

252
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:08,484
so we had to raise the bus's status.

253
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:10,968
TransMilenio bus system

254
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:16,724
actually works more like a subway
on wheels than a traditional bus.

255
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:20,521
Buses go on exclusive lanes.

256
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:24,146
People pay when they enter the station.

257
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:26,276
When the buses arrive,

258
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:30,658
the station doors open
simultaneously with the bus doors.

259
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:32,918
You can get a hundred people out

260
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,575
and hundred people
onto the bus in seconds.

261
00:21:42,706 --> 00:21:47,712
And now they can go from one extreme
to the other very fast.

262
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:54,268
For the same cost that we could do
a 25km subway,

263
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:58,268
we do 400km of TransMilineo.

264
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:01,358
These systems are also more flexible.

265
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:04,488
Younger cities don't have such
a defined center

266
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:05,949
and the center is shifting.

267
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:10,690
So if you put a hugely expensive
infrastructure like a subway line,

268
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:13,928
you might find that the

269
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:16,523
new center in a matter
of twenty or thirty years

270
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:19,417
is somewhere else where
the subway line doesn't go.

271
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:24,712
This system is very powerful
symbol of democracy.

272
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,629
The first article in every Constitution
says that...

273
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,060
The first article in every Constitution

274
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,293
says that all citizens
are equal before the law.

275
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,262
This is not just poetry.

276
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:42,025
It means for example
that a bus with 100 passengers

277
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,730
has a right to 100 times more
road space than a car with one.

278
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:48,393
It's democracy at work.

279
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,552
You can really see that public good
prevails over private interest.

280
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:07,985
Okay, here we are on part
of the Porvenir Promenade.

281
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:10,309
This is a 24km,

282
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,053
pedestrian and bicycle-only street,

283
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:17,120
which networks
very low income neighborhoods

284
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,261
to the richest area of the city.

285
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,542
I think it's a revolution
in the way urban life works.

286
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:27,341
This kind of high quality
infrastructure for bicycles

287
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,542
increases the social status
of cyclists.

288
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,024
Before we had bicycle ways,

289
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:35,126
low-income people
were ashamed of using bicycles.

290
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,119
Now a high-quality protected bicycle
way shows that

291
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,096
a citizen on a $30 bicycle

292
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:46,484
is equally important to one
in a $30,000 dollar car.

293
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,710
And here is something interesting,

294
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:51,684
you can see how the pedestrians
and bicycles have pavement,

295
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:53,674
and the cars are in the mud.

296
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:57,227
So it's a priority for the pedestrians
and the bicycles

297
00:23:57,552 --> 00:24:00,146
and then later sometime
we will pay for the cars.

298
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,630
But first the pedestrians.

299
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:05,996
So this completely shows respect
for human dignity, for everybody,

300
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,222
not just those who have cars

301
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:11,042
who normally think to be the important
ones in developing country cities.

302
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,373
Again, this democracy at work.

303
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:52,158
In Copenhagen we have,
for 30 or 40 years,

304
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,147
had this very distinctive policy

305
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:59,613
to invite people to bicycle
as much as possible.

306
00:25:00,993 --> 00:25:06,090
There is a complete network
of bicycle lanes citywide.

307
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,215
In what we call Copenhagen-style
bicycle lane.

308
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:14,014
We always have the bicycle lanes
next to the sidewalk.

309
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:19,095
The sidewalks are the slow traffic,
the bike lanes are a little bit faster,

310
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:23,979
and then there would be parked cars,
and then there would be the traffic.

311
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:28,404
In this way you have the parked cars
to protect the bicyclists,

312
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:32,360
instead of the bicyclists
to protect the parked cars.

313
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:38,665
It helps invite a lot of people
who would be too afraid to bicycle

314
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:44,872
to get the idea, "I can actually do it,
because now it is much safer."

315
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:49,585
In ten years we have seen
the bicycling doubling.

316
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:55,325
We have seen that now we have 37%
of everyone commuting to work

317
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:58,197
arriving on his bicycle.

318
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:04,767
It keeps people fit, it doesn't pollute
and it doesn't take up much space.

319
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,899
It's a really smart way
of getting around the city.

320
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:19,286
I think a good city
is like a good party.

321
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,278
If you ask a guy that was
at a good party on Friday,

322
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:27,005
he says "Oh my dear, I was only home
by 5;30 in the morning."

323
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:31,072
If people get involved in social
activities

324
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:34,937
they will forget place and time
and just enjoy.

325
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:37,849
That is why I would say, do not look at

326
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,765
how many people
are walking in the city,

327
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:43,225
but look at how many people
have stopped walking

328
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:46,730
to stay and enjoy what is there.

329
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:52,824
The challenge is how
do we make sure

330
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:56,995
that public open spaces
are inviting and well used.

331
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,700
And in these spaces, design detail
makes all the difference.

332
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:04,520
There should be multiple kinds
of seating,

333
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:08,751
many different reasons for people
to come into a space.

334
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:11,069
For instance, movable chairs.

335
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:14,799
People, when they sit in a chair
that's moveable,

336
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,585
they just move it so much.

337
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:20,300
So it's kind of their chair
and it's their place.

338
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:25,976
Movable chairs also let you socialize,
they let you be by yourself,

339
00:27:26,308 --> 00:27:29,608
they let you be part of the city,
or away from the city.

340
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:36,949
Knowing about Homo sapiens and
the kind of creature he is

341
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:39,895
has been a very important key

342
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:43,959
to understanding why some places
work and some places don't.

343
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,197
Much of it is bound to our senses,

344
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,097
how long you can see
and how long you can hear.

345
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:57,015
How your eye is horizontal,
you see very little upward,

346
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,702
you see much more downward,

347
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,437
and you see much,
much more out to either side.

348
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:05,852
That is leftover
from the evolutionary process,

349
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:09,812
when the walking animal was out
walking on the plains,

350
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:13,240
the enemies were out there
and in front of you,

351
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,444
but they were not up there.

352
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:19,663
But you should look out for snakes and
scorpions and boulders.

353
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,962
The eye can't command an area

354
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:28,270
more than about 100 meters
by 100 meters.

355
00:28:28,294 --> 00:28:32,672
That is the distance where you can see
other people and movements.

356
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,965
But if it gets bigger, the eye can't
see what's going on.

357
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:40,346
Then you feel less comfortable.

358
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:44,142
That's why nearly all the squares
in all the old cities

359
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:48,442
will be smaller than this 100 meters.

360
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:54,400
We are really talking about the urban
habitat of Homo sapiens.

361
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:57,993
It's the same Homo sapiens
all over the world.

362
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,572
Cultural circumstances differ

363
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,078
economic circumstances differ,

364
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,128
climatic circumstances differ,

365
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:08,954
but basically we are
the same little walking animal.

366
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:11,020
The rise of post-industrial sites in
cities around the world,

367
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,109
have come about only
in the last 30 or 40 years,

368
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,178
and people don't know
what to do with them.

369
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,037
They think should be removed
and erased.

370
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:23,114
What we've found over the
past 10 years is that you can

371
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:28,579
actually take these post-industrial
conditions and through creative design

372
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,710
actually produce something
that people love.

373
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,985
It's not erasure
and it's not preservation.

374
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,719
It's really transformation.

375
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,016
I lived about a block away from
the High Line for over 15 years,

376
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,938
and never paid it any attention at all.

377
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,107
Trains ran on the High Line
until about 1980

378
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,306
and then they stopped entirely.

379
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:55,652
It was the realization
that this thing was actually

380
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:59,092
this monumental structure
that ran 22 blocks,

381
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,709
three neighborhoods.

382
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,743
It just seemed like
this amazing opportunity

383
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:07,234
to experience the city
in a whole new way.

384
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,827
I'd read on the agenda
of a community board meeting

385
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:12,543
that it was going to be demolished.

386
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:15,343
And sat next to Josh, and we didn't
know each other,

387
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:19,514
and he was sort of interested
in it in the same way I was.

388
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:21,799
And no one else in the meeting
was interested.

389
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,935
There was one person who spoke
who I think was literally

390
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:28,310
frothing at the mouth about how
terrible the High Line was.

391
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:31,816
So after the meeting,
we exchanged business cards

392
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:34,503
and said, you know, "Why don't
we do something together?"

393
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,519
When we came up here we realized

394
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,821
there was something magical
up here already.

395
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:45,658
The High Line was this
extraordinary artifact,

396
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:51,421
rusting steel where grasses and flowers
had taken seed naturally.

397
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,386
As a landscape architect,

398
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:58,149
a question I always ask is what
will design actually mess up here.

399
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:01,557
What through design
will you anaesthetize?

400
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,384
Will you destroy?

401
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:06,929
Because a lot of these sites have
a sort of charm to them

402
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,435
that really I'm always looking to try
to capture and actually amplify.

403
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,550
It's much more about
a symbiotic relationship

404
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:22,528
between nature and civilization.

405
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:26,492
Because a city's a messy place.
And so there are lots of places

406
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:30,182
for nature to move in
and not take over

407
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,116
but form a relationship

408
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:35,536
with the urban infrastructure
in a really interesting way.

409
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:41,428
Having the grasses and flowers
come up through the paving

410
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,885
was a big part of the design.

411
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:50,357
It really is about showcasing Manhattan
in a way that is authentic.

412
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:53,105
It's not overly manicured,
or overly scripted.

413
00:32:57,481 --> 00:32:59,978
And the noises, I guess,
are part of it.

414
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:30,813
The fact that the High Line
was driven by, at the very start,

415
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:33,761
Robert and me, but very quickly a
large group of neighbors,

416
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:36,071
community members, New Yorkers

417
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,276
and ultimately people
from all over the country,

418
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:44,174
I think has imbued the park
with a communal sensibility

419
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,153
that very much effects
the environment that is up here.

420
00:33:48,283 --> 00:33:51,287
Underneath the design,
a lot of what we see today

421
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:56,420
is the result of the care and attention
that went into the zoning.

422
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,383
We were just passionate
about saving the High Line.

423
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:04,470
Zoning was just one piece of it, I only
played a role in the zoning,

424
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:07,555
and being obsessive I think I said,

425
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:10,743
if I didn't think about
the High Line every single day,

426
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:13,679
it was going to come down,
that was my mindset.

427
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:23,657
These are the two blocks we wanted
to talk to you about.

428
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,494
The Department of City Planning is
responsible for shaping

429
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:32,416
its neighborhoods, its waterfronts,
its industrial lands,

430
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:33,587
and its business districts.

431
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:37,091
Really shaping the form of the city

432
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:40,340
and where it's going grow, where
it's going to develop.

433
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:41,912
This is a double problem,

434
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:45,961
because not only have you lost
holding the street wall here,

435
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:48,595
you now have a building that is
very out of scale

436
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:52,057
with the Brooklyn Academy of Music
historical building.

437
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,915
We can't actually design
the architecture,

438
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:57,083
we can't design the storefront,

439
00:34:57,107 --> 00:35:00,043
but at least we can set up
these basic parameters

440
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,693
that give you the best possibility

441
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,771
that this will be a great street.

442
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,860
Our plans have really redrawn

443
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:10,868
the entire land use blueprint
of the city.

444
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:13,544
Because we have to grow by
over a million people.

445
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:17,132
And our plans have therefore been

446
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:21,720
as ambitious as those of Robert Moses.

447
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:25,762
But we really judge ourselves by
Jane Jacobs' standards.

448
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,804
Robert Moses was
"the master builder."

449
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:33,725
He planned looking at the
city from above

450
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:39,447
and his highway building destroyed
entire neighborhoods.

451
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:43,409
He cutoff our entire island
of Manhattan

452
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:47,429
from the waterfront by building
highways down the edges.

453
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:50,109
His impact was profound

454
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:56,692
and his insensitivity was legendary
to the texture of the city.

455
00:35:57,998 --> 00:36:02,299
His downfall came at the same time as
the rise of Jane Jacobs.

456
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:07,968
Jane Jacobs was a journalist,

457
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,851
she was not trained as a professional
architect or planner.

458
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:15,309
In the early '60s, there was a plan

459
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:19,818
to put through some major highways that
would have knocked down

460
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:23,276
most of Greenwich Village, which
was her neighborhood.

461
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:30,166
And she began to write about what
she thought the planners

462
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,343
really weren't seeing
and understanding.

463
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:37,528
They were looking at problems
from the 30,000 feet height,

464
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:39,823
and she was really looking at it
from the perspective of someone

465
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:42,080
living there on the street.

466
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:47,337
She was really the first voice
who came out and argued that

467
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:50,385
these aren't just these old,
overcrowded,

468
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:52,583
small, chopped up little spaces.

469
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:56,768
Instead, there is an incredibly rich
social structure here

470
00:36:56,952 --> 00:36:58,878
that actually works incredibly well.

471
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,678
Communities had a mix of uses.

472
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:04,837
You had people living there,
working there, you had shops.

473
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:09,035
She talked about the importance
of having "eyes on the street".

474
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:11,479
Of people who know each other

475
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,402
and make the street a more safer
and comfortable place.

476
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:20,504
What Jane Jacobs was able to describe,
I think incredibly accurately,

477
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:23,769
is there's something about the DNA
of cities and the relationship between

478
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:26,400
physical space and social fabric.

479
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:35,771
She recognized that the minute
you put people into a housing block

480
00:37:36,517 --> 00:37:38,869
you lose the fundamental social
infrastructure

481
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:41,052
which makes community possible.

482
00:37:42,064 --> 00:37:44,297
So schools,
where people meet informally.

483
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:47,169
They weren't necessarily close
to where people were living.

484
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:51,332
So much effort and interest went into
creating the house unit,

485
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:56,163
that little attention went into,
well what happens on the outside?

486
00:37:56,662 --> 00:38:00,917
Where do kids play? Where do mothers
look at their kids playing?

487
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,460
Jane Jacobs recognized the difference

488
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,712
between people
and different activities

489
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:11,224
pushed together is what a city
is about at its best.

490
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:17,435
She attributed most of these problems
to the loss of the heart of the city.

491
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:22,193
That as people move out of the city,
the sense of the civic center

492
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:23,865
is really being lost.

493
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,218
From the beginning of recorded time,

494
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:38,444
there's been this vacillation
between the desirability of living

495
00:38:38,468 --> 00:38:42,417
in the periphery of the city,
and living in the center.

496
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:54,688
After WWII, suddenly we began
a pattern of development that was

497
00:38:55,055 --> 00:38:57,353
absolutely based on suburbanization.

498
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:00,690
Getting out into the suburbs,
with a car,

499
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:04,558
was considered
a tremendous step up

500
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,366
from what at the time was perceived
as overcrowding in the cities.

501
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,048
The American Dream
was home ownership

502
00:39:13,265 --> 00:39:15,256
and one's own little piece of dirt.

503
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:25,127
Defining sprawl is a little bit
like defining pornography.

504
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:26,888
You know it when you see it.

505
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:32,862
There is no consensus on any one
single definition of sprawl.

506
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:38,025
But as the basic process of
suburbanization has been continuing,

507
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,553
we've been getting more and more
of these massive developments,

508
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,098
by large home builders,

509
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:47,196
where every house is the cookie cutter
looking exactly the same.

510
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:50,102
Multiply that by having chain
store retail

511
00:39:50,142 --> 00:39:54,581
where every single big box store
looks exactly the same.

512
00:39:55,157 --> 00:39:56,119
More and more cars,

513
00:39:56,281 --> 00:40:00,065
that require us to drive
much longer distances.

514
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:03,428
That's when people really start
saying, "This is now sprawl.

515
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:06,163
This is not just suburbia."

516
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,147
The main negative of sprawl,

517
00:40:09,227 --> 00:40:12,563
as it is used
as a pejorative term to me,

518
00:40:12,587 --> 00:40:15,730
is it spreads everyone out over
a larger area of land,

519
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:18,316
and eats up the bucolic,

520
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:22,066
rural villages of Vermont,

521
00:40:22,395 --> 00:40:25,990
by overrunning them with subdivisions
and that...

522
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:29,159
that would be a better lifestyle
to preserve.

523
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,373
So there's a perception, if you
listen to NPR, that...

524
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:37,835
sprawl is always bad, and Phoenix is a
poster child for bad sprawl.

525
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,997
But Phoenix is not a city where we're
taking a high-density population

526
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:44,359
and redistributing it at a low density.

527
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,127
We're building at the same density
we've always lived at.

528
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:51,501
Nor are we overrunning rural,
pastoral landscapes.

529
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,802
Now, we are eating up desert.

530
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,976
And the desert is really beautiful
here and really important.

531
00:40:57,347 --> 00:41:00,351
And we've tried to learn a better
way to develop in the desert.

532
00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:03,612
But I don't think this is a poster
child for sprawl.

533
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,982
This is a poster child
for an automobile oriented,

534
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,489
post-war urban fabric.

535
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:11,869
This is what you get.

536
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,355
You're not buying "sprawl
is always bad

537
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:15,738
and density is always good"?

538
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:17,991
No, you know, here's the deal.
Let's be honest.

539
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:19,059
I live on a 3/4 acre lot

540
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:21,317
and I like my backyard
and I like my swimming pool.

541
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:24,264
And I think living in a condo
would be cute and interesting,

542
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,336
and I'd like to do it about
two months out of the year,

543
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:27,494
but I like the way I live.

544
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:31,029
That's really what it's all about,
at the end of the day.

545
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,595
While I have my preferences
of where I want to live,

546
00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:37,439
I certainly would never tell anybody

547
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:41,345
mine is right choice and everyone else
has made the wrong choice.

548
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:44,640
But I do think especially
with the environmental crisis

549
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,642
and issues of climate change,

550
00:41:47,148 --> 00:41:49,465
that we do as a society

551
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:52,692
have to begin to decide
whether some of these choices

552
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:55,433
come with additional costs.

553
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:59,703
It's certainly not about eliminating
the suburbs.

554
00:42:00,244 --> 00:42:02,622
But we need a different vision,

555
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:07,711
with walkable, compact,
connected communities.

556
00:42:09,128 --> 00:42:14,135
Cities are extremely dynamic organisms.
Throughout the history of the world

557
00:42:14,468 --> 00:42:18,598
we've watched cities that bloomed
and then collapsed.

558
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:23,562
And similarly we see now amongst our
cities and our suburbs,

559
00:42:23,936 --> 00:42:27,566
some of them are growing
and still booming

560
00:42:27,898 --> 00:42:29,686
and more and more people
want to live there,

561
00:42:30,354 --> 00:42:32,120
and others are shrinking.

562
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:33,344
Detroit was once two million people.

563
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:39,647
And a metropolitan area that really was
the center of industrial production,

564
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:43,192
not just in the United States,
but in the world.

565
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:46,904
The city has shrunk back
to about 700,000 people.

566
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:51,860
It's a city of 138 square miles.
You could fit Boston, San Francisco,

567
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:55,992
and Atlanta inside the boundaries
of the city of Detroit.

568
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:57,956
It's that big.

569
00:43:58,574 --> 00:44:02,704
So when you have 700,000 people as
opposed to two million people,

570
00:44:03,037 --> 00:44:06,541
you've got to scale back to your
neighborhoods and your areas

571
00:44:06,874 --> 00:44:07,856
where there is concentration,

572
00:44:08,057 --> 00:44:11,257
where there is this livability
and urbanity.

573
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,304
My grandmother bought the
house we're in in 1969.

574
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,224
When I was a kid it was like
a village, you know?

575
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:24,183
We had car dealerships,

576
00:44:24,957 --> 00:44:28,102
clothing stores, bars, lounges,

577
00:44:28,658 --> 00:44:31,565
theaters, restaurants.
Everything you could imagine.

578
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:33,533
You didn't have
to leave the neighborhood.

579
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:35,078
You just had everything here.

580
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:40,417
And people just picked
up and moved away.

581
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:45,923
And now, we got a bunch of vacant lots
in our neighborhood.

582
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:48,908
In 2008, I came outside

583
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:52,258
and saw a bunch of garbage
on the curbs and in the lots.

584
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:54,569
That's something I never saw
in the neighborhood

585
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,022
and I wanted to do something
about it.

586
00:44:57,468 --> 00:45:00,312
Being out here cleaning up, we were
able to talk to neighbors,

587
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,478
people were coming up to see
what we were doing.

588
00:45:02,807 --> 00:45:03,638
And we found out that

589
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:08,832
some people were choosing food
over medicine or medicine over food.

590
00:45:09,063 --> 00:45:11,691
So we started a community
garden project.

591
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,552
It kind of turned into
healthy food choices,

592
00:45:14,752 --> 00:45:17,432
cheap food, because we were
giving it away for free.

593
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:21,789
We got hot peppers,
two beds of okra,

594
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:25,871
in the back corner's two beds
of mustard and turnip greens.

595
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:29,627
We have 31 raised beds for vegetables.

596
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,537
And across the street,
there's two vacant lots

597
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:33,129
where we did an orchard

598
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:37,017
and across the street from that
is our community center.

599
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:41,639
And down the street we have two
more community gardens.

600
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,300
The guy that just walked past.

601
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:46,978
His brother is 22 or 23 years old now.

602
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:49,827
The first time he saw me picking
carrots out of the garden.

603
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:52,846
- He said, "Are those carrots?"
- "Yeah."

604
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:55,347
"I didn't know carrots came out
of the ground!"

605
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:58,220
I was like, "Where you think they
came from?" - "Out of the bag!"

606
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:03,373
You're kidding me?
You didn't watch Bugs Bunny?

607
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:07,338
We don't own the lots.
The city owns them.

608
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:09,658
But other than letting us do it,

609
00:46:09,797 --> 00:46:11,938
that's really the only thing
the city's done.

610
00:46:11,962 --> 00:46:15,007
It's our blood sweat and tears
that've done it.

611
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:22,477
I definitely don't expect everyone
to do what I do, but...

612
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,145
I'm trying to say this nicely;

613
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:28,068
you need to get off your butt and
take care your own.

614
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:31,245
If you take care of your own,
everything else will fall into place.

615
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,534
There's a lot of parts of the city
where stuff like this is happening.

616
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,829
There are a lot of community
gardens going on.

617
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:40,708
Maybe not on this big of scale,

618
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,536
but all of us want to do
something like this.

619
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:46,480
I would almost use the term

620
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:51,147
"self-organized urbanism"
to describe what's going on there.

621
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:56,129
In the sense that there is
a kind of possibility,

622
00:46:56,432 --> 00:46:59,955
a sort of DIY aesthetic that does
in fact exist in the city

623
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:04,320
that is allowing for a lot
of individual initiatives to happen.

624
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,268
And you see that in the urban
agricultural movement

625
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:09,038
not only with community gardens,

626
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:12,483
but also with these large-scale
commercial gardens.

627
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:15,403
There are all sorts of different
retrofitting practices,

628
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:17,311
not only on an urban scale

629
00:47:17,363 --> 00:47:20,855
but also on an architectural
micro-scale happening in the city.

630
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:26,212
If we think creatively,
if we think as entrepreneurs,

631
00:47:26,537 --> 00:47:27,983
there is no reason

632
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:31,552
why in 15, 25, 35 years

633
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:35,547
we shouldn't be looking
at a very different Detroit.

634
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:38,874
But we have to change our mental state.

635
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,911
We should be innovating
on how to crack the code

636
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:43,904
on low carbon and climate change.

637
00:47:44,013 --> 00:47:46,988
And we should be doing that in places
like Southeast Michigan,

638
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:49,529
given the legacy of production,
and innovation,

639
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:52,341
and science, and engineering.
That's what we should be doing.

640
00:47:53,898 --> 00:47:55,903
Because at the end of the day,

641
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:57,909
cities are competing for people,

642
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,168
they're competing for investment.

643
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:03,241
And so how they develop,
whether they're livable,

644
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:04,825
whether they're sustainable,

645
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:07,168
whether they're economically
focused,

646
00:48:07,248 --> 00:48:09,583
whether they're easy places
to do business in,

647
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,910
will affect their prosperity now
and over time.

648
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,561
Today's Beijing, when I go through it,

649
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:06,481
I see a city I don't recognize.

650
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:11,566
It's a new Beijing,
but I'm not sure if I like it.

651
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:22,756
When I was growing up,
my family,

652
00:49:23,914 --> 00:49:25,540
we would take a walk,

653
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:28,749
after dinner,
summertime, typically.

654
00:49:29,622 --> 00:49:31,295
And then we'd meet people,

655
00:49:31,874 --> 00:49:37,881
friends and relatives, and then
you stop and greet them.

656
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:44,304
That kind of a feeling of living in a
city is not here anymore.

657
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,848
It's gone.

658
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:54,523
In the past 30 years, cities were
conceived and designed

659
00:49:54,897 --> 00:49:59,403
to be part of the economical
development, which is okay

660
00:49:59,735 --> 00:50:05,959
but I think livability has really been
ignored until very recently.

661
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:09,880
So it's not convenient.
It's not comfortable.

662
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:13,248
Those mistakes,
they didn't have to happen,

663
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:17,013
even if you build a city fast.

664
00:50:19,006 --> 00:50:20,429
The Chinese are basically struggling

665
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:23,513
with of course with the same issues,
struggling with traffic,

666
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:27,168
struggling with public space,
struggling with density,

667
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:30,674
struggling with how big
a city should be,

668
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:33,104
should it have history,
should it not have history.

669
00:50:33,437 --> 00:50:37,205
So I think all the issues
are essentially the same.

670
00:50:44,114 --> 00:50:45,411
Every major building

671
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:49,386
really demands
its own specific scenario

672
00:50:49,598 --> 00:50:52,000
in terms of what you are trying
to achieve with it.

673
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:54,932
The first consideration

674
00:50:55,149 --> 00:51:00,149
is how could you create place
in a collection of high rise towers.

675
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,197
Because towers basically consume place,

676
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:08,893
but very few towers manage to create
a larger then itself moment.

677
00:51:10,224 --> 00:51:12,693
And that really explains its shape.

678
00:51:13,061 --> 00:51:15,090
For me one of the more
interesting parts of it

679
00:51:15,265 --> 00:51:19,023
is that it's a building
that doesn't have a single identity,

680
00:51:19,428 --> 00:51:22,128
and that the slightest movement
in the city

681
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:25,236
actually changes
the building completely.

682
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:31,088
It has an almost unlimited amount
of different identities.

683
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:52,610
There is an incredible amount of wasted
effort in the industry.

684
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:54,039
A fair amount of it is

685
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:59,029
generated through
the procedure of competitions.

686
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,433
Which is really a complete drain
of intelligence.

687
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:06,604
I don't know any other profession
that would tolerate this.

688
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:09,141
At the same time you are important,

689
00:52:09,552 --> 00:52:11,435
we invite your thinking,

690
00:52:12,086 --> 00:52:15,668
but we also announce
that there is an 80% chance

691
00:52:15,853 --> 00:52:17,585
that we will through away
your thinking

692
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:22,026
and make sure
that it is completely wasted.

693
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:30,106
I think that very few cities these
days are really designed.

694
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:35,029
And there's been very little rethinking
of what cities can be.

695
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,471
Particularly...

696
00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:40,710
since we have entrusted in the
market economy so much power.

697
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:50,523
Since we're still right in the middle
of a very fast urbanization,

698
00:52:50,575 --> 00:52:53,217
cities will be built fast,

699
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:58,440
but I hope,
I really hope that collectively

700
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:03,498
we can correct some of the mistakes
made in the past 30 years.

701
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:09,306
As China builds its cities,
as India builds its cities,

702
00:53:09,638 --> 00:53:13,984
it can't just take the recipe
from 20th century America

703
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:18,486
and apply it to 21st century China
or 21 st century India.

704
00:53:18,814 --> 00:53:20,853
That would be horrendous for them

705
00:53:21,084 --> 00:53:23,421
and it would be horrendous
frankly for all of us.

706
00:53:54,017 --> 00:53:57,533
Cities today consume 75%
of the world's energy

707
00:53:57,755 --> 00:54:00,869
and therefore contribute
to 75% of CO2 emissions.

708
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,261
Added to that,

709
00:54:03,813 --> 00:54:08,126
40 years from now FA of the world's
population will be living in cities

710
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:11,662
and they will consume
more and more energy.

711
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:14,543
So a small reduction of the
environmental footprint

712
00:54:14,872 --> 00:54:17,842
and energy footprint of a city has a
massive impact on the planet.

713
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:30,480
We're interested in making people

714
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,699
more aware
of their patterns of behavior

715
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:34,437
so that potentially
they can change them.

716
00:54:35,977 --> 00:54:39,322
In this project we were interested
in electricity usage.

717
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:49,705
We actually went for a very low-tech
method of recording electricity usage.

718
00:54:49,907 --> 00:54:51,580
So rather than using smart sensors,

719
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,389
each day we got participants
on Tidy Street

720
00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:56,307
to go down
to their electricity meter,

721
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:57,725
note down the reading

722
00:54:57,777 --> 00:55:01,025
and then they went to our website
and put that number in.

723
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:06,613
We were interested in doing
a public display,

724
00:55:07,196 --> 00:55:10,641
so we turned the street essentially
into a big graph.

725
00:55:14,182 --> 00:55:17,131
On the street, we show
how the average usage

726
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:20,240
of the participants compares
to the Brighton average.

727
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:21,382
It's 500 feet long,

728
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:23,381
we recorded for three weeks,

729
00:55:23,892 --> 00:55:25,780
and each day we show
how they compare.

730
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:27,628
So if you're looking down the street,

731
00:55:27,797 --> 00:55:31,208
you can see how their electricity
usage has changed over time.

732
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:34,629
It's woken us up.

733
00:55:34,954 --> 00:55:38,424
I'm not very technological, is it?
So I did my best.

734
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:44,802
And I try to unplug things and so on,
but it has made us very conscious

735
00:55:45,381 --> 00:55:48,351
of what we use, and what we waste.

736
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:52,393
It wasn't really so much
about the numbers as

737
00:55:52,722 --> 00:55:54,184
where your wiggly line was going

738
00:55:54,209 --> 00:55:56,841
in relation
to the street's Wiggly line.

739
00:55:57,226 --> 00:56:02,073
Seeing the information graphically
really focused you into

740
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,490
thinking about things you leave
on that you don't need to.

741
00:56:07,403 --> 00:56:08,213
Mine was quite high,

742
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:10,760
so I needed to in the community spirit
try to get that down

743
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:13,683
rather than bring the street average
up and above.

744
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:16,672
So I started changing the way
I did things.

745
00:56:17,238 --> 00:56:19,160
One of the pieces of technology
we gave the participants

746
00:56:19,193 --> 00:56:20,711
was an appliance meter.

747
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:24,090
I think that was really important,
because once they got an idea

748
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,659
about how their overall electricity
usage was changing,

749
00:56:26,662 --> 00:56:30,071
they then wanted to identify
which particular appliances were

750
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:31,540
were using more electricity.

751
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:33,800
We'd see just how greedy

752
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:36,203
some of the devices
we had in the house were.

753
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,134
Halogen lighting,
very very greedy.

754
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:40,961
The television, not so bad.
The kettle...

755
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:44,381
We have to ration how many cups
of tea we have everyday

756
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:47,316
because it uses up so much electricity.

757
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:49,080
But it does make you very aware
of what you're using.

758
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,779
Everybody that walked by,

759
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:55,547
you could see them examining
the street art,

760
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,372
trying to understand what it was.

761
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,033
There was a lot of conversation
that went on in the street.

762
00:57:00,174 --> 00:57:02,476
You were always talking
about the project.

763
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,018
When people were walking down
on Saturday,

764
00:57:04,036 --> 00:57:06,156
they wanted to talk about the project.

765
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,903
So I think it genuinely raised
the profile,

766
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:10,669
having this thing in the road.

767
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,820
Over the first three weeks
of the project,

768
00:57:13,281 --> 00:57:16,774
the average electricity usage
of the participants came down by 15%.

769
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,265
So it's promising.

770
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,884
And we're hoping that
that change will be sustained.

771
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,733
I'd thought about energy use
in general,

772
00:57:25,048 --> 00:57:27,439
but I hadn't thought about how
I would change my behavior,

773
00:57:27,594 --> 00:57:28,919
I didn't do anything about it.

774
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:32,742
By participating in the project,
what it did was just make me act on it

775
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,922
as opposed to think nice thoughts
about perhaps doing something.

776
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:42,878
The main lessons we can learn about
sustainability from this project

777
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,742
is that although it starts
with individuals,

778
00:57:45,063 --> 00:57:49,003
a really important factor in people's
behavior is their community.

779
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,434
People are influenced by what
other people are doing around them.

780
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,658
So if you can engage them
as a community,

781
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:55,582
they seem to be more motivated

782
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:58,392
and more likely
to change their behavior.

783
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:06,276
Maybe out of these extreme
energy pressures,

784
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:11,616
the positive aspects of human nature,
the quest for innovation,

785
00:58:11,948 --> 00:58:15,297
for inquiry, will lead to something
which is

786
00:58:15,561 --> 00:58:18,250
more exciting, more sustainable.

787
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:22,406
As an architect,
if you are not an optimist

788
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,059
you're not going to be able
to survive professionally.

789
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:28,799
So you have a belief in the future.

790
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:34,522
The big transformation of the city
happened through technology.

791
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:38,142
For example, in the past,

792
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:42,933
technology that would take away
the open sewers

793
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:46,527
and create the networks of roads.

794
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:50,830
What is the equivalent now
of those new technologies?

795
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:14,558
Rio is like your wife
or your mother-in-law.

796
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:17,106
I mean, you can say bad things
about them,

797
00:59:17,515 --> 00:59:21,361
but you never let people say
bad things about Rio.

798
00:59:26,816 --> 00:59:30,996
You can use technology not only
for preventing disaster,

799
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:33,198
not only for security.

800
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:34,557
What we try to do here

801
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:38,302
is how can we take care of
the everyday life of the people

802
00:59:38,762 --> 00:59:39,814
using technology.

803
00:59:50,516 --> 00:59:52,018
This operations center that we built,

804
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:54,511
you've got all the departments
of the city there.

805
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:57,431
You've got a big screen with the
garbage company of the city,

806
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:01,060
civil defense which is taking care
of disasters,

807
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:03,584
there's the social assistance there,

808
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:06,388
there's the subway,
there's the trains,

809
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,568
there's the power company,
there's the gas company,

810
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:12,438
you've got the school system,
the health system.

811
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:14,908
I mean you have it all there
on a big screen.

812
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:16,910
Bigger than NASA, that's what I like.

813
01:00:17,368 --> 01:00:19,183
It's something that you can use

814
01:00:19,235 --> 01:00:21,741
to really make the departments
work together.

815
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:27,053
Let me give you an example. If you
see in the power grid,

816
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:31,122
there is a lack of energy in a
certain area of the city,

817
01:00:31,783 --> 01:00:34,267
you can connect straight
to all the hospitals

818
01:00:34,846 --> 01:00:37,362
and schools there
and get the city ready.

819
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:39,407
With the information you can get,

820
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,811
and all the changes you can make,

821
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:43,222
you can really change
the everyday life of the city.

822
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:48,738
When you go to the favelas,

823
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:52,791
the big problem that we face
is taking care of this security issue.

824
01:00:53,353 --> 01:00:55,421
They don't have big roads
inside the favelas.

825
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:59,505
They are always narrow streets,
dark spaces,

826
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:01,731
and obviously that's bad for security.

827
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:03,919
So when you put good lights
on streets,

828
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:08,455
open big spaces for squares
where people can meet.

829
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,762
You change completely the security
aspect of the place.

830
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,862
Khayelitsha's a very interesting story.

831
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:36,788
It's one of the youngest
townships in South Africa.

832
01:01:37,117 --> 01:01:40,337
It was built in the 1980s.

833
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:43,537
It offered the latest example

834
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:48,053
of the then local authority
trying to concentrate the growing

835
01:01:48,215 --> 01:01:52,521
African black population in the city,
at the periphery of the city.

836
01:01:53,758 --> 01:01:55,226
It was specifically developed

837
01:01:55,552 --> 01:01:59,307
as a dormitory residential area
with no economic base,

838
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:03,689
no real industry, economy,
nothing like that.

839
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:08,783
People were required to travel out
of the area to gain access to jobs.

840
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:13,483
And it was characterized
by very poor health conditions

841
01:02:13,656 --> 01:02:16,273
and very high violent crime rates.

842
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,793
What's interesting about Khayelitsha

843
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:23,715
is the storm water systems, that were
designed by engineering standards,

844
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,817
which create large,
vast tracts of open,

845
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:30,365
underutilized land,
which become crime hotspots.

846
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:33,173
The idea was to transform

847
01:02:33,522 --> 01:02:36,945
the very unsafe areas that form
part of the storm water system

848
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:38,937
into something that is more positive.

849
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:45,486
Those spaces were used by gangsters
to attack the community

850
01:02:45,853 --> 01:02:47,479
when they go to work,
when they pass by.

851
01:02:47,658 --> 01:02:49,449
People were robbed,
they were mugged,

852
01:02:49,775 --> 01:02:53,200
people's stuff was taken by the thugs.

853
01:02:53,528 --> 01:02:55,539
And when VPUU was introduced

854
01:02:55,761 --> 01:02:59,122
into the community
by the KDF and the city,

855
01:03:00,252 --> 01:03:02,257
that made a big change.

856
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:08,216
VPUU is Violence Prevention
through Urban Upgrading.

857
01:03:08,843 --> 01:03:11,174
The project looks at those problems

858
01:03:11,379 --> 01:03:14,724
and creates interventions,
and it might not just be buildings,

859
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,473
it could be occupying space
but it could be something

860
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:21,649
as simple as lighting or paving.

861
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:26,001
The first one we started working on
was the pedestrian walkway

862
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:29,335
that extended from Khayelitsha
railway station,

863
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:33,031
across the suburb of Harare, towards
the informal settlement.

864
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:36,531
Historically the way urban design
has happened

865
01:03:36,864 --> 01:03:39,663
in South Africa is along what
are seen as major routes,

866
01:03:39,992 --> 01:03:42,245
and that's where all the
infrastructure happens.

867
01:03:42,578 --> 01:03:45,707
The different tack that VPUU took is
they actually spoke with the community.

868
01:03:46,415 --> 01:03:49,742
Which meant that the decision
as to where pedestrian routes went

869
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,505
wasn't the normative position,

870
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:54,309
but more where people were walking,

871
01:03:54,937 --> 01:03:56,384
which were those desire lines,

872
01:03:56,568 --> 01:03:58,805
which cut their way
through the settlement.

873
01:04:02,682 --> 01:04:06,357
Your communities, you empower them.

874
01:04:06,686 --> 01:04:10,437
It's not imposition,
but it's engagement.

875
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:14,287
It's what we call
negotiated development.

876
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:16,580
It's not top down, it's bottom up.

877
01:04:17,948 --> 01:04:21,168
The community said they wanted
safe pedestrian routes.

878
01:04:22,077 --> 01:04:23,643
What makes spaces unsafe,

879
01:04:23,883 --> 01:04:27,146
in Kayelitsha or anywhere at night,
is when there's not good lighting,

880
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:29,491
and where the surface isn't smooth
and easy to walk on.

881
01:04:29,685 --> 01:04:32,353
You can easily trip
or someone can easily hide.

882
01:04:33,005 --> 01:04:36,100
The idea is that you have really
good lighting in space.

883
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:37,661
At night, when they go on,

884
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:41,011
there's this cover
that makes the space safer.

885
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:47,362
Another idea of this linkage,
in this route,

886
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:52,067
was every 500 meters you would have
a lookout point, or lookout tower.

887
01:04:53,526 --> 01:04:54,912
Part of the whole strategy plan

888
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,585
was to create a series
of these active boxes,

889
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:02,164
specifically along the pedestrian
walkway, to provide places of safety.

890
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:05,121
So if for instance you're walking along
that pedestrian route

891
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:07,730
and you feel unsafe for any reason,

892
01:05:07,874 --> 01:05:10,311
you can always see
where the next active box is

893
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,132
and you know that you can go there
and be safe.

894
01:05:14,184 --> 01:05:15,837
They're designed in such a way
to provide

895
01:05:16,087 --> 01:05:18,610
an identity and also to provide

896
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:23,015
a vertical element that one could see
as one was walking along.

897
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:28,063
We've used red in this case so they're
very clearly visible during the day,

898
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:32,366
and then they're down lit at nighttime,
so they're light boxes at night.

899
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,455
They're occupied 24/7

900
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,557
so there's always a caretaker,
somebody always involved.

901
01:05:40,532 --> 01:05:44,250
And they form little points where
you can also have economic activity

902
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,553
and just coming together of community.

903
01:05:53,879 --> 01:05:57,634
What's also very lacking in the area is
a place for children to play,

904
01:05:57,967 --> 01:06:01,562
so that was another aspect that we
worked in the urban design.

905
01:06:02,137 --> 01:06:03,600
Because people are moving through it,

906
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:06,213
it's constantly observed,
so it's fairly safe.

907
01:06:08,103 --> 01:06:11,031
With all this upgrading,
people now have pride in it

908
01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:12,821
and they want to be part of it.

909
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:15,908
The murder rate has come down
by approximately 40%

910
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:19,812
since VPUU started in this area.

911
01:06:22,409 --> 01:06:25,959
It's like a sun lighting
in a dark place.

912
01:06:26,288 --> 01:06:28,324
And even though
there's still a lot of things

913
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:30,881
VPUU needs to put in Khayelitsha,

914
01:06:31,126 --> 01:06:37,304
the stride that they've taken gives
the Khayelitsha people a hope of life.

915
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:41,720
Parents now are starting
to see that their kids

916
01:06:42,304 --> 01:06:47,106
are safer now because there's a place
for them where they come and play.

917
01:06:48,644 --> 01:06:51,614
The kids are playing
and the kids are safe.

918
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,422
When you have extreme conditions
like that,

919
01:07:25,703 --> 01:07:28,574
the answer's not for government
to sort of float in

920
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,188
and to say what the solution is

921
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,489
and to, in a way,
impose it on people.

922
01:07:33,982 --> 01:07:36,923
But that paradoxically even though
the needs are obvious,

923
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,105
it then becomes even more important

924
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:42,298
to systematically involve people
who live these realities

925
01:07:42,752 --> 01:07:46,979
in trying to figure out what's
the most strategic way to respond.

926
01:08:01,051 --> 01:08:04,646
In New Orleans, the devastation
was so widespread.

927
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:07,813
It was a tragic horror.

928
01:08:09,644 --> 01:08:11,928
And the problem
with the Lower 9th Ward is,

929
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,771
there was no recovery plan.

930
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:17,563
It's like a bunch of architects
from the West Coast

931
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:19,556
coming in
and doing all these buildings.

932
01:08:20,446 --> 01:08:22,737
To do something like that
without a plan,

933
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:26,959
without a landscape plan,
without a landscape architect,

934
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:30,590
is just against every
simple little rule.

935
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:34,897
It's something where architects
had a lot of fun,

936
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,441
at some great expense.

937
01:08:38,298 --> 01:08:40,344
I mean I'm thrilled
that they're doing it,

938
01:08:40,427 --> 01:08:44,380
because the notoriety
for the city has been fantastic,

939
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:47,378
and the movie star lives
like a block away from me.

940
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:49,293
I can't remember his name.

941
01:08:50,685 --> 01:08:51,911
Whatever his name is.

942
01:08:52,354 --> 01:08:54,069
- Brad Pitt?
- Brad Pitt!

943
01:08:54,093 --> 01:08:56,109
My wife saw Brad Pitt this morning!

944
01:08:57,443 --> 01:09:01,949
What Mr. Pitt and his foundation
is doing is wonderful,

945
01:09:02,322 --> 01:09:05,225
and now, everyone wants to go
to the Lower 9th Ward.

946
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,275
And the minute they get there,
they go,

947
01:09:07,327 --> 01:09:09,037
"Oh my gosh, what is this?"

948
01:09:09,881 --> 01:09:12,442
I mean it looks like you're
in California somewhere,

949
01:09:12,704 --> 01:09:14,673
by the beach, in Malibu.

950
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,079
That's what it looks like to me.

951
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:21,593
It looks like my best friend's
mother's beach house.

952
01:09:23,427 --> 01:09:26,226
Just because the architects are
so divinely wonderful,

953
01:09:27,307 --> 01:09:30,652
isn't going to make a place wonderful.

954
01:09:32,187 --> 01:09:35,361
In New Orleans people talk
about planning fatigue.

955
01:09:35,732 --> 01:09:41,034
After Katrina, lots of people went
to lots of community meetings

956
01:09:41,362 --> 01:09:43,865
and put lots of stickers
on lots of maps.

957
01:09:44,866 --> 01:09:50,339
Oftentimes they didn't really see any
noticeable change. So I thought, well,

958
01:09:50,663 --> 01:09:53,467
what if local residents
had better tools

959
01:09:53,512 --> 01:09:58,301
to shape the future businesses
in their neighborhood and beyond?

960
01:09:58,325 --> 01:10:00,914
And so I thought, well there are
a lot of vacant storefronts,

961
01:10:01,077 --> 01:10:03,417
where better to ask for civic input

962
01:10:03,468 --> 01:10:05,766
than on the very space that
we are trying to improve.

963
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:11,478
I put grids of stickers on neglected
buildings around the city,

964
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,078
and a little sharpie pen,

965
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:17,670
for people who are walking by
to write what they wish was there.

966
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,075
They're made of vinyl,
so they're very sticky

967
01:10:22,404 --> 01:10:25,658
but future business owners can remove
them without damaging property.

968
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:30,289
I've been blown away by
the range of responses.

969
01:10:47,138 --> 01:10:48,280
It leads to bigger questions,

970
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:49,958
like what if residents
had better tools

971
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:52,124
to shape and develop
their neighborhoods.

972
01:10:52,227 --> 01:10:58,030
We're the ones who know what business
we need, what things need fixing.

973
01:10:58,358 --> 01:11:02,613
It's like a love child of urban
planning and street art.

974
01:11:05,073 --> 01:11:07,190
There are so many things, living
in the same neighborhood,

975
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,563
that we could actually share
with each other

976
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:11,135
that would help us understand
what's going on.

977
01:11:11,316 --> 01:11:13,226
You know, share local information.

978
01:11:13,498 --> 01:11:17,548
Now it's kind of funny that it's easier
to reach out to the entire world,

979
01:11:18,044 --> 01:11:20,092
than it is to reach out
to your neighborhood.

980
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:23,179
If you look at the messages
in public space,

981
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:27,689
you might think all we care about are
sexy beers and fruity shampoos

982
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:29,774
and the latest Hollywood movies, right?

983
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:33,091
And you think, does that really
reflect what's important to us?

984
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:34,716
I think we really need to consider

985
01:11:34,731 --> 01:11:37,379
whether our public spaces
can be better designed

986
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:40,367
so they are not necessarily
going to the highest bidder,

987
01:11:40,693 --> 01:11:43,401
instead they're reflecting what's
important to our neighborhoods

988
01:11:43,597 --> 01:11:45,941
and to our personal well being.

989
01:21:10,568 --> 01:21:14,823
Cities and their form will always
be the terrain of struggle

990
01:21:15,156 --> 01:21:19,502
as different interests contest
for power, for position,

991
01:21:19,827 --> 01:21:21,829
and influence
in the shaping of the city.

992
01:21:24,457 --> 01:21:28,219
Democracy itself is always showing
the sort of strains

993
01:21:28,273 --> 01:21:30,694
and stresses from time to time.

994
01:21:31,131 --> 01:21:36,012
And in a way the city is an expression
of that, in many ways, in microcosm.

995
01:21:37,512 --> 01:21:39,990
Some of those societies which are now

996
01:21:40,441 --> 01:21:43,942
being torn by inner strife
and tensions,

997
01:21:44,228 --> 01:21:46,724
and ambitions, and repressions.

998
01:21:47,314 --> 01:21:51,035
It is the public spaces which
become the symbols.

999
01:22:09,545 --> 01:22:12,890
There's an optimism about cities
in this century.

1000
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:18,355
There's a sense we're creating
something that is truly global.

1001
01:22:19,514 --> 01:22:21,368
And we're creating networks of people,

1002
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:25,519
not experts,
people of all strata of society

1003
01:22:25,895 --> 01:22:29,149
who are involved in the building
of something special.

1004
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:31,089
I'm city obsessed.

1005
01:22:31,327 --> 01:22:33,633
I always been city obsessed,

1006
01:22:33,665 --> 01:22:36,089
grew up in New York,
so who would not be.

1007
01:22:36,281 --> 01:22:38,875
But this is the century
for city lovers.

1008
01:22:39,784 --> 01:22:41,582
This is where it happens.

1009
01:22:43,663 --> 01:22:48,261
The challenge in the future will be how
do you manage demography.

1010
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:50,091
I think in the physical part
of the city

1011
01:22:50,245 --> 01:22:53,592
will not be able to determine
the success of the city.

1012
01:22:53,616 --> 01:22:55,790
Architecture will not be
the only spectacle.

1013
01:22:57,095 --> 01:23:00,591
And how you intersect architecture
with mobility

1014
01:23:00,764 --> 01:23:03,303
with creating a humane environment
through design

1015
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,559
is going to be the critical challenge.

1016
01:23:13,235 --> 01:23:18,662
I'm assuming that the broad outlines
of Kyoto will be achieved by 2050.

1017
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:22,691
What that means for
how everything is organized,

1018
01:23:22,912 --> 01:23:26,032
from how you get about,
what you consume,

1019
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,688
how things are packaged, everything.

1020
01:23:27,933 --> 01:23:31,873
It will be completely different
in just forty years time.

1021
01:23:32,213 --> 01:23:34,071
That's the one side.
On the other side,

1022
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:41,410
in Asia and Africa you're going
to have complete new cities

1023
01:23:42,265 --> 01:23:46,111
that capitalize on all the new thinking
about how we can reorganize cities.

1024
01:23:46,436 --> 01:23:47,911
That will function completely different

1025
01:23:48,101 --> 01:23:50,103
to everything we think
and know about cities.

1026
01:23:50,857 --> 01:23:53,059
So that prospect of dramatic,

1027
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,811
disruptive change
within one generation.

1028
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:01,205
I mean, to be able to get that,
like we're in the middle, on the cusp

1029
01:24:01,534 --> 01:24:06,462
of this unbelievably dramatic set of
forces coming together.

1030
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:09,884
Fundamentally as a species

1031
01:24:10,085 --> 01:24:12,624
we need things that can
power our imaginations,

1032
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:15,079
that can get our passions going,

1033
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,721
that can give us sort of
a sense of meaning.

1034
01:24:19,303 --> 01:24:24,104
And that is not a brick,
it is not a pipe, it is an idea.

1035
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:27,820
That's what drives cities forward.

1036
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,127
