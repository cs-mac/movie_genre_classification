1
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:35,416


2
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:41,116


3
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:46,717


4
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:52,132
I dont believe it.
It makes no sense.

5
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:59,783
"There is something so strange."

6
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:07,071
"Perhaps you could suggest some
fantastic explanation. "

7
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,912
"Could'nt it be this sort of thing"

8
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:22,445
He turned the drawing round.

9
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,890
"Yes," she said,
"That is what I mean."

10
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:38,252
This was the first explanation
of the splitting the atom.

11
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:58,052
Robert Oppenheimer said:
"Impossible."

12
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,987
But within 15 minutes he decided
it was real.

13
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:05,660
He realised it would release
some great amount of energy,

14
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:08,157
That you could
generate power

15
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,039
and make bombs.

16
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:20,448
Within one week, on
Oppenheimer's black board

17
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:24,489
There was a drawing of
the bomb.

18
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,734
Enrico Fermi stood
in his office

19
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,549
and looked out of  Manhattan.

20
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:42,818
He kept  his hand to
the size of a tennis balll.

21
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:48,536
"A little bomb like that" He said

22
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:51,248
"And it would all  disappear."

23
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,197
Countdown To Zero

24
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,722
There is no doubt in my mind

25
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:17,591
if the terrorists had
acquired a nuclear weapon,

26
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:20,183
They would not have hasitated to use it.

27
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:36,719
SoI guess the question is:

28
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,629
Could They Ever Get One?

29
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:07,241
Al-Qaida is determined
to acquire nuclear weapons

30
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:09,132
and use them if they get them.

31
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,828
In the early 90's

32
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,889
they tried to buy highly
enriched uranium in Sudan

33
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,489
They got scammed

34
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:20,555
Just prior to the
9/11 attacks

35
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:24,348
we do know that Osama bin Laden and
his lieutinent Zawahiri

36
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,829
sat down with two
Pakistani nuclear scientists

37
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,943
and discussed
nuclear weapons.

38
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:35,736
Before releasing sarin gas
in the Tokyo subway

39
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,539
the Japanese cult
Aum Shinrikyo

40
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,109
attempted  to acquire a
nuclear bomb in Russia.

41
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:45,188
They bought a sheet
farm in Australia

42
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,241
to mine uranium to
build their own bomb.

43
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:53,398
The objective of Al-Qaeda is:

44
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,014
is to kill 4 million Americans
including two million children

45
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,835
This is in his calculations,

46
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:03,321
the..which is required to
balance the scales of justice.

47
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,268
He takes
various incidents

48
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:10,738
from Shatila to
the war in Iraq,

49
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,707
and counts up the
bodycount and says

50
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,592
"Thats how many people
we owe: 4 million. "

51
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:19,456
You are not going to get
4 million people killed by

52
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:23,046
hijacking airplanes and
crashing  them into buildings.

53
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:43,171
Actually, I am not that worried
about nuclear weapons.

54
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:44,652
Its not one of my main worries.

55
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,474
Isnt everyone worried about
nuclear weapons?

56
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:52,280
There are all concerned
nuclear war?

57
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,182
Thats a stupid answer,
no

58
00:06:56,852 --> 00:07:00,064
I don't know. Its never been something
that I actually had to think

59
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:01,858
in my everyday life.

60
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:09,931
It might get on your conscience
and maybe then disappears

61
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:16,904
I do not think anybody is going
to use in this day and age

62
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,006
it is ridiculous to even think about it.

63
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,349
What can you do?
Nothing.

64
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:27,907
At the end of the day a small button
and there is going to be a big mess at the end of that

65
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,351
Somebody is going to make a mistake one day
and we are all going to suffer for it.

66
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:47,481
There are three ways to
acquire a nuclear weapon:

67
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:50,136
You could steal a bomb,

68
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,301
You could buy a bomb

69
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,235
and you could build a bomb.

70
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:59,914
Of all the things I've learned after 9/11,
about terrorism iintent

71
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:02,929
the most startling discovery
for me personally

72
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,862
was realising they were trying to
build a bomb.

73
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:12,116
The hardest part of
making a nuclear bomb

74
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,609
is getting the material,

75
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,271
highly enriched uranium
or plutonium.

76
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,601
Many countries have
these materials,

77
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:23,498
and often they are poorly guarded

78
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,983
But if I were
a terrorist

79
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:30,211
intending  to build
a nuclear bomb,

80
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:32,580
and i wanted to blow up
a major city

81
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:36,030
I would look to the countries of
the former Soviet Union.

82
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,220
There have been many cases
involving the theft

83
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:41,801
of highly enriched
uranium or plutonium.

84
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:45,126
And every time there has been a black market ceasure

85
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,557
of stolen HEU or plutonium

86
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,458
andthey were able to
track to its source

87
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,361
It came from Russia.

88
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:59,423
There was a case at a Russian naval base
in the early 1990s.

89
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:06,063
One of the naval personel told a relative of his
where the highly enriched uranium at this place was

90
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,964
This relative walked through a gapping hole
and a security fence

91
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:14,163
walked upto what you and i would
consider to be a tool shaft

92
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,620
snapped the lock
with an iron bar.

93
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:21,780
He set off no alarm.
It was not detected at all.

94
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:26,562
The Russian military prosecutor in that
case said, quote:

95
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:28,972
"Potatoes were guarded better ".

96
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,913
At a facility called Luch,

97
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:43,583
where they fabricate fuel made from
 highly enriched uranium,

98
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:48,246
there was a worker  there who knew
that as long as the output

99
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,992
was within about 3 percent of the input

100
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:54,796
they figured it was normal loses to waste
and they didnt bother to investigate.

101
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,807
So he kept stealing
small amounts

102
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,645
of highly enriched uranium

103
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:01,428
day after day,
over  a long period of time.

104
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,821
Eventually he stole a kilogram and a half

105
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:22,590
of 90%  of highly enriched uranium

106
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,358
He set off no alarms.
Noone noticed.

107
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:28,763
He had friends
who were making their living

108
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:30,731
stealing car batteries.

109
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,139
And they said:

110
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,750
"Maybe the guy in Moscow who buys or is still  in car batteries

111
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,538
"will Buy your
stolen uranium . "

112
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,843
So they went down to
the train station  together,

113
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:42,434
and the police came in and arrested the car battery thieves

114
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:45,446
and he got arrested along with them
Thats the only way he was ever caught .

115
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:50,510
We have cases in which people
from the Russian nuclear arsenal

116
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:52,854
were sellling material
and they were captured

117
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:56,124
We have cases in which  people from
Russian nuclear labs

118
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,917
were selling materials
they was captured.

119
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:02,430
Almost all of those cases

120
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,664
until the material was seized

121
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:07,222
and had never been noticed
to have been missing.

122
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,004
All  the black market seizures that
I am ware of were serendepetous

123
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,677
They were caught by luck.

124
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:22,461
So we dont know weather it is
the iceberg or the tip of the iceberg.

125
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:31,893
Once you have managed to acquire
highly enriched uranium,

126
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:34,353
you need to smuggle it out of the country

127
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:46,707
Georgia is located
along Russia's southern border

128
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:53,031
and things like highly enriched uranium

129
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:55,574
could be smuggled from such a place

130
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,934
by Azerbaijan,
Iraq, Iran,

131
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:03,693
Turkmenistan, Afghanistan
and so on so forth.

132
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:08,882
The Georgians invented a so called man
 of Turkish nationality

133
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:12,226
who said he was  a Muslim and

134
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:15,695
representing a
serious organization.

135
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,090
Oleg Khintsagov
believed he was selling

136
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,845
highly enriched uranium

137
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,725
to make an atomic weapon to terrorists

138
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,398
If a  truck driver
can get hold of it,

139
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,433
a small time husler

140
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,402
who just wants to become a rich guy

141
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,805
imagine what
professionals could have done

142
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:06,841
Real professionals
with an ideology,

143
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:09,902
with an agenda
with brains

144
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:41,008
Once you have moved the
highly enriched uranium,

145
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:43,010
you could use
any number of ports

146
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:45,012
in the Middle East
or the Mediterranean

147
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:47,841
to ship the
HEU to your destination.

148
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:02,451
smuggling highly enriched Uranium

149
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:05,020
into the United States,
is pretty straight forward

150
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,276
lead pipe will
shield the HEU.

151
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,084
The detector would have be
within a few inches

152
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:18,705
to pick up any radiation.

153
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:31,066
And then hide it amongst
everyday goods

154
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,695
A hundred pounds of highly enriched uranium

155
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:37,698
is  smaller than a football.

156
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,738
It would fit in a 6 pack beer cans

157
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,490
100 000 shipping containers
go to the united states everyday

158
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:56,884
Every way the drugs come to new york city

159
00:16:56,885 --> 00:17:00,304
would be the same way you would imagine
highly enriched uranium coming.

160
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,429
If you have any doubt about
the ability of al-Qaeda

161
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,588
to bring highly enriched uranium
into the U.S.

162
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,149
They could always hide it
a bale of marijuana.

163
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:40,003
Terrorism is just one threat

164
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:42,208
the deliberate threat.

165
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,788
There is also the
unintentional threat

166
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:51,596
of a nuclear detonation

167
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,687
by accident,by  error
or by misjudgment.

168
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:29,243
We like to think that
the U.S. military

169
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,963
or other military who are
controlling nuclear weapons

170
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:35,095
are perfect organizations ,
they will never fail .

171
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,306
We expect them  to have 100% reliability.

172
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,993
But even the well-disciplined,

173
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:48,412
very professional U.S military

174
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,912
made serious serious mistakes
with nuclear weapons.

175
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:01,004
<i> An atomic bomb breaks loose
from a  mounting shakle </ i>

176
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,718
<i>in a  B-47 jet over

177
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,680

178

179
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:13,187
<i> An American airplane flew 1500 miles

180
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:15,256

181
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,925
<i> And nobody knew.

182
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:20,025
<i> not the commanders on ground. </ i>

183
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,698
we have had B-52's explode
in the air

184
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:27,101
during refueling mission

185
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:29,770
causing 4 thermonuclear weapons

186
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:33,690
to fall onto the Spain territory
and into  the Mediterranean.

187
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:36,653
<i> A B-52 bomber

00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:43,096
<i> scattering deadly plutonium
over the icecap. </ i>

190
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:48,122
In 1960, a BOMARC air defence missile exploded,

191
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:49,990
melting a nuclear warhead.

192
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:52,627
In 1968, the USS Scorpion
sank

193
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:55,262
400 miles southwest
of Azores.

194
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,102
Nuclear weapons on board
were never found.

195
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:02,285
A B-47 bomber disappeared
over the Mediterranean.

196
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:05,673
Nuclear weapons on board
were never located.

197
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:09,677
In 1959, an aircraft crashed near
Whidbey Island, Washington.

198
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:11,639
The nuclear debt charges

199
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,080
were not recovered.

200
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:16,209
Skyhawk's strike aircraft
carrying a nuclear weapon

201
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,823
rolled off an aircraft carrier
in the Sea of Japan

202
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,289
The weapon was never recovered.

203
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,354
There are many ways
in which  efforts

204
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,537
to make a system
more reliable

205
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:28,496
actually backfire and make it less reliable

206
00:20:28,497 --> 00:20:31,699
Sometimes we had
a redundant system.

207
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,735
and backup systems

208
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:37,628
so that if one fails,
another can take its place.

209
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:47,882
But complexity is the
enemy of reliability.

210
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:50,499
Because as you add
system is making more complex

211
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,316
because its harder  to understand
all the potential interactions.

212
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:11,424
Its that unlikely bizzare interaction

213
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,850
where one person interacts with
another in a way that wasnt anticipated

214
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:20,247
or one backup system interacts
with another

215
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:22,140
in ways that you cant figure out ahead of time

216
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:24,033
and therefore cant plan around

217
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,709
Those are what cause the problems

218
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:29,074
In 1961, a B-52
broke apart in midair

219
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,876
over  Goldsboro,
North Carolina

220
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:34,616
causing two nuclear bombs to fall

221
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:37,431
One parachute functioned properly,

222
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:40,110
and that bomb survived with minor damage

223
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:45,753
The other parachute failed to open
When that bomb hit

224
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:48,726
five of six safety devices malfuntioned

225
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,878
A single switch prevented
a nuclear explosion.

226
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,833
When i worked
in the Pentagon

227
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:01,259
i believed that the likelyhood
 of a nuclear weapons accident

228
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,610
in the United States occuring was very low

229
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:06,374
I still believe that

230
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,265
But low probablity events happen

231
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,195
they happen all the time.

232
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:16,446
There's a first time in
history for every event.

233
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:22,181
Eventually those low probablity events will occur

234
00:22:28,784 --> 00:22:31,057
No! That supposed to happen?

235
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:10,206
Like there is probably
every country in the world today

236
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,260
How many countries do i  think
have nuclear weapons?

237
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,229
- List them?
- China.

238
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,227
I dont think i suckup for this.

239
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,231


240
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:22,568
- UK. may be

241
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,968
America i'm guessing

242
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:27,568
Oh. Oh. Us Oh
I .. that was a given

243
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,544
- France.
- Germany?

244
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:31,643
- Australia?
- Canada? I do not think Canada

245
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,412


246
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:37,018


247
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:40,321
- No, not Japan.
- There's more. I know there's more.

248
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,924
Iraq, Iran,
Saudi Arabia.

249
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:47,462
All other countries. They are not
 telling us. They have them

250
00:23:47,463 --> 00:23:49,759
- Afghanistan?
- North Korea?

251
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,001
- North Korea.
-Do they?Ok, North Korea.

252
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,237
Who knows?Who knows exactly?

253
00:23:56,238 --> 00:23:58,173


254
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:01,002
I think that's it.Yeah

255
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:08,389
After  the United States detonated.
the first atomic bomb

256
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,251
in the New Mexico desert

257
00:24:10,252 --> 00:24:12,818
nuclear technology
began to spread

258
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:15,823
and other countries
began to acquire

259
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:17,838
their own
nuclear bombs.

260
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,638
Great credit is due
for this mighty British achievement

261
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:41,638
for it seems that by the  possession of such
 deadly weapons peace can be maintained

262
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:43,038
in this troubled world

263
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:50,367
At Reggane,
deep in the Sahara

264
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:52,339
France goes forward
with the detonation

265
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,128
<i> of her  first
atomic bomb. </ i>

266
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:56,831
<i> The explosion carries France

269
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:13,280

<i> Pakistan, which has often
went to war with India, </ i>

276
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,960

00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:06,411
<i> "numbers in the nuclear club will not stop at six"</ i>

279
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,522
One Prime Minister of Pakistan said

280
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,920
Pakistan would build a nuclear weapon

281
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:13,074
even if it meant that the people would
have to eat grass

282
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:17,099
"We will make the bomb even if
we have to eat grass. "

283
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:37,364
<i> In Karachi, they
poured into the streets </ i>

284
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:40,201
<i>pulling the symbol of the
power they were celebrating. </ i>

285
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:43,704
<i> The bomb has become a
source of national pride. </ i>

286
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:46,674
thought there was a jubliation
in the streets of Pakistan.

287
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:48,976
The first time we achieved something

288
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:51,378
which places us in the ranks

289
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:53,573
of very very few
countries of the world.

290
00:26:53,582 --> 00:26:55,786
We were proud
of our scientists,

291
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:57,461
we were proud of
our capabilities,

292
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,131
we were proud of our strength.

293
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:00,855
The people thought that :

294
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:03,724
"Now let India
do anything to Pakistan.

295
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,324
"Let's see what they do."

296
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:16,737
I had North Korean officials say to me

297
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:21,075
a lesson they took away  from the
toppling of Saddam Hussein was that

298
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:24,478
Saddam was ousted because
he didnt have a bomb

299
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:27,693
They were not going to let the same
 thing happen to Kim Jong-Il.

300
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:29,935
Therefore,they needed
to have a bomb.

301
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:37,858
North Korea has
feared of disappearing

302
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,928
into what the communists used to call
the "dustbin of history,"

303
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:44,198
like all their other communist friends
and they see the nukes

304
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:47,763
as the one thing that makes them the country

305
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:51,138
that is taken seriously by the U.S
and the other big players in the neighbourhood

306
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:03,508
Every country has enemies.

307
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:10,357
Every country can use
self defense

308
00:28:10,358 --> 00:28:13,127
as a  rationale for
acquiring nuclear weapons.

309
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:15,296
But if every country does so

310
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:17,118
it is a much more dangerous world.

311
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:30,399
<i> When we see something that is
technically sweet, </ i>

312
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,098
<i> you do it . </ i>

313
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:37,234
That is the way it was
the atomic bomb.

314
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:42,523
<i> The father of the atomic bomb,
Robert Oppenheimer </ i>

315
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:46,401
<i> gave some frank answers to
some important questions in 1947. </ i>

316
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,570
I have been asked whether in
the years to come will it be

317
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:54,529
<i>pssible to kill
40 million American people </ i>

318
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,256
<i> in the 20 largest
American towns </ i>

319
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:59,988
<i>by the use of
atomic bombs </ i>

320
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,588
<i>in a single night. </ i>

321
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:06,560
<i> I am afraid  that the answer to
that question is yes. </ i>

322
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:12,984
<i>I have been asked whether
there is hope for the naions security </ i>

323
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:17,258
<i> In keeping secrets some of the
knowledge </ i>

324
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,997
<i> which has gone into the making of the bombs. </ i>

325
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:22,847
I am afraid there is no such hope

326
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:36,147
A nuclear weapon in a sense
is the most

327
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:39,816
simple configuration of
 nuclear material

328
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:42,254
that you can imagine
You just bring together

329
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:45,787
certain quantity of
fissile material

330
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:48,756
highly enriched uranium
or plutonium

331
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:51,606
and if you do it right
it will explode.

332
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:57,898
The design of the first
atomic bomb

333
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,723
was a very deep secret

334
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:06,874
In fact that was a time when
people didnt even know

335
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,795
whether a bomb was possible.

336
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:12,907
Now the making of the atom bomb
has become  much easier.

337
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:20,616
Those who say that building
a nuclear weapon is easy

338
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:22,202
They are very wrong

339
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:25,472
Those who say building a crude device is very difficult

340
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:27,072
They are more wrong

341
00:30:27,562 --> 00:30:29,276
Do you agree with that statement?

342
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:32,277
I wont comment on that statement
- Okay, Alright

343
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:35,267
People from the U.S Nuclear laboratory were

344
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:38,098
testified to a classified section to the Congress

345
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,210
and they said it would be possible
make a nuclear bomb

346
00:30:42,211 --> 00:30:45,846
with all parts being
Commercially available

347
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:47,799
except from the actual nuclear material

348
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:50,420
Senator Biden asked

349
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:53,021
the heads of the three
weapons labs:

350
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:56,124
Is it possible?"Is it really possible that the
terrorists could do this? "

351
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,701
They said "yes."

352
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:01,016
They said:"This is something that we test
our graduate students from time to time.

353
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:04,562
"We take two students who
havnt been  prepared for doing this"

354
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,781
We tell them: "See if you can
make a bomb that would work. "

355
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:12,339
"And on the whole most of them passed this test"

356
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:18,679
Biden said: "Prove it"

357
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,783
And so  they went and
made a nuclear bomb,

358
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:24,241
with everything other than
the nuclear material,

359
00:31:24,242 --> 00:31:26,120
from commercial parts.

360
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:29,896
They actually brought it in to the
classified hearing room in the Senate.

361
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:35,243
Typically, an implosion
 bomb would have something like a

362
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:39,537
25 kg of uranium,which is about
the size of a grapefruit.

363
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:48,354
If, lets say, between
70 and a 100 kg of HEU

364
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,191
is available,

365
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:53,432
then the design is not
a major factor.

366
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,981
It would not be very efficient.

367
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:01,410
it would not use all the uranium that was used in it.

368
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:04,340
and yet it would be enough to level a city

369
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:45,499
During my 10 years
as prime minister,

370
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,502
what i really noticed was that

371
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,738
it was actually the threat of the proliferation,

372
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:53,121
the fact that these
weapons could fall

373
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:54,854
into other peoples hands

374
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:56,726
That was the thing
that troubled me,

375
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,007
that kept me
awake at night.

376
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:01,780
<i> In the capital, Islamabad, </ i>

377
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:04,518
word hit the streets in early afternoon:

378
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,713
Another nuclear device <i>
 tested successfully. </ i>

379
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:10,524
As <i>
Pakistan celebrated, </ i>

380
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:14,870
<i> the public hailed AQ Khan
as the father of the Islamic bomb. </ i>

381
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:17,841
In 1974, AQ Khan
was working  at a company

382
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:21,578
that was developing a brand new
process of enriching uranium

383
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:25,545
He stole their designs and took
 the list of all the suppliers.

384
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:28,442
At the end of the day he is
not really a master scientist

385
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:31,285
but he is a master smuggler
and a master organizer.

386
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:34,448
He knows how to get
the pieces out of the countries

387
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:37,006
and how to find stuff
and buy stuff

388
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:40,506
There was this whole plan
to start an operation setup

389
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:44,758
by the intelligence services,
by the army and by Dr. Khan

390
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,561
Restrictions were placed
Sanctions were placed.

391
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:50,398
But somehow the pakistanis
got around that

392
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,416
and the formal help actually
came from India's enemy- China

393
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:58,680
China gave a blueprint of a
nuclear bomb to Pakistan.

394
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:02,443
Around
early 1980s,

395
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:05,012
Khan makes contact
with the Iranians,

396
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:07,154
who were very  interested
in getting a bomb

397
00:34:07,155 --> 00:34:09,875
but clearly dont have the scientific
or industrial capacity

398
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,385
to do it themselves

399
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:13,920
And thus he starts on a
a commercial enterprise.

400
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:18,025
Khan has got a full  marketing
regime laid out

401
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:21,257
 brochures and videos tapes that
offers nuclear wares

402
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:24,624
It extremely lucrative business

403
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:28,569
He had extensive
contacts, networks,

404
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:33,678
and he didnt much care about
 who the ultimate client was going to be

405
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:39,013
He contacted Iran
North Korea, Libya,

406
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:41,248
but he didnt just give them the technologies

407
00:34:41,249 --> 00:34:44,359
He also took the bomb designs
that the Pakistanis had

408
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,587
and threw those in as a sweetner

409
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:50,157
He gave them 24/7  technology support
.

410
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:52,827
Got a problem?
Call 1-800-AQKHAN.

411
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:55,725
It was a full service operation

412
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,622
The U.S. intelligence began
to focus on AQ Khan

413
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:02,103
in the  late 1990s.

414
00:35:02,104 --> 00:35:05,639
The homerun  was in
December 2003 with Libya.

415
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:12,850
The CIA and British Intelligence

416
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:16,244
essentially caught the Khan network red handed

417
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:19,815
Selling a full scale nuclear weapon to Libya.

418
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:23,624
If it wasnt for AQ Khan,

419
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:26,017
Libya never would have got the centrifuges

420
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:28,129
but that they have
thankfully today given up

421
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:29,767
If it wasnt for AQ Khan,

422
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:32,865
there wouldnt be an Iranian nuclear program

423
00:35:37,406 --> 00:35:39,874
Iran is the tip of the spear

424
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,653
It's the big problem
that we have to solve.

425
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:48,649
They promised not to
build nuclear weapons,

426
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,453
but the problem is that the
very same centrifugals

427
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:55,189
very  same factory
that can enrich uranium

428
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,706
to low quantities
for nuclear fuel

429
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:59,946
can enrich it
to high quantities

430
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,471
for nuclear weapons.

431
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,255
So the question is:
Do you trust Iran?

432
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,371
By their own admission they
have deceived inspectors

433
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:13,574
about their nuclear activities
 for 17 years.

434
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:38,199
Without question Iran is trying
 to get a nuclear bomb.

435
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,201
They have made that very clear,

436
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:42,903
despite their promises
that they are only pursuing

437
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:46,171
civil and peaceful objectives
for their nuclear program.

438
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,530
They are really good
They are trying to bring things in

439
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:52,313
that can be used for their nuclear program

440
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:54,932
The Iranians
have worked very hard

441
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:58,619
to hiding and disguising their facilities

442
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,981
Many of their facilities are
in crowded urban areas

443
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:04,434
underground,
extremely well protected

444
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:06,460
from any sort of
aerial bombing

445
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:09,463
If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons capability

446
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:11,899
the impact is across the whole of the the region

447
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,499
We will get a whole set of other countries

448
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,630
deciding they have got to acquire
 nuclear weapons capability

449
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,376
Syria, Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, Egypt ...

450
00:37:22,377 --> 00:37:25,479
the rivals of the Iranian
Shite state

451
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,687
would match their capabilities
and would go from the Middle East

452
00:37:28,784 --> 00:37:31,385
with one nuclear armed nation Israel

453
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:34,322
to one with three, four or five
nuclear armed nations

454
00:37:34,323 --> 00:37:40,190
They are surrounded by
very unstable regimes and countries  .

455
00:37:40,395 --> 00:37:42,797
If Iran acquires
everything it needs,

456
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:46,701
without doubt pieces of that
become more readily available

457
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:50,371
to terrorist organizations like Hamas.

458
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:56,177
The risk that you have today

459
00:37:56,178 --> 00:38:00,347
with regimes like
Iran or North Korea

460
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:03,918
is  they are prepared
to start trading

461
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:07,060
that  nuclear weapons capability
and  technology.

462
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:10,324
The Pakistanis had the
nuclear know how.

463
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:12,326
they didnt have a
delivery system.

464
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:14,295
The North Koreans
had the missile,

465
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:15,996
and didnt have the
nuclear know how

466
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:20,334
So there was a natural convergence of interests here

467
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:24,038
The North Koreans have
a long track record of

468
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:26,340
selling military technology
 and missiles to

469
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:30,745
the Syrians,to the Iranians,
to the Iraqis, Pakistanis.

470
00:38:30,746 --> 00:38:33,274
They dont really
have any other exports.

471
00:38:37,577 --> 00:38:39,987
Daily life is very real

472
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:41,956
Food is in short supply

473
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:44,959
you  drive around the
capital,Pyongyang, at night

474
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,727
and its basically dark.

475
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:48,729
There is a famous
satellite photo

476
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,232
that shows the
Korean peninsula.

477
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:53,601
and in the south, we see all these lights,

478
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:55,266
and then its just black

479
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,193
we are still dealing with his years

480
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:05,390
of unchecked activities and contacts

481
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:09,083
and its really a genie out of the bottle

482
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:12,395
that cannot be easily put back

483
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:28,335
We spend billions of dollars

484
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:31,272
putting in radiation detectors

485
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:33,464
but highly enriched uranium

486
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:35,065
is easily shielded

487
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:41,148
If you are depending on
portal monitors

488
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:44,919
to defend a city
against a nuclear detonation,

489
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,261
You have done far too much too late

490
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:51,602
Nuclear weapons

491
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,495
dont have to be
exactly on target.

492
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:56,130
Close is good enough.

493
00:39:56,131 --> 00:39:58,503
If  a terrorist thinks
that the portal monitor

494
00:39:58,504 --> 00:40:01,803
might detect weapon,
they set it off in the port.

495
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:06,899
highly enriched uranium is
easy to smuggle

496
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,457
the radiation is very weak.

497
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:20,688
The detectors that we are
putting in place now

498
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,857
would have no chance of detecting

499
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:26,057
HEU
in a cargo container.

500
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:36,471
The signature of highly enriched uranium
is so slight

501
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:38,941
that they would have to set
the monitors very high

502
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:41,167
to detect it,and so
they are getting

503
00:40:41,168 --> 00:40:44,015
thousands of false alarms
 every day.

504
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:48,249
Toilets, will set it off
china

505
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,851
Ceramics,
stones like granites,

506
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:55,495
lot of biological materials
like tobacco, some algae,

507
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:58,759
televisions ,the
old style televisions,

508
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,695
kitty litter,lot of chemical products,

509
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,335
and well other stuff also

510
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:12,306
You wants to smuggle a
bomb into the United States?

511
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:14,398
Ship it in a truck with a kitty litter

512
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:17,148
No one would ever find it

513
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:22,116
They are great for really
 radioactive stuff,

514
00:41:22,117 --> 00:41:23,639
like cesium or something

515
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,087
that might be used
in a "dirty bomb."

516
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:29,145
But for the stuff that you
would use to make a nuclear bomb

517
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:32,022
that would incenerate the
heart of a major city

518
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,690
they are not gonna detect that.

519
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:42,412
Robert Oppenheimer
in 1946, he appeared in a

520
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:44,805
closed door session
of the Senate,

521
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:46,807
and one of the senators
asked him

522
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:49,912
if nuclear terrorism
was a potential threat.

523
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:52,061
He said "Of course"

524
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:55,932
"Terrorists could bring a
bomb into New York City

525
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,639
"And destroy the city."

526
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:00,544
Somebody asked him :
"How would you stop it?"

527
00:42:02,057 --> 00:42:04,024
He said:
"With a screwdriver,

528
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,861
"To open up every container
that comes into this city. "

529
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,971
Once you have smuggled the highly enriched uranium

530
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,982
into the U.S.you  would need a
place to build the bomb.

531
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:28,990
The bomb could be built
right in the target city.

532
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:33,654
The hard part was
what we did in 1945.

533
00:42:33,655 --> 00:42:35,921
The hard part is doing
it the first time.

534
00:42:36,826 --> 00:42:40,205
This is no longer a conceptual challenge
There is no trick.

535
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:42,797
There is no magic
that needs to be figured out

536
00:42:42,798 --> 00:42:45,171
It's really just an engineering challenge

537
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,250
It's definitely not rocket science.

538
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:49,573
The rocket science
is more difficult.

539
00:42:50,372 --> 00:42:52,339
 you can make a
very simple weapon,

540
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,542
a so called  gun type weapon

541
00:42:54,543 --> 00:42:56,844
which was the one used in Hiroshima

542
00:42:56,845 --> 00:43:01,042
It was so simple we didnt even test it
before we dropped it

543
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:04,819
It is essentially just
a gun barrel.

544
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,911
with a target and you can projectile,
and you propel the projectile into the target.

545
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:14,995
you will need an artillary gun

546
00:43:14,996 --> 00:43:17,197
to fire a
one piece of HEU in the other,

547
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:21,116
which would be bolted
onto the muscle of the gun

548
00:43:21,503 --> 00:43:24,438
The military sells these
things as surplus,

549
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:26,140
but they sell them  to save it

550
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:29,010
You would have to make the
gun capable of shooting again

551
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:31,268
and you would want to test fire the gun
to make sure that

552
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:33,924
that it fired the
projectile at the right speed.

553
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,923
This is  the only thing that
you would need to do off-site.

554
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:40,955
you would need a
group of people ...

555
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:44,158
lets say,between 15 to 20 to 25,

556
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,228
who would be knowledgable in
particular aspects

557
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:49,997
of weapons designs
of explosives.

558
00:43:49,998 --> 00:43:52,377
Two or three people
to do the  machining,

559
00:43:52,378 --> 00:43:54,002
two or three people to
work on the gun

560
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:56,772
two or three people
to work on electronics,

561
00:43:56,807 --> 00:44:00,241
People who are experts
in ballistics

562
00:44:00,342 --> 00:44:02,543
People who know something
about nuclear physics.

563
00:44:02,544 --> 00:44:05,412
you just need the machinist and metallar

564
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:08,045
just to make the pieces into the right
shapes and make sure they fit together

565
00:44:08,116 --> 00:44:10,751
Ordinary explosives and
detonators

566
00:44:10,752 --> 00:44:13,421
maybe some
electronic equipment.

567
00:44:13,422 --> 00:44:14,822
You can go online

568
00:44:14,823 --> 00:44:17,657
and easily find the
blade for  $ 10,000.

569
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:20,694
you could find the furnace
for about $ 50,000.

570
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:23,564
And you can even find the
surplus recoilless rifle

571
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:26,801
probably also
for $ 10,000.

572
00:44:26,802 --> 00:44:30,538
More than 90% of the effort
in the Manhattan Project

573
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:32,762
was making the
nuclear material

574
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,015
to make
the nuclear bomb.

575
00:44:35,377 --> 00:44:37,712
If you can get hold of
that nuclear material,

576
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:41,182
then it doesnt take a
Manhattan Project to make a bomb.

577
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,131
If the circumstances
are right,

578
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:58,832
acquiring a
complete bomb

579
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,967
may be easier
than building one

580
00:45:01,036 --> 00:45:03,537
In Algeria, in 1961,

581
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:06,507
officers within the French
millitary rebelled

582
00:45:06,508 --> 00:45:08,728
and tried to seize a nuclear weapon.

583
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:10,478
As the rebels closed in

584
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:13,681
the weapon was detonated in a
degraded explosion

585
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:17,813
to prevent it from falling into the
hands of the rebelling  officers.

586
00:45:26,661 --> 00:45:30,030
The Japanese death terror cult, Aum Shinrikyo,

587
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:33,243
attemted to buy a nuclear
bomb from the Soviet Union.

588
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:36,304
They had a lot of resources,

589
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:39,373
We are talking well over
billion dollars of assets.

590
00:45:39,374 --> 00:45:42,724
and secondly they had
 tremendous access. At one point,

591
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:46,725
the group had more members in Russia in the
 former Soviet Union than they had in Japan

592
00:45:49,918 --> 00:45:54,485
In 1994, a senior leader made eight trips to Russia

593
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,012
His personal notebook
included a shopping list

594
00:45:58,013 --> 00:46:01,257
for buying a nuclear warhead
for $ 15 million.

595
00:46:02,665 --> 00:46:05,031
A perfectly secure  nuclear weapon

596
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:07,434
is also a perfectly
unusable one

597
00:46:07,654 --> 00:46:13,565
So here one has this paradox
 between security and usability

598
00:46:16,244 --> 00:46:19,061
Where is the worlds most dangerous place right now?

599
00:46:20,082 --> 00:46:22,349
mu money it is  Pakistan.

600
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,685
you have got an  unstable government,

601
00:46:24,686 --> 00:46:27,421
plus enough material for
up to a 100 nuclear weapons,

602
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:30,730
plus Osama bin Laden in the country.

603
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:43,938
What we have seen over the last two or three years

604
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:46,941
has been a spiral that has
 been going downwards

605
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:50,177
Destabilization,the
spread of the Taliban,

606
00:46:50,178 --> 00:46:53,531
the spread of radicalism,
the collapse of the economy.

607
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,418
So could there be a cornals coup in Pakistan

608
00:46:57,419 --> 00:47:00,254
by Islamic radicals
within the military

609
00:47:00,255 --> 00:47:03,120
and then could  nuclear
 weapons be at risk?

610
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,262
What happens if that country destablises?

611
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:11,307
What happens if the
army splits?

612
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,230
Who gets the  weapons?

613
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:15,742
Who gets the
material for the weapons?

614
00:47:15,743 --> 00:47:19,482
Who gets the scientists
who know how to build the weapons?

615
00:47:26,048 --> 00:47:31,251
There is no such thing as perfect command and control
over the  nuclear weapons,

616
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:35,210
even in the sophasticated
of the arsenals.

617
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:43,164
from the levels of the presidents gone down

618
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:46,411
there are human weaknesses,
technical problems

619
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:49,074
deficiencies and
vulnerabilities.

620
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:58,087
I was the launch officer  for
Minuteman missiles.

621
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:02,384
and I spent three years
in Montana in a hole

622
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:05,897
in an undergorund launch
control centre

623
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:14,261
I was one of the guys responsible for

624
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:17,265
for getting these missiles off ground

625
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:20,829
in one minute. we didnt call them
"Minuteman missiles" for nothing.

626
00:48:30,045 --> 00:48:34,282
When I was serving in the Air Force
as the launch officer,

627
00:48:34,283 --> 00:48:38,018
there was a device in the launch control centre

628
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:40,584
into which 12 digits
had to be dialed in

629
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,308
in order to unlock the missiles for firing

630
00:48:44,078 --> 00:48:47,027
This had been  installed under Robert McNamara

631
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:50,064
over the objections of the Strategic Air Command

632
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:54,572
Since they couldnt prevent the panel from being installed

633
00:48:54,803 --> 00:48:57,238
the StrategicAir Command
in Omaha

634
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:59,685
had set these codes to zero

635
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,282
and we all knew it.

636
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:03,711
That was the secret unlock code

637
00:49:03,712 --> 00:49:05,913
for firing
our missiles:

638
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:07,739
12 zeros.

639
00:49:08,217 --> 00:49:11,237
In fact, in our launch
check list

640
00:49:11,238 --> 00:49:14,405
we had to  ensure
that the unlock code

641
00:49:14,406 --> 00:49:16,841
was set to al zeros
before we completed

642
00:49:16,842 --> 00:49:18,768
the launch sequence.

643
00:49:24,032 --> 00:49:26,767
This changed in 1977

644
00:49:26,768 --> 00:49:29,236
when they started using
actual codes.

645
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:32,373
But until then, I and one other
crew member

646
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:35,375
could have actually
formatted a launch order

647
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:38,651
a completely valid launch order

648
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:43,142
and transmitted it to the
entire American stratergic arsenal.

649
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:46,019
Looks like we are in a shooting war

650
00:49:46,706 --> 00:49:50,324
Oh hell.Oh the russians have got it?

651
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:51,859
<i>i think: Thats what i have been told </ i>

652
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,774
just came in on the
red phone.

653
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:56,527
My orders are toseal this base tight
and thats what i mean to do, seal it tight

654
00:49:57,173 --> 00:50:00,868
Now I want you to transmit Plan R

655
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:03,292
"R" for "Robert"
to the wing.

656
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:06,341
- Plan "R",for "Robert".
- Is it that bad, sir?

657
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:08,821
looks like its pretty hairy
- Yes, sir.

658
00:50:09,111 --> 00:50:11,412
I remember watching
"Dr. Strangelove"

659
00:50:11,413 --> 00:50:14,063
and thinking  they
had it all wrong.

660
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:16,203
You dont need to be a general.

661
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:19,328
We were only lieutenants,
but we could have started

662
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:23,122
World War III just as
easily as Gal. Jack Ripper.

663
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:25,187
We could have triggered
implementation

664
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,161
of the U.S. nuclear war plan

665
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:30,464
involving thousands and thousands
of nuclear weapons

666
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:33,274
fired at the
Soviet Union and China.

667
00:50:33,636 --> 00:50:37,104
<i> Standby
Message followed </ I>

668
00:50:37,105 --> 00:50:40,308
<i> Alpha, Tango, Golf, Reamer. </ i>

669
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:42,805
The life of a
watch officer

670
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,445
is really Pavlovian.

671
00:50:44,446 --> 00:50:47,982
You have been   trained and conditioned
so thoroughly

672
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:53,421
you kind of march up a long step
 into a very  well rehearsed script

673
00:50:53,422 --> 00:50:55,663
thats written by check lists.

674
00:50:55,824 --> 00:50:57,968
<i> Step 1: All keys inserted. </ i>

675
00:50:57,969 --> 00:50:59,497
Roger

676
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:02,263
We would jump up unlock our safe

677
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:03,864
take out codes

678
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,505
Check the codes against the mesage

679
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:13,524
and then proceed through a launch check list that

680
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:15,754
takes about one minute to carry an armour

681
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:21,094
<i>Lets enable the missiles.
Key program activated. </ I>

682
00:51:21,095 --> 00:51:24,051
All <i> in flight. BF all.

683
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:25,651
Standby...

684
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:27,822
Unlock code inserted.

685
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:30,320
enable
Its enabled.

686
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,304
At the end of that process to
turn the keys

687
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:38,486
and launch upto 50 missiles
at Soviet Union and / or China.

688
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:58,652
Today, the position of
United States and Russia

689
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:01,575
is exactly the same as
it was during the Cold War.

690
00:52:02,591 --> 00:52:05,025
So if the orders came
down,during now

691
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:08,429
20 years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall,

692
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,965
It would take about
two minutes

693
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:15,269
to launch all of the US nuclear ballistic  missiles

694
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,205
their tunnels
in central U.S.

695
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:18,959
out of their tubes
in the midwest

696
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,042
It would time for the
Russians to do the same thing

697
00:52:21,043 --> 00:52:24,245
and then it would take another 10 to 12 minutes

698
00:52:24,246 --> 00:52:26,924
for everything else
thats on

699
00:52:26,925 --> 00:52:29,765
 launch ready alert
to be fired

700
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:42,763
So that within 15 minutes

701
00:52:42,998 --> 00:52:46,500
all the forces on the launch ready alert

702
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:50,311
would be in the air in their flight
to the other side of the planet.

703
00:52:51,448 --> 00:52:53,374
2000 bombs

704
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:57,143
strategic nuclear weapons,
very high yield.

705
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,957
And they could kill

706
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,525
over a 100 million
Russians and Americans

707
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:04,293
within 30 minutes.

708
00:53:12,127 --> 00:53:15,025
When we are working on nuclear
apps control

709
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,749
i found myself in a briefing in the Pentagon with a colonel

710
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,568
we had a short exchange about this

711
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:23,637
and in this context of this exchange
he said:

712
00:53:23,638 --> 00:53:26,396
"But I do not understand what
would be such a big deal"

713
00:53:26,397 --> 00:53:28,316
"If there was a
nuclear exchange"

714
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:30,845
"Only about 500 million
people would die.

715
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:32,947
"Life would go on afterwards."

716
00:53:34,683 --> 00:53:38,784
And I can remember having a feeling like Woody Allen

717
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:40,976
and recall

718
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:43,820
"I'm sorry i have got an appointment
back on planet earth"

719
00:54:16,692 --> 00:54:18,664
I dont think that anyone
really knows

720
00:54:18,665 --> 00:54:21,482
how many nuclear weapons
there are on the planet today.

721
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:25,872
- I have a ...
- Does anyone know?

722
00:54:27,536 --> 00:54:29,470


723
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:32,507
May be thousands,i dont know
Far more than I know.

724
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:36,577
6000.

725
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,416
I do not know. 15 000.

726
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:43,618
- 20 000.
- 50 000?

727
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,020
- 100 000.
- 500 000.

728
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:47,661
There is enough firepower

729
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:49,354
on a US nuclear sub

730
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:51,194
to annihilate
 probably half the planet.

731
00:54:53,295 --> 00:54:55,312
I have heard people say that we
have enough

732
00:54:55,313 --> 00:54:57,331
 nuclear weapons to create a new sun.

733
00:54:57,332 --> 00:55:00,302
I think couple to
eliminate this city.

734
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:02,101
Do you know how many are there?

735
00:55:08,343 --> 00:55:13,855
We estimate that there are about
23 000 nuclear weapons in the world still.

736
00:55:16,054 --> 00:55:19,268
The good news is
there used to be 60 000.

737
00:55:19,388 --> 00:55:22,857
So we have cut those
arsenals by more than half.

738
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:25,459
But we, the United States,
still has about

739
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,329
1,500  hydrogen bombs

740
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,558
on missiles poised for launch

741
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,454
in 50 minutes or less.

742
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:37,183
The really bad news is
that the Russians have the same.

743
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:45,602
If the Russians fired
missiles at the United States

744
00:55:48,351 --> 00:55:52,019
the first warning
would come from satellites,

745
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,357
and they could detect
the flame from the booster rocket

746
00:55:56,358 --> 00:55:58,001
within seconds,

747
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:01,348
easily
within a minute.

748
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:06,634
Suddenly, this early warning
hub in the United States

749
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:10,738
would become very frenzy
to try figure out

750
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:14,142
whether this is a false
alam or whether this is a real attack

751
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:17,581
and determine this
in 60 seconds.

752
00:56:22,243 --> 00:56:26,275
The President would receive a briefing

753
00:56:26,276 --> 00:56:29,317
from the duty officer

754
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:31,534
at Strategic Command Headquaters

755
00:56:32,227 --> 00:56:34,595
That briefing of the President

756
00:56:34,596 --> 00:56:38,766
of his response options
and their consequences

757
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:42,724
has to be delievered in as
little as 30 seconds

758
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:47,882
The president normally

759
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:50,795
would have no more than 12 minutes
to make a decision,

760
00:56:50,796 --> 00:56:54,222
and maybe its little
as 10 seconds.

761
00:56:56,585 --> 00:57:00,336
I knew that if the Soviets
did launch an attack,

762
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:04,822
that it would take 26 minutes for an
ICBM to leave russian soil

763
00:57:04,823 --> 00:57:07,596
and land in Washington
or New York.

764
00:57:07,597 --> 00:57:11,163
And I had that much time to
decide how to respond.

765
00:57:37,693 --> 00:57:39,727
And the timeline was very short

766
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:42,629
We had just a few minutes to make a decision

767
00:57:43,104 --> 00:57:46,984
how to respond at
what level of intensity.

768
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,464
Somewhere before the 10th minute

769
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:53,735
the order to execute
would be issued

770
00:57:54,944 --> 00:57:59,747
The Strategic Air Command
probably would be airbourne by then

771
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,834
just as a precaution.

772
00:58:06,055 --> 00:58:09,524
There might be a Presidential evacuation

773
00:58:09,525 --> 00:58:13,232
so that the president would survive
an attack on Washington

774
00:58:15,488 --> 00:58:18,044
But I know of cases
in which the President

775
00:58:18,045 --> 00:58:20,873
chose not to be evacuated

776
00:58:21,948 --> 00:58:25,741
And roughly by the 28th
minute, at the latest,

777
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:29,383
those of us not evacuated

778
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:31,088
would be dead.

779
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:41,449
For us it was a
kind of suicide duty

780
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:46,594
Any missile landing within
half a mile of our location

781
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:48,371
would probably have killed us

782
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:51,265
If we had survived the attack,

783
00:58:51,266 --> 00:58:54,582
we were supposed to go to
a randezvous farm

784
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:59,000
Our air will only
24 hours,

785
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:03,419
So we go out through an escape

786
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,055
which was filled with sand

787
00:59:05,056 --> 00:59:08,671
We would have to release the bolts
on cover and let the sand fall through

788
00:59:09,084 --> 00:59:11,308
and then
crawl up the tube

789
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:16,657
Our tube came up the parking lot

790
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:20,224
so we would have to break through asphalt to get out

791
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,502
The randevous point be

792
00:59:25,503 --> 00:59:29,517
50 or 100 kms away
and we would have to walk.

793
00:59:32,198 --> 00:59:33,608
Disnt really matter though

794
00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:36,978
Everyone knew that the radiation
would kill us quickly anyway

795
00:59:36,979 --> 00:59:39,674
and you would never make
it to the rendezvous

796
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:14,727
In 1995, Pete Sampras won the
U.S. Open and Wimbledon.

797
01:00:15,517 --> 01:00:18,950
George Clooney made his
first big movie

798
01:00:19,455 --> 01:00:23,825
A bomb destroyed the
federal building in Oklahoma city

799
01:00:23,826 --> 01:00:27,148
OJ Simpson was
acquitted of murder.

800
01:00:27,696 --> 01:00:29,731
And we also came close

801
01:00:29,732 --> 01:00:32,329
to  an accidental nuclear missiles launch.

802
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:38,976
On January 25, 1995,

803
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:41,324
the United States  launched a
rocket from Norway

804
01:00:41,325 --> 01:00:43,177
to study
the northern hights

805
01:00:43,178 --> 01:00:45,646
We told the Russians that
we were gonna launch that rocket

806
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:48,929
but  somebody must have
forgot how to pass word on it

807
01:00:49,129 --> 01:00:52,229
When they picked up the 4 stages of this rocket

808
01:00:52,287 --> 01:00:55,424
they initially interpreted
this as 4 warheads

809
01:00:55,425 --> 01:00:58,659
from a U.S nuclear submarine

810
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,962
which we often station off the coast of Norway

811
01:01:00,963 --> 01:01:03,231
possibly
directed at Moscow.

812
01:01:03,232 --> 01:01:06,100
That fit exactly
the characteristics

813
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:08,102
of the beginning of a
nuclear strike

814
01:01:08,103 --> 01:01:11,839
One missile, coming over
exploding in the atmosphere

815
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,041
and sending out an electromagnetic pulse

816
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:16,654
that would fry all the electronics

817
01:01:16,655 --> 01:01:20,782
radar surveillance,
Computers in the country to be attacked,

818
01:01:20,783 --> 01:01:24,665
followed by an onslought of nuclear weapons

819
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:27,155
And for the first
in the nuclear age,

820
01:01:27,156 --> 01:01:29,924
the Russians actually opened up the nuclear football

821
01:01:29,925 --> 01:01:31,604
They went to
President Yeltsin,

822
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,425
they opened up  the command and
launch codes, the button,

823
01:01:34,426 --> 01:01:37,498
put on the desk and said:
"We are under attack."

824
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:41,720
Boris Yeltsin was basically given
5 minutes to decide what to do.

825
01:01:41,804 --> 01:01:44,672
Fortunately, Yeltsin
wasnt drunk

826
01:01:44,673 --> 01:01:47,237
and he didnt believe what
the military was telling him.

827
01:01:47,238 --> 01:01:49,310
He said:
"There must be some mistake."

828
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:52,603
Both the U.S. and Russia
guide their nuclear response

829
01:01:52,604 --> 01:01:55,929
with a doctrine called
"Launch on Warning"

830
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,745
It is the policy if you believe
that you are under attack

831
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:01,555
you are supposed to launch the missiles.
you dont wait for them to land.

832
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:04,025
According to Russian military doctrine

833
01:02:04,026 --> 01:02:06,671
Boris Yeltsin should have
launched all out nuclear attack

834
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:08,525
on the United States that morning.

835
01:02:08,964 --> 01:02:11,099
We do not know what
happened in the Kremlin.

836
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,398
All we know is that he didnt.

837
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:23,621
There have been a no. of false
alarms during the Cold War.

838
01:02:24,252 --> 01:02:27,081
We have had ocassions
where the rising moon

839
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:30,969
was interpreted to be a
Russian ICBMs attack.

840
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:36,307
A flock of geese
was thought to be bombers.

841
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:42,130
A training tape
was slipped into a computer

842
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:45,333
at our command and control
headquarters at NORAD

843
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:47,041
Everyone involved
thought

844
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:49,672
there was an actual attack underway.

845
01:02:49,963 --> 01:02:55,125
A tape was inserted into the
early warning hub in Colorado

846
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:59,124
that  simulated a large scale
Soviet nuclear attack.

847
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:02,617
And no one realised  that it was
just a training tape

848
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:05,083
until the U.S had gone
into this sort of frenzy

849
01:03:05,084 --> 01:03:07,926
check list procedure

850
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:10,868
to prepare
for nuclear war.

851
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,973
Airborne command posts,
actually,in some cases, took off.

852
01:03:22,337 --> 01:03:24,938
The Presidents dooms day plane

853
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:29,457
actually left its base
in preparation

854
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,801
for an incoming Soviet strike.

855
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:35,150
Senator Charles Percy

856
01:03:35,151 --> 01:03:37,351
happened to be there
at the time

857
01:03:37,352 --> 01:03:39,818
and said there was
absolute panic.

858
01:03:46,005 --> 01:03:47,717
Another false alarm

859
01:03:47,718 --> 01:03:49,684
was caused by a computer

860
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:52,500
chip malfuntion
that generated

861
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:55,387
indications of large scale
Soviet attack

862
01:03:55,388 --> 01:03:58,471
We raised the
alert levels.

863
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:02,944
Crews took launch
codes out of their safes.

864
01:04:02,945 --> 01:04:06,108
Inserted the keys into
the launch switches.

865
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:12,854
Zbigniew Brzezinski was woken up
in the middle of the night

866
01:04:12,855 --> 01:04:15,757
with the assured instruction

867
01:04:15,758 --> 01:04:17,725
that a nuclear attack is underway

868
01:04:17,726 --> 01:04:19,888
and that he had to go
wakeup President Carter.

869
01:04:21,464 --> 01:04:24,394
There was 8 minutes worth of

870
01:04:24,395 --> 01:04:26,253
nuclear launch preparations

871
01:04:26,254 --> 01:04:29,300
that were triggered
by malfunctioning

872
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:33,330
computer chip
that costs less than a dollar.

873
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:41,872
And having  missiles on hair trigger
is an accident waiting to happen.

874
01:04:41,873 --> 01:04:46,522
As Fermi said
about the physics:

875
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:49,823
"What isnt forbidden
is compulsory,''

876
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:52,190
it will eventually happen.

877
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:58,316
There is nothing that makes
the launch of nuclear weapons impossible

878
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:02,875
If the probability
isnt zero, it will happen.

879
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:59,213
Right now the world has a policy

880
01:05:59,214 --> 01:06:00,632
that is based heavily on technology

881
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:03,197
you keep something secret and
you call it a day

882
01:06:03,198 --> 01:06:06,956
But secrecy has half life.
Things leak out

883
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:14,763
Centrifuges happen to be the technology
that is going to change the game.

884
01:06:16,154 --> 01:06:21,423
They are going to democratize the process
of building nuclear weapons.

885
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,977
Uranium exists
everywhere on Earth.

886
01:06:26,727 --> 01:06:28,889
Its more common than tin.

887
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,695
99.3% of all uranium
is uranium 238,

888
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:37,432
isotope that can not be
used for nuclear weapons.

889
01:06:37,433 --> 01:06:41,150
except 0.7% that you
need to separate out

890
01:06:43,772 --> 01:06:46,238
A centrifuge
Its basically a tube.

891
01:06:47,343 --> 01:06:49,911
It spins the uranium in gas form

892
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:53,915
and pushes the heavier atoms towards the wall.

893
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:55,950
and the lighter atoms from the center.

894
01:06:55,951 --> 01:06:58,529
And you can skin off the light atoms

895
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:04,719
You do this over and over again.

896
01:07:06,295 --> 01:07:08,688
Many dozens of times,

897
01:07:09,264 --> 01:07:13,361
and eventually you purify it to a
level that you can use it as a bomb

898
01:07:17,323 --> 01:07:19,869
The common risk in them is
they are very complicated.

899
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:25,202
Technologies that take countries
 decades to build

900
01:07:25,203 --> 01:07:28,046
and the highest achievements.
But the fact is,

901
01:07:28,047 --> 01:07:30,918
is that the centrifuges are
1950's technology.

902
01:07:30,919 --> 01:07:33,304
And this is 2010.

903
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:39,025
Enriching uranium is still
beyond the reach of the individual.

904
01:07:39,675 --> 01:07:42,760
It is a  logistics feat,
requiring thousands of centrifuges

905
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:44,689
working for
months or years.

906
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,554
But highly enriched  uranium

907
01:07:48,555 --> 01:07:50,763
is now within the
grasp of nearly any country.

908
01:07:50,806 --> 01:07:55,194
And once you have the HEU
making a crude bomb is easy

909
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:37,051
We're not just <i>
dicussing limits </ i>

910
01:08:37,052 --> 01:08:40,204
<i> on a further
increase of nuclear weapons. </ i>

911
01:08:40,205 --> 01:08:43,257
<i> We seek instead to
reduce their numbers. </ i>

912
01:08:43,258 --> 01:08:47,362
We seek total elimination  <i>
 one day</ i>

913
01:08:47,363 --> 01:08:50,350
<i> of nuclear weapons from
the face of the earth. </ i>

914
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,440
<i> Happy New Year, man. </ i>

915
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,999
<i> Happy New Year. </ i>

916
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,693
<i> I love you all. </ i>

917
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,867
In the first
millionth of a second ,

918
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:43,036
the fireball is 500 feet across

919
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:46,909
Within 10 seconds,
it would grow to over 1 mile

920
01:11:47,543 --> 01:11:50,611
The temperature would rise
to 20 million degrees Fahrenhiet

921
01:11:50,612 --> 01:11:52,747
hotter than the
surface of the sun

922
01:11:52,748 --> 01:11:57,385
The blast would generate winds
in excess of 650 miles an hour

923
01:11:57,386 --> 01:12:00,081
Forces of that magnitude
can destroy anything

924
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,556
that people can build.

925
01:12:01,557 --> 01:12:04,497
Strongest Buildings
would be reduced to rubble.

926
01:12:04,498 --> 01:12:09,697
Tens of square blocks would just be
 melted, would just be evaporated

927
01:12:09,698 --> 01:12:14,569
Everything would be vaporized:
the buildings,the cars,

928
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:19,441
the trees,the people,
the upper level of earth itself

929
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:35,990
There were 76 000 buildings
in Hiroshima.

930
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:38,459
70 000 of them were destroyed.

931
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,461
The hospitals,the fire stations

932
01:12:40,462 --> 01:12:43,498
the communications equipment;
the military installations.

933
01:12:43,499 --> 01:12:45,500
Everything just flattened.

934
01:12:45,501 --> 01:12:47,635
In the first 5 to 6 miles,

935
01:12:47,636 --> 01:12:51,639
virtually everyone in that
5 mile radius is going to die.

936
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,008
Somewhere between 3&4 million people

937
01:12:54,009 --> 01:12:56,744
dead immediately
in the first 5 miles

938
01:12:56,745 --> 01:13:00,782
If you are lucky enough to be 8 or
9 miles away from the blast,

939
01:13:00,783 --> 01:13:05,086
then you would experience it as blast effects
Windows being shattered

940
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:08,007
It would shatter every window
and turn it to hundreds of missiles

941
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:10,178
flying outwards from the
center of the explosion,

942
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:12,126
at speeds more than
100 miles per hour

943
01:13:12,127 --> 01:13:14,262
After the blast,
Its the firestorm that would combust everything

944
01:13:14,263 --> 01:13:17,999
Everything flammable would burn

945
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,933
paper, cardboard, cloth,
heating oil,

946
01:13:20,934 --> 01:13:22,804
gasoline.
Everything would burn.

947
01:13:22,805 --> 01:13:24,872
Whole blocks would catch fire.

948
01:13:24,873 --> 01:13:26,837
Hundreds of thousands of fires would turn

949
01:13:26,838 --> 01:13:29,511
into a giant firestorm
11 miles across.

950
01:13:29,512 --> 01:13:32,313
Everything catches fire
There just will be no air to breathe.

951
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:35,420
All the oxygen would be consumed
and everyone would die.

952
01:13:38,468 --> 01:13:42,092
It is useless to talk  about the way
you die because you are burned to death

953
01:13:42,093 --> 01:13:44,992
or because you have been blown to bits by the blast

954
01:13:44,993 --> 01:13:48,863
Anyone looking in the direction of the
nuclear explosion they will be blinded.

955
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:51,666
The lungs would be ruptured by the pressure
or the eardrums would be ruptured by the pressure.

956
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:53,901
crush injuries from
buildings falling,

957
01:13:53,902 --> 01:13:56,631
broken bones thrown in the air
against the buildings

958
01:13:57,172 --> 01:13:59,634
Hundreds of thousands,
possibly millions

959
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,338
would die from the fallout.

960
01:14:01,339 --> 01:14:04,546
The body does have a repair rate for radiation

961
01:14:04,547 --> 01:14:07,531
but the doses are so heavy
and coming  so quickly

962
01:14:07,532 --> 01:14:10,184
that it would overwhelm the body's
repair mechanism

963
01:14:10,185 --> 01:14:11,936
The 450 to 70 RAD dose kills you

964
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:14,628
because of white cells or blood cells

965
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:18,893
or you will go into seasures
or immediate coma

966
01:14:18,894 --> 01:14:21,970
and you will die within a matter of
minutes or hours.

967
01:14:22,069 --> 01:14:25,233
Most of the doctors are going to be dead
most of the nurses are going to be dead.

968
01:14:25,234 --> 01:14:27,435
Most of the hospitals are going to be destroyed.

969
01:14:27,436 --> 01:14:30,371
Huge number of casualties
and no medical equipment.

970
01:14:30,372 --> 01:14:31,916
They will be a need for antibiotics.

971
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:34,375
tens of units
of blood per person.

972
01:14:34,376 --> 01:14:36,377
There wont be any electrical power

973
01:14:36,378 --> 01:14:38,240
Vast amounts
of intravenous fluids

974
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:39,847
to sustain people that have
 been burned,just burned.

975
01:14:39,848 --> 01:14:41,983
You couldnt treat all
the burn victims.

976
01:14:41,984 --> 01:14:45,155
And there comes a certain point
the casualties become so high

977
01:14:45,187 --> 01:14:48,289
its pointless to try to make any sense out of it.

978
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:50,758
The doctor in the Red Cross Hospital

979
01:14:50,759 --> 01:14:52,794
who turns into an automaton,

980
01:14:58,329 --> 01:15:01,602
And that's what desended on the
physicians and nurses

981
01:15:01,603 --> 01:15:03,784
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

982
01:15:04,648 --> 01:15:07,560
Someone would surely claim they had 10 more

983
01:15:07,561 --> 01:15:09,377
that were already hidden somewhere

984
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:10,873
and then start setting them off
and blast

985
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,653
unless they meet
their demands.

986
01:15:12,654 --> 01:15:14,908
Every other big
city is gonna wonder

987
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:17,587
-whether they might be a target.
- Pulic panic,

988
01:15:17,658 --> 01:15:19,619
the people fleeing major cities

989
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:22,078
You could forget about the rules
of search and seizure.

990
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:24,225
You  are gonna have to be searching everywhere

991
01:15:24,226 --> 01:15:27,492
You could  forget about civil
liberties when people realize

992
01:15:27,493 --> 01:15:29,584
a whole city
was just destroyed.

993
01:15:29,619 --> 01:15:32,268
Take the Bill of
Rights,you put it on a shelf

994
01:15:32,269 --> 01:15:33,822
and you might
never see it again.

995
01:15:33,887 --> 01:15:36,926
People would be demanding
draconian measures

996
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:40,534
to make sure that another
city didnt go up.

997
01:16:10,506 --> 01:16:13,082
<i> Some people laughed. </ i>

998
01:16:14,787 --> 01:16:16,431
<i> Few people cried. </ i>

999
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:18,900
Most  people were <i>
silent. </ i>

1000
01:16:23,183 --> 01:16:27,107
I remembered the line
from the Hindu Scripture,

1001
01:16:27,108 --> 01:16:28,794
the Bhagavad Gita.

1002
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,313
Vishnu ...

1003
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,993
trying to persuade the prince

1004
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:41,602
he should do his duty

1005
01:16:41,603 --> 01:16:44,238
and to impress him,

1006
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:47,405
takes on his multiarmed form

1007
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:49,693
and says:

1008
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:54,118
"Now I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds. "

1009
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:20,942
<i> Every man,
woman and child </ i>

1010
01:17:20,943 --> 01:17:24,746
<i> lives under a nuclear sword
of Damocles, </ i>

1011
01:17:24,747 --> 01:17:27,949
<i>hanging by the slenderest of threads, </ i>

1012
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,752
<i> capable of being cut
at any moment </ i>

1013
01:17:30,753 --> 01:17:35,155
<i> by accident, or
miscalculation or by madness. </ i>

1014
01:17:35,926 --> 01:17:38,292
<i>. The weapons of war must be abolished  </ i>

1015
01:17:38,293 --> 01:17:40,503
<i>before they abolish us. </ i>

1016
01:17:55,411 --> 01:17:57,377
The Cuban Missile Crisis

1017
01:17:57,378 --> 01:18:00,679
endanger the very existence
of our nation.

1018
01:18:01,216 --> 01:18:04,635
Wecame that close to nuclear war.

1019
01:18:07,656 --> 01:18:11,259
Neither the Soviet
nor we, the US

1020
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:14,674
intended to put our nation at risk.

1021
01:18:14,997 --> 01:18:18,559
And the next time we may not be so lucky

1022
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:22,659
They kill by the millions.

1023
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:25,873
They kill in numbers that the human imaginations

1024
01:18:25,874 --> 01:18:28,099
simply cannot comprehend.

1025
01:18:29,257 --> 01:18:33,514
I asked: "Well we have nuclear weapons
 to prevent their use. "

1026
01:18:33,515 --> 01:18:35,949
we now know that we
live in a world in which,

1027
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:39,023
if we possession,
if any one possesses,

1028
01:18:39,024 --> 01:18:41,210
they will be used.

1029
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:44,759
I dont see any good that a nuclear weapon
 could be a threat to the world.

1030
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,828
In my opinion,
you can  forget them.

1031
01:18:46,829 --> 01:18:49,297
I think they should
be destroyed.

1032
01:18:49,298 --> 01:18:51,199
I think we are
better off without them.

1033
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,203
Theres a 183 countries in the world
that do not have nuclear weapons.

1034
01:18:55,204 --> 01:18:58,039
Many of these countries could
have nuclear weapons.

1035
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,107
They have chosen not to have them.

1036
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:06,588
We have decided to take al
180 degrees turn in South Africa

1037
01:19:06,589 --> 01:19:08,228
When I became
President

1038
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:12,445
I was then informed that we have
completed six devices

1039
01:19:12,446 --> 01:19:17,882
more or less comparable to the
bombs which were actually  used at Hiroshima.

1040
01:19:18,786 --> 01:19:22,764
I indicated that i would like us
to stop this program

1041
01:19:22,765 --> 01:19:26,214
and to become part of the mainstream world again

1042
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:30,189
The only way to eliminate the
threat of nuclear terrorism

1043
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:33,568
is to eliminate all nuclear weapons
 in all countries.

1044
01:19:33,575 --> 01:19:38,379
We have got to ensure that
never once the terrorists suceed

1045
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,311
in detonating a nuclear weapon.

1046
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,951
You think about nuclear security

1047
01:19:43,952 --> 01:19:46,033
its all about the material

1048
01:19:46,055 --> 01:19:50,492
The simple  physical fact is that
if you dont have fissile material ...

1049
01:19:50,493 --> 01:19:54,041
either highly enriched uranium or
plutonium  for example ...

1050
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:56,062
you cannot have
a nuclear weapon.

1051
01:19:56,721 --> 01:19:59,527
The focus is all about material.

1052
01:19:59,702 --> 01:20:01,903
Stop  making new material.

1053
01:20:01,904 --> 01:20:04,739
Secure the material where you 
know it is around the world

1054
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:08,443
And make sure that  you detect 
the illicit  transfer of material.

1055
01:20:08,444 --> 01:20:11,084
And then start getting rid of the material that you have

1056
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:15,850
Today in the world we have about
1,700 tons of HEU.

1057
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:21,119
So that's enough material for
around the order of  50 to100 thousand weapons

1058
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,105
to really
create a truely

1059
01:20:23,106 --> 01:20:25,723
international system
for these facilities.

1060
01:20:25,724 --> 01:20:27,952
International Fuel banks

1061
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:29,780
or International reprocessing centers...

1062
01:20:29,781 --> 01:20:31,666
that would be a mauch safer world

1063
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:34,569
We havnt lost an ounce 
of gold from Fort Knox.

1064
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:36,738
We shouldnt lose
an ounce of plutonium

1065
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:38,970
or highly enriched uranium.

1066
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:40,791
During the Cold War,

1067
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:43,593
I believed in the value
of nuclear weapons

1068
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:45,306
to detter an attack.

1069
01:20:45,581 --> 01:20:48,282
20 years after the fall
of the Berlin Wall,

1070
01:20:48,283 --> 01:20:51,364
there is no excuse any longer
for keeping nuclear weapons

1071
01:20:51,365 --> 01:20:53,675
on launch ready laert

1072
01:20:53,676 --> 01:20:57,859
We can remove all of the
warheads on our missiles ,

1073
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:00,661
share our safe guards technology

1074
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:03,464
and establish a joint warning center

1075
01:21:03,465 --> 01:21:07,767
to ensure Nuclear war
cannot happen by mistake.

1076
01:21:08,499 --> 01:21:11,839
When I came into government
in the early '1980s,

1077
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,377
the idea that within about10 years,
both sides would have agreed

1078
01:21:16,378 --> 01:21:19,347
to have 50%  reduction in 
their Nuclear weapons

1079
01:21:19,348 --> 01:21:23,082
would have sounded absurd.
But we achieved it.

1080
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:28,131
That  means a reduction of 
more than 5,000 nuclear warheads a piece

1081
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:32,527
We have gone almost 20 years now

1082
01:21:32,528 --> 01:21:36,664
without really any demonstrative steps

1083
01:21:36,665 --> 01:21:38,744
to nuclear reductions

1084
01:21:38,745 --> 01:21:41,888
This has to be a step by step process

1085
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:46,339
That's how we did it
with chemical weapons.

1086
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,675
These weapons are now taboo.

1087
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:53,681
The Soviet Union imploded
when I was Sec of State

1088
01:21:53,682 --> 01:21:56,851
and we actually got an enforceable treaty

1089
01:21:56,852 --> 01:21:59,921
where we goot Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Ukraine

1090
01:21:59,922 --> 01:22:02,003
to give up their
nuclear weapons.

1091
01:22:02,057 --> 01:22:04,692
All countries in the
world have to sign

1092
01:22:04,693 --> 01:22:07,228
a legally
binding,

1093
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:09,364
 intrusively verifiable agreement

1094
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:11,835
to rid the world
of nuclear weapons.

1095
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:16,006
The choice we face is
eliminate nuclear weapons

1096
01:22:16,071 --> 01:22:19,806
or live in a world with
25 or 30 nuclear powers.

1097
01:22:20,106 --> 01:22:21,909
We can do this

1098
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:24,805
There has to be a

1099
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,029
carefully orchestrated process of reductions

1100
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,772
The United States and Russia,

1101
01:22:28,773 --> 01:22:32,530
with 96% of the worlds nuclear weapons
have to lead the way

1102
01:22:32,855 --> 01:22:37,069
We start in a world where
there are 23,000 nuclear weapons.

1103
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:41,436
The very  first step is to cut
those arsenals dramatically

1104
01:22:41,437 --> 01:22:43,297
in the United States
and Russia.

1105
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:46,968
Once you get down to low hundreds in the world

1106
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:49,971
then you have built up the confidence and the mechanisms

1107
01:22:49,972 --> 01:22:52,714
to ensure that you can
verify this process

1108
01:22:52,715 --> 01:22:55,009
so that we can
get rid of the last one

1109
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,260
- None.
- Should be zero.

1110
01:22:57,579 --> 01:22:59,178
I say zero.

1111
01:23:04,086 --> 01:23:06,654
- Never
- We'd rather not have them. I think

1112
01:23:11,493 --> 01:23:14,482
- None.
- Zero.

1113
01:23:14,797 --> 01:23:16,965
No nuclear weapons.
Zero.

1114
01:23:16,966 --> 01:23:18,933
- Zero.
- Zero.

1115
01:23:18,934 --> 01:23:20,568
No country
should have them.

1116
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:23,895
The ultimate number is none.
Ideally will be zero

1117
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:27,446
- Zero nuclear weapons.
- Zero. Zero.

1118
01:23:43,592 --> 01:23:45,693
<i>We have taken important steps forward </ i>

1119
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:47,462
<i> to increase
nuclear security</ i>

1120
01:23:47,463 --> 01:23:49,864
<i> and to stop the spread
of nuclear weapons. </ i>

1121
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:51,866
<i> This starts with the reduction </ i>

1122
01:23:51,867 --> 01:23:53,968
<i> of our own
nuclear arsenals. </ i>

1123
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:58,872
This legally binding treaty <i>
will be completed this year. </ i>

1124
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:02,643
The arms control agreements we negotiated

1125
01:24:02,644 --> 01:24:05,213
between the United States
and the Soviet Union ...

1126
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:07,782
You think these were
independent initiatives

1127
01:24:07,783 --> 01:24:09,984
taken by governments,

1128
01:24:09,985 --> 01:24:12,170
but the fact is that
public opinion

1129
01:24:12,171 --> 01:24:14,642
had a big role to play in the process

1130
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:17,091
- President Kennedy,

1131
01:24:17,092 --> 01:24:19,961
After he passed the limited test ban treaty

1132
01:24:19,962 --> 01:24:22,430
and whenever he mentioned 
it on the stump afterwards he

1133
01:24:22,431 --> 01:24:25,587
got thunderous applause.
And he quote:

1134
01:24:25,588 --> 01:24:27,602
"If I had known that it
was so popular,

1135
01:24:27,603 --> 01:24:30,003
"I would have done
it a long time ago. "

1136
01:24:30,338 --> 01:24:32,407
The elimination of
nuclear weapons

1137
01:24:32,408 --> 01:24:36,610
has not yet been agreed to by
political leaders of the world.

1138
01:24:36,779 --> 01:24:40,702
It's a revolutionary idea,
but they can be eliminated.

1139
01:24:45,754 --> 01:24:48,256
We have to change
our way of thinking.

1140
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:51,025
And if we cant change
our way of thinking,

1141
01:24:51,026 --> 01:24:54,133
we wont survive.
Its that simple

1142
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:56,763
I have changed my way of thinking

1143
01:24:56,764 --> 01:24:59,327
and millions and millions of other people
are changing their thinking

1144
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:03,004
And, frankly, if you have never 
changed your mind about something,

1145
01:25:03,005 --> 01:25:06,353
I .. pinch yourself
You maybe dead.

1146
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:08,976
