1
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,634
Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California.

2
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,096
It's about 5:00 in the morning.

3
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,015
That's the homicide squad,

4
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,769
complete with detectives
and newspapermen.

5
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,938
A murder has been reported from
one of those great big houses

6
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,274
in the 10,000 block.

7
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,444
You'll read about it
in the late editions, I'm sure.

8
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,364
You'll get it over your radio
and see it on television.

9
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,619
Because an old-time star is involved.
One of the biggest.

10
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:05,166
But before you hear it all distorted
and blown out of proportion,

11
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,711
before those Hollywood columnists
get their hands on it,

12
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,215
maybe you'd like to hear the facts.
The whole truth.

13
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,386
If so, you've come to the right party.

14
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,808
You see, the body of a young man was
found floating in the pool of her mansion

15
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,311
with two shots in his back
and one in his stomach.

16
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,230
Nobody important, really.

17
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:31,150
Just a movie writer
with a couple of B pictures to his credit.

18
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,405
The poor dope.
He always wanted a pool.

19
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,242
Well, in the end, he got himself a pool,

20
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,370
only the price
turned out to be a little high.

21
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:50,002
Let's go back about six months
and find the day when it all started.

22
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:54,298
I was living in an apartment house
above Franklin and lvar.

23
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,801
Things were tough at the moment.

24
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,972
I hadn't worked in a studio
for a long time.

25
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,976
So I sat there, grinding out
original stories, two a week.

26
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,313
Only I seemed to have lost my touch.

27
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,316
Maybe they weren't original enough.

28
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,152
Maybe they were too original.

29
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,822
All I know is, they didn't sell.

30
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,868
Yeah?

31
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,130
- Joseph C. Gillis?
- That's right.

32
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,300
We've come for the car.

33
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,634
What car?

34
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,556
1946 Plymouth convertible,
California license 40R-116.

35
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,892
Where are the keys?

36
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,602
Why should I give you the keys?

37
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,979
Because the company's
played ball with you long enough,

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,232
because you're three payments behind
and because we got a court order.

39
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,692
Now, come on. The keys.

40
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,403
Or do you want us to jack it up
and haul it away?

41
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,407
- Relax, fans. The car isn't here.
- Oh, is that so?

42
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,827
I loaned it to a friend of mine.
He took it down to Palm Springs.

43
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,079
Had to get away for his health,
I suppose.

44
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,081
If you don't believe me,
look in the garage.

45
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,835
Sure, sure, we believe you.
Only now we want you to believe us.

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,006
That car better be back here by noon
tomorrow or there's gonna be fireworks.

47
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,175
You say the cutest things.

48
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,773
Well, I needed about $290,

49
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,610
and I needed it real quick,
or I'd lose my car.

50
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,864
It wasn't in Palm Springs,
and it wasn't in the garage.

51
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,116
I was way ahead
of the finance company.

52
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,537
I knew they'd be coming around,
and I wasn't taking any chances.

53
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,039
So I kept it across the street

54
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,210
in a parking lot
behind Rudy's Shoeshine Parlor.

55
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,630
Rudy never asked any questions
about your finances.

56
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,841
He'd just look at your heels
and know the score.

57
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,724
I had an original story
kicking around Paramount.

58
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,519
My agent told me
it was dead as a doornail.

59
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,730
But I knew a big shot over there
who'd always liked me.

60
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,817
And the time had come to take
a little advantage of it.

61
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,527
His name was Sheldrake.

62
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,239
He was a smart producer,
with a set of ulcers to prove it.

63
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,328
All right, Gillis, you've got five minutes.
What's your story about?

64
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,249
It's about a baseball player,
a rookie shortstop that's batting.347.

65
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,875
Poor kid was
once mixed up in a holdup.

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,502
But he's trying to go straight.

67
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,713
Except there are a bunch of gamblers
that won't let him.

68
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,174
So they tell the poor kid he's got to
throw the World Series or else, huh?

69
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,300
More or less, except for the end.

70
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,427
I've got a gimmick that's real good.

71
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,970
Uh-huh. You got a title?

72
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,222
Bases Loaded.
There's a 40-page outline.

73
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:52,351
Call Readers' Department. Find out
what they have on Bases Loaded.

74
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,229
They're pretty hot about it
over at Twentieth,

75
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,939
except I think Zanuck's all wet.

76
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,525
Can you see Ty Power as a shortstop?

77
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,278
You've got the best man for it
right here on this lot. Alan Ladd.

78
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,988
Be a good change of pace for Ladd.

79
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,990
And there's another thing.
It's pretty simple to shoot.

80
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,908
Lots of outdoor stuff.

81
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,619
I bet you could make the whole thing
for under a million.

82
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,746
Excuse me.

83
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,456
And there's a great little part
for Bill Demarest,

84
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,041
one of the trainers, an old-time player

85
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,793
who got beaned,
goes out of his head sometimes.

86
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,086
- Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Hello.

87
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,214
On that Bases Loaded,
I covered it with a two-page synopsis.

88
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,717
- Thank you.
- But I wouldn't bother.

89
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,635
- What's wrong with it?
- It's from hunger.

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,763
Nothing for Ladd?

91
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,474
It's just a rehash of something
that wasn't very good to begin with.

92
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,560
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.
He wrote it.

93
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,479
This is Miss Kramer.

94
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,399
The name is Schaefer. Betty Schaefer.

95
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,820
Right now I wish I could crawl
in a hole and pull it in after me.

96
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,739
And if I could be of any help...

97
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,201
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I
just didn't think it was any good.

98
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,870
I found it flat and trite.

99
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,955
Exactly what kind of material
do you recommend?

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,874
James Joyce? Dostoyevsky?

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,460
I just think that pictures
should say a little something.

102
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,671
Oh, one of the message kids.
Just a story won't do.

103
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,090
You'd have turned down
Gone with the Wind.

104
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:08,177
No, that was me. I said,
"Who wants to see a Civil War picture?"

105
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,140
Perhaps the reason I hated
Bases Loaded is that I knew your name.

106
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,725
I'd always heard
that you had some talent.

107
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,811
That was last year.
This year I'm trying to earn a living.

108
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,481
So you take plot 27-A,
make it glossy, make it slick...

109
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,941
Those are dirty words.

110
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,984
You sound like
a bunch of New York critics.

111
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:28,280
- That'll be all, Miss Kramer... Schaefer.
- Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.

112
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,617
Next time I'll write you
The Naked and the Dead.

113
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:36,872
Well, it seems like Zanuck
has got himself a baseball picture.

114
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,249
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think

115
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,626
I thought this was going to win
any Academy Award.

116
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,712
Of course, we're always
looking for a Betty Hutton.

117
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,966
- Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
- Frankly, no.

118
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,846
Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls'
softball team, put in a few numbers.

119
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,642
Might make a cute musical. It Happened
in the Bullpen: Story of a Woman.

120
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,688
Are you trying to be funny?
Because I'm all out of laughs.

121
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,732
- I'm over a barrel. I need a job.
- I haven't got a thing.

122
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,360
Any kind of an assignment.
Additional dialog.

123
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,445
There's nothing. Honest.

124
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,492
Look, Mr. Sheldrake.

125
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,745
Could you let me have 300 bucks
yourself, as a personal loan?

126
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,831
Could I? Gillis.

127
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,253
Last year somebody talked me
into buying a ranch in the Valley.

128
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,089
So I borrowed the money from
the bank to pay for the ranch.

129
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,342
This year I had to mortgage the ranch
so I could keep up my life insurance,

130
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,219
so I could borrow on my insurance...

131
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,851
After that I drove down to headquarters.

132
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,021
That's the way a lot of us
think about Schwab's drugstore.

133
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,108
Kind of a combination office,
kaffeeklatsch and waiting room.

134
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,820
Waiting. Waiting for the gravy train.

135
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,952
I got myself 10 nickels and started
sending out a general SOS.

136
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,997
Couldn't get hold of my agent, naturally.

137
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,500
So then I called a pal of mine,
Artie Green,

138
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,503
an awful nice guy, an assistant director.

139
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,548
He could let me have 20.
But 20 wouldn't do.

140
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,345
Then I talked to
a couple of yes-men at Metro.

141
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,764
To me they said no.

142
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:21,644
Finally I located that agent of mine.
The big faker.

143
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,480
Was he out digging up a job
for poor Joe Gillis?

144
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,567
No. He was hard at work in Bel-Air,
making with the golf sticks.

145
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,700
So you need $300.
Of course I could give you $300.

146
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,245
- Only I'm not going to.
- No?

147
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,415
Gillis, get this through your head.
I'm not just your agent. It's not the 10%.

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,501
- I'm your friend.
- You are?

149
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,336
Don't you know
the finest things in the world

150
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,088
have been written
on an empty stomach?

151
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,050
Once a talent like yours gets into that
Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through.

152
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,469
Forget Romanoffs.
It's the car I'm talking about!

153
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,513
If I lose my car,
it's like having my legs cut off.

154
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
Greatest thing that could happen to you.

155
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,643
Now you'll have to sit behind
the typewriter. Now you'll have to write.

156
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,730
What do you think I've been doing?
I need $300.

157
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,192
Sweetheart, maybe what you need
is another agent.

158
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,417
As I drove back towards town,
I took inventory of my prospects.

159
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,461
They now added up to exactly zero.

160
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,423
Apparently I just didn't have
what it takes.

161
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:36,635
And the time had come to wrap up the
whole Hollywood deal and go home.

162
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,137
Maybe if I hocked all my junk

163
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,307
there'd be enough
for a bus ticket back to Ohio.

164
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,476
Back to that $35-a-week job
behind the copy desk

165
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,480
at the Dayton Evening Post,
if it was still open.

166
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,650
Back to the smirking delight
of the whole office.

167
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,654
"All right, you wise guys. Why don't you
go out and take a crack at Hollywood?

168
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,407
"Maybe you think
that you could make..."

169
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,927
I had landed myself
in the driveway of some big mansion

170
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,888
that looked run-down and deserted.

171
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,849
At the end of the drive
was a lovely sight indeed,

172
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:11,146
a great big empty garage,
just standing there, going to waste.

173
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:16,110
If ever there was a place to stash away
a limping car with a hot license number.

174
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,122
There was another occupant
in that garage,

175
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,417
an enormous, foreign-built automobile.

176
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,920
It must have burned up
ten gallons to a mile.

177
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,090
It had a 1932 license.

178
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,010
I figured that's when the owners
had moved out.

179
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,721
And I also figured I couldn't
go back to my apartment

180
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,516
now that those bloodhounds
were onto me.

181
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,810
The idea was to get to Artie Green's
and stay there

182
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,771
until I could make that bus for Ohio.

183
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,442
Once back in Dayton, I'd drop the
credit boys a picture postcard,

184
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,361
telling them where to pick up the jalopy.

185
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,617
It was a great big white elephant
of a place.

186
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,455
The kind crazy movie people
built in the crazy '20s.

187
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,167
A neglected house
gets an unhappy look.

188
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,836
This one had it in spades.

189
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,423
It was like that old woman
in Great Expectations,

190
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,927
that Miss Havisham in her rotting
wedding dress and her torn veil,

191
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,890
taking it out on the world
because she'd been given the go-by.

192
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,857
You there! Why are you so late?

193
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,570
Why have you kept me waiting so long?

194
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,081
In here.

195
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,091
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blowout. I thought maybe...

196
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,635
Go on in.

197
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,970
Look, maybe I'd better take my car
and get it off...

198
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,597
Wipe your feet.

199
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,268
Go on.

200
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,360
You're not properly dressed
for the occasion.

201
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,656
- What's the occasion?
- Have him come up, Max.

202
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,324
Up the stairs.

203
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,867
Suppose you listen to me
for just a minute.

204
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,537
- Madame is waiting.
- For me?

205
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,123
Okay.

206
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,634
If you need any help
with the coffin, call me.

207
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,488
This way.

208
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,455
In here.

209
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,584
I put him on my massage table
in front of the fire.

210
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,129
He always liked fires
and poking at them with a stick.

211
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,721
I've made up my mind
we'll bury him in the garden.

212
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,432
Any city laws against that?

213
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,767
- I wouldn't know.
- I don't care anyway.

214
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:40,063
I want the coffin to be white,
and I want it specially lined with satin.

215
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,274
White or deep pink.

216
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,740
Maybe red. Bright, flaming red.
Let's make it gay.

217
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,959
How much will it be?

218
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:05,631
I warn you, don't give me a fancy price
just because I'm rich!

219
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:10,469
Lady, you got the wrong man. I had
some trouble with my car. A flat tire.

220
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,847
I pulled into your garage
until I could get a spare.

221
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:19,144
- I thought this was an empty house.
- It is not. Get out.

222
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,731
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry you lost your friend.

223
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,318
And I don't think red is the right color.

224
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,488
Wait a minute. Haven't I seen you
before? I know your face.

225
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,825
- Get out. Or shall I call my servant?
- You're Norma Desmond!

226
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,704
You used to be in silent pictures.
You used to be big!

227
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:42,250
I am big. It's the pictures that got small.

228
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,672
I knew there was something
wrong with them.

229
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,174
They're dead. They're finished.

230
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,509
There was a time in this business

231
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,345
when they had the eyes
of the whole wide world.

232
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,014
But that wasn't good enough for them.
Oh, no!

233
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,183
They had to have the ears
of the world, too.

234
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:03,522
So they opened their big mouths
and out came talk, talk, talk.

235
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,232
That's where
the popcorn business comes in.

236
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,693
You buy yourself a bag
and plug up your ears.

237
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,363
Look at them in the front offices,
the masterminds!

238
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,615
They took the idols and smashed them.

239
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,451
The Fairbankses, the Gilberts,
the Valentinos!

240
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,287
And who have we got now?
Some nobodies!

241
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,874
Don't blame me.
I'm not an executive, just a writer.

242
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,628
You are.
Writing words, words, more words!

243
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,506
Well, you've made a rope of words
and strangled this business!

244
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,384
But there's a microphone right there
to catch the last gurgles,

245
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,470
and Technicolor to photograph
the red, swollen tongue!

246
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,433
- You'll wake up the monkey.
- Get out! Max!

247
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,395
Next time I'll bring
my autograph album along.

248
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,940
Or maybe a hunk of cement,
and ask for your footprint.

249
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,906
- It's okay. Okay, I'm going.
- Just a minute, you.

250
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,576
- You're a writer, you said.
- Why?

251
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,828
Are you or aren't you?

252
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,872
That's what it says on my Guild card.

253
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,625
And you have written pictures,
haven't you?

254
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,587
Sure have. Want a list of my credits?

255
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,590
I want to ask you something.
Come in here.

256
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,426
Last one I wrote was about Okies
in the Dust Bowl.

257
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,553
You'd never know it, because
when it reached the screen,

258
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,389
the whole thing played
on a torpedo boat.

259
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,691
Intimate, isn't it?

260
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,364
The wind gets in that blasted pipe
organ. I ought to have it taken out.

261
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,784
Or teach it a better tune.

262
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,119
Young man, tell me something.

263
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:45,123
How long is a movie script these days?
I mean, how many pages?

264
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,793
Depends on what it is,
a Donald Duck or a Joan of Arc.

265
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:53,173
This is to be a very important picture.
I've written it myself. Took me years.

266
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,425
Looks like enough
for six important pictures.

267
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,804
It's a story of Salome.
I think I'll have DeMille direct it.

268
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,306
DeMille?

269
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,976
- We made a lot of pictures together.
- And you'll play Salome.

270
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,522
Who else?

271
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,066
Only asking. I didn't know
you were planning a comeback.

272
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,110
I hate that word! It's a return!

273
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,821
A return to the millions of people

274
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,824
who have never forgiven me
for deserting the screen.

275
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:24,538
- Fair enough.
- Salome. What a woman. What a part!

276
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,957
The princess in love with a holy man.

277
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,125
She dances
the dance of the seven veils.

278
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,088
He rejects her, so she demands
his head on a golden tray.

279
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,300
Kissing his cold, dead lips.

280
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,012
- They'll love it in Pomona.
- They'll love it every place.

281
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,723
Read it. Read the scene
just before she has him killed.

282
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,184
Never let another writer read
your material. He may steal it.

283
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,771
I'm not afraid. Read it.
Max, bring something to drink.

284
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,901
- Sit down. Is there enough light?
- I've got 20-20 vision.

285
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,988
I said sit down.

286
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,036
Well, I had no pressing engagement,

287
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,164
except with those boys
from the finance office.

288
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,376
And she'd mentioned
something to drink. Why not?

289
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:18,425
Sometimes it's interesting to see
just how bad, bad writing can be.

290
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,428
This promised to go the limit.

291
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,388
I wondered what a handwriting expert

292
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,308
would make of that
childish scrawl of hers.

293
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,397
Max wheeled in some champagne
and some caviar.

294
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:37,944
Later I found out that Max was the only
other person in that grim Sunset castle.

295
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,489
And I found out
a few other things about him.

296
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,577
As for her, she sat
coiled up like a watch spring,

297
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,580
her cigarette clamped
in a curious holder.

298
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,917
I could sense her eyes on me
from behind those dark glasses,

299
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,961
defying me not to like what I read.

300
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:59,257
Or maybe begging me
in her own proud way to like it.

301
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,343
It meant so much to her.

302
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:13,730
It sure was a cozy setup,
that bundle of raw nerves and Max

303
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,982
and a dead monkey upstairs.

304
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,694
And the wind wheezing through
that organ once in a while.

305
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:33,083
Later on, just for comedy relief,
the real guy arrived with the baby coffin.

306
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,505
It was all done with great dignity.

307
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,800
He must have been
a very important chimp.

308
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,678
The great-grandson
of King Kong, maybe.

309
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,642
It got to be 11:00.

310
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,186
I was feeling a little sick at my stomach,

311
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,482
what with that sweet champagne
and that tripe I'd been reading,

312
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:02,028
that silly hodgepodge
of melodramatic plots.

313
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:07,409
However, by then, I'd started
concocting a little plot of my own.

314
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,329
Well?

315
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,249
- This is fascinating.
- Of course it is.

316
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,045
Maybe it's a little long and maybe
there's some repetitions,

317
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,007
but you're not a professional writer.

318
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:27,345
- I wrote that with my heart.
- Sure you did.

319
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,597
That's what makes it great.

320
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,145
What it needs is
maybe a little more dialog.

321
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,897
What for?
I can say anything I want with my eyes.

322
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,358
Well, it certainly could use
a pair of shears and a blue pencil.

323
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,861
I will not have it butchered.

324
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,823
Of course not,
but it ought to be organized.

325
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,159
Just an editing job.
You can find somebody.

326
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:53,204
Who?
I'd have to have somebody I could trust.

327
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,124
When were you born?
I mean, what sign of the zodiac?

328
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,377
- I don't know.
- What month?

329
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,379
December 21.

330
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:05,925
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians.
You can trust them.

331
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,179
- Thank you.
- I want you to do this work.

332
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,347
Me?

333
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm busy. I just finished a script,
and I'm due on another assignment.

334
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,188
I don't care.

335
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,609
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get 500 a week.

336
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:27,238
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.

337
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,574
Maybe I'd better take the rest
of the script home and read it.

338
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,161
Oh, no! I couldn't let it out of my house.
You'll have to finish it here.

339
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,413
Well, it's getting kind of late.

340
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,876
- Are you married, Mr...
- Name is Gillis. Single.

341
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,421
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. Alto Nido Apartments.

342
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,465
There's something wrong
with your car, you said.

343
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,675
There sure is.

344
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,429
- Why shouldn't you stay here?
- Look, I'll come back early tomorrow.

345
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:55,100
Nonsense.
There's a room over the garage.

346
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,685
Max will take you there. Max!

347
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,820
I felt kind of pleased
with the way I'd handled the situation.

348
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,240
I dropped the hook
and she snapped at it.

349
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:15,495
Now my car would be safe down below
while I did a patch-up job on the script.

350
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,414
And there should be
plenty of money in it.

351
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,464
This room hasn't
been used for a long time.

352
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,051
It'll never make House Beautiful,
but I guess it's okay for one night.

353
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,053
I made your bed this afternoon.

354
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:36,558
Thanks. How did you know I was
gonna stay this afternoon?

355
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:41,020
The bathroom's over there. I put in
some towels, soap and a toothbrush.

356
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:49,445
Say, she's quite a character,
that Norma Desmond.

357
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,575
She was the greatest of them all.
You wouldn't know. You're too young.

358
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,203
In one week she received
17,000 fan letters.

359
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,874
Men bribed her hairdresser
to get a lock of her hair.

360
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,376
There was a maharajah
who came all the way from India

361
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,755
to beg one of her silk stockings.
Later he strangled himself with it.

362
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,303
Well, I sure turned in
to an interesting driveway.

363
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,181
You did, sir. Good night, sir.

364
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:26,232
I pegged him as slightly cuckoo, too.

365
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,027
A stroke, maybe.

366
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,572
Come to think of it, the whole
place seemed to have been stricken

367
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:38,244
with a kind of creeping paralysis,
out of beat with the rest of the world,

368
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,581
crumbling apart in slow motion.

369
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:46,753
There was a tennis court,
or rather the ghost of a tennis court,

370
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,505
with faded markings and a sagging net.

371
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:58,932
And, of course, she had a pool.
Who didn't then?

372
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:04,562
Mabel Normand and John Gilbert must
have swum in it 10,000 midnights ago.

373
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:08,566
And Vilma Banky and Rod La Rocque.

374
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,736
It was empty now. Or was it?

375
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,496
There was something else
going on below.

376
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:28,378
The last rites for that hairy old chimp,
performed with the utmost seriousness.

377
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,590
As if she were
laying to rest an only child.

378
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,178
Was her life really as empty as that?

379
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:52,068
It was all very queer.
But queerer things were yet to come.

380
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,579
That night I had a mixed-up dream.

381
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,332
In it, there was an organ grinder.

382
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:10,420
I couldn't see his face,
but the organ was all draped in black,

383
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:14,299
and a chimp was dancing for pennies.

384
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:18,803
When I opened my eyes,
the music was still there.

385
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,346
Where was I?

386
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,102
Oh, yes.
In that empty room over her garage.

387
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:32,233
Only it wasn't empty anymore.
I'd had a visitor.

388
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,320
Somebody had brought in
all my belongings.

389
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,072
My books, my typewriter, my clothes.

390
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,826
What was going on?

391
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:05,892
Hey, you! Max, whatever your name is,
what are my things doing here?

392
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:10,313
I'm talking to you! My clothes
and things are up in the room!

393
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:16,402
- Naturally. I brought them myself.
- Is that so?

394
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,489
Why, what's the matter?
Is there anything missing?

395
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,240
Who said you could?
Who asked you to?

396
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,745
I did. I don't know why
you should be so upset.

397
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,538
Stop that playing, Max.

398
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:31,125
It seemed like a good idea
if we are to work together.

399
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,670
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.

400
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,714
There's nothing in the deal
about my staying here!

401
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,049
You'll like it here.

402
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,093
Thanks for the invitation.
I've got my own apartment.

403
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,762
You can't work in an apartment
where you owe three months' rent.

404
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,808
- I'll take care of that.
- It's all taken care of, it's all paid for.

405
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,146
Okay, we'll deduct it from my salary.

406
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,401
Now, now, don't let's be small about
such matters. We won't keep books.

407
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:01,406
- Max, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
- It is done, Madame.

408
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,908
Well, pack them up again!
I didn't say I was staying!

409
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:08,037
Suppose you make up your mind.
Do you want this job or don't you?

410
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,084
Yes, I wanted the job.

411
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,796
I wanted the dough, and I wanted
to get out of there as quickly as I could.

412
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:21,509
I thought if I really got going,
I could finish it up in a couple of weeks.

413
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,886
But it wasn't so simple
getting some coherence

414
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,973
into those wild hallucinations of hers.

415
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:30,810
And what made it even tougher was
that she was around all the time,

416
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:35,940
hovering over me, afraid I'd do injury
to that precious brainchild of hers.

417
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:46,576
- What's that?
- Just a scene I threw out.

418
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,035
Which scene?

419
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,620
The one where you go
to the slave market.

420
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,247
It's better to cut directly
to John the Baptist...

421
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,875
Cut away from me?

422
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,711
Honestly, it's a little too much of you.
They don't want you in every scene.

423
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,047
They don't? Then why do they still
write me fan letters every day?

424
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,632
Why do they beg me
for my photographs?

425
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:06,888
Why? Because they want to see me.
Me! Norma Desmond.

426
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,724
- Put it back.
- Okay.

427
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,616
I didn't argue with her.

428
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,245
You don't yell at a sleepwalker.
He may fall and break his neck.

429
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,663
That's it.

430
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:36,667
She was still sleepwalking along
the giddy heights of a lost career.

431
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:41,672
Plain crazy when it came to that
one subject, her celluloid self,

432
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,217
the great Norma Desmond.

433
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,970
How could she breathe in that house
so crowded with Norma Desmonds,

434
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,932
more Norma Desmonds

435
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,435
and still more Norma Desmonds?

436
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,232
It wasn't all work, of course.

437
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,985
Two or three times a week, Max would
haul up that enormous oil painting

438
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,989
that had been presented to her by
some Nevada Chamber of Commerce

439
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:11,035
and we'd see a movie,
right in her living room.

440
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,664
So much nicer than going out,
she'd say.

441
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:19,168
The plain fact was she was afraid
of that world outside.

442
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:22,338
Afraid it would remind her
that time had passed.

443
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:29,053
They were silent movies, and Max
would run the projection machine,

444
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,222
which was just as well.

445
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,099
It kept him from
giving us an accompaniment

446
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,142
on that wheezing organ.

447
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,564
She'd sit very close to me

448
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,984
and she smelled of tuberoses,
which is not my favorite perfume,

449
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,361
not by a long shot.

450
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,657
Sometimes as we watched,
she'd clutch my arm or my hand,

451
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,951
forgetting she was my employer.

452
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:56,414
Just becoming a fan, excited about
that actress up there on the screen.

453
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:02,420
I guess I don't have to tell you
who the star was.

454
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,924
They were always her pictures.
That's all she wanted to see.

455
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:38,623
Still wonderful, isn't it? And no dialog.

456
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,334
We didn't need dialog. We had faces.

457
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,088
There just aren't any faces
like that anymore.

458
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,382
Maybe one, Garbo.

459
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,221
Oh, those idiot producers.
Those imbeciles.

460
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,391
Haven't they got any eyes? Have they
forgotten what a star looks like?

461
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,770
I'll show them.
I'll be up there again, so help me!

462
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,241
Sometimes there'd be
a little bridge game in the house,

463
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,661
at a twentieth of a cent a point.

464
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,829
I'd get half of her winnings

465
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,207
once they ran up to 70 cents,

466
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,669
which was about
the only cash money I ever got.

467
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,755
The others around the table
would be actor friends.

468
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,676
Dim figures you may still remember
from the silent days.

469
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,512
I used to think of them
as her waxworks.

470
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,972
- One diamond.
- One heart.

471
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,311
- Spade.
- Pass.

472
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,606
- Three no-trump.
- Pass.

473
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,442
Pass.

474
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,278
Empty the ashtray, will you, Joe, dear?

475
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,516
There are some men outside,

476
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,934
- they asked for you.
- I'm not here.

477
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,936
- That's what I told them.
- Good.

478
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,441
But they found your car in the garage,
and they're going to tow it away.

479
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,861
Where's the ashtray?
Joe, can't we have the ashtray?

480
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,245
I want to talk to you for a minute.

481
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,664
Not now, my dear.
I'm playing three no-trump.

482
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,416
They've come for my car.

483
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,836
Please. Now I've forgotten
how many spades are out.

484
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,423
- Look, I need some money right now.
- Can't you wait until I'm dummy?

485
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,259
- No.
- Please.

486
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:34,507
- Now what is it? Where's the fire?
- I've lost my car.

487
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,467
And I thought it was
a matter of life and death.

488
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,386
It is, to me.
That's why I came to this house.

489
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,806
That's why I took this job ghostwriting.

490
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,601
Now you're being silly.
We don't need two cars. We have a car.

491
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,979
Not one of those cheap new things
made of chromium and spit.

492
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:53,192
An Isotta-Fraschini. Have you
ever heard of Isotta-Fraschini?

493
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,737
All handmade. Cost me $28,000.

494
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,828
So Max got that old bus
down off its blocks and polished it up.

495
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,748
She'd take me for rides
in the hills above Sunset.

496
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:12,294
The whole thing was upholstered
in leopard skin

497
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:16,382
and had one of those car phones,
all gold-plated.

498
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:22,054
- That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
- What's wrong with it?

499
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,848
Nothing, if you work in the filling station.

500
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:28,435
And I'm getting rather bored with that
sport jacket and the same baggy pants.

501
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:35,025
Max, what's a good men's shop in town?
The very best? Well, go there.

502
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,279
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly
don't want you buying them for me.

503
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:42,992
Why begrudge me a little fun?
I just want you to look nice.

504
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,952
And must you chew gum?

505
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,170
Now there's nothing like
blue flannel for a man.

506
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,256
Now this one,
single-breasted, of course.

507
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,885
Now we need a topcoat. Let me see
what you have in camel's hair.

508
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,929
- How about some evening clothes?
- I don't need a tuxedo.

509
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,724
Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails,
and if you aren't careful,

510
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,893
you'll get a cutaway.

511
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,394
Tails! That's ridiculous.

512
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,771
You need them for parties.
You need them for New Year's Eve.

513
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:16,150
- Where are your evening clothes?
- This way, Madame.

514
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,531
Here are some camel's hair,
but I'd like you just to feel this.

515
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,075
It's vicuna.
Of course, it's a little more expensive.

516
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,202
The camel's hair will do.

517
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:33,500
Well, as long as the lady's paying for it,
why not take the vicuna?

518
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,348
The last week in December,
the rains came.

519
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,059
A great big package of rain,

520
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:54,271
oversized, like everything else
in California.

521
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:58,317
It came right through the old roof
of my room above the garage.

522
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,113
She had Max move me
to the main house.

523
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,783
I didn't much like the idea.

524
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,787
The only time I could have to myself
was in that room.

525
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,582
But it was better than sleeping
in a raincoat and galoshes.

526
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,999
- Whose room was this?
- It was the room of the husband.

527
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:59,253
Of the husbands, I should say.
Madame has been married three times.

528
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,970
I guess that's the one
you can see Catalina from.

529
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,055
Only this isn't the day.

530
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,780
Say, what's this with the door?
There isn't any lock.

531
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,909
There are no locks anywhere
in this house, sir.

532
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,085
How come? There must be a reason.

533
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,880
- The doctor suggested it.
- What doctor?

534
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:48,260
Madame's doctor.
Madame has moments of melancholy.

535
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,139
There have been
some attempts at suicide.

536
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,143
We have to be very careful.
No sleeping pills, no razor blades.

537
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,022
We shut off the gas
in Madame's bedroom.

538
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,149
Why? Her career?

539
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,193
She got enough out of it.
She's not forgotten.

540
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,944
She still gets those fan letters.

541
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,989
I wouldn't look too closely
at the postmarks.

542
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,579
You send them. Is that it, Max?

543
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,457
I had better press
your evening clothes, sir.

544
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,044
Mr. Gillis has not forgotten
Madame's New Year's party?

545
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:27,591
No, no, I haven't.
I suppose all the waxworks are coming.

546
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,011
I wouldn't know, sir.
Madame made the arrangements.

547
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,825
There it was again.

548
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:57,287
That room of hers, all satin and ruffles.

549
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,249
And that bed like a gilded rowboat.

550
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,168
The perfect setting
for a silent movie queen.

551
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,547
Poor devil.

552
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:10,843
Still waving proudly to a parade
which had long since passed her by.

553
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,600
It was at her New Year's party that
I found out how she felt about me.

554
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,355
Maybe I'd been an idiot
not to have sensed it was coming.

555
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,275
That sad, embarrassing revelation.

556
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,906
Joe!

557
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,665
You look absolutely divine.

558
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,125
- Turn around.
- Please.

559
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:48,839
Come on. Perfect. Wonderful shoulders.
I love that line.

560
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,925
It's all padding. Don't let it fool you.

561
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,385
You know, to me,
getting dressed up was always

562
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,179
just putting on my dark blue suit.

563
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,513
I don't like the stud they sent.

564
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,016
I want you to have a pearl.
A big, luscious pearl.

565
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,519
Well, I'm not going to wear
earrings, I can tell you that.

566
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,688
Cute. Come on, let's have a drink.

567
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,525
- Shouldn't we wait for the others?
- Max, champagne.

568
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,320
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.

569
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,616
Here's to us.

570
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,578
You know, this floor used to be wood,
but I had it changed.

571
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:24,541
Valentino said
there's nothing like tile for a tango.

572
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,544
- Come on.
- Not on the same floor with Valentino.

573
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,171
Just follow me.

574
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,608
Don't bend back like that.

575
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,819
- It's that thing. It tickles.
- It does?

576
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,473
It's quarter past 10. What time
are they supposed to get here?

577
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,141
- Who?
- The other guests.

578
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,768
There are no other guests.

579
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,437
We don't want to share this night
with other people.

580
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,856
This is for you and me.

581
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,026
- Oh?
- Hold me tighter.

582
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,486
Okay.

583
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,782
Come midnight, how about
blindfolding the orchestra

584
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,618
and smashing champagne glasses
over Max's head?

585
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,746
- You think this is all very funny.
- A little.

586
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,966
An hour dragged by.

587
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,220
I felt caught, like the cigarette
in that contraption on her finger.

588
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:10,480
What a wonderful next year it's
going to be. What fun we'll have!

589
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,065
I'll fill the pool for you.

590
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,527
I'll open my house in Malibu,
and you can have the whole ocean.

591
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,488
And when our picture is finished,
I'll buy you a boat

592
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,574
and we'll sail to Hawaii...

593
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,617
Stop it. You're not going
to buy me anything more.

594
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,619
Don't be silly.

595
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,831
Here.
I was going to give it to you at midnight.

596
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,711
Norma, I can't take it.
You've bought me enough.

597
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,421
Shut up. I'm rich.

598
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,008
I'm richer than all this
new Hollywood trash.

599
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,926
- I've got $1,000,000.
- Keep it.

600
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:44,556
I own three blocks downtown.
I've got oil in Bakersfield.

601
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,642
Pumping, pumping, pumping.

602
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:50,228
What's it for
but to buy us anything we want?

603
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,148
Cut out that "us" business!

604
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,649
What's the matter with you?

605
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,361
What right do you have
to take me for granted?

606
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,156
What right? Do you want me to tell you?

607
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,869
Has it ever occurred to you
that I may have a life of my own?

608
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,706
That there may be some girl
that I'm crazy about?

609
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,460
Who? Some carhop or dress extra?

610
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,213
What I'm trying to say is
that I'm all wrong for you.

611
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,217
You want a Valentino, somebody
with polo ponies. A big shot.

612
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,762
What you're trying to say is
you don't want me to love you.

613
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,139
Say it. Say it!

614
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:46,970
I didn't know where I was going.
I just had to get out of there.

615
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:52,100
I had to be with people my own age.
I had to hear somebody laugh again.

616
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,147
I thought of Artie Green.

617
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,316
There was bound to be
a New Year's shindig going on

618
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,902
in his apartment down on Las Palmas.

619
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,739
Writers without a job,
composers without a publisher,

620
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:10,202
actresses so young they still believe
the guys in the casting offices.

621
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:15,248
A bunch of kids who didn't give a hoot
just so long as they had a yuk to share.

622
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:22,756
Hollywood for us ain't been so good
Got no swimming pool, very few clothes

623
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,760
All we earn are buttons and bows

624
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,348
- Hello, Joe.
- Tom.

625
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,807
How are you, Joe?

626
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,893
- Welcome to the party.
- Hi, Joe.

627
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,564
- Well, what do you know! Joe Gillis!
- Hiya, Artie.

628
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,441
Where you been keeping
that gorgeous face of yours?

629
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:42,567
In a deep freeze.

630
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,028
I almost reported you
to the Bureau of Missing Persons.

631
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,114
Fans, you all know Joe Gillis,
the well-known screenwriter,

632
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,700
uranium smuggler
and Black Dahlia suspect.

633
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,913
- Come on, give me your coat.
- Let it ride for a while.

634
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,415
- You're gonna stay, aren't you?
- Well, that was the general idea.

635
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,002
Then, come on. What is this, mink?

636
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:05,799
Judas H. Priest!

637
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,385
Who did you borrow that from?
Adolphe Menjou?

638
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,636
Close, but no cigar.

639
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,972
Say, you're not really in the smuggling
business these days, are you?

640
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,140
- Where's the bar?
- Come on.

641
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,104
- It's a good party.
- The greatest.

642
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,940
They call me the Elsa Maxwell
of the assistant directors.

643
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,901
Hey, wait a minute.
Go easy on that punch bowl.

644
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,321
Budget only calls for
three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.

645
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,532
Say, Artie,
can I stick around here for a while?

646
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,200
Sure. This will go on all night.

647
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,411
No, I mean, can you put me up
for a couple of weeks?

648
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,621
It just so happens
we have a vacancy on the couch.

649
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:37,747
I'll take it.

650
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,374
I'll have the bellhop
take care of your luggage.

651
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,626
Just register it here.

652
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,339
- Hello, Mr. Gillis.
- Hello.

653
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,425
- You know each other?
- Let me help you.

654
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:52,429
- Betty Schaefer, Sheldrake's office.
- Oh, sure. Bases Loaded.

655
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:56,433
Wait a minute. This is the woman I love.
What's going on? Who was loaded?

656
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:59,019
Don't worry.
She's just a fan for my literary output.

657
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,312
Hurt Feelings Department.

658
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,855
Hey, about that luggage.
Where's the phone?

659
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,982
Over by the Rainbow Room.

660
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,329
Say, when you're through with
that thing, can I have it?

661
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,500
Hey, you forgot this.

662
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:26,338
- Thanks.
- I've been hoping to run into you.

663
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,174
What for? To recover that knife
you stuck in my back?

664
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:32,469
No. I felt a little guilty,
so I got out some of your old stories.

665
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,678
Why, you sweet kid.

666
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,973
There's one called Window,
something with a window.

667
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,142
- Dark Windows. How'd you like it?
- I didn't.

668
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,770
- Thank you.
- Except for about six pages.

669
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,773
You've got a flashback there...

670
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:48,735
- Is there someplace we can talk?
- How about the Rainbow Room?

671
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,657
Hey, Joe.
I said you could have my couch.

672
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:57,577
- I didn't say you could have my girl.
- Oh, this is shop talk.

673
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,789
Now, if I got you correctly,
there was a short stretch of my fiction

674
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,624
which you found worthy of notice.

675
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,000
The flashback scene in the courtroom

676
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,794
when she tells about
being a schoolteacher.

677
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,629
I had a teacher like that once.

678
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,007
Maybe that's why it's good.
It's true. It's moving.

679
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:13,927
- Now why don't you use that character...
- Who wants true? Who wants moving?

680
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,554
Drop that attitude!
Here's something really worthwhile.

681
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,890
Want me to start right away?
Maybe there's some paper around.

682
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,893
- I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
- And I've got a few ideas of my own.

683
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,478
One of them being
this is New Year's Eve.

684
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,854
How about living it up a little?

685
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,023
- As for instance?
- Well...

686
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,442
We could make some paper boats
and have a regatta.

687
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,152
Or we could turn on the shower
full blast.

688
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,613
How about capturing the kitchen
and barricading the door?

689
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,533
- Are you hungry?
- Hungry?

690
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,912
After 12 years in the Burmese jungle,
I'm starving, Lady Agatha.

691
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,916
- Starving for a white shoulder...
- Phillip, you're mad!

692
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,377
Thirsting for the coolness of your lips.

693
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,715
You can have the phone now.

694
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,635
No, Phillip, no. We must be strong.

695
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,054
You're still wearing the uniform
of the Coldstream Guards.

696
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:01,141
Furthermore,
you can have the phone now.

697
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,560
Okay.

698
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,146
Suddenly I find myself
terribly afraid of losing you.

699
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,858
You won't.
I'll get us a refill of this horrible liquid.

700
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:13,820
- You'll be waiting for me?
- With a wildly beating heart.

701
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,656
Life can be beautiful.

702
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:40,180
Hello, Max. This is Mr. Gillis.
I want you to do me a favor.

703
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,183
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis. I cannot talk now.

704
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,769
Yes you can.
I want you to get my old suitcase

705
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,271
and put in all my old clothes,
the ones I came with.

706
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,523
And my typewriter.
I'll have somebody pick them up.

707
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:54,611
I have no time to do anything now.
The doctor is here.

708
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,989
What doctor? What's going on?

709
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:01,367
Madame got the razor from your room
and she cut her wrists.

710
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,371
What? Max! Max!

711
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:20,345
I just got the recipe.
You take two packages of cough drops

712
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:23,848
and dissolve in one gallon
of lukewarm grape juice, and...

713
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:31,815
Hey, Joe!

714
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,658
Happy New Year!

715
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:49,833
- How is she?
- She's up in her room.

716
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,585
Be careful. Don't race upstairs.

717
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,088
The musicians mustn't know
what happened.

718
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,717
Go away.

719
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,271
What kind of a silly thing
was that to do?

720
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,774
To fall in love with you,
that was the idiotic thing.

721
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,738
It sure would have made
attractive headlines.

722
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:05,241
"Great Star Kills Herself
for Unknown Writer."

723
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,994
Great stars have great pride.

724
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,795
Go away. Go to that girl of yours.

725
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,637
Look, I was making that up

726
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:28,848
because I thought the whole thing
was a mistake.

727
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,811
I didn't want to hurt you.
You've been good to me.

728
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:37,774
You're the only person in this
stinking town that has been good to me.

729
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:41,361
Why don't you just
say thank you and go? Go, go!

730
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:45,031
Not until you promise to act
like a sensible human being.

731
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,826
I'll do it again. I'll do it again.

732
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,164
I'll do it again.

733
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,593
Happy New Year, Norma.

734
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,857
Happy New Year, darling.

735
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,876
Hello?

736
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,546
Is this Crestview 5-1733?

737
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,964
I'm sorry to bother you again,

738
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:28,384
but I've confirmed the number.
I must speak to Mr. Gillis.

739
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,637
- He's not here.
- Well, where can I reach him?

740
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,514
Maybe somebody else in the house
could tell me...

741
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,768
Nobody here can
give you any information.

742
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,437
And you will please not call again!

743
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,857
Max!

744
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,904
Who was it, Max? What is it?

745
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:54,494
Nothing, Madame.
Somebody inquiring about a stray dog.

746
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:59,290
Our number must be very similar
to the number of the pound.

747
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,877
Wait a minute.
I want you to get out the car.

748
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,545
You're to take the script
over to Paramount

749
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,381
and deliver it to Mr. DeMille in person.

750
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,342
Very good, Madame.

751
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:16,182
You really going to send
that script to DeMille?

752
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,852
Yes, I am. This is the day.
Here's the chart from my astrologer.

753
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,604
She read DeMille's horoscope.
She read mine.

754
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,273
- Did she read the script?
- DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio.

755
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,734
Mars has been transiting
Jupiter for weeks.

756
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:30,446
Today is the day
of the greatest conjunction.

757
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:33,449
Turn around, darling. Let me dry you.

758
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:39,914
I hope you realize, Norma, that
scripts don't sell on astrologer's charts.

759
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,291
I'm not just selling the script.
I'm selling me.

760
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:45,211
DeMille always said
I was his greatest star.

761
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,338
When did he say it, Norma?

762
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,007
All right, it was quite a few years ago.

763
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:53,219
But the point is,
I never looked better in my life.

764
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:57,223
Do you know why? Because I've
never been as happy in my life.

765
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,021
A few evenings later,
we were going to the house

766
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:07,150
of one of the waxworks
for some bridge.

767
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,485
She'd taught me
how to play bridge by then,

768
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,572
just as she'd taught me
some fancy tango steps

769
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,658
and what wine to drink with what fish.

770
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,831
That idiot!
He forgot to fill my cigarette case.

771
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,541
Here, have one of mine.

772
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,918
They're dreadful. They make me cough.

773
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,675
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max?
I'll get you some.

774
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,594
You're a darling.

775
00:58:56,408 --> 00:59:00,536
Give me a package of those
Turkish cigarettes. Abdullas.

776
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,250
Stick 'em up, Gillis!
Stick 'em up or I'll let you have it!

777
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,587
Hi, Artie. Good evening, Miss Schaefer.

778
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,464
You don't know
how glad I am to see you!

779
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,841
Walking out on the mob.
What's the big idea?

780
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,218
Oh, I'm sorry about New Year's.

781
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,845
Would you believe me if I told you
I stayed with a sick friend?

782
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,390
Someone in the formal set, no doubt,
with a 10-karat kidney stone.

783
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,769
Oh, stop it, Artie, will you?
Where've you been keeping yourself?

784
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,438
I've got
the most wonderful news for you.

785
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,107
I haven't been keeping myself at all.
Not lately.

786
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,818
I called your agent.
I called the Screen Writers' Guild.

787
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,404
Finally, your old apartment gave me
some Crestview number.

788
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,615
There was always somebody
with an accent growling at me.

789
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,450
You were not there.
You were not to be spoken to.

790
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,577
They never even heard of you.

791
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,497
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?

792
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,707
Sheldrake likes the angle
about the teacher.

793
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,417
- What teacher?
- Dark Windows.

794
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,002
I got him all hopped up about it.

795
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,629
He thinks it could be
made into something.

796
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,507
- Okay. Where's the cash?
- Where's the story?

797
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,300
I bluffed it out with a few notions
of my own.

798
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:58,552
It's really just a springboard.
It needs work.

799
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,720
I was afraid of that.

800
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,932
I've got twenty pages of notes and I've
got a pretty good character for the man.

801
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,517
Could you write in
plenty of background action

802
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,102
so they'll need an extra
assistant director, huh?

803
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,895
Oh, Artie, shut up!

804
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,064
Now, if we could sit down for two weeks
to get a story...

805
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,900
I'm sorry, Miss Schaefer,
I've given up writing on spec.

806
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,568
But I tell you this is half sold.

807
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,946
As a matter of fact,
I've given up writing altogether.

808
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,532
Mr. Gillis, if you please.

809
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,034
I'll be right there.

810
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,704
The accent! I get it!

811
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,539
This guy's in the pay
of a foreign government.

812
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,541
Check those studs. Get those cufflinks.

813
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,752
I've got to run along. Thanks anyway
for your interest in my career.

814
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:36,257
It's not your career, it's mine!
I'd kind of hoped to get in on this deal.

815
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,468
I don't want to be a reader all my life.
I want to write.

816
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,513
- I'm sorry if I crossed you up.
- You sure have!

817
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,223
So long.

818
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,695
What on earth, darling?
It took you hours.

819
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,697
Oh, I ran into some people I know.

820
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,034
- Where are my cigarettes?
- Where are your...

821
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,871
Norma, you're smoking too much.

822
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:13,169
Whenever she suspected
I was getting bored,

823
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:15,963
she would put on a live show for me.

824
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,549
The Norma Desmond Follies.

825
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:22,261
Her first number was always
the Mac Sennett Bathing Beauty.

826
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:35,941
I can still see myself in the line.
Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand.

827
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,819
Mabel was always stepping on my feet.

828
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:42,740
What's the matter with you, darling?
Why are you so glum?

829
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:46,869
Nothing's the matter. I'm having
a great time. Show me some more.

830
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:50,498
All right. Give me this.
I need it for a mustache.

831
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:52,958
Now, close your eyes. Close them.

832
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,676
Something was the matter all right.

833
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:07,098
I was thinking about that girl of Artie's,
that Miss Schaefer.

834
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:11,394
She was so like all us writers
when we first hit Hollywood,

835
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,354
itching with ambition,

836
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:18,609
planning to get your names up there.
"Screenplay by, Original Story by."

837
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:25,825
Audiences don't know somebody
sits down and writes a picture.

838
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:29,412
They think the actors make it up
as they go along.

839
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,414
Open your eyes.

840
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,785
- Madame is wanted on the telephone.
- You know better than to interrupt me.

841
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,871
- Paramount is calling.
- Who?

842
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,664
Paramount Studios.

843
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:18,878
Now! Now, do you believe me?
I told you DeMille would jump at it.

844
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,130
It is not Mr. DeMille in person.

845
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,299
It is someone
by the name of Gordon Cole.

846
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,260
- He says it's very important.
- Certainly it's important.

847
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,721
It's important enough
for DeMille to call me personally.

848
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,640
The very idea of having
some assistant call me!

849
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,685
- Say I'm busy and hang up!
- Very good, Madame.

850
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,235
How do you like that?

851
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,323
We've made 12 pictures together,
his greatest successes!

852
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,659
- Maybe he's busy, maybe he's shooting.
- I know that trick!

853
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:54,330
He's trying to belittle me.
He's trying to get my price down.

854
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:57,917
I've waited 20 years for this call.

855
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:01,086
Now DeMille can wait
until I'm good and ready.

856
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:07,301
About three days later
she was good and ready.

857
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,178
Incredible as it may seem,

858
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,057
there'd been some more of those
urgent calls from Paramount.

859
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:17,645
So, she put on about a half a pound
of makeup, fixed it up with a veil

860
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,065
and set forth to see DeMille in person.

861
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:28,113
Madame will pardon me, the shadow
over the left eye is not quite balanced.

862
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:31,075
Thank you, Max.

863
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,841
Hold that noise!

864
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,302
Hey!

865
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,138
To see Mr. DeMille. Open the gate!

866
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,724
Mr. DeMille is shooting.
You got an appointment?

867
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:59,395
No appointment necessary!
I'm bringing Norma Desmond.

868
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,063
Norma who?

869
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,233
Norma Desmond!

870
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,486
- Jonesy! Hey, Jonesy!
- Yeah?

871
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,656
Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond.

872
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,952
- How have you been, Miss Desmond?
- Open the gate!

873
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,329
Sure, Miss Desmond. Come on, Mac.

874
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,331
They can't drive on the lot
without a pass.

875
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,625
Miss Desmond can. Come on.

876
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,597
- Where's Mr. DeMille shooting?
- Stage 18, Miss Desmond.

877
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:38,100
Thank you, Jonesy,
and teach your friend some manners.

878
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,102
Tell him without me,
he wouldn't have any job,

879
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,187
because without me, there
wouldn't be any Paramount Studio.

880
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:45,024
- You're right, Miss Desmond.
- Go on, Max.

881
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,576
Stage 18.

882
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,121
Oh, I guess, get...
Notify Henry Wilcoxon.

883
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,583
Just clear them out, will you?
Spread the thing out so I can see it.

884
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,962
Keep it quiet a little bit,
will you, back there?

885
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:09,965
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see Mr. DeMille.

886
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,720
Can you hit that with a light, somebody,
so I can get a look at that 'scape?

887
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,847
Back up a little bit here, girlie, back up.

888
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,475
Soldier, get out of the way.
You fell over the back there.

889
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,810
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see Mr. DeMille.

890
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,729
Norma Desmond?

891
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,190
Wait a minute.

892
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:28,067
- Harry Wilcoxon!
- Yes?

893
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,819
Draw your sword
and raise that drape with it.

894
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,988
Samson's lying unconscious over here.

895
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:36,200
Norma Desmond is coming in
to see you, Mr. DeMille.

896
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,953
- Norma Desmond?
- She must be a million years old.

897
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:44,333
I hate to think where that puts me.
I could be her father.

898
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,501
Very sorry, Mr. DeMille.

899
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,629
It must be about
that awful script of hers.

900
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,174
What can I tell her? What can I say?

901
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,343
I can tell her you're all tied up
in the projection room.

902
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,679
I can give her the brush.

903
01:06:56,763 --> 01:07:00,182
Thirty million fans have given her
the brush. Isn't that enough?

904
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,559
- I didn't mean to...
- No, of course you didn't.

905
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:06,939
You didn't know Norma Desmond
as a lovely little girl of 17

906
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,566
with more courage and wit and heart

907
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,860
than ever came together
in one youngster.

908
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,113
I understand she was a terror
to work with.

909
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,365
Only toward the end.

910
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,618
You know, a dozen press agents
working overtime

911
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:23,956
can do terrible things
to the human spirit.

912
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,750
Hold everything.

913
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:35,801
- Don't you want to come along, darling?
- I don't think so.

914
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,720
It's your script. It's your show.
Good luck.

915
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,304
Thank you, dearest.

916
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,310
Well, hello, young fellow.

917
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:48,397
- Hello, Mr. DeMille.
- It's good to see you.

918
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,024
That last time I saw you
was some place very gay.

919
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,902
I remember waving to you.
I was dancing on a table.

920
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:58,532
A lot of people were. Lindbergh had just
landed in Paris. Come on in.

921
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:02,953
Norma, I...

922
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:06,915
- I must apologize for not calling you.
- You'd better. I'm very angry.

923
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,251
Well, as you can see, I'm terribly busy.

924
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,546
That's no excuse.
You read the script, of course?

925
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,256
Yes, I did.

926
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,924
Then you could have
picked up the telephone yourself,

927
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,051
instead of leaving it
to one of your assistants.

928
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:21,263
- What assistant?
- Now don't play innocent.

929
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:25,559
- Somebody named Gordon Cole.
- Gordon Cole?

930
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,270
And if you hadn't been pretty darned
interested in that script,

931
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:31,106
he wouldn't have tried to get me
on the telephone 10 times.

932
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,983
Gordon Cole!

933
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,361
Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.

934
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,822
Now, why don't you just sit
up here in my chair

935
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,949
and make yourself comfortable?

936
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,994
- Thank you.
- That's a girl. There.

937
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,163
I won't be a moment.

938
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,082
Bring me a telephone
and get me Gordon Cole.

939
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:50,375
Right.

940
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,309
Hey, Miss Desmond!

941
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:14,107
Miss Desmond! It's me! It's Hog-Eye.

942
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,735
Hello, Hog-Eye!

943
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,448
Let's get a good look at you!

944
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:28,705
- Look, there's Norma Desmond!
- Norma Desmond!

945
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,251
- Norma Desmond.
- Why, I thought she was dead!

946
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,002
How nice to see you.

947
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,505
Welcome home, Miss Desmond.
You remember me, don't you?

948
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,423
- Miss Desmond!
- Hello!

949
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,927
Mr. Wilcoxon,
have you met Miss Desmond?

950
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,679
It's a great pleasure.

951
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:46,223
Oh, Gordon. This is C.B. DeMille.

952
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,350
Have you been calling
Norma Desmond?

953
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,893
Yes, Mr. DeMille.

954
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:52,688
It's that car of hers,
an old Isotta-Fraschini.

955
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,648
Her chauffeur drove it in
on the lot the other day.

956
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,692
It looks just right for the Crosby picture.

957
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,278
We want to rent it
for a couple of weeks.

958
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,779
Oh, I see.

959
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,450
Well, thank you very much. Thank you.

960
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:24,469
Hog-Eye, turn that light
back where it belongs.

961
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,402
Well, I...

962
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,738
I got hold of Gordon Cole.

963
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,449
Did you see them?
Did you see how they came?

964
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,825
You know,

965
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:50,454
some crazy things happen
in this business, Norma.

966
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,832
I hope you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

967
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,294
- What's the matter, dear?
- Nothing.

968
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:01,632
I just didn't realize what it would be like
to come back to the old studio.

969
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,176
I had no idea how much I'd missed it.

970
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,552
We've missed you, too, dear.

971
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:08,889
We'll be working again, won't we,
Chief? We'll make our greatest picture!

972
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:12,684
- That's what I want to talk to you about.
- It's a good script, isn't it?

973
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,188
Well, it's...
It has some good things in it, yes, but,

974
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,774
it would be a very expensive picture.

975
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:22,569
Oh, I don't care about the money.
I just want to work again.

976
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,489
You don't know what it means
to know that you want me.

977
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:28,533
Nothing would please me more,
Norma, if...

978
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,577
- lf it were possible.
- And remember, darling,

979
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:34,456
I don't work before 10:00 in the morning,
and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.

980
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,458
We're ready for the shot, Mr. DeMille.

981
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:40,837
All right. Norma, why don't you just
sit here and watch?

982
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,633
You know,
pictures have changed quite a bit.

983
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,469
All right, let's go!

984
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,346
Hit 'em all!

985
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,808
Roll 'em!

986
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,394
Speed!

987
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,488
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis?

988
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,576
They used to be Madame's
dressing room. The whole row.

989
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,454
That didn't leave much
for Wallace Reid.

990
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:17,165
Oh, he had a great big bungalow
on wheels.

991
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,127
I had the upstairs.

992
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:23,171
You see where it says
"Readers' Department"?

993
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:27,426
I remember my walls were covered
with black patent leather.

994
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:38,729
I'll be with you in a minute.

995
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,493
Hey, here's that funny car
Gordon Cole was talking about.

996
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,829
- Yeah.
- Do you mind if we look it over?

997
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,914
What's so funny about it?

998
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,465
Just so you don't think
I'm a complete swine,

999
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,885
if there's anything in Dark Windows
you can use, take it. It's all yours.

1000
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:13,013
Well, for heaven's sakes!
Come on in, have a chair.

1001
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,891
I mean it. It's no good to me, anyway.
Help yourself.

1002
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,142
Now, why should you do that?

1003
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,895
If you get 100,000 for it,
you buy me a box of chocolate creams.

1004
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,688
If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.

1005
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:23,690
You know,
I'd take you up on that in a minute.

1006
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:26,068
I'm just not good enough
to do it all by myself.

1007
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:27,861
What about all those ideas you had?

1008
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,322
Well, see if they make sense.

1009
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,325
To begin with, I think you should throw
out all that psychological mess,

1010
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,204
- exploring a killer's sick mind.
- Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

1011
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,749
This is a story about teachers,
their threadbare lives, their struggle!

1012
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,002
Now, I see her teaching day classes
while he teaches night school.

1013
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,004
Now, the first time they meet...

1014
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:48,465
Look, if you don't mind,
I haven't time to listen to the whole plot.

1015
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,926
- I'll make it short.
- I'm sorry. It's your baby now.

1016
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,887
Couldn't we work in the evenings?
6:00 in the morning?

1017
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,599
This next month I'm completely
at your disposal. Artie's out of town.

1018
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,811
- What's Artie got to do with it?
- We're engaged.

1019
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,981
Oh. Oh, well, good for you.
You couldn't find a nicer guy.

1020
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:09,319
That's what I think. They're on location
in Arizona, making a Western.

1021
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,446
I'm free every evening
and every weekend.

1022
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:14,783
We could work at your place,
if you want.

1023
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,077
Look, Betty, it can't be done. It's out!

1024
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,287
Now, stop being chicken-hearted
and write that story!

1025
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:22,415
- Honest to goodness, I hate you!
- And don't make it too dreary.

1026
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,792
How about this for a situation?

1027
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,919
She teaches daytimes,
he teaches at night. Right?

1028
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,295
- Right.
- They don't even know each other,

1029
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,548
but they share the same room.
It's cheaper that way.

1030
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:33,969
As a matter of fact, they sleep
in the same bed. In shifts, of course.

1031
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,889
Are you kidding?
Because I think it's good.

1032
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,641
- So do I.
- Well, come on back.

1033
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:42,310
- Let me show you where it fits in.
- So long.

1034
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,229
Oh, you...

1035
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,404
- What's the matter, Max?
- I just found out the reason

1036
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,073
for all those telephone calls
from Paramount.

1037
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:59,494
It's not Madame they want.
It's her car they want to rent.

1038
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:00,954
What?

1039
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,502
Well, goodbye, Norma.
We'll see what we can do.

1040
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:11,214
I'm not worried. Everything will be fine.
The old team together again.

1041
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:14,843
- Nothing can stop us.
- The old team. Yeah.

1042
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,681
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mr. DeMille.

1043
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,358
- How'd it go?
- It couldn't have gone better.

1044
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,027
It's practically set.

1045
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:36,865
Of course, he has to finish this picture
first, but mine will be his next.

1046
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:41,912
Get Gordon Cole.
Tell him to forget about her car.

1047
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:44,915
Tell him he can get
another old car someplace.

1048
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,834
I'll buy him five old cars, if necessary.

1049
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,218
After that,

1050
01:15:56,302 --> 01:16:00,388
an army of beauty experts invaded
her house on Sunset Boulevard.

1051
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:04,476
She went through
a merciless series of treatments.

1052
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,563
Like an athlete training for the Olympic
Games, she counted every calorie.

1053
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:11,024
Went to bed every night at 9:00.

1054
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:14,277
She was absolutely determined
to be ready,

1055
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:17,656
ready for those cameras
that would never turn.

1056
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,945
- Joe, darling, are you there?
- Yes, Norma.

1057
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:00,156
Don't turn around!
Keep your eyes on the book.

1058
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,744
I just came to say good night.

1059
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,621
I don't want you to see me.

1060
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,666
- I'm not very attractive.
- Good night.

1061
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,751
You know, I've lost half a pound
since Tuesday.

1062
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,336
- Good!
- I was a little worried

1063
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,963
about the line of my throat.

1064
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,549
- This woman has done wonders with it.
- Good.

1065
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,221
- You'd better get to bed yourself.
- I think I'll read a little longer.

1066
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:28,018
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?

1067
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:30,645
- Why do you say that?
- I just happen to know it.

1068
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,314
I had a nightmare
and I screamed for you.

1069
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:35,317
You weren't here. Where were you?

1070
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,695
- I went for a walk.
- No, you didn't. You took the car.

1071
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,824
All right, I drove to the beach.

1072
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,493
Norma, you don't want me to feel
that I'm locked up in this house?

1073
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:49,664
Of course not, Joe.
It's just that I don't want to be left alone.

1074
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:54,127
Not while I'm under this terrible strain.
My nerves are being torn to shreds.

1075
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:58,590
All I ask is for you to be a little patient
and a little kind.

1076
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:04,012
- Norma, I haven't done anything.
- Of course you haven't.

1077
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:08,516
I wouldn't let you. Good night, darling.

1078
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:41,633
Yes, I was playing hooky
every evening alone in there.

1079
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,844
It made me think of when I was 12

1080
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:48,723
and used to sneak out on the folks
to see a gangster picture.

1081
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:53,770
This time, it wasn't to see a picture.
It was to try and write one.

1082
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,564
That story of mine
Betty Schaefer had dug up

1083
01:18:56,649 --> 01:19:00,318
kept going through my head
like a dozen locomotives.

1084
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,988
So, we started working on it,
the two of us,

1085
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:09,035
nights when the studio was deserted,
up in her little cubbyhole of an office.

1086
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,054
I got the funniest letter from Artie.

1087
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:31,099
It's rained every day since
they got to Arizona.

1088
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,894
They rewrote the whole picture for rain
and shot half of it.

1089
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:38,940
Now, the sun is out.
Nobody knows when they'll get back.

1090
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,608
- Good.
- What's good about it?

1091
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,111
I miss him something fierce.

1092
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:44,946
I mean this is good dialog
along in here.

1093
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,739
- It'll play.
- It will?

1094
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:50,785
Sure. Especially with lots of music
underneath, drowning it out.

1095
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:54,289
- Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
- Constantly.

1096
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:00,128
No, in all seriousness, this is really
good. It's fun writing with you.

1097
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,047
Oh, thanks.

1098
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,229
Who's Norma?

1099
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,566
Who's who?

1100
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,944
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't usually read
private cigarette cases.

1101
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,906
Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine,

1102
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:32,994
a middle-aged lady,
very foolish and very generous.

1103
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,330
I'll say. This is solid gold.

1104
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:37,916
I gave her some advice
on an idiotic script.

1105
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,084
Oh, the old, familiar story.

1106
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,754
You help a timid little soul
cross a crowded street.

1107
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:47,091
She turns out to be a multi-millionaire
and leaves you all her money.

1108
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,887
That's the trouble with you readers.
You know all the plots.

1109
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:54,224
Now, suppose you proofread
page 10 while the water boils.

1110
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,267
- Okay?
- Okay.

1111
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:23,044
Sometimes, when we got stuck,

1112
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,964
we'd make a little tour
of the drowsing lot,

1113
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,258
not talking much,

1114
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:31,970
just wandering down alleys
between the sound stages

1115
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:35,974
or through the sets they were getting
ready for the next day's shooting.

1116
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,101
As a matter of fact,

1117
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:41,896
it was on one of those walks
when she first told me about her nose.

1118
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:43,773
Look at this street.

1119
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:48,236
All cardboard, all hollow, all phony,
all done with mirrors.

1120
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:52,198
You know, I like it better
than any street in the world.

1121
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,077
Maybe because I used to play here
when I was a kid.

1122
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:59,330
What were you, a child actress?

1123
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:04,210
No, I was born just two blocks from this
studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.

1124
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:06,713
My father was head electrician here
till he died.

1125
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,799
- Mother still works in Wardrobe.
- Second generation, huh?

1126
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,594
Third. Grandma did stunt work
for Pearl White.

1127
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,304
I come from a picture family.

1128
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,140
Naturally, they expected me
to become a great star.

1129
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:21,436
So I had 10 years of dramatic lessons,
diction, dancing.

1130
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,398
Then the studio made a test.
Well, they didn't like my nose.

1131
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:29,277
It slanted this way a little.
So, I went to a doctor and had it fixed.

1132
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:32,030
They made more tests
and they were crazy about my nose,

1133
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,949
only they didn't like my acting.

1134
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,037
- Nice job.
- It should be.

1135
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,456
It cost me $300.

1136
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,292
- That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
- Oh, not at all.

1137
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,753
It taught me a little sense.
I got a job in the mailroom,

1138
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:49,047
worked up to the Stenographic.
Now I'm a reader.

1139
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,131
Come clean, Betty.

1140
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:53,384
At night you weep for those lost
close-ups, those gala openings.

1141
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:54,510
Not once.

1142
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:57,472
What's wrong with being on the
other side of the cameras?

1143
01:22:57,556 --> 01:23:01,351
- It's really more fun.
- Three cheers for Betty Schaefer!

1144
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,021
- I will now kiss that nose of yours.
- If you please.

1145
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:13,946
- May I say that you smell real special?
- It must be my new shampoo.

1146
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:20,912
That's no shampoo. It's more like
freshly laundered linen handkerchiefs.

1147
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:25,041
Like a brand-new automobile.

1148
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,794
- How old are you, anyway?
- Twenty-two.

1149
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:32,590
Smart girl.
Nothing like being twenty-two.

1150
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:37,136
And may I suggest that
if we're ever to finish this story,

1151
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:40,014
you stay at least two feet away from me.

1152
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:42,517
The first time you see me
coming any closer,

1153
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:46,521
I want you to take off a shoe
and clunk me on the head with it.

1154
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,359
Now back to the typewriters,
by way of Washington Square.

1155
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,241
What is it, Max?

1156
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,702
Want to wash the car,

1157
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:45,913
or are you doing a little spying
in your off hours?

1158
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:49,333
You must be very careful
as you cross the patio.

1159
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:50,918
Madame may be watching.

1160
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:53,254
How about going up the kitchen stairs
and undressing in the dark?

1161
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,256
Will that do it?

1162
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,426
I am not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes
every night.

1163
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,512
Why don't you? I'm writing a script.

1164
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,265
And I'm going to finish it,
no matter what.

1165
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:07,560
It is just that I am greatly worried
about Madame.

1166
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,354
Sure you are.

1167
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:14,984
And we're not helping her any,
feeding her lies and more lies.

1168
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,363
Getting herself ready for a picture.
What happens when she finds out?

1169
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:23,534
She never will. That is my job,

1170
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:26,954
and it has been for a long time.

1171
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:31,292
You must understand,
I discovered her when she was 16.

1172
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:36,506
I made her a star,
and I cannot let her be destroyed.

1173
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:42,553
- You made her a star.
- Yes, I directed all her early films.

1174
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:47,809
There were three young directors
who showed promise in those days.

1175
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:53,606
D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille
and Max von Mayerling.

1176
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:57,777
And she's turned you into a servant.

1177
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:02,240
It was I who asked to come back,
humiliating as it may seem.

1178
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:05,201
I could have continued my career,

1179
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:10,081
only I found everything unendurable
after she had left me.

1180
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,874
You see,

1181
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:15,419
I was her first husband.

1182
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,073
You're here, Joe!

1183
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,952
When did you come home?

1184
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:55,167
Oh, Joe, where were you?

1185
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:59,380
Is it a woman? I know it's a woman.
Who is she?

1186
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:03,801
Why can't I ask you? I must know!

1187
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,524
What's the matter?

1188
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:06,822
Betty, wake up!
Why are you staring at me like that?

1189
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,534
Oh, was I? I'm sorry.

1190
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,414
What's wrong with you tonight?
What is it?

1191
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,001
Oh, something came up.
I don't want to talk about it.

1192
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,461
Why not?

1193
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,387
I just don't.

1194
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:39,605
What've you heard?

1195
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:43,859
Come on, let's have it. Is it about me?

1196
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:02,420
Betty, there's no use running out on it.
Let's face it, whatever it is.

1197
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:09,093
- I got a telegram from Artie.
- From Artie? What's wrong?

1198
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,471
He wants me to come on to Arizona.

1199
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,684
He says it only costs $2
to get married there.

1200
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,563
It would kind of save us a honeymoon.

1201
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:24,650
Well, why don't you?
We can finish the script by Thursday.

1202
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:30,281
Stop crying, will you? You're getting
married. That's what you wanted.

1203
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,116
I don't want it now.

1204
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:38,205
- Why not? Don't you love Artie?
- Of course I love him. I always will.

1205
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:44,295
I'm not in love with him anymore,
that's all.

1206
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:49,925
- What happened?
- You did.

1207
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,984
It wasn't until I got back to that
peculiar prison of mine

1208
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:09,445
that I started facing the facts.

1209
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:16,285
There it was, Betty Schaefer's future
right in the palm of my hand.

1210
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:21,707
Betty Schaefer engaged to Artie Green,
as nice a guy as ever lived.

1211
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:26,295
And she was in love with me. Me!

1212
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:43,562
She was a fool not to sense that there
was something phony in my setup.

1213
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:46,732
And I was a heel not to have told her.

1214
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:51,195
But you just can't say those things
to somebody you're crazy about.

1215
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:55,616
Maybe I'd never have to.
Maybe I could get away with it,

1216
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,326
get away from Norma.

1217
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:01,205
Maybe I could wipe the whole
nasty mess right out of my life.

1218
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:13,801
Hello. Is this Gladstone 9281?

1219
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:18,055
May I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer?
She must be home by now.

1220
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:22,893
Hey, Betty! Here's that weird-sounding
woman again.

1221
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:26,397
Well, what is this, anyway?

1222
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,567
This is Betty Schaefer.

1223
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:33,779
You must forgive me for calling you
so late, but I really feel it's my duty.

1224
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:37,575
It's about Mr. Gillis.
You do know Mr. Gillis?

1225
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:42,246
Exactly how much
do you know about him?

1226
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,499
Do you know where he lives?

1227
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:49,587
Do you know how he lives?
Do you know what he lives on?

1228
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:54,925
Who are you? What do you want?
What business is it of yours, anyway?

1229
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:58,846
Miss Schaefer,
I'm trying to do you a favor.

1230
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:03,017
I'm trying to spare you
a great deal of misery.

1231
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:07,605
Of course you may be too young to even
suspect there are men of his sort.

1232
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:11,901
I don't know what he's told you,
but he does not live with relatives,

1233
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:15,738
nor with friends
in the usual sense of the word.

1234
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,742
Well, ask him. Ask him again.

1235
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:28,125
That's right, Betty, ask me again.
This is Joe.

1236
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:32,796
Joe? Where are you?
What is this all about?

1237
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:38,552
Or better yet, why don't you come out
and see for yourself?

1238
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:43,057
The address is
10,086 Sunset Boulevard.

1239
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:01,992
Don't hate me, Joe!
I did it because I need you.

1240
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:04,954
I need you
as I've never needed you before.

1241
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:07,831
Look at me! Look at my hands!

1242
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:11,168
Look at my face! Look under my eyes!

1243
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:14,546
How can I go back to work
if I'm wasting away under this torment?

1244
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:17,675
You don't know what I've been through
these last weeks!

1245
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:27,309
I bought myself a revolver, I did. I did!

1246
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:31,272
I stood in front of that mirror,
but I couldn't make myself do it.

1247
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:34,483
Don't just stand there hating me!
Shout at me!

1248
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:40,364
Strike me! But don't hate me.
Say you don't hate me, Joe!

1249
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:59,174
Here's 10,079, Connie.
It must be over there.

1250
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,729
Betty, let me come along with you.
Please!

1251
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,731
No, I'll be all right.

1252
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:24,783
I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe.

1253
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,078
I love you, Joe.

1254
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:34,918
What are you going to do, Joe?
What are you going to do?

1255
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:45,554
It's all right, Max. I'll take it.

1256
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,807
- Hello, Betty.
- I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.

1257
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:51,268
- Is it something awful?
- Come on in.

1258
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:01,236
Ever been in one of these
old Hollywood palazzos?

1259
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:05,115
That's from when they were making
18,000 a week and no taxes.

1260
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:09,536
Careful of these tiles, they're slippery.
Valentino used to dance here.

1261
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:12,081
- This is where you live?
- You bet.

1262
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,751
- Whose house is it?
- Hers.

1263
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:18,587
- Whose?
- Just look around.

1264
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:20,339
There's a lot of her spread about.

1265
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:23,217
If you don't remember the face,
you must have heard the name.

1266
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,927
Norma Desmond.

1267
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,638
That was Norma Desmond
on the phone?

1268
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,140
Would you like something to drink?
There's always champagne on ice,

1269
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:32,976
- plenty of caviar.
- Why did she call me?

1270
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,853
Jealous.

1271
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,731
Did you ever see so much junk?

1272
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:40,442
She had the ceiling
brought from Portugal.

1273
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:42,319
And look at this.

1274
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,949
Her own movie theater.

1275
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:51,120
I didn't come here to see a house!
What about Norma Desmond?

1276
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:57,000
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is an enormous place.

1277
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:02,047
Eight master bedrooms.
A sunken tub in every bathroom.

1278
01:36:02,549 --> 01:36:05,217
There's a bowling alley in the cellar.

1279
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,931
It's lonely here,
so she got herself a companion.

1280
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:16,270
A very simple setup.
An older woman who is well-to-do.

1281
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:21,984
A younger man
who's not doing too well.

1282
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:24,695
- Can you figure it out yourself?
- No.

1283
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:30,367
- All right. I'll give you a few more clues.
- No! I haven't heard any of this.

1284
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:35,497
I never got those telephone calls
and I've never been in this house!

1285
01:36:35,582 --> 01:36:38,876
Now, get your things together
and let's get out of here.

1286
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:44,381
All my things? All my 18 suits,
all my custom-made shoes

1287
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:46,258
and the six dozen shirts
and the cuff links

1288
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:49,720
and the platinum key chains
and the cigarette cases?

1289
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:51,930
Come on, Joe.

1290
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:57,102
Come on where? Back to a one-room
apartment I can't pay for?

1291
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:00,772
Back to a story that may sell
and very possibly will not?

1292
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,733
If you love me, Joe.

1293
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:07,237
Look, sweetie, be practical.
I've got a good deal here.

1294
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:11,074
A long-term contract with no options.
I like it that way.

1295
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:16,205
Maybe it's not very admirable.

1296
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:20,667
Well, you and Artie can be admirable.

1297
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:26,548
I can't look at you anymore, Joe.

1298
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:34,264
How about looking for the exit?
This way, Betty.

1299
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:54,910
Good luck to you, Betty. You can finish
that script on the way to Arizona.

1300
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:58,372
When you and Artie get back,

1301
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:01,667
if the two of you
ever feel like taking a swim,

1302
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:04,378
here's the pool.

1303
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:51,842
Thank you, darling. Thank you, Joe.

1304
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:55,178
Joe!

1305
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:24,041
May I come in, Joe? I've stopped crying.

1306
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:28,128
I'm all right again.
Joe, tell me you're not cross.

1307
01:39:28,338 --> 01:39:31,214
Tell me everything is just as it was, Joe.

1308
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:35,552
Joe!

1309
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,224
What are you doing, Joe?

1310
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,733
- What are you doing?
- I'm packing.

1311
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,864
- You're leaving me!
- Yes, I am, Norma.

1312
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:59,660
No, you're not! Max! Max!

1313
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,163
Thanks for letting me
wear the handsome wardrobe.

1314
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:06,291
And thanks for the use
of all the trinkets.

1315
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,337
The rest of the jewelry
is in the top drawer.

1316
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:13,340
- It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
- And I'd take it in a second,

1317
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:17,135
only it's a little too dressy for sitting
behind a copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.

1318
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,554
These are nothing!
You can have anything you want.

1319
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:23,642
What is it you want? Money?

1320
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:29,064
Norma, you'd be throwing it away.
I don't qualify for the job, not anymore.

1321
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:34,277
You can't go! Max! Max!
I can't face life without you.

1322
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:39,116
And you know I'm not afraid to die!

1323
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,951
That's between you and yourself.

1324
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,871
You think I made that up about the gun,
don't you? All right.

1325
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:56,758
See, you didn't believe me!

1326
01:40:56,843 --> 01:40:58,552
Now, I suppose
you don't think I have the courage!

1327
01:40:58,636 --> 01:41:00,387
Oh, sure,
if it would make a good scene.

1328
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:01,596
You don't care, do you?

1329
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:03,724
Well, hundreds of thousands
of people will care.

1330
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:06,435
Oh, wake up, Norma. You'd be killing
yourself to an empty house.

1331
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:08,228
The audience left 20 years ago.
Now, face it!

1332
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:11,398
- That's a lie! They still want me.
- No, they don't!

1333
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:13,650
What about the studio?
What about DeMille?

1334
01:41:13,735 --> 01:41:17,988
He was trying to spare your feelings.
The studio only wanted to rent your car.

1335
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:20,699
- Wanted what?
- DeMille didn't have the heart to tell you.

1336
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:22,576
None of us has had the heart.

1337
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:26,621
That's a lie! They want me.
I get letters every day.

1338
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:31,668
You tell her, Max.
Come on, do her that favor!

1339
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:33,503
Tell her
there isn't going to be any picture!

1340
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:36,381
There aren't any fan letters
except the ones you write!

1341
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:39,885
That isn't true! Max!

1342
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:42,721
Madame is the greatest star of them all.

1343
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:47,017
I will take Mr. Gillis' bags to the car.

1344
01:41:53,316 --> 01:41:56,693
You heard him. I'm a star!

1345
01:41:57,695 --> 01:42:00,572
Norma, you're a woman of 50.
Now, grow up!

1346
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:05,368
There's nothing tragic about being 50,
not unless you try to be 25.

1347
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,871
I'm the greatest star of them all.

1348
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:15,837
Goodbye, Norma.

1349
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:22,594
No one ever leaves a star.
That's what makes one a star.

1350
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:32,562
Joe! Joe!

1351
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:43,281
Joe!

1352
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:20,944
Stars are ageless, aren't they?

1353
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:33,540
Well, this is where you came in.
Back at that pool again,

1354
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,168
the one I always wanted.

1355
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:41,131
It's dawn now, and they must have
photographed me a thousand times.

1356
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:45,635
Then they got a couple of pruning hooks
from the garden and fished me out,

1357
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,304
ever so gently.

1358
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:51,600
Funny how gentle people get with you
once you're dead.

1359
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:56,563
They beached me
like a harpooned baby whale

1360
01:43:56,647 --> 01:44:00,650
and started to check the damage,
just for the record.

1361
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:05,530
By this time,
the whole joint was jumping.

1362
01:44:05,615 --> 01:44:08,366
Cops, reporters, neighbors, passersby,

1363
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:10,660
as much whoop-de-doo
as we get in Los Angeles

1364
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:12,579
when they open a supermarket.

1365
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:15,415
Even the newsreel guys came
roaring in.

1366
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:18,793
Here was an item
everybody could have some fun with.

1367
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:22,005
The heartless so-and-sos!

1368
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:25,592
What would they do to Norma?

1369
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:30,513
Even if she got away with it in court,
crime of passion, temporary insanity,

1370
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,142
those headlines would kill her.

1371
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:37,187
"Forgotten Star a Slayer."

1372
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:41,399
"Aging Actress,
Yesterday's Glamour Queen."

1373
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:56,665
Coroner's office?
I want to speak to the Coroner.

1374
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:00,168
- Who's on this phone?
- I am!

1375
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:03,004
Now get off! This is more important.

1376
01:45:03,089 --> 01:45:05,215
Times City Desk?
Hedda Hopper speaking.

1377
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:07,676
I'm talking from the bedroom
of Norma Desmond.

1378
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,638
Don't bother with a re-write, man.
Take it direct. Ready?

1379
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:13,640
"As day breaks over the murder house,

1380
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,101
"Norma Desmond,
famous star of yesteryear,

1381
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:19,145
"is in a state of complete mental shock.

1382
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:20,814
"A curtain of silence seems
to have fallen around her..."

1383
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:22,440
You don't deny having killed this man,
Miss Desmond?

1384
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:23,775
"...she sits in the silken boudoir
of her house..."

1385
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:25,068
Just answer me that!

1386
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,987
Was it a sudden quarrel?

1387
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:29,990
Had you ever had any trouble
between you before?

1388
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:33,243
If it was a quarrel,
how come this gun was right there?

1389
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:36,579
This guy, where did you meet him
for the first time?

1390
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:38,498
Where did he come from? Who is he?

1391
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:42,669
Did you hate him? Had you ever thought
of doing something like this before?

1392
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:45,839
Was theft involved? Did you catch him
trying to steal something?

1393
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:47,716
Or find he had stolen something?

1394
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,551
The newsreel men are here
with the cameras.

1395
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:53,638
Tell them to go fly a kite!
This is no time for cameras.

1396
01:45:53,723 --> 01:45:57,267
Now, Miss Desmond, is there anything
you want to tell us?

1397
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:00,186
Cameras?

1398
01:46:03,024 --> 01:46:04,691
What is it, Max?

1399
01:46:09,155 --> 01:46:11,906
- The cameras have arrived.
- They have?

1400
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,910
Tell Mr. DeMille
I'll be on the set at once.

1401
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:17,871
What is this?

1402
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:25,211
Well, it's one way to get her downstairs.

1403
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:31,301
Let's have the car right outside. Okay.

1404
01:46:33,054 --> 01:46:36,389
- Everything will be ready, Madame.
- Thank you, Max.

1405
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:41,227
You'll pardon me, gentlemen,
but I must get ready for my scene.

1406
01:46:43,147 --> 01:46:44,606
- What's happening up there?
- Any statement?

1407
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:47,525
- Why did she do it?
- Is there a confession?

1408
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:50,987
- Everything set up, gentlemen?
- Just about.

1409
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:53,323
- Lights ready?
- All set.

1410
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:06,836
Okay, fellas.

1411
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:13,635
Quiet, everybody!

1412
01:47:16,388 --> 01:47:17,639
Lights!

1413
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:24,562
Are you ready, Norma?

1414
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:30,360
What is the scene? Where am I?

1415
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:36,908
This is the staircase of the palace!

1416
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:41,204
Oh, yes, yes...

1417
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:44,999
Down below, they're waiting
for the princess.

1418
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:49,420
I'm ready.

1419
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:54,050
All right. Cameras! Action!

1420
01:47:57,513 --> 01:48:01,224
So they were turning after all,
those cameras.

1421
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:08,273
Life, which can be strangely merciful,
had taken pity on Norma Desmond.

1422
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:15,071
The dream she had clung to
so desperately had enfolded her.

1423
01:48:43,642 --> 01:48:46,769
I can't go on with the scene.
I'm too happy!

1424
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:52,150
Mr. DeMille, would you mind
if I say a few words? Thank you.

1425
01:48:53,152 --> 01:48:55,987
I just want to tell you all how happy
I am to be back in the studio,

1426
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:58,364
making a picture again!

1427
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:01,826
You don't know
how much I've missed all of you.

1428
01:49:01,911 --> 01:49:04,579
And I promise you,
I'll never desert you again!

1429
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:09,000
Because after Salome, we'll make
another picture and another picture!

1430
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:13,004
You see, this is my life!
It always will be!

1431
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:18,301
There's nothing else.
Just us and the cameras

1432
01:49:19,428 --> 01:49:24,098
and those wonderful people
out there in the dark.

1433
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:28,770
All right, Mr. DeMille,
I'm ready for my close-up.
