How you go about doin' that?

153
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,243
I got to do my normal, man.

154
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,307
I got to go out,
try to find me something to sell.

155
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,252
First I got to find out what I got here
from last night.

156
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:57,381
I got these off of 75th Street.

157

CDs. You know what I'm sayin'?

158
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,527
I can sell these
to my man on 82nd Street.

159
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:09,090
And these some good CDs.
Plus I got a couple of books.

We got to make a dollar.

That's a bad motherfucker too.

166

Four-wheel drive. That's right.

167
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:31,548
This is my motherfuckin'
station wagon. That's right.

168
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:35,425

170
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:41,432
You understand what I'm sayin'?
And the reason why I'm saying this,

171
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:45,198
because each one of them fuckin' carts
contain something.

172
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,535
And what's that something? Money.

mo' money, mo' money,

You know what I'm sayin'?

176

Free enterprises.

177

What peoples throw away,
other peoples can use.

178

And by them can use it,
I get paid for it because I find it.

But down here, man...
You be surprised
the stuff that I be findin'...

182
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:22,839
and I be sellin', getting top dollar for,

183
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:27,335

You know what I'm sayin'?

187
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:42,287
Now, I don't sell everything.
Stuff that I can use, I keep.

188
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:45,694
But stuff that I just...
I can't use, I sell.

[Interviewer]
What are you doing?

198
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:13,525
I'm putting this sign.
There's no... no crack.

199
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:19,726
Because they be knockin' on my house
sometimes, and they...

200
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,630
and they want to borrow a stem.

201
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:24,567
And I don't smoke crack no more.

202
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,434
It took... You know...

203
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:30,641
It... The crack fucked me up, man.

204
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,769
The crack got me down here.

205
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:35,246
Well, crack helped me
get down here.

206
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:38,512
And then... Now I stopped.

207
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,281
You know? And it took me
a fuckin' long time to realize...

208
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:43,754
that that shit wasn't, you know...

209
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,791
That wasn't it. That wasn't me.

210
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:51,992
So I don't want 'em in my house.
Because if I see it around me,
every time... every time...

211
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:56,429
and I let people smoke in my house...
then I'm gonna want to get the urge.

212
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,404
It's bad enough that sometimes...

213
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:03,238
I stopped crack already for a long time,
for more than three years now.

214
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:06,767
And sometimes I wake up
with the urge.

215
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,815
And I haven't done it
for more than three years,

216
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:13,580
and sometimes I still wake up
with the urge to smoke it, but I fight it.

217
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,683
And then I'm gonna have these people
knockin' on my house...

218
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:21,784
talkin' about if I got a stem
or they could go inside and smoke.

219
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:25,319
You know, that shit's gonna
fuck me all up again.

220
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,459
So I said, "Well, let me go ahead
and put a sign."

221
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,663
So that way, these assholes
could read it...

222
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:34,871
and don't knock.

223
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:40,335
I do like you do sometime.
Heat it up a little bit.

224
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,711
Because if you don't...
Ain't no use in wastin' it.

225
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,579
You know?

226
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,414
Just heat it up a little bit.

227
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,063
That's doin' it.

228
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,705
Okay, uh, this is one
of the things I, uh, keep...

229
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:21,048
to keep myself a little safer
than what, uh, supposed
to be down here.

230
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:25,649
But I usually set up this trap
with these pans and everything
over here.

231
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:32,521
Simply, uh, put a pan like that.

232
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:35,032
Put a little pencil underneath there...

233
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:39,333
so, uh, it'll roll if somebody does come by.

234
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,740
Put it like that, make sure it's on there.

235
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,879
Come over here and tie it
to the other side underneath.

236
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:58,412
So that way, you know,
if they even got a flashlight,

237
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,925
they can't really see
in the dark down here.

238
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,485
They can't really see.

239
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,963
And, uh, I tie it to over here.

240
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,933
Not very tight, but, uh,

241
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,833
whatever movement you give it
from up there...

242
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:23,638
So, like, when you walk by it, you know,
when you trip the wire...

243
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:29,484
You can see that at nighttime, you know,
but people that don't really know
what's goin' on, you know,

244
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:33,082
and they're just looking around,
looking to find something...

245
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,424
or steal something or whatever, you know...

246
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:39,124

that they put res...

and they put res,

The papers and the clothes
and everything went flying.

To keep 'em from comin' in here.

When? I don't know.

So, that's the problem.

00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:30,445
It could stop you
instead of you stopping it.

Yeah, but still in all...
But I don't like to be pressured.

Well, all right.

There's a difference to it.

No, no, but check this out.
It's still a drug. It's still a drug.

Okay, but...

776
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,606
I'm not saying that.
By-By-By you keep saying to me
stop smoking crack,

777
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,652
it only makes me want
to go out and smoke more.

Because, uh, I...

because of the long relationship
that we've had with our clients,

1037
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,554
was to immediately go to court.

1038
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:09,759
Previous to Amtrak's decision
to evict people out of the tunnel,

1039
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:14,428
we had just sued Amtrak on the grounds
they could not throw people
out of Penn Station,

1040
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,667
a travel area here in New York City.

1041
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:21,370
So when we found out that Amtrak
was gonna come in, we were...

1042
01:08:21,444 --> 01:08:22,968
Immediately we thought law suit,
because we knew...

1043
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:25,810
we had to stop them
from throwing people
out of the tunnel...

1044
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:30,376
who had called it their home
for 10, 15, 25 years.

1045
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:35,447
We met with Amtrak officials,
and they were very...
at first very abrupt.

1046
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:37,720
They wanted everybody out.
Had to be in a few days.

1047
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,126
They were gonna fence it off,
put in security guards.

1048
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:43,997
And we worked out a plan
that we would assist people...

1049
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:48,503
into moving into temporary shelter
if Amtrak would not evict people.

1050
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:52,564
Um, but soon thereafter
we learned of a program...

1051
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:54,735
run by the federal government...
a Section 8 program...

1052
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:58,512
<i>and we guaranteed Amtrak...</i>

1053
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:01,914
<i>that no one would be left
inside of the tunnels.</i>

1054
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:06,185
<i>The Section 8 program,
the housing program here in New York City,</i>

1055
01:09:06,456 --> 01:09:08,515
<i>is a great ticket into housing.</i>

1056
01:09:08,591 --> 01:09:10,957
<i>It guarantees someone an apartment,</i>

1057
01:09:11,027 --> 01:09:14,485
<i>helps pay the brokers
and the security fees.</i>

1058
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:18,625
<i>So it was a perfect chance,
and I think Amtrak knew that,</i>

1059
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:22,729
uh, it's a good opportunity
to work with advocates...

1060
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:24,637
rather than having a legal challenge.

1061
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:28,770
And, um, on our part, on civil liberties' part,
we were pretty confident.

1062
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:30,779
Had we had to go to court,
we would have won.

1063
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:33,475
It was a crystal-clear violation
of people's rights.

1064
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,178
But we didn't want to defend people
to live on the street.

1065
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:39,848
We wanted to get them into housing.
That was the ultimate goal.

1066
01:09:39,922 --> 01:09:43,517
And, uh, we're glad
we didn't have to go to court.

Oh, yeah. Got a job.

1092
01:11:17,753 --> 01:11:20,984
Comin' up. 8.50 an hour.
Working at King's Steak
in the Bronx.

1093
01:11:21,023 --> 01:11:23,150
That's all right 'cause I'm gonna
blow you out of the water...

1094
01:11:23,225 --> 01:11:25,284
once I get this mountain bike
and start working this messenger's job.

1095
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,029
As a cook.
Start makin', like,
seven or eight bills a week.

1096
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:29,895
What you gonna do then, huh?

1097
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:32,696
Hey, enough to pay the rent.
Enough to help out with food.

1098
01:11:32,768 --> 01:11:34,668
I don't care.
No doubt.

1099
01:11:34,737 --> 01:11:36,637
Anything helps.
Once we start these jobs,

1100
01:11:36,706 --> 01:11:39,004
ain't gonna be no more fried chicken
and shit like that.

1101
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:42,772
Gonna be straight-up steaks, filet mignon
and all kinds of good shit every night.

1102
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:45,177
I'll bring steak home
every night of the week.

No doubt.

1104

We gonna gain about...
We gonna gain about
400 pounds apiece, right?

1105
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:50,785
Mm-hmm.

1106

You gonna miss it?

1109

Sometimes.
Definitely gonna miss it.

1110
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,861
Not bad enough to come back though.

1111
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:13,941
Just gonna miss
the freedom down here.

1112
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:17,810
The thought of "This is mines,
and I can do whatever
I want to with it."

it didn't bother me at all.

01:17:25,988 --> 01:17:28,115
I will never go homeless again.

1185
01:17:29,124 --> 01:17:32,355
That was like a nightmare.

1186
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:35,192
You know?
And I woked up out of it,

1187
01:17:35,264 --> 01:17:38,199
and I'm staying awake.
[Chuckles]

1188
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:41,202
I'm serious. I don't want that shit.
I don't need it.

1189
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:46,970
Mm-mmm. I'd rather stay working
and, you know, doing good.

1190
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:49,508
I don't wanna be homeless no more.

1191
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:51,410
Whoopee!

1192
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:57,385
It feel real good.

1193
01:17:58,654 --> 01:18:00,246
