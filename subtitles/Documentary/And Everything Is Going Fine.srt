1
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,692
Thanks.

2
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:02,400
Thank you.

3
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:30,120
I can remember riding around on the back of
my mother's bicycle in her little seat...

4
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:32,456
the basket seat on the back...

5
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,793
because we were celebrating
the end of World War II...

6
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,400
because we, the Americans...

7
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,471
had dropped the bombs
on the Japs in Hiroshima...

8
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:47,076
and we were celebrating because
my mother's brothers, Tinky and John...

9
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,078
were coming home from the war.

10
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:55,116
Maybe I should just tell you
some of the facts as I remember them.

11
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,719
I grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island...

12
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,154
in a clapboard house.

13
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,226
At the time I was a child...

14
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:08,592
I guess I was told
that it was 75 years old.

15
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,598
It had a well -
a bucket well...

16
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:14,362
and an artesian well -
two wells.

17
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:16,368
A well you could drop
a bucket down into...

18
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,099
and hoist it up and drink
fresh water in the summer.

19
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:22,438
It had a barn,
which we kept garden tools in...

20
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:24,443
and cars as well - two cars.

21
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:27,980
And an attic upstairs
and a cellar in the barn.

22
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,142
A lovely garden
that my grandfather and father...

23
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,617
grew everything in...

24
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:36,349
including peanuts, Swiss chard.

25
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:41,924
My Grandmother Gray,
my father's mother, lived with us.

26
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:45,089
I was the middle of three boys...

27
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,633
so my parents had three sons.

28
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:49,998
And so I got a little kitten, Mittens.

29
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:53,937
I called it Mittens 'cause it had
those little white, you know, paws.

30
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,770
And so this Mittens...

31
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,879
I hadrt had it very long
before it was killed by Mrs. Adams...

32
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,413
driving a large
black Chrysler at dusk...

33
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,643
On Rumstick Road.

34
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,913
Mrs. Adams was a very big woman.
She had two daughters...

35
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,181
that my brothers and I called
"piggy big sisters. "

36
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,203
They were very big, and
they looked like pigs.

37
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,794
That's the most I can
remember of them.

38
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,522
And Mrs. Adams was mortified.
She realized what she'd done.

39
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,632
She stopped the car
and she chased me, and I ran.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,668
I couldn't face her.
I couldn't breathe. I was so -

41
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,432
I couldn't catch my breath,
and I ran to my room, and she chased me.

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,700
I think she made it
as far as the front door...

43
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,505
and my mother, I suppose, stopped her and
talked with her, but she never got to me.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,649
I went and locked myself in my room.
I was catatonic. Couldrt catch my breath.

45
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,410
Something like my brother actually couldn't
- He'd go through that too -

46
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,416
extreme anxieties - my older brother.

47
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:44,078
We were sleeping in the same bedroom, and
I'd wake up in the middle of the night...

48
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,282
and he'd be holding his throat,
blue in the face...

49
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,155
telling my mother and father he was dying
because he couldn't breathe, you see?

50
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,593
And they'd be sitting at the edge
of the bed, trying to calm him down.

51
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:55,665
He was standing on the bed.
Finally, they would calm him down...

52
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,234
and my father would go to bed,
and my mother would stay with him...

53
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:01,531
and she'd turn out the lights
and sit on the edge of his bed...

54
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:04,175
and we would look up at the ceiling,
which the only light...

55
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,469
was these fluorescent decals
of the stars -

56
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:09,579
the Big Dipper, a new moon, Saturn.

57
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:14,213
And my brother would start in.
He'd say...

58
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:18,344
"Mom, when I die, is it forever?"

59
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:23,421
She'd go, "Yes, dear. "

60
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:26,461
He'd go, "Mom, when I die...

61
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:28,360
is it forever and ever?"

62
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,093
She'd go, "Mm-hmm, dear. "

63
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:35,136
Then he'd go, "Mom...

64
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:39,071
when I die,
is it forever and ever...

65
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:41,301
and ever and ever?"

66
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:44,174
She'd go, "Mm. "

67
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:46,781
And I'd just fall asleep to this.

68
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,781
It would put me right out,
and he would always get upset with me...

69
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:57,517
for being the calm one, you see?

70
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:59,923
Well, there were two extreme
nervous breakdowns...

71
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:04,361
and probably a lot of nervous
"in between" that she had...

72
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:08,629
and the first one was
when I was I think ten years old.

73
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:10,738
And it was in the summer...

74
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:15,036
and, uh, it was -

75
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:19,841
She was just very nervous
and pulling at her hair...

76
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:22,505
and unable to concentrate
and talking to herself.

77
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:29,121
Then I think at that time, she was sent
away to a Christian Science nursing home.

78
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,386
I tell you, the most difficult thing
about it for me was that...

79
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:35,461
the denial that was going on
around the house.

80
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,463
My Grandmother Gray lived with us
at the time - my father's mother -

81
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:41,067
and no one was ever coming...

82
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:44,897
to me or my brothers...

83
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:48,098
and saying... talking about it.

84
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:51,108
So that I'd be in the playroom
with my friends in the summer...

85
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:53,371
and all of a sudden I'd hear Mom...

86
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:57,847
shrieking in the - in the kitchen...

87
00:05:58,018 --> 00:05:59,781
crying out to Jesus and going...

88
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:02,080
"Oh, Rock! Oh, no! Oh!"
You know...

89
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:04,485
just in distress,
like she's being attacked.

90
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:08,457
I can remember pausing,
and my friends would be afraid.

91
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:12,120
We'd all be afraid and be looking
at each other, and no one would say...

92
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:14,198
"Was that your mother?"
Or "What was that?"

93
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,631
It was like a ghost.

94
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:19,430
I think that some people
are born people...

95
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:22,165
and they grow up as people and then
they decide to become professionals...

96
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,002
'cause they have
to make a living, right?

97
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,610
And they become a dentist, doctor
or lawyer, whatever it is they study for...

98
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,646
and then they go through life as that,
and then they die, and that's that.

99
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:34,774
You know, even some people study acting.
They become actors through studying acting.

100
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:36,750
Other people are born actors.

101
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,549
It's an ontological condition.
There's no way out.

102
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:43,751
They are simply acting out all the time,
you know? And I think I was in that state.

103
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:46,192
For instance, I was 12 years old...

104
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,891
and some fireworks would go off, just a
whole package of lady fingers outside.

105
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:52,593
And I'd take the cue and
rush to the window...

106
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:55,102
and go, "Mom! Mom, come quick!

107
00:06:55,272 --> 00:06:59,208
Russ Russell, our neighbor,
is up on his roof shooting his children!"

108
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:05,241
And that was before that happened
so often, you know?

109
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,112
In the old days.
It wasrt a common occurrence.

110
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,879
And my mother would buy right into it.
She'd rush over going, "What?

111
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,456
Oh! Oh! Oh -
No, no.

112
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,525
Oh, Spuddy dear, no. "

113
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:19,594
She would be...

114
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:23,528
well, very, very forthcoming,
and helping me with my spelling words...

115
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,634
and taking me on my paper route...

116
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:28,430
and telling me intimate stories...

117
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:33,064
about her relationship to my father
that I probably shouldn't have heard.

118
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:36,643
And then all of a sudden one day
when I was 14...

119
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:41,512
and had failed seventh grade
and tried to knock myself out.

120
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:45,946
We used to take 20 deep breaths
after a hot bath...

121
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,316
and blow on your thumb.

122
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,118
What was I doing?
I don't know. Some crazy thing.

123
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,261
And I got knocked out,
and when I came to, my arm...

124
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:55,794
this arm, was against the radiator...

125
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:59,832
and I had a third-degree burn -
it looked like rare roast beef -

126
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,196
and it was a miracle
I was still alive...

127
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,430
that I didn't break a blood vessel
in my head or just, you know.

128
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:08,234
And my parents were downstairs
watching television -

129
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,741
Gunsmoke, I remember -
in the playroom.

130
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:15,041
And I walked down, shaking all over
with this incredible burn...

131
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:17,047
and my mother
looked at it and went...

132
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:20,244
"Oh, put some soap on it, dear,
and know the truth" -

133
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,651
the truth being that there is no...

134
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:25,553
pain or suffering in God's world,
there's no imperfection.

135
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:29,628
That is enormous distance, you see?

136
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:32,560
That's what I mean
by "alternating current. "

137
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,633
Any mother,
I don't care what religion she's in...

138
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:39,898
would, I would think -
Intuition would be to fly to that child.

139
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:45,272
But for her, it would represent
acknowledging the condition.

140
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:49,643
She really believed in the power of mind.
Our pipes used to freeze in a bathroom...

141
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:53,047
from the wind off Narragansett Bay,
which is very ice-cold in February...

142
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:57,018
and she was sure that the wind
was caused by the disturbed thinking...

143
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,157
of the Red Chinese
in Communist China.

144
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:01,155
You see?

145
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:04,853
And she told me that Mary Baker Eddy
said there was a man who was so afraid...

146
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,227
when he was on the operating table,
he was sweating, he thought it was blood...

147
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,231
and he died of fear, you see?

148
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:13,838
So we were always afraid of being afraid.
It was never-ending.

149
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,773
My father, he said,
"Why don't we go play golf together?"

150
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:22,742
Now, we had never played golf together.

151
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,905
We never even joined the country club.

152
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,243
My uncle said there were two kinds of
people in Barrington, Rhode Island -

153
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:30,444
those who belong and those who don't -
to the Rhode Island Country Club.

154
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,111
We didn't belong.

155
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,622
Later, my Grandmother Gray
told me that my father's father...

156
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,317
told him the facts of life
on a golf course...

157
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,827
so this is where my father
got the idea from.

158
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,932
So we went out -
We had to go to a public course...

159
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,468
in Seekonk, Massachusetts,
called Wampanoag.

160
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,367
Now, mainly when it rained,
it was underwater...

161
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,474
so we called it Swampanoag.

162
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,769
So we get out there.
I think we were on the fourth hole...

163
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:57,812
and my father went...

164
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,972
"You know" -
This just came out of nowhere.

165
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,779
He said, "There's a gal in our plant. "

166
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,474
He worked in a factory.
He called it a

167
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:07,253
plant. It was a very
conservative factory...

168
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:11,359
where they made screw machines,
machines that made screws...

169
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,827
and they didn't even allow Coca-Cola
in this plant until a few years ago.

170
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,796
And he said,
"There's a gal in our plant...

171
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,960
who has a turkey in the oven...

172
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:24,469
and she won't admit to it. "

173
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:34,146
"It's, uh - It's as plain
as the nose on her face.

174
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:37,842
She won't admit to it because she doesn't
have a man. She's not married...

175
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,886
and she keeps coming to work
because she has no one to support her.

176
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,956
People are saying,
'Why don't you go have the turkey...

177
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,753
and come back when you're through? '
But she -"

178
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,192
"Now, you wouldn't want
to get a gal...

179
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:51,832
in a situation like that, would you?"

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,969
And I said,
"Well, I guess not. No. No. "

181
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:57,798
And then there was a pause.
We were kind of going with our clubs...

182
00:10:57,972 --> 00:11:01,270
and walking and putting,
and he said...

183
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:05,070
"Um, you know, there are diseases
that can make you blind. "

184
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:10,279
Now, I didn't know what he was
talking about then. I didn't know.

185
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,509
I was a little paranoid then,
and I thought...

186
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,120
"Oh, Jeannie Lamb's mother
has found out.

187
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:18,053
She's told Dad to take me
out on the golf course and say...

188
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:22,025
'Tell your son that if he fucks
my daughter, he'll go blind. "

189
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:24,662
- We played golf out on the -
- We did. That's right.

190
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,594
Wampanoag Trail, the public course.

191
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:31,464
And in fact, that's where you first
attempted to tell me the facts of life.

192
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:33,696
- Was it?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:36,535
- We were out to the fourth hole.
- On the fourth hole?

194
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,769
And you told me about a woman
that got pregnant at Brown & Sharpe -

195
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:42,244
- On the fourth hole?
- Yeah.

196
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:46,181
I don't think you said she had a turkey in
the oven, but you might have. I don't know.

197
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:48,546
Would that be something you'd say?
Or did I make that up?

198
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,881
Sometimes I don't know
when I'm fictionalizing or not.

199
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:54,184
I sometimes don't know
whether you are either, but -

200
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:57,328
My Uncle Tinky
introduced me to wine.

201
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,830
His name was Ted.
We called him Tinky. I don't know why.

202
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:04,935
But he brought wine - two bottles
of Great Western sparkling Burgundy...

203
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:08,664
every Thanksgiving and Christmas -
to my grandmother's house.

204
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,002
Now, I sat next to my Grandmother Gray,
and she didn't like sparkling Burgundy...

205
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:16,135
so I got two glasses, which means
I was twice-over happy twice a year.

206
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:18,281
I was happy
on Thanksgiving and Christmas.

207
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:21,509
The rest of the year was mainly waiting
for the sparkling Burgundy.

208
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,615
And I told my friend Duke Watts, I said,
"This wine is good.

209
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,520
Wine is a good thing.
We must find it. "

210
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:34,896
"To have it more days of the year. "

211
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,123
The way we would do it,
we discovered a plan -

212
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,234
he had his drivers' license,
I didn't have mine yet -

213
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,870
was to drive down toward Newport,
the naval base...

214
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:45,064
but not go over the Mount Hope Bridge,
because we didn't want to pay the dollar.

215
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,982
It was owned by Haffenreffer,
and he was charging

216
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,642
a dollar to go over and
a dollar to come back.

217
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:55,609
So we would go, and they would say,
"All right, what do you want?"

218
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:58,515
And we always wanted to say to them,
"We would like two bottles...

219
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:01,383
of Great Western sparkling Burgundy. "

220
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:03,387
But we were afraid to.
I don't know why.

221
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,958
We were afraid that the sailors
would think we were -

222
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:13,031
So they'd say, "What do you want?"
You know?

223
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:15,829
And we'd say, "We want wine. "
"Well, what kind?"

224
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,869
"Red wine," we'd say,
'cause we didn't know the kinds.

225
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,441
And they'd always come out
with a quart bottle of Petri port.

226
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,374
Which we started to like.
It was sweeter.

227
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,571
It was 20 percent alcohol,
although it didn't have the little bubbles.

228
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,774
And so we were having -

229
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,647
We liked drinking in the afternoons,
when our energy was at the highest.

230
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:38,554
We called these afternoon
drinking sessions "luncheons. "

231
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:42,093
That was our code word so my parents
wouldn't know what was going on.

232
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:45,164
And a typical luncheon
would be a bottle of Petri port...

233
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:48,699
and we would listen to Sidney Bechet
full blast on Duke Watts's record player...

234
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,803
and then jump out his second-story
window after we got drunk, land...

235
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:55,498
come around, come back upstairs, drink
some more, jump out the window, land...

236
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:58,075
while the music was playing,
just letting off steam.

237
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,976
And I thought I would try out
for the junior play.

238
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:10,714
And not only was I dyslexic, but I was
so nervous I couldn't hold a book.

239
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,222
I was...

240
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:17,021
So I didn't get the role.

241
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,892
So my senior year, they did
The Curious Savage as the class play...

242
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:23,228
and I said, "By God,
I'm gonna try out the way I read...

243
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:25,597
and I'm gonna hold the book down
so it won't move"...

244
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,762
and I just read it
the only way I could read it.

245
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,670
"Cheese, eggs, milk, meat. Ha, ha.

246
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:34,210
I drink about four pints
of milk a day -

247
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,244
Channel Island milk- ha, ha -

248
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:39,383
and eat about a pound of steak. "

249
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,041
And I got the role...

250
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,552
Because it took place
in an insane asylum.

251
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,552
They thought
I was perfect for the role...

252
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,061
of the man
who thinks he's Hannibal.

253
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,563
He's deluded. He has delusions of grandeur,
and he thinks not only is he Hannibal...

254
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,084
that he can play the violin
- And at the end

255
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,429
of the play, everyone's
fantasy comes true.

256
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:03,198
They put on violin music, and I'm -
sawing away.

257
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:07,207
Now, opening night - and of course we only
played two nights at Fryeburg Academy -

258
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,614
It wasrt at rehearsal. And I remember
I had to do a downstage left cross...

259
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:18,117
and I improvised a hopscotch,
in character, on the squares.

260
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:21,189
And the entire audience laughed.

261
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,760
Like that.
Only everyone, complete.

262
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:28,793
And I was hooked.
I was hooked.

263
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:32,422
It went through me like a "thoop!"
Like a "whoo!" Like a you-know-what.

264
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,229
And I didn't want to do anything else.

265
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:39,534
There was nothing else I wanted to do
before that, so this was a novelty.

266
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:43,667
I remember that a very important thing
happened in that Curious Savage.

267
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:46,610
The stage manager kept trying
to give me my lines...

268
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:50,377
because my timing -
they didn't appreciate my timing.

269
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:53,988
And Ruth Hartz - I remember
Mrs. Hartz, the director, said...

270
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:57,022
"Don't ever give Spud a cue.

271
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:59,319
Don't ever give him his line
unless he asks for it...

272
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:01,894
because he has excellent timing. "

273
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,623
And that's the first time
anyone had said...

274
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,029
the word "excellent"
in relationship to anything I did.

275
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:11,195
And to say it around timing -
well, that's everything, isn't it?

276
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,759
I was a virgin when I entered college.

277
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,595
And I was at a party...

278
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,290
and my friend Randy
came up to me and said...

279
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,299
"You see that girl?

280
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,495
Her name's Pam,
and she goes down. "

281
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,108
"And I'm going to go down with her
before the night's over. "

282
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,907
And I thought I'd try to beat him out,
and I went up and said...

283
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,816
"Hi, Pam. My name's Spud,
and I hear you go down. "

284
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,928
And we spent the night together.

285
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:16,825
I began by licking her breasts.

286
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,095
She said, "What do you think I am,
your mother?"

287
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,777
Um...

288
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,040
then we had intercourse.

289
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:45,020
And I came in about 30 seconds...

290
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:49,097
and I ended up lying there for the rest
of the night, staring at the ceiling.

291
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:51,427
And I have to tell you
I was a little anxious...

292
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,899
because my bed
was right by the window.

293
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,935
I kept rearranging the
bed, but the room was

294
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,699
so small that no matter
where I put it...

295
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:00,707
it was basically by the window.

296
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:05,712
Why was it upsetting for me? Because
I was reading Freud for the first time...

297
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,942
and I read that Freud
had discovered an unconscious.

298
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:12,383
I don't remember how, but he had.

299
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:17,117
And this was a shock for me, because
up until then, I thought I was here.

300
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:25,221
I didn't know there was a whole part
of me missing. I didn't know...

301
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,925
there was this "un"...

302
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:31,163
which, if you don't know how big it is,
could go on forever. It could be huge.

303
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,448
And I thought it was
housing all the

304
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:36,039
self-destructive shadow
aspects of myself...

305
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:38,145
and that if I went to sleep
by that window...

306
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:40,247
the "un" would take over
my body in the night...

307
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,348
and jump out the window with it.

308
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:44,814
And halfway down,
the conscious self, waking up...

309
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:47,453
would be desperately
grasping at the bricks.

310
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:49,984
Now, this upset me so
much that I transferred

311
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,751
to Emerson College
down the road.

312
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:56,624
But you know what I was
curious about was that...

313
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,919
what you thought about
when I first starting

314
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:00,733
going into acting
at Emerson College.

315
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,699
- I thought you were absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,464
How anybody could make
a living in the theater...

317
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:10,666
particularly one that was a shy,
backwards sort of young fellow -

318
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,812
I just knew you couldn't do it.

319
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:16,278
Long Day's Journey Into Night.
This was a role I really got into.

320
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,508
I was playing Edmund,
the O'Neill role.

321
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:20,710
I was drinking whiskey, Irish whiskey.

322
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:23,219
I was suffering.
I was reading the O'Neill biography.

323
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,084
I was living in a big
Victorian house. It was

324
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,951
Theatre by the Sea, in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

325
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,459
Tugboats out there.
Perfect sound effects.

326
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,994
Me drinking the whiskey
and refusing to turn up the heat...

327
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:34,632
in this very cold Victorian house
with a widow's walk...

328
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,827
and the owner of the house who's renting me
this room is saying, "Please, please.

329
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:41,472
I'll lower the rent
if you turn up the heat. "

330
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,234
And I wouldn't do it. And the pipes
were bursting, and he was down there.

331
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,607
He had such a beautiful disposition.
It was unbelievable what I put him through.

332
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,476
There was ice on the toilet in the morning.
I had to pee on top of ice.

333
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:54,380
There was a sheet of ice there. And we
were playing this thing four hours long...

334
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:58,682
to seven people in subzero weather
at this warehouse on a Sunday night.

335
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:01,689
Seven people in the audience.
And my brother had been in Chile.

336
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,158
Rocky had been in Chile for three years,
and he came back to see me.

337
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,290
He hadrt seen me in three
years, and in order

338
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:09,060
to deal with my new
theatrical career...

339
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:12,828
he sat in the front row and took notes
throughout the whole production.

340
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,996
He was very intellectual.

341
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:21,008
And the woman who was playing the mother
was swearing in the dressing room -

342
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,113
"Who the fuck is that asshole
in the front row taking notes?

343
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,181
We've already been reviewed!"

344
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,510
She was throwing ashtrays
around the dressing room.

345
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,812
I said, "It's my brother, Rocky. "

346
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:33,820
And when Rocky and I got home...

347
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,390
the first thing he did
was give me his notes.

348
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:41,622
After I left Rhode Island, you see,
I wanted to go across country...

349
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,628
and I didn't have
enough money to do it.

350
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,098
I had this fantasy idea
that I thought every great actor...

351
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:51,171
should both play Hamlet in his lifetime
and also fuck on stage.

352
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,171
You know, should run the gamut...

353
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:56,573
or else try to incorporate both in Hamlet.

354
00:20:56,745 --> 00:21:00,237
But Hamlet wasrt playing this summer, or I
didn't know about any auditions for it...

355
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:04,580
so I ended up - To try to make money, I
ended up applying for a pornographic movie.

356
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:07,654
And I got the role.
I was really surprised.

357
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:10,290
She would work on us. She would
work on me, say, with her mouth...

358
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,722
and him with the hand,
and then vice versa.

359
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:15,863
And then as soon as I was up...

360
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,260
I'd start down as he went up...

361
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:21,425
And we would never get it together.

362
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:23,867
So finally he said,
"Clear the room. "

363
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:27,007
So the director would go out of the room,
and we'd work together...

364
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,643
and we'd both get up,
and he'd say...

365
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:31,836
"All right. Quick.
Bring the cameras back. "

366
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:36,005
And by the time the camera's set up,
we'd be down again.

367
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:39,516
So it was a lot of work.

368
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:43,281
We finally finished the shot.
It took about all afternoon.

369
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,858
The director was very upset
and running around me, saying...

370
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:49,359
"Make more noise, Gray.
Make more faces. "

371
00:21:57,803 --> 00:21:59,498
The Knack.

372
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:03,005
Not a very good play by Ann Jellicoe.

373
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:05,302
I happen to have a copy of it here.

374
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:08,311
I was in this play
at Theatre by the Sea...

375
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:11,245
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

376
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:15,820
I thought I should have played
the role of Tolen...

377
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:19,446
but I got cast as Colin,
who was the stud.

378
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,991
My father brought my mother
to see this play...

379
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:26,130
while she was having
an incurable nervous breakdown.

380
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,461
She thought she was coming to see
Long Day's Journey Into Night.

381
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:38,633
Now, that wasrt because she was
having a nervous breakdown.

382
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,904
That came after this play.
It wasrt completely an illusion...

383
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,412
but my father brought her to this
because he thought...

384
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,743
Long Day's Journey
would upset her too much...

385
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:50,444
and I'm afraid that
this one was worse.

386
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,454
I'm right up to this section...

387
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,287
where the character, Brewster,
is trying to get away from his mother.

388
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,988
It's the summer of 1966. She's having
a very severe nervous breakdown.

389
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:04,430
He's trying to help her through it.
At the same time, he's very aware...

390
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:06,433
that he must flee the nest.

391
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:09,300
He must run away and begin
his own life, or he won't have one.

392
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,736
And he desperately
wants to become an actor...

393
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:15,844
and he wants to get his actor's equity card
at the Alley Theatre that season.

394
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,981
They have a very good reputation.
Also, what is very important for him...

395
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,878
is that they're doing
Chekhov's play The Sea Gull...

396
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:24,144
and he is sure
that he is perfect for the role...

397
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,619
of Konstantin Gavrilovich Treplev,
the young writer...

398
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,248
positive he'll be cast in it
because he's sensitive like Konstantin...

399
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:34,793
his relationship to his mother
is not unlike Konstantirs to his mother...

400
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:37,591
and the other thing is that Konstantin
gets to shoot himself in the head...

401
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:41,759
at the end of every play and come back
the following night to play himself again.

402
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:43,768
Brewster likes this.

403
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,430
And I'm there with my mother
in Rhode Island...

404
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,200
and she is going mad.

405
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:50,183
She's having a nervous breakdown.
She's tearing

406
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,710
her hair out from the
back of her head.

407
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,281
And I'm trying to calm her down
by reading to her from Alan Watts's book...

408
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,146
Psychotherapy East & West.

409
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,345
Laboring under that romantic idea
of R.D. Laing's...

410
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:05,686
how every person who has
a nervous breakdown is so lucky...

411
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,660
'cause they get to come out the other
side of it with such great wisdom...

412
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,128
provided they come out
the other side.

413
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,563
And I was trying to help my mother
through to the other side...

414
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:16,600
but she wasrt listening to Alan Watts.

415
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:19,501
She was reading from Science and Health
by Mary Baker Eddy...

416
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,574
and from The Christian Science Monitor.

417
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:24,403
And I remember that vividly,
that warm July day -

418
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:26,772
she in her pajamas,
curled up on the couch...

419
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:31,679
with The Christian Science Monitor
between us like a Japanese paper wall.

420
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:34,376
And I am so annoyed finally
that I can't get through to her...

421
00:24:34,554 --> 00:24:36,886
that I reach down
and just flick the paper.

422
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:42,586
And she pulls the paper down
and looks me right in the eyes and says...

423
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:45,060
"How shall I do it, dear?

424
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:47,425
How shall I do it?

425
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,500
Shall I do it in the garage
with the car?"

426
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:54,501
The day I found out was that -

427
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:56,800
My father didn't tell me
over the phone.

428
00:24:56,975 --> 00:25:00,376
I'd called him from -
let's see, from Houston...

429
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,446
'cause I'd taken a train
up to Houston...

430
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,741
and was gonna fly in
from Houston to Providence.

431
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,943
And he picked me up.
It was a very hot August day.

432
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,554
And I remember I had a bottle
of tequila in a brown bag.

433
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:13,384
I'd been carrying it on the plane.

434
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:16,755
And I was sipping it
outside the Providence airport.

435
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:21,365
And he picked me up in his Ford LTD
with the air conditioner on.

436
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:23,363
I remember it was very hot.
The windows were up.

437
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:25,832
And he said,
"Tying one on, are you?"

438
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:28,563
I had the bag of tequila...

439
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,800
and we rode in silence for a bit,
and I said...

440
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:34,001
"So how's Mom?"
'Cause I knew she'd been having...

441
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:36,168
this nervous breakdown
for two years...

442
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:38,280
in and out of shock treatments.

443
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:40,541
And he just started to -

444
00:25:40,717 --> 00:25:43,845
He broke down while he was driving.
He started to cry.

445
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,818
Like, whimper.
It wasrt really full-blown.

446
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,254
He said, "She's gone. "

447
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:53,328
And I remember,
looking back on it...

448
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:55,328
turning to stone like a statue.

449
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:58,798
And I just heard "gone. " "Gone. "
I was trying to make sense of "gone. "

450
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,698
And I remember "gone,"
like "died of a broken heart. "

451
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:04,066
I heard that Grimm's fairy tale line.

452
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,732
And then I had an image - and all of this
may be fictionalized since then.

453
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,606
But this is what I remember.
I had an image of a dandelion...

454
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,113
when it's turned to fluff
at the end of the -

455
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,719
Gone. Just gone.

456
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,979
Not "dead," not "killed herself. "

457
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:24,217
Again, that was avoidance language
that was going on in Rhode Island.

458
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:27,520
And when my mother's obituary
appeared, it was "deceased"...

459
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:31,028
and the rumors were she died of cancer.
There was no mention of suicide.

460
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:34,191
So when I began to talk about it,
and the Providence Journal did...

461
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:37,236
a profile about me
doing my first piece...

462
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:39,305
Rumstick Road,
with the Wooster Group...

463
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,841
in which we did an exploration
of my mother's suicide in 1967...

464
00:26:43,011 --> 00:26:47,107
as a group piece - with tape recordings
and slides - it was a mixed-media piece...

465
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:49,647
and that really led me
into my monologues.

466
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,184
When they did a profile in
the Providence Journal, it was scandalous.

467
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:56,083
I mean, my relatives were upset
that it would come out...

468
00:26:56,256 --> 00:26:59,555
that it was this suicide.

469
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:02,251
My mother committed suicide.
Shortly after she committed suicide...

470
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,227
the woman down the road,
her husband drank himself to death.

471
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:08,766
So my father and this woman got together
to try to make a good marriage...

472
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:11,166
and forget about the pain
and move into a perfect house.

473
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,169
They moved
into this kind of a ranch house...

474
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:15,466
that was like a very modern,
fully equipped motel...

475
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:18,303
where you pull in the asphalt driveway.
On the right is a huge tennis court.

476
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:20,377
You pull in,
push a button in the car...

477
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:22,446
one of the three cars,
a three-car garage door goes up.

478
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:25,015
Three cars are in the garage.
You go around to the front door...

479
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:26,786
ring the doorbell. It
plays 40 different tunes.

480
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,312
My father's always
adjusting them every day.

481
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:31,285
That particular day it was the William Tell
Overture, or next day would be...

482
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:33,482
"The Whole World is Waiting
for the Sunrise," with a polka beat...

483
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,786
or it might be "Jingle Bell Rock,"
according to the seasons.

484
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:38,088
And you go in and there's a whole
weather station there on your left...

485
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:40,754
with the barometric pressure
and the wind velocity and the temperature.

486
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:43,799
And it's wall-to-wall carpeting
and Muzak playing in all the rooms.

487
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:46,204
And in their bedroom,
between the twin beds,

488
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:48,463
there's a little box
that makes white sound.

489
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,734
You can turn it to static, you can turn it
to water, you can turn it to wind.

490
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,572
My father likes to sleep with the static.
Said he couldn't get to sleep without it.

491
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:57,544
Down in the basement -
And everything is going fine.

492
00:27:57,716 --> 00:28:00,844
Down in the basement, there are
two freezers filled to the top with meat.

493
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,646
Up in the attic, there are rows and rows
of bourbon, rows and rows of Scotch...

494
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:05,686
rows and rows of gin,
just like a liquor warehouse.

495
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:08,791
There's an automatic generator that goes
on automatic pilot when the lights go out.

496
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,155
And everything is going fine,
and everything is going

497
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,089
fine, and the cocktail
hour begins about 5:00.

498
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:15,664
We usually start in front
of the TV with Zoom.

499
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,825
And after Zoom,
6:00 news, the 6:30 news...

500
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:21,904
the 7:00 news, and we're eating
somewhere around The Odd Couple.

501
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:24,870
Now, I never know whether I'm talking to my
father, my stepmother, or The Odd Couple.

502
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:27,168
It all kind of blends in.

503
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:29,675
And everything is going fine,
except this particular day, it's summer...

504
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:32,178
and we're eating outside,
and the only problem is flies.

505
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:35,010
"There's a fly. Look out.
Close the door. Get out the bomber. "

506
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:38,517
My father got out this big fogger and set
it off by the picnic table out back...

507
00:28:38,688 --> 00:28:41,623
and my stepmother, who collects antiques,
got out the antique fly gun.

508
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:44,385
You pull it back like this and line it up
a certain distance from the fly...

509
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,326
and if you're all right,
the thing goes "thump. "

510
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:50,931
And everything is going fine,
and everything is going fine...

511
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,499
except someone stole his flagpole twice
with the flag on it...

512
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:56,069
so he's had to cement this one in,
and everything is going fine...

513
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:58,304
except the swimming
pool has cracks in it,

514
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:00,538
it's leaking, and the
AstroTurf is shrinking.

515
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:04,451
And everything is going
fine, and everything

516
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:06,042
is going fine, except
for the squirrels...

517
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:09,115
the gypsy moths,
and a pig farmer named Rocky.

518
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,889
Now, these pigs - It's a good ways away,
but if the wind is wrong...

519
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:17,354
you smell the garbage
when you're in the swimming pool.

520
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:20,358
And this is driving them nuts,
because it's an imperfection, you see.

521
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,622
It's an imperfection.
So what they found out was -

522
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:26,028
They investigated.
There's a town ordinance...

523
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,100
that you can't have pigs
next to private property.

524
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:30,330
But there's a good chunk
of very expensive property

525
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:32,296
between their property and
Rocky the pig farmer.

526
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:35,567
And there's another problem too,
because my father's name is Rocky.

527
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:41,470
So there's a very big, expensive piece
of property between there and there...

528
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:44,811
and so they go down and buy it,
and the next day they take Rocky to court -

529
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:47,749
the pig farmer - and they say, "You
can't have pigs next to our property. "

530
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:50,253
He says, "You don't own that property. "
And he says...

531
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:52,482
"We bought it this morning, my friend. "

532
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,522
It was 1967...

533
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:03,032
and I just escaped the draft
by the skin of my... whatever-

534
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:06,069
chance, luck-
that I didn't go to Vietnam...

535
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,729
and I got very disillusioned
with theater, regional theater...

536
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,239
and the lack of adventure...

537
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,402
and experimentation,
and I started reading...

538
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,310
about Andre Gregory being thrown
out of Theatre for the Living Arts...

539
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,678
for doing Rochelle Owens's play,
Beclch.

540
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,438
And the board of directors
had fired him. He'd

541
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:22,878
gone to New York City
to start a company.

542
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,080
So I read that in The New York Times,
and I thought...

543
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,088
"Well, someone's getting fired
for doing something.

544
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,694
I wonder what that something is, and I'm
gonna take a check-out in New York City. "

545
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,956
My first publicity shot
in New York City.

546
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,293
I didn't know who to go to
when I came here.

547
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,800
I just took a Backstage magazine,
you know, and I took it out.

548
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,871
I took the first ad
that said "photographer. "

549
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,201
I go. This guy must have had...

550
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,843
his great-grandfather's camera
from the Civil War.

551
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,344
He had a canopy he threw over his head,
and there was a wooden cup over the lens...

552
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,982
and he took it off and counted
the exposure - one, two -

553
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,981
and then put it back like this.

554
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:58,815
A 1969 publicity shot.

555
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:07,063
I was doing a workshop
with the Open Theater...

556
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,222
which was an experimental group
run by Joe Chaikin...

557
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,130
and Joyce Aaron was running
the workshop as a free, open workshop...

558
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:16,761
and we were asked -
and this was in 1969, in New York City -

559
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:19,237
to come in and just bring in
a story and jam on it...

560
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:21,344
in a kind of way that
if you didn't remember

561
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,174
the whole story, you
could repeat a word.

562
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:25,142
And I didn't repeat anything once.

563
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:28,477
I just did a story of my day
as fast as I could speak it.

564
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:31,211
And at the end of the workshop,
Joyce, who was running it...

565
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:34,151
asked me who wrote it.

566
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:36,655
She thought it had been
prewritten and memorized.

567
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:39,192
And in 1969, I had a little hint...

568
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,453
that I had some sort of talent
for storytelling...

569
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:45,588
but there was no place for it then, and
it didn't come out till ten years later.

570
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:48,075
It wasrt my choice to go to India.
I was going with

571
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,363
a performance group to do
Brecht's Mother Courage.

572
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:53,098
I don't know why.

573
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:57,909
We had gotten
a John D. Rockefeller llI travel grant...

574
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,640
to do this.
That paid for our tickets over.

575
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:05,308
But when I was in India - I began
searching for a guru when I was in India...

576
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,922
because, well, I started getting
interested in tantric gurus.

577
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,751
I was looking for tantric masters
because I had become...

578
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:14,189
sexually obsessed in India.

579
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:18,295
I think it had to do
with the fact that I knew...

580
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:20,660
there was a lot of sexuality
going on in the country...

581
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,064
because there were so many people
and so many children...

582
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:26,138
but I didn't know where it was operative...

583
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:28,433
Where it was happening.

584
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:31,702
I couldn't understand it
through my cultural view of my eyes.

585
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:35,837
And so I was searching around for these
tantric masters that could teach me...

586
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:38,210
and there were supposed to be
a few tantric masters left...

587
00:32:38,384 --> 00:32:40,284
that practiced this tantric sexuality.

588
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:42,353
You get in a tantric pose
and you say...

589
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:45,582
"I am one who is doing this. "
You know, "I am one -"

590
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:51,587
I waited two weeks,
applied for an audience.

591
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:55,130
And then what you have to do
is you must come to his gate...

592
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,326
around 6:00 out back, because
you go around the back of his house.

593
00:32:58,503 --> 00:33:01,233
And you're not to wear
any scented soaps...

594
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:05,172
or perfume or shaving lotion,
anything - or cut flowers -

595
00:33:05,343 --> 00:33:07,311
because any kind of scent...

596
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:09,970
will cause the guru to leave his body.

597
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,587
And he had been leaving it by accident,
you know, as a result of these scents...

598
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:19,621
and the sannyasis were afraid
he wouldn't come back.

599
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,021
Some people came and knelt, and he shone
a little penlight in their eye...

600
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:25,185
and then gave them a holy name
and put the mala around.

601
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:28,559
Well, when I knelt down, it was obvious
I wasrt about to take the mala.

602
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:32,099
I really wanted to just say,
"Look, which workshop is the orgy?"

603
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,330
I met this American expatriate
on the plane that was living in Paris...

604
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:40,272
and he had friends
down in Greece.

605
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:44,140
He said, "No problem at all. Come with me.
Take a room in the hotel I'm staying in...

606
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,340
and then we'll go out to eat,
we'll have some drinks.

607
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:50,884
You go up and see the ruins first.
Then we'll meet, have drinks and eat. "

608
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:54,046
By then, I knew that this guy
was a homosexual. He was gay.

609
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:59,093
He told me, "It's much better to be gay
if you're traveling a lot, you know?

610
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:03,221
It's just much more convenient.
You have more sexual activity. "

611
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:06,562
"Oh, really?" I said.
"Yeah," he said. "No, this is true. "

612
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:11,334
I got into bed,
and I started feeling - mm -

613
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:15,465
that kind of springtime feeling in the
base of my spine, a little slight itch.

614
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:20,740
And I thought, uh...

615
00:34:23,552 --> 00:34:26,282
"I wonder why he didn't
try to seduce me.

616
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:31,723
What's wrong with me?"

617
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,821
"What's wrong with him?"

618
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,761
And I thought,
"Maybe I should go ask him.

619
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:45,269
Yeah. "

620
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:47,373
So I got up, I got dressed...

621
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,270
and I went out
and I knocked on his door.

622
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:51,843
He said, "Who is it?"
I said, "Spalding. "

623
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:55,073
He said, "Come in. "
So I kind of went along the wall.

624
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:57,307
I came in, and I said...

625
00:35:02,155 --> 00:35:04,282
"We've got to, uh, do something. "

626
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:08,153
He said, "Uh, go take a shower.

627
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:10,193
You can use my shower,
and then we'll talk. "

628
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:12,695
So I came out of the shower
dripping, and, um -

629
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,925
Look, I figured it was safe.

630
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:17,569
He was clean.

631
00:35:17,737 --> 00:35:20,205
He was nice. He was -

632
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:22,272
It was better than one of those -
It was a private room.

633
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,705
I figured I was going to be
traveling in Greece.

634
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:26,777
I might as well get initiated.

635
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,482
And, uh...

636
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,142
I thought it was better than one of those
steamy New York City gay baths...

637
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:38,620
and, uh -

638
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,759
And who would ever know?

639
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:46,524
So he said,
"What do you like to do?"

640
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:48,598
And I said, "Oh, huh. "

641
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:53,595
"I don't know. I don't know.
What do you like to do?"

642
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:57,605
He said, "Oh, I like
having my cock sucked. "

643
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,441
I said...

644
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,010
"I would never do that. "

645
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:12,181
Next thing I knew, I was in bed with him,
like on automatic pilot.

646
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:15,189
It was such a surprise.
I was in there, I had my arms around him...

647
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,886
and it was a real surprise,
because he was soft like a woman.

648
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:22,395
His skin was very soft,
and it was good to be next to someone...

649
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:25,399
after traveling around
all that time and just -

650
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:28,299
But I didn't relax with it, you know?
It was too much for me just then...

651
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:30,565
and I just went right down on him.

652
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,572
I didn't waste any more time.
And while I was doing it...

653
00:36:32,743 --> 00:36:34,573
I was thinking in my head
all the time like this:

654
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:37,838
"I am a homosexual, I am a homosexual,
I am a homosexual, I am a homosexual...

655
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:39,844
I am a homosexual,
I am a homosexual. "

656
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:42,540
And suddenly it broke
like a bubble in my head, you know...

657
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:44,583
and I was suddenly
finding myself sucking...

658
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:47,780
on this kind of disconnected
rubber garden hose...

659
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,482
semi-choking.

660
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:54,151
And - I don't know. Some of you
may know what I'm talking about.

661
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,231
This disconnected feeling.

662
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,867
He said, "Oh!"
He caught on.

663
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:02,832
He said
"Spalding, ease down, ease down.

664
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:07,304
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

665
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,740
I mean, there's no sense
torturing yourself.

666
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:14,106
Is there?"

667
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,911
Every morning I was calling up
and saying to the airplane...

668
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:21,886
"This is Mr. Gray. I have an open ticket.
I'd like to fly at 6:00 tonight. "

669
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:24,023
"Anything you say, Mr. Gray.
You have an open ticket. "

670
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:26,159
And I'd go have a couple beers,
and I'd think about Greece...

671
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:30,023
and I'd come back and call and say, "No,
cancel it. I'm going to fly another time. "

672
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:32,028
"Anything you say, Mr. Gray.
You have an open ticket. "

673
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,759
I was beginning to like this, you know?

674
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:38,029
No. It was more power
than I'd had in all my life.

675
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:40,867
Big Royal Dutch 747.

676
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,941
So Liz said,
"You better go back with me. "

677
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,578
I said, "Sure.
You make the reservation. You do it.

678
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:48,213
You call them, tell them we'll show up. "
We showed up at the airport, right?

679
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:50,747
We got to the airport, and I started pacing
around. She said, "What's wrong?"

680
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:54,409
I said, "I can't go. I have to go - I -"

681
00:37:54,587 --> 00:37:57,351
And she said, "Wait a minute.
You'd better get your bags off the plane. "

682
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:01,459
So I went over to the woman and said,
"Can you -"

683
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:03,686
"No, skip it. Just leave my bags on.
I'm not going. "

684
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:06,923
She said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Gray. You have to
accompany your bags back to New York City.

685
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,192
They can't go without you. "
I said, "Can you take them off?"

686
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,358
She said, "I think we can. "
She got her walkie-talkie out.

687
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,834
- She said, "Do you want -"
- I said, "Yes. No. Uh -

688
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,200
Yes. No. "

689
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:20,802
I started barking at her.
It was unbelievable.

690
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:24,380
And her eyes were rolling in her head,
and Liz just walked on ahead...

691
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:26,983
as though she didn't know me,
you know?

692
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:30,383
I had a rather -

693
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:34,548
a kind of nervous collapse that lasted
maybe four or five months.

694
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:38,126
A lot of not being able to stay awake
and very depressed...

695
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:41,162
and it was triggered
by a lot of regret, of saying...

696
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:42,387
"I should've done
this in India, and I

697
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,630
could've done that, and
I didn't do that"...

698
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,632
rather than looking
at things I did do.

699
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:49,899
So coming out of that breakdown,
I started keeping a journal, a diary.

700
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:53,737
And it was just a regular diary.
That was a real daily diary.

701
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:57,244
And each morning
I would write in that day...

702
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:59,382
saying, "This is what
I did the day before. "

703
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,983
I let sleep be the filter system.

704
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:04,551
And it was healing
in the sense of saying...

705
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:07,349
"This is what I did,
not what I didn't do. "

706
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:10,254
This developed a very -

707
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:13,827
And this was seven years
I did this without missing a day.

708
00:39:13,997 --> 00:39:16,864
And this developed a terrific...

709
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,900
like almost "cinemagraphic"
or photographic memory for detail.

710
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:24,266
And slowly I began to understand
that what my art form was -

711
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:26,304
and bless them,
it was the Wooster Group...

712
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:28,443
that pushed me
and was the first audience.

713
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,704
Elizabeth LeCompte and I
had some time on our own...

714
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,509
to develop our own pieces, and we just
started playing around in the garage.

715
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:38,414
And we began to use
my memories and life experiences

716
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,078
as a kind of source material
to build our pieces on.

717
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:44,623
We did a trilogy called
Three Places in Rhode Island...

718
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:47,091
and Liz LeCompte and the group
would tape-record them...

719
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,252
transcribe them,
and I'd look at them and go...

720
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,866
"Aha! That's writing!"

721
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:56,595
And what happened was that the writer's
voice began to push the actor's voice out.

722
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,671
When I say "writer's voice,"
what do I mean?

723
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:02,331
I couldn't spell.
I couldn't write. I could barely read.

724
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,569
I didn't know that had
nothing to do with writing.

725
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:09,708
This self-reflector's
writer's voice began to -

726
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:11,943
I couldn't memorize my texts properly.

727
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,519
I was always interpolating
or adding my own words.

728
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:18,214
So the little voice began
to whisper to me...

729
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:21,224
"What if, in fact, you were
speaking your own words?

730
00:40:21,394 --> 00:40:24,591
What would they be?"
And I began to do that.

731
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:28,325
In 1979, at the Performing Garage
in downtown Manattan...

732
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,765
I did my first monologue
and called it...

733
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:33,963
Sex and Death to the Age 14.

734
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,472
I sat down at this table in front of
whoever came. It was word of mouth.

735
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:41,272
Maybe there were 15 or 16 people there,
or less - or 12 people -

736
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:44,007
and I put on the Donna Diana Overture
and just played the opening...

737
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:47,016
and lifted the needle,
and I had my little outline...

738
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:50,246
and it was everything I could remember
about sex and death till the age 14...

739
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:53,118
which was the name of the monologue,
and I tape-recorded it.

740
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:57,422
And the first night it was maybe,
oh, 50 minutes long.

741
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:00,531
Then I went back and listened to the tape,
and I had all these massive...

742
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,996
associations and memories
and restructured the outline.

743
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,533
Went back the next night.
It was 60 minutes.

744
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:08,968
Then it was an hour and five,
hour and ten, hour and 30-

745
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,337
almost all 19 monologues
have come in at an hour and 30-

746
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,105
and it just fell into that form, and it
became my first autobiographic monologue.

747
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,716
And what it did was trigger
enormous amounts of memory.

748
00:41:19,884 --> 00:41:22,045
I went right on to the next one,
Booze, Cars, and College Girls...

749
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,051
then A Personal History
of the American Theater.

750
00:41:24,222 --> 00:41:27,987
But, you see, this unlocked
a whole new method of working.

751
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:30,956
I became
like an inverted method actor.

752
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:32,823
You see?

753
00:41:35,132 --> 00:41:37,657
I was using myself to play myself.

754
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:42,029
I was playing with myself.

755
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:46,301
It was a kind of creative narcissism.
And this began to develop, you see?

756
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:50,673
More memories came, and I began
to develop this little cottage industry.

757
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:52,541
And I began to tour.

758
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:54,910
Wherever people would ask me to go,
I'd take these monologues.

759
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:57,450
And sometimes I'd go out alone.
Sometimes I'd go with my girlfriend, Rene.

760
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,053
Now how did you meet?

761
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:01,155
Oh, God, we met in Studio 54.

762
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:03,518
Couldrt have been
a more ludicrous meeting place.

763
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:06,184
I mean, it was a downtown
celebration of the arts.

764
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:08,956
I got an arts award, and we were -

765
00:42:09,465 --> 00:42:12,559
I saw her across a crowded room,
and her face lit up, and I loved it -

766
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:15,726
a very open, soulful face.

767
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:18,031
And I asked her to dance...

768
00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:21,198
and she said
I tried to come on too much.

769
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:24,607
I was, like, too physical
with her, and she fled.

770
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:26,440
She thought I was married.
I wasrt.

771
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:28,582
I was living with someone at the time,
but we were breaking up.

772
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,241
And I pursued her and I found her,
and we had a date...

773
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:33,319
and we went out,
and those were the days -

774
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:35,718
I think on the first date
we were back in bed...

775
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,586
and she was nervous and drank
the wrong drinks and said...

776
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,590
"Excuse me.
I'm gonna throw up. "

777
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:43,662
So in the middle of our first
making love, she threw up...

778
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:46,197
and I held her head
and put a pot under it...

779
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:47,856
and that was
our bonding, I think.

780
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:51,266
We bonded around that vomiting.

781
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,032
And we had a horrible fight
when we started out.

782
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,507
I think it was, Rene missed
her New York support system.

783
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:04,477
That was the first item.
Then she said that sex was a red herring...

784
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:08,284
and we started talking
about what a red herring was.

785
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:13,853
And then she said,
"But we're not equals, you see?"

786
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:15,926
And then she finally said, "Look...

787
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,826
I feel like I'm driving you
3,000 miles to work!"

788
00:43:22,902 --> 00:43:24,130
See?

789
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:28,170
I started asserting myself,
you know?

790
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,052
I said, "I don't give
a shit if you go,

791
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,003
really. I can't take
this arguing anymore. "

792
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:36,443
And my assertion made us both
incredibly horny, and we, uh...

793
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:40,813
we pulled the car over, and we had
the best sex of the whole trip, you know?

794
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:44,717
It had nothing to do with positions
or where the car was parked.

795
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,824
It was just something -

796
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,520
I get tired of talking about myself.

797
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,889
And when I do, I do
the conversations with the audience...

798
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,055
and it's a way of getting outside
of myself and hopefully empathizing...

799
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,098
with another persors story.

800
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,294
So the conversations
are always guided...

801
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,371
toward trying to bring up
a story in someone...

802
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,475
about whatever topic
we're dwelling on that day.

803
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,577
It's a beautiful piece...

804
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,872
because people don't have
any public conversations in America.

805
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,448
They're always 12-step programs.
They always have an agenda.

806
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,585
There is no agenda in this.

807
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,915
And the audience has to find
what's interesting for them.

808
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:21,079
They have to do the editing,
you know?

809
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:23,088
And they will or they won't.
They're in and out of it.

810
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:25,090
Some people
are more interesting than others.

811
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:28,355
But I've gotten more intuitive
of choosing people that will be able...

812
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:34,097
- Did you try to kill yourself?
- No. No, no, no.

813
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,137
It was - I would never kill -
I mean -

814
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,707
You never tried to kill yourself?

815
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:43,140
Um, never.

816
00:44:43,312 --> 00:44:46,748
- Mm. Did you think about it?
- No. I, um -

817
00:44:46,915 --> 00:44:48,815
I think it's a real bad joke.

818
00:44:48,984 --> 00:44:51,885
- Huh? You think it's a bad joke?
- Yeah.

819
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:54,818
- You don't like it.
- I don't like it. It's a real bad joke.

820
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,083
Real, you know, bad joke.

821
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,193
I get - And makes me angry.

822
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:05,325
No, it's the least you can do.
It's so short, you know?

823
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:07,490
It's the least you can do.
Just hang in.

824
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:10,933
You never know, you know?
You just never know.

825
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,505
Do you know anyone
that's ever killed themselves?

826
00:45:13,674 --> 00:45:17,201
You know, that guy I was married to
the first time, he did.

827
00:45:17,378 --> 00:45:20,506
- Just two or three years ago.
- He killed himself?

828
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:24,048
And I haven't seen him
for 20 years, or 30.

829
00:45:25,386 --> 00:45:29,083
And it's been very upsetting
to think, you know -

830
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:31,190
I hadrt seen him.
I hadrt thought about him.

831
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:34,623
He did that.
And it's true: It does have a kicker.

832
00:45:34,794 --> 00:45:37,194
I mean -

833
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:39,855
If you can't make it any other way,
you can do it that way.

834
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:42,763
It's gonna have a real impact,
but it's a shock.

835
00:45:42,936 --> 00:45:45,598
It just doesn't - doesn't do it.

836
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:47,364
Mm.

837
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,634
But it, like, removes things.
It doesn't add.

838
00:45:53,747 --> 00:45:57,409
- I just don't like it. It scares me.
- Right.

839
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,711
- I don't want you to do it. Anybody.
- Right.

840
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:02,376
That's all.

841
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,886
I was taking them on.
I was taking on their stories.

842
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:07,582
- I was interviewing them onstage.
- Who were you interviewing?

843
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,990
I was interviewing people
from the streets of L.A.

844
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:12,790
I was interviewing a woman who had just
been picked up in a mother ship...

845
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:14,990
a flying saucer
on the Ventura Freeway...

846
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:19,125
and her car was going west,
and then an hour later it was going east...

847
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:21,795
and she had to be deprogrammed
to figure out she'd been on a spaceship.

848
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:24,168
So the next person
I have in is a person...

849
00:46:24,342 --> 00:46:26,105
who's the head
of the Aetherius Church out there...

850
00:46:26,277 --> 00:46:29,405
that believes flying saucers
are 15,000 miles up...

851
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,480
above the Earth,
sending down positive energy.

852
00:46:31,649 --> 00:46:34,015
In this church, they have
a big battery that looks kind of like...

853
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:36,119
a small radiator on stilts...

854
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,222
and they receive the energy
from these flying saucers.

855
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,621
Then, when there's a natural disaster
in the United States, they aim the battery.

856
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:45,728
They go up and aim it at that disaster
and send out the positive energy.

857
00:46:45,896 --> 00:46:47,733
I say to him, "Wait,
have any of your people

858
00:46:47,746 --> 00:46:49,388
ever been picked up
by flying saucers?"

859
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:51,466
He said,
"No, they're 15,000 miles up. "

860
00:46:51,635 --> 00:46:54,763
I said, "We had a woman in here the other
night that was on a ship," and he goes...

861
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:59,204
- "Crazy. "
- She's nuts. She's nuts.

862
00:46:59,376 --> 00:47:01,207
Do you have any fears?

863
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:03,346
No. Well, actually, yeah.

864
00:47:03,513 --> 00:47:05,413
What?

865
00:47:07,017 --> 00:47:09,416
Going home and getting beat up -
beaten up.

866
00:47:09,585 --> 00:47:13,316
- Have you ever been beat up?
- Once.

867
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:16,947
What happened? People -
Who beat you up?

868
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,423
Large people. Yeah.

869
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,794
A large gang of people.

870
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,766
Was there any way
of getting back at them?

871
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:31,099
- Me?
- Yeah.

872
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:33,297
No. By myself?

873
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,500
- Right.
- No.

874
00:47:35,677 --> 00:47:37,577
Did you talk to your father about it,
or anyone bigger?

875
00:47:37,746 --> 00:47:39,407
No.

876
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:41,845
I couldn't.
Well, never mind.

877
00:47:42,017 --> 00:47:44,076
You kept it a secret?

878
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,083
- Yeah.
- Right.

879
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:49,451
Well, now I'm not.
It's on television now.

880
00:47:49,624 --> 00:47:53,321
Are there any secrets
that I have?

881
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,657
Are there stories that I don't tell?

882
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,388
Yes.

883
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:02,429
If I'm going into a situation
that I know is gonna be loaded...

884
00:48:02,603 --> 00:48:04,434
like the making of The Killing Fields,
for instance...

885
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:08,041
I kept a pretty tight diary
for the facts, for the details.

886
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:11,939
Then, when I get home from
The Killing Fields, three months after...

887
00:48:12,112 --> 00:48:15,206
because I do refer to myself
as a poetic journalist...

888
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:17,316
in the sense
that any good journalist...

889
00:48:17,484 --> 00:48:19,611
would try to get the story in
as quickly as possible...

890
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:24,280
I am working on a story,
but I like it to gel...

891
00:48:24,457 --> 00:48:28,655
and sit in my unconscious or my dream
state or my regular life for a while...

892
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:31,388
and then after three months' time,
I'll make an outline.

893
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:35,432
Swimming was a radical - and I'd always
been rooting for that - breakthrough.

894
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:38,434
So I was out in L.A.,
performing at the Mark Taper Forum...

895
00:48:38,604 --> 00:48:40,504
Taper Two,
Swimming to Cambodia...

896
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:43,403
and of course, I was in film land,
and everyone was approaching me...

897
00:48:43,576 --> 00:48:46,601
and they were doing, "Let's just
get it down real quick on 16 mm.

898
00:48:46,778 --> 00:48:49,872
Don't bother with the contract.
We want to just document this. "

899
00:48:50,048 --> 00:48:52,016
And Rene said,
"You take control.

900
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:54,550
You got everyone wanting to do it.
I'll produce it.

901
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:56,949
You choose the director. "

902
00:48:57,122 --> 00:49:01,218
It really reached a larger audience,
and I became more popular.

903
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:03,588
Did you read any of
Swimming to Cambodia?

904
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:06,094
I read about half of it.
I should have read it all...

905
00:49:06,264 --> 00:49:09,630
but I got involved with other things,
and I like it very much.

906
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,395
- You were able to read it, though.
- Oh, it's very amusing in places.

907
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,972
I can just picture some of these things,
doing them myself.

908
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:18,733
Really?

909
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,934
Well, those scenes in New York...

910
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:23,842
where you would go down the street
snapping your fingers three times...

911
00:49:24,014 --> 00:49:26,312
or six times or whatever
for some reason -

912
00:49:26,484 --> 00:49:28,509
- I've forgotten what it was now.
- The compulsive behavior.

913
00:49:28,686 --> 00:49:31,018
Yeah, but I've done
the same thing myself...

914
00:49:31,188 --> 00:49:33,553
- Yeah.
- When I was younger.

915
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:35,782
Now you're over it, right?

916
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:39,486
I like telling the story of life
better than I do living it.

917
00:49:39,662 --> 00:49:41,493
I'm very reflective.

918
00:49:41,664 --> 00:49:45,498
I mean, I just enjoy telling the story,
and the event feeds that.

919
00:49:45,668 --> 00:49:47,829
But how does that quell
your fears of living?

920
00:49:48,004 --> 00:49:50,666
Uh, control.
See, I'm afraid of life.

921
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,400
I don't know how you deal with this,
but everything is chance.

922
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:56,170
It's a miracle to me that I'm here,
that the plane made it.

923
00:49:56,346 --> 00:49:58,779
That the sun came up.

924
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:02,246
As soon as you don't have any form
of God or meaning in your life...

925
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,248
then you make it up
as you go along.

926
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:07,547
And certainly, doing the monologue is
making it up, getting control over it...

927
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:10,988
giving it structure to what is normally
chaos to me every day.

928
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,186
The monologue you're going to hear
tonight is a monologue about a man...

929
00:50:14,363 --> 00:50:17,855
who can't write a book about a man
who can't take a vacation.

930
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:26,897
Now, as soon as I signed
the contract for the book...

931
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:29,167
I decided that I would give up
doing monologues.

932
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:33,439
I'd just completely give them up.
I felt they were making me too extroverted.

933
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:39,151
Perhaps even pandering.

934
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,811
And what I wanted to do was pull in
to my more introverted self...

935
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:44,253
that I hadrt been in touch with
in 20 years...

936
00:50:44,425 --> 00:50:48,724
and just begin to work
on writing in a private way...

937
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:51,022
and go away to a writers' colony,
if I could get in one...

938
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,530
'cause I thought that would prove
I was a writer if they'd accept me...

939
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,531
and just write the book.

940
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:57,363
No living. Just writing.

941
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:01,906
And finally I did get down to the writing,
and I got down to it, and it was awful.

942
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:07,012
I don't know why I'd romanticized it.
It's disgusting.

943
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,308
Writing is like a disease.
It is a disease.

944
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:13,508
It steals your body from you.
There's no audience.

945
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:16,348
There's no feedback.
There's - There's -

946
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:19,787
It's -
My hand was swelling up -

947
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:23,019
my knuckle, from the pen pressing
against it, 'cause I was writing longhand.

948
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:25,186
I was losing my sight in my left eye.

949
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:28,333
I was going blind in my left eye,
which was horrible for me...

950
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,401
because here I was,
working on all my Oedipal themes.

951
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,800
And I thought...

952
00:51:33,973 --> 00:51:37,464
"There goes the first eye. "

953
00:51:37,642 --> 00:51:39,303
Which is more frightening -

954
00:51:39,477 --> 00:51:42,310
to go out on a stage as yourself...

955
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,710
or to go out on a stage
as a character?

956
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:47,407
Well, it's flip-flopped.
Now it's more frightening...

957
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:51,954
to go out on the stage
as a character, because I was -

958
00:51:52,123 --> 00:51:55,581
I got to the point, I think,
that I was hiding behind myself.

959
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,591
The self became like a mask.
Not hiding...

960
00:51:57,762 --> 00:52:00,025
but there was a persona there
that I was working behind.

961
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:03,724
Now I'm playing. Now I am rehearsing
for the role of the caretaker...

962
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,731
in the Broadway revival of Our Town...

963
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:07,893
that's going on at the Lyceum,
and I'm terrified.

964
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:10,938
- Why?
- Because I am having to do...

965
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:13,303
a role that's not dissimilar
from myself...

966
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:16,776
but I'm having to say someone else's
words, and in a very tight girdle.

967
00:52:16,947 --> 00:52:19,848
And I have this terrific
rebellious feeling...

968
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:22,008
like I had back in school...

969
00:52:22,185 --> 00:52:25,085
to do a parody of the play -
My subconscious -

970
00:52:25,254 --> 00:52:27,586
I want to tell a story about -
I'm discursive.

971
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:29,588
I'm associative.
That's how I work.

972
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:32,489
So every time I say a line
from Our Town, I have an association...

973
00:52:32,662 --> 00:52:34,448
and I start spinning off
on that association,

974
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:36,063
and I'm having all
these internal films.

975
00:52:36,232 --> 00:52:38,200
I'm really supposed to be
just speaking the lines.

976
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:40,892
So it is going to be -
It's like putting on a girdle.

977
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,868
It's gonna be very, very difficult for me
to do this. I'm very nervous about it.

978
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,770
The little boy playing Wally Webb
over here, Emily's brother...

979
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:50,001
whose appendix burst in New Hampshire
on a Scout trip - he's 11 years old.

980
00:52:50,178 --> 00:52:54,512
He is not blinking an eye for 40 minutes
while I talk about eternity and say...

981
00:52:54,683 --> 00:52:57,413
"You know as well as I do...

982
00:52:57,585 --> 00:53:01,487
that the dead don't stay interested
in us living for very long.

983
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:05,387
Gradually, gradually,
they lose hold of the earth...

984
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,586
and the pleasures they had,
and the things they suffered...

985
00:53:08,763 --> 00:53:12,221
and the people they loved,
and the ambitions they had.

986
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,367
They get weaned away
from the earth. "

987
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:17,333
That's the way I put it -
"weaned away. "

988
00:53:17,504 --> 00:53:20,166
Except often when you're doing
a long run, you often have...

989
00:53:20,341 --> 00:53:22,741
what I refer to as
a "unifying accident"...

990
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,073
in which something so strange
happens on the stage that it suddenly...

991
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:28,476
unifies the audience
and the cast in a realization...

992
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:31,379
that we are only here together
in this one moment, for this show.

993
00:53:31,552 --> 00:53:34,180
It's not television.
It's not a film.

994
00:53:34,355 --> 00:53:36,332
Because of the nature
of the accident, we all

995
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:38,290
know it will never be
repeated, most likely.

996
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,517
And somewhere
in the middle of the run, it happens.

997
00:53:40,693 --> 00:53:43,924
I'm turning to the dead, saying,
"They're waiting.

998
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:46,327
They're waiting for something
they feel is coming.

999
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:48,729
Something important and great. "

1000
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:51,734
And I turn to watch them wait,
and just as I turn...

1001
00:53:51,904 --> 00:53:55,237
the little 11-year-old boy
projectile-vomits.

1002
00:53:57,343 --> 00:54:01,074
Like a hydrant it comes,
hitting one of the dead on the shoulder.

1003
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:05,376
The other dead levitate around him
out of sheer fear and drop back down.

1004
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,986
Frannie Conroy in the front row,
in deep meditative trance, is thinking...

1005
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:11,384
"Why is it raining onstage?"

1006
00:54:11,556 --> 00:54:15,083
The little boy flees from his chair,
vomit pouring from his mouth.

1007
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,593
Splatter, splatter, splatter!
My knees are shaking.

1008
00:54:18,764 --> 00:54:20,527
The chair is empty.

1009
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:23,293
The audience is thunderstruck.

1010
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,698
There is not a sound
coming from the audience...

1011
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:29,362
except for one little
ten-year-old boy in the eighth row.

1012
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,906
He knows what he saw.

1013
00:54:34,412 --> 00:54:36,573
He is laughing!

1014
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:42,614
And I don't know what to do.

1015
00:54:42,787 --> 00:54:45,654
I don't know whether to go on
with Thornton Wilder and be loyal to him...

1016
00:54:45,823 --> 00:54:47,688
and do the next line as written...

1017
00:54:47,858 --> 00:54:50,155
or attempt what might be
one of the most creative improvs...

1018
00:54:50,326 --> 00:54:52,226
in the history
of American theater.

1019
00:54:54,731 --> 00:54:58,223
And I decide to be loyal to Wilder
and go on with the next line...

1020
00:54:58,401 --> 00:55:00,801
and turn to that empty chair and say...

1021
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:06,101
"Arert they waiting for the eternal part
of them to come out clear?"

1022
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:11,805
When I think of
Monster in a Box...

1023
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:15,108
the film, which is
being released...

1024
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:18,048
any day now...

1025
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,018
I have a story that I tell over
and over again that I think I know...

1026
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,021
because I've told the story...

1027
00:55:23,192 --> 00:55:25,660
and it has to do with how,
at the end -

1028
00:55:25,828 --> 00:55:29,457
I talk about when I came home
from Mexico on my vacation...

1029
00:55:29,631 --> 00:55:32,327
all I found left about my mother -
'cause she committed suicide...

1030
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:35,436
and had been cremated -
was ashes in an urn...

1031
00:55:35,604 --> 00:55:37,936
in a box by my father's bed.

1032
00:55:38,106 --> 00:55:41,563
And I'd tell that story over and over
again, and then I suddenly realized...

1033
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:44,210
how long he actually kept
that box by the bed...

1034
00:55:44,378 --> 00:55:46,903
before casting
the ashes over the sea...

1035
00:55:47,081 --> 00:55:49,572
and what a kind of
loving gesture it was.

1036
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,982
And I'd seen it just that -
He wasrt procrastinating or waiting...

1037
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:56,214
but he was actually
living with...

1038
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,585
and sleeping next to
those ashes.

1039
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:01,023
And it was just
a very strong, powerful image -

1040
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:03,095
the thought of him alone
with that box at night.

1041
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:06,061
And I never, never really felt it...

1042
00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:08,701
or looked into it until I had
spoken it so many times.

1043
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:11,838
And yet the box
in which you put the fragments...

1044
00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:16,101
that will contribute to your next work -
is that a monster too?

1045
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:20,110
Yes, and I've only started doing that
with the box since Monster in a Box.

1046
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,407
I got a box and put it by my -
It was a new idea...

1047
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:25,813
and I think it grew
out of that, yeah.

1048
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:28,146
Is the monster of those fragments -
is that chaos?

1049
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,016
Yes, that's what it is. And of course
it's all about organizing that...

1050
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,591
and how frightening that is,
and why any artist is an artist...

1051
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,456
and what their main work is to -

1052
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,724
Yeah, that chaos is -
Yeah.

1053
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,960
I just feel that all the time
when I'm not performing or organizing.

1054
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:47,333
I'm out there in it, but it's what makes
the monologue, so I try to keep a journal.

1055
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:50,769
What next? What to do?

1056
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,807
Another monologue.
What else is there to do?

1057
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:55,138
There's always a new crisis,
a new "impingency. "

1058
00:56:55,313 --> 00:56:58,714
I hoped I wasrt making them up,
creating them just so I'd have material.

1059
00:57:00,552 --> 00:57:03,146
The new one was that I was losing
my sight in my left eye.

1060
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,620
I certainly hoped I wasrt bringing
that one on myself for material.

1061
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,488
And I did a monologue about it
and called it Gray's Anatomy.

1062
00:57:10,662 --> 00:57:13,631
Gray's Anatomy was gonna be
a cover story for The New York Times.

1063
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:15,650
I said, "It's not ready.
" My agent said, "It's

1064
00:57:15,663 --> 00:57:17,255
for The New York Times,
a cover story. "

1065
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,562
I said, "It doesn't exist yet. "
She said, "Well, make it exist!"

1066
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,079
I said, "I don't have
a performance until

1067
00:57:22,092 --> 00:57:23,638
March. " She said, "That's too late.
Make it. "

1068
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,241
So I hired an editor,
John Howell, a friend of mine.

1069
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,378
He sat across from me,
and I told him the story.

1070
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,070
He was my first audience.
Just like you, it was one-on-one...

1071
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,148
but I was telling the story
from an outline.

1072
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:34,716
It's oral composition.

1073
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:37,046
I was about to turn 52...

1074
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,347
and clearly I had -

1075
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,353
My mom killed herself
when she was 52...

1076
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,856
and I had, somewhere in the back
of my mind, thought I was gonna -

1077
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,051
in my "un," perhaps -
going to do it too.

1078
00:57:46,228 --> 00:57:49,095
Now, I had witnessed
two severe nervous breakdowns...

1079
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,426
the second one
ending in her suicide...

1080
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,933
so I was very attuned to it...

1081
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:57,698
and was so sure that I was going
to join her either unconsciously...

1082
00:57:57,873 --> 00:58:00,171
where I would contract
some disease...

1083
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:04,006
or in an accident,
or maybe just actually do a suicide.

1084
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,707
And around this time, what began
to happen was suicide fantasies.

1085
00:58:08,883 --> 00:58:12,216
Like films.
I mean, I wasrt manufacturing them.

1086
00:58:12,387 --> 00:58:14,981
They were coming into my consciousness,
and I was watching them...

1087
00:58:15,156 --> 00:58:17,420
and embracing them as fantasies
and nothing more.

1088
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:22,052
I mean, the first one I remember was,
I was touring Ireland with Rene...

1089
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,690
and we went down to the Cliffs of Moher,
those 400-foot-high rock cliffs...

1090
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:30,303
at sunset, you know -
an Irish sunset -

1091
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:33,031
gray sky over gray sea.

1092
00:58:35,643 --> 00:58:37,804
Gray observed by Gray.

1093
00:58:39,113 --> 00:58:41,138
And I was standing there -
it was cocktail hour -

1094
00:58:41,315 --> 00:58:43,681
drinking a can of Guinness Stout,
looking out over -

1095
00:58:43,851 --> 00:58:47,787
Most of the tourists had gone.
And this fantasy came to me...

1096
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:51,982
this desire to commit what I would call
a "Roadrunner suicide"...

1097
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,218
in which I got back in a field,
and shot by Rene full speed -

1098
00:58:55,395 --> 00:58:57,795
beep-beep! Voom! -
out over the cliff.

1099
00:58:57,964 --> 00:59:01,661
And just before I went down,
I turned and saw her face...

1100
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:05,031
and it was that expression
on her face that I took with me...

1101
00:59:05,204 --> 00:59:08,230
as my last vision
to my watery grave.

1102
00:59:08,408 --> 00:59:11,343
And as I thought about this,
I couldn't stop crying...

1103
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:14,446
and I could not stop
telling Rene the fantasy...

1104
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:16,912
over and over...

1105
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:19,243
and over again.

1106
00:59:19,418 --> 00:59:23,047
Now, around the time I was being
plagued by these silly fantasies...

1107
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:25,587
a very powerful
synchronistic event happened.

1108
00:59:25,757 --> 00:59:30,319
Steven Soderbergh, the film director of
Sex, Lies, and Videotape and Kafka...

1109
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:33,396
approached me to be in his new film,
King of the Hill.

1110
00:59:33,565 --> 00:59:36,728
And he said he was choosing me
for the particular role of Mr. Mungo...

1111
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:38,961
because he'd read my book
Impossible Vacation.

1112
00:59:39,137 --> 00:59:41,628
"What a strange way to cast," I thought.
"From this book!"

1113
00:59:41,807 --> 00:59:44,502
And he said the character
in Impossible Vacation -

1114
00:59:44,675 --> 00:59:47,610
the "character," right? -
Brewster North -

1115
00:59:47,778 --> 00:59:50,212
was clearly ruled by regret...

1116
00:59:50,381 --> 00:59:53,976
and the character in his movie,
Mr. Mungo, that he wanted me to play...

1117
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:57,416
was ruled by regret
to the extent that he kills himself.

1118
00:59:57,588 --> 00:59:59,419
"Oh, really?"

1119
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:04,555
"And how does he do that, Steven?"

1120
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:07,196
"Right now
I have him slitting his wrists. "

1121
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:09,524
"I'll do it!"

1122
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:13,362
So here was a chance, I thought, to work
out this fantasy in a creative way...

1123
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:16,437
with a good director.

1124
01:00:17,741 --> 01:00:20,175
I think it's a watershed monologue.
I think the other monologues...

1125
01:00:20,343 --> 01:00:23,210
were always about me being the victim
and having the audience be the mother...

1126
01:00:23,379 --> 01:00:25,210
and me crying out,
"Look, look, I'm drowning. "

1127
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:28,509
And also in my relationship
with Rene Shafransky...

1128
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:32,279
which was similar to with the audience,
of always being...

1129
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:34,547
in need of being nurtured
and mothered.

1130
01:00:34,723 --> 01:00:38,386
And in this monologue, I say...

1131
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,188
"Hey, I did this,"
and I take more responsibility.

1132
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:44,423
My shadow's showing in this.
I mean, I'm not a good guy.

1133
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,660
Rene knew I had affairs.
She was not happy about it.

1134
01:00:47,836 --> 01:00:51,169
She had some -
not to the degree that I had -

1135
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:55,071
and so I suppose there was
an unspoken relationship -

1136
01:00:55,244 --> 01:00:57,734
or we thought we had
this modern relationship where...

1137
01:00:57,912 --> 01:01:01,473
if the affair existed outside there
and didn't come back and haunt us...

1138
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:04,083
then it was all right.
We kept a distance on it.

1139
01:01:04,252 --> 01:01:07,312
Also, the other thing was that
we were both so into riding...

1140
01:01:07,488 --> 01:01:09,786
on the magic carpet of my celebrity...

1141
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,892
that we just didn't look at the underbelly
of the relationship for a lot of time.

1142
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,518
Things were rolling so fast.

1143
01:01:16,697 --> 01:01:19,723
So Kathie - that was breaking
the boundaries...

1144
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:22,733
because I was never supposed
to have one in New York City.

1145
01:01:22,903 --> 01:01:24,803
But I had met Kathie on the road,
and she moved to New York.

1146
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:27,565
She moved to Thomas Street
in downtown Manattan.

1147
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:29,800
Now, the odd thing about that
was I grew up...

1148
01:01:29,976 --> 01:01:32,069
near Thomas Street
in Barrington, Rhode Island.

1149
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:34,338
But I didn't have a girlfriend
when I was 16...

1150
01:01:34,514 --> 01:01:38,143
because I dated my mom
until I was 23.

1151
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:41,378
So to some extent,
I think I was going back to that.

1152
01:01:41,555 --> 01:01:44,217
And I'm not saying I was having
an affair with the street.

1153
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:47,382
I'm saying that people
were becoming like signifiers to me.

1154
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:51,087
It was like I was in a movie,
and I didn't know whose film it was...

1155
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:54,960
and I was going through the motions,
and it was feeling good but confusing...

1156
01:01:55,134 --> 01:01:58,297
and I was approaching 52,
and things were really getting complicated.

1157
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,495
Rene wanted to get married again.

1158
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:03,233
"Again" - we'd never been married,
but she was pushing for it again.

1159
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:05,502
And I thought,
"I should be able to give her that gift.

1160
01:02:05,678 --> 01:02:07,976
We've been together so many years. "
And if I got married...

1161
01:02:08,147 --> 01:02:10,341
that would automatically
end the affair.

1162
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:12,676
But I was so timid about it...

1163
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:15,718
I had to propose to her
in front of my therapist...

1164
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:20,519
Who knew I was having
an affair with Kathie...

1165
01:02:20,692 --> 01:02:23,092
and said nothing about it.

1166
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:25,593
In fact, I brought Kathie in
to meet him...

1167
01:02:25,763 --> 01:02:29,790
and we had a session, and afterward she
went to use his bathroom, and he said...

1168
01:02:29,968 --> 01:02:34,097
"She's quite European
in her attitudes.

1169
01:02:34,271 --> 01:02:36,136
She's like a French woman. "

1170
01:02:36,306 --> 01:02:40,242
I said, "Well, you dog!
You want to fuck her, don't you?"

1171
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,537
He said, "No, no!"

1172
01:02:42,713 --> 01:02:44,977
And then he had a very bad
countertransference...

1173
01:02:45,148 --> 01:02:47,378
and died of a heart attack
before I could kill him.

1174
01:02:49,553 --> 01:02:51,384
I didn't think I could do
another monologue.

1175
01:02:51,555 --> 01:02:56,492
I pretty much almost cracked up
just before this monologue was -

1176
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,627
Are you serious? Come on.

1177
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:00,819
Yeah, was told
that I was manic-depressive...

1178
01:03:00,997 --> 01:03:05,024
was on Klonopin and lithium
and seeing a top psychopharmacologist -

1179
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,294
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1180
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,461
I don't know if that monologue
gives a flavor...

1181
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:13,302
of the - of the crack-up.

1182
01:03:13,476 --> 01:03:15,535
And I-

1183
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:19,112
Skiing really gave me a sense of balance
in the middle of that crack-up.

1184
01:03:19,282 --> 01:03:21,477
But what was the question?

1185
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:23,743
What didn't you tell us
we might want to know?

1186
01:03:23,919 --> 01:03:27,480
Oh, my God! That was in the therapist's
office. That's what helped me through.

1187
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:29,487
I had a very good...

1188
01:03:29,658 --> 01:03:32,559
woman therapist that -

1189
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:36,527
I laid out the stuff. I laid out
my shadow in her lap, as it were...

1190
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:40,259
and we began to figure out
what was public and what was private.

1191
01:03:40,435 --> 01:03:42,767
When Kathie told me she was pregnant,
I fell down on the floor...

1192
01:03:42,938 --> 01:03:44,906
and went into a fetal position...

1193
01:03:45,073 --> 01:03:47,199
and when I got up, I said...

1194
01:03:47,374 --> 01:03:50,832
"Get rid of it. Get rid of it. "

1195
01:03:51,011 --> 01:03:52,842
And she said, "Not so fast.

1196
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:55,311
This is my body.
I have to think about it.

1197
01:03:55,482 --> 01:03:58,747
If I have this child, I will raise it.
I will be committed to it. "

1198
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:01,581
And I got out of there,
and I went out on tour...

1199
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:05,657
and I sent her money for an abortion,
and I called her and sent her letters...

1200
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:09,557
and on September 27, 1992...

1201
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,890
Kathie gave birth to a son...

1202
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:16,229
and named him
Forrest Dylan Gray.

1203
01:04:16,402 --> 01:04:19,303
This was extremely traumatic.

1204
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:21,997
Rene cried. I cried.

1205
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:25,474
Kathie cried. Forrest cried.

1206
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:28,876
And Rene requested me...

1207
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:33,041
not to see this child until there was
some reconciliation between us...

1208
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:36,085
and I couldn't deal with any of it
and went out on tour.

1209
01:04:36,254 --> 01:04:38,222
And out there,
I got more and more agoraphobic...

1210
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,221
and wasrt going out of my hotel...

1211
01:04:40,392 --> 01:04:43,122
and Rene called and said,
"You've got to come back.

1212
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:47,755
I've seen the baby in a snuggly in Kathie's
arms, and I am in bed, devastated. "

1213
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:50,094
And I said,
"You've got to give me a day. "

1214
01:04:50,268 --> 01:04:52,793
And she said, "If you take a day,
I won't be here for you. "

1215
01:04:52,971 --> 01:04:55,201
I took two days.
I took two days...

1216
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:57,774
because I couldn't even find myself...

1217
01:04:57,943 --> 01:05:00,342
to walk out of the hotel,
I was so split...

1218
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:03,446
with an image of myself
sitting on the bed, comforting Rene...

1219
01:05:03,614 --> 01:05:05,741
and an image of myself
standing next to Kathie...

1220
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:08,146
meeting my son for the first time.

1221
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,685
And the split was so great,
it took three people...

1222
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:13,119
to get me out
to the San Francisco airport...

1223
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,121
jerking and barking all the way.

1224
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:18,159
This time, the captain
of the American Airlines came out.

1225
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:21,958
My friend talked to him, and the
captain said, "I don't care who he is.

1226
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:25,431
Do you know what it costs
to land this plane in Kansas?"

1227
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:30,404
And somehow -
and I don't know how Bill did this -

1228
01:05:30,573 --> 01:05:35,101
he convinced the captain I was rehearsing
for a psychotic role in a Scorsese movie.

1229
01:05:37,047 --> 01:05:39,572
And Rene said,
"This is it. I can't -

1230
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:44,516
I have to draw a boundary here.
I'm moving out with a friend for a while. "

1231
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:47,485
And when she left the loft...

1232
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:49,624
she took the feeling with her.

1233
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:52,454
There was no heart left in that room.

1234
01:05:52,628 --> 01:05:55,495
I turned to stone.
I turned to a dead thing.

1235
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:57,689
And I had not realized
for 14 years...

1236
01:05:57,866 --> 01:06:00,767
Rene had been filling
the room with the feeling.

1237
01:06:00,936 --> 01:06:03,769
And I took a bottle of vodka
and knocked down a few shots...

1238
01:06:03,939 --> 01:06:05,998
and began to feel my breath
and thought...

1239
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:08,370
"What do I want to do?"

1240
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:12,036
And I thought,
"I would like to see my son.

1241
01:06:12,214 --> 01:06:14,204
He's eight months old.
I've never seen him. "

1242
01:06:14,382 --> 01:06:17,613
And I called Kathie and I said,
"I'm coming down. "

1243
01:06:17,785 --> 01:06:20,151
And I came down,
and she took him out of the crib...

1244
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:22,653
and he went right for her breast...

1245
01:06:22,824 --> 01:06:25,725
and I knew there was
no need for a blood test.

1246
01:06:28,629 --> 01:06:32,531
I saw the shape of my father's head
in the back of his head.

1247
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,635
I saw my brother Rocky's eyes
in his eyes.

1248
01:06:35,803 --> 01:06:39,499
I saw a distant mirror.
I saw a little lust flower.

1249
01:06:39,673 --> 01:06:41,834
I saw a completely formed
human being.

1250
01:06:42,008 --> 01:06:45,205
I saw a glorious accident.

1251
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:48,575
And I had a perfect paradox
at that moment, where I thought...

1252
01:06:48,748 --> 01:06:51,774
"Now you can die,
and you must stay alive...

1253
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:53,783
to help this little guy through. "

1254
01:06:53,954 --> 01:06:56,946
My dad died three days
after I saw my son...

1255
01:06:57,124 --> 01:06:59,092
not knowing he had
his first grandson.

1256
01:06:59,259 --> 01:07:01,123
I didn't even know
my father was dying.

1257
01:07:01,293 --> 01:07:04,285
My stepmother didn't call
to tell me he was in the hospital...

1258
01:07:04,463 --> 01:07:06,761
she was so angry with me
at the way I portrayed her...

1259
01:07:06,932 --> 01:07:09,867
in my book Impossible Vacation.

1260
01:07:10,035 --> 01:07:13,562
Sorry you can't stick around
and spend a little time here.

1261
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:15,730
Yeah. As always...

1262
01:07:15,908 --> 01:07:18,240
I'm off on another toot.

1263
01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:23,509
- Back to Boston?
- Yeah. You should come up.

1264
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:26,878
Well, maybe we will.
Except for the traffic.

1265
01:07:27,051 --> 01:07:29,485
Right. I hope we don't hit it.

1266
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:33,556
But I don't know when -
next time we'll see each other.

1267
01:07:33,725 --> 01:07:35,955
Well, you're going
to Florida at Christmas.

1268
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:40,359
Yeah, and then
to Australia on January 11.

1269
01:07:40,532 --> 01:07:43,023
So we won't see you again
till probably March, hmm?

1270
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:45,499
- Uh, April, more like.
- April.

1271
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,036
Are you going up to the house
in the mountains in April?

1272
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:50,765
- I think I'm gonna try to sell that house.
- Oh, are you?

1273
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,772
What are you going to do
about the foundation?

1274
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,969
Try to sell it. They say
there's a sucker born every minute...

1275
01:07:56,146 --> 01:07:58,444
and if there is,
I'll let them take it over.

1276
01:07:58,615 --> 01:08:00,810
We want to get a house
out in the Hamptons...

1277
01:08:00,984 --> 01:08:04,283
believe it or not,
closer to the water.

1278
01:08:04,454 --> 01:08:06,684
What's it like being a dad?
How has that changed your life?

1279
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:09,917
Being a dad is fantastic.
It's very grounding, very connecting.

1280
01:08:10,093 --> 01:08:12,926
And it's got me out of myself, because
believe me - and you must know this...

1281
01:08:13,096 --> 01:08:16,826
and everyone that has children knows it -
their needs are bigger than yours...

1282
01:08:16,999 --> 01:08:19,490
and they are so obviously bigger.

1283
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:21,967
- That's right.
- It really relativizes yours.

1284
01:08:22,138 --> 01:08:24,197
You talked about your dad
in the excerpt a moment ago.

1285
01:08:24,373 --> 01:08:26,568
What did you learn from your dad
about raising kids?

1286
01:08:26,742 --> 01:08:29,472
It's all been learned now,
after his death, I'm sad to say...

1287
01:08:29,645 --> 01:08:33,308
'cause I'm a father late in life,
and I'd love to thank him...

1288
01:08:33,482 --> 01:08:36,417
for what he went through with us,
his three boys.

1289
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:38,678
And I've learned
to appreciate him in absence.

1290
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,400
Yeah!

1291
01:09:22,796 --> 01:09:24,889
Yeah!

1292
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:26,760
- That's greatl
- Stick your foot out.

1293
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:28,457
Oh, my Godl

1294
01:09:28,635 --> 01:09:30,728
So the new monologue is called
Morning, Noon and Night...

1295
01:09:30,903 --> 01:09:33,770
and it's about my life living
with the family here in this house.

1296
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,568
And of course, my fear is that
once I tell the story...

1297
01:09:36,743 --> 01:09:39,234
or organize the chaos
about the family...

1298
01:09:39,412 --> 01:09:41,880
I'll be looking for the next story,
which means I'll have to leave the family.

1299
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:44,016
So that's the risk of the work.

1300
01:09:44,183 --> 01:09:47,243
And when she moved to New York City
with her daughter, Marissa -

1301
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,981
and Marissa was three -
I continued to meet her there.

1302
01:09:51,157 --> 01:09:55,183
And I first met Marissa at a party
in downtown New York City.

1303
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,353
And Marissa had a sense that
the name Spalding Gray existed...

1304
01:09:59,531 --> 01:10:03,023
because I'd call the loft a lot
to talk with Kathie...

1305
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:05,499
but she could never get her imagination
around "Spalding Gray"...

1306
01:10:05,671 --> 01:10:08,731
so she referred to me as
"Splendid Caf"...

1307
01:10:10,842 --> 01:10:14,938
Which I thought was a great stage name
if I ever needed one.

1308
01:10:15,113 --> 01:10:18,343
I think we're going to get away
with this one story about the family.

1309
01:10:18,516 --> 01:10:20,416
I wouldn't want to turn it
into Ozzie and Harriet...

1310
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:23,712
and make an ongoing soap opera,
because the children would then be...

1311
01:10:23,888 --> 01:10:26,652
minor heroes
before they were greater people.

1312
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:29,918
We move into the house,
and new life comes.

1313
01:10:30,094 --> 01:10:32,494
Kathie gets pregnant.

1314
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:35,632
How did this happen?

1315
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,700
"I don't think I want this child.

1316
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:41,701
I'm content now with our new home
and the family configuration as it is"...

1317
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:45,398
I told my therapist.

1318
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:49,511
Kathie's sure it's gonna be a girl.
She's convinced me it's gonna be a girl.

1319
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,943
We're gonna name her
Eliza Ann Gray.

1320
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:55,607
Eleven hours into labor here,
the storm is still raging.

1321
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:59,277
It's the next day, and Kathie
can only find one comfortable position.

1322
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,720
She's on all fours,
like a wild animal.

1323
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:04,587
The nurses are not approving.
I know it's not Northern California.

1324
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,958
I'm trying to get the hermetically sealed
window open to get a little air in there.

1325
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,531
Marissa's dozing in the corner
with her little camera...

1326
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,533
and all of a sudden,
it starts to come.

1327
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:18,434
And I just have time to get on
my scrubs and roll Kathie over.

1328
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,474
I'm helping. I'm pushing one knee back.
The other nurse has the other knee...

1329
01:11:21,643 --> 01:11:25,477
and I look down and -
Oh, my God!

1330
01:11:25,647 --> 01:11:29,083
It looks like she's giving birth
to a dead beaver!

1331
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:33,984
"What is that hairy blue football...

1332
01:11:34,155 --> 01:11:36,282
and how is it gonna fit
through that -"

1333
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:38,357
Pow! And it's out!
And I go...

1334
01:11:38,526 --> 01:11:41,586
"Whoa!
Look at the balls on that girl!"

1335
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:49,728
And I lean over
and kiss Kathie and cry...

1336
01:11:49,904 --> 01:11:53,896
and bend down and cut the umbilical cord,
and the crimson blood flies...

1337
01:11:54,074 --> 01:11:58,067
and I look down
at this glorious accident, Theo.

1338
01:11:58,245 --> 01:12:00,304
We just grabbed that name out the air
in case it was a boy.

1339
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,449
"Theo," short for nothing.

1340
01:12:03,617 --> 01:12:05,585
Short for "the study of God. "

1341
01:12:05,752 --> 01:12:07,743
Theo Spalding Gray.

1342
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:12,722
And back at me is coming this totally
perplexed face with the big "Why?"

1343
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:14,724
"Why this?

1344
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:16,988
Why something and not nothing?"

1345
01:12:17,164 --> 01:12:20,428
And I totally identify with it.
And I know that he's not mirroring me.

1346
01:12:20,599 --> 01:12:23,568
He hasn't been in the world
long enough to pick up on my face.

1347
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:25,863
He's brought this in with him.

1348
01:12:26,038 --> 01:12:29,439
And I think, "Oh, little one,
you may have already spent...

1349
01:12:29,608 --> 01:12:32,839
the best days of your life...

1350
01:12:33,012 --> 01:12:37,574
In there. "

1351
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,550
I think of poetic journalism
as telling a relatively true story...

1352
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:45,485
but after you've digested it, filtered it
through your own imagination...

1353
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:49,354
and then tell it with poetry,
with flavor...

1354
01:12:49,527 --> 01:12:52,428
with innuendo,
with hyperbole...

1355
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:56,033
so that it starts
as a true story...

1356
01:12:56,201 --> 01:13:00,194
but it's filtered
through my imagination.

1357
01:13:00,371 --> 01:13:03,431
So at its best, it comes out
as a form of poetry.

1358
01:13:03,608 --> 01:13:06,338
Forrest came to me very early on
with questions about death.

1359
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:09,570
He wasrt even four.
And I just was very honest with him.

1360
01:13:09,746 --> 01:13:12,738
I said, "You know,
everyone that comes in has to go out.

1361
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:15,714
That's just the whole rule of it.
That's how it goes.

1362
01:13:15,886 --> 01:13:19,845
And it's probably, in a way, comforting.
It's the only thing we really know.

1363
01:13:20,023 --> 01:13:22,583
And the funny thing, Forrest,
about death is - or not funny, really,

1364
01:13:22,759 --> 01:13:24,590
because I don't think there's
anything funny about death -

1365
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:27,594
but the odd thing is,
is that, you know...

1366
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:29,857
everyone knows
they're going to die...

1367
01:13:30,033 --> 01:13:33,968
but no one really believes it. "

1368
01:13:34,136 --> 01:13:37,128
All of my life - Or so many of us
were brought up with the idea...

1369
01:13:37,306 --> 01:13:39,706
of the ethereal-ness of death...

1370
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:43,869
and you're going to go off
into the vapors and to heaven.

1371
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:46,037
And I think that we return
to the elements...

1372
01:13:46,215 --> 01:13:50,845
and that age is a great pain
but also a great comfort.

1373
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,511
It's a great paradox,
because the older I get...

1374
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:56,122
the more weight I feel
and the more aware of gravity.

1375
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:58,122
You know, I only live once.

1376
01:13:58,293 --> 01:14:00,761
I'm sure the configuration
of Spalding Gray...

1377
01:14:00,929 --> 01:14:04,421
there's only room for it one time around,
so I know I won't be reincarnated.

1378
01:14:04,599 --> 01:14:07,329
One of the ways
to reincarnate is to tell your story.

1379
01:14:07,502 --> 01:14:10,027
And I get enormous pleasure from that.
It's like coming back.

1380
01:14:10,205 --> 01:14:12,673
They're probably gonna go in
and play in front of the fire...

1381
01:14:12,841 --> 01:14:14,968
and put music on, maybe.

1382
01:14:15,143 --> 01:14:18,977
If Marissa wins, and she usually does,
it'll be Spice Girls.

1383
01:14:19,147 --> 01:14:21,239
If Forrest gets his way, it'll be Hanson.

1384
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,280
Kathie and I are gonna just
hang out here a little more...

1385
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:25,475
and have more chardonnay
with Theo and relax.

1386
01:14:25,653 --> 01:14:29,214
"Keep it down in there.
Please keep it down. "

1387
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:31,415
Sounds like a compromise, huh?

1388
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,423
I don't know what they chose.

1389
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:37,052
What is it?

1390
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:40,666
We'll be singir

1391
01:14:41,969 --> 01:14:44,664
- I get knocked down, but I get up again
- Wow!

1392
01:14:44,837 --> 01:14:47,362
Hey! It's Chumbawamba!

1393
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,407
I can't resist. Pumpir out.

1394
01:14:50,577 --> 01:14:53,842
- Whoo!
- I get knocked down but I get up again

1395
01:14:54,013 --> 01:14:57,176
- You're never gonna keep me down
- And I'm out there with 'em.

1396
01:14:57,350 --> 01:15:00,581
Wow! Hey! Whoo!

1397
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:04,052
Marissa's doing ballet leaps
across the living room floor.

1398
01:15:04,223 --> 01:15:06,817
Forrest enters,
twirling like a dervish.

1399
01:15:06,993 --> 01:15:10,792
Theo comes in and starts doing plis
on the wingback chair.

1400
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:17,334
Kathie enters,
walkir like an Egyptian.

1401
01:15:19,538 --> 01:15:23,565
Oh, Danny boy, Danny boy

1402
01:15:23,742 --> 01:15:27,576
Hey, we're dancing. The whole family's
dancing to Chumbawamba.

1403
01:15:27,746 --> 01:15:32,149
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

1404
01:15:32,317 --> 01:15:36,616
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

1405
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:41,588
I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

1406
01:15:54,005 --> 01:15:56,303
And we all go downtown
for ice cream.

1407
01:15:56,474 --> 01:16:00,569
I always felt that I would always be
publicly talking about something...

1408
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:02,678
and I never know what
the next thing is gonna be...

1409
01:16:02,846 --> 01:16:05,838
but I suspect that
as long as I have a voice...

1410
01:16:06,016 --> 01:16:08,712
there will be a story, you know?

1411
01:16:11,087 --> 01:16:13,419
This is a great entrance.

1412
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,649
Boy, we had so much -

1413
01:16:15,825 --> 01:16:19,192
It was hard to film at Robbie's with
all the planes, and they're over here too.

1414
01:16:19,362 --> 01:16:22,797
But I now know how to get up the steps.
I'm able to jump steps, so -

1415
01:16:22,965 --> 01:16:26,332
- That's an acquired skill.
- It's a new breakthrough for me. Yeah.

1416
01:16:26,502 --> 01:16:28,868
So I've gotten
to this real stationary place...

1417
01:16:29,038 --> 01:16:31,404
where I don't have to do anything...

1418
01:16:31,573 --> 01:16:34,303
and people wait on me,
and I just observe.

1419
01:16:34,476 --> 01:16:37,070
I feel like a real outsider...

1420
01:16:37,246 --> 01:16:39,305
kind of like I'm half dead.

1421
01:16:43,952 --> 01:16:46,010
In a funny way, it's a treat...

1422
01:16:50,358 --> 01:16:53,020
just to be a witness.

1423
01:16:53,194 --> 01:16:55,355
I don't want to see the ocean.

1424
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:58,055
'Cause the last thing I picture myself was,
I was Boogie-boarding in June...

1425
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:02,225
and I said, "I don't want to leave here.
I don't want to go to Ireland.

1426
01:17:02,403 --> 01:17:05,167
I'm riding the waves with Forrest,
and this is great.

1427
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:07,136
You know, my life is good. "

1428
01:17:07,308 --> 01:17:10,401
And I said, "The past five years
have been the best five years of my life. "

1429
01:17:10,577 --> 01:17:13,341
- And then boom.
- And then it happened like that.

1430
01:17:13,513 --> 01:17:15,777
- When did it happen, anyway?
- June 23rd.

1431
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:19,544
- When did you guys arrive in Ireland?
- The day before, the 21st.

1432
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,689
Yeah, we celebrated
the longest day there...

1433
01:17:22,856 --> 01:17:24,983
and Kathie and I had
the master bedroom...

1434
01:17:25,158 --> 01:17:27,592
and we had
one great, erotic night...

1435
01:17:27,761 --> 01:17:30,992
and the next day, end of story.

1436
01:17:31,164 --> 01:17:32,791
End of story line.

1437
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:34,796
You were coming back from dinner
from your birthday?

1438
01:17:34,967 --> 01:17:38,061
From a restaurant.
We were one mile from home.

1439
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,728
And, um...

1440
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,069
And you guys were just in the car, and you
came around a curve and you got hit?

1441
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,542
No, he came around a curve.
Kathie slowed to stop to turn...

1442
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:50,511
and this van came hurtling
right into her.

1443
01:17:50,683 --> 01:17:53,550
I don't think he even broke.
I could see it coming.

1444
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:57,553
It looked like a video game,
like I was playing a video game.

1445
01:17:57,723 --> 01:17:59,553
You just can't accept it.

1446
01:17:59,724 --> 01:18:02,249
And then... huge crash.

1447
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:05,555
And the car just - Our car spun around.
He pushed it around.

1448
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:08,460
The next thing, I was lying
in the road in a puddle of blood...

1449
01:18:08,633 --> 01:18:10,897
and there was this woman
nursing me.

1450
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:14,732
She was the Good Samaritan. Somehow -
She lived in the neighborhood...

1451
01:18:14,906 --> 01:18:16,635
and heard Tara screaming...

1452
01:18:16,808 --> 01:18:20,244
and she lost her nine-year-old son
there a year ago.

1453
01:18:20,411 --> 01:18:23,709
- In a car accident?
- He fell out of the car.

1454
01:18:23,881 --> 01:18:27,044
The car skidded,
and he was almost decapitated.

1455
01:18:27,217 --> 01:18:30,243
And I was her son, in a way.
She kept talking me down...

1456
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,547
and nursing me and saying,
"You're gonna be all right. "

1457
01:18:32,723 --> 01:18:34,918
And I couldn't see out of this eye,
which is my good eye...

1458
01:18:35,092 --> 01:18:37,060
'cause there was so much blood.

1459
01:18:37,227 --> 01:18:40,560
So I couldn't see past the blood.
And there was all this...

1460
01:18:40,731 --> 01:18:43,791
they told me, cow medicine
everywhere, and the weird thing -

1461
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,738
Cow medicine?

1462
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:46,299
Because it was a
veterinarian that hit us.

1463
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:48,460
And the weird thing was
just earlier in the day...

1464
01:18:48,638 --> 01:18:51,573
I saw a very sick calf
that couldn't get up...

1465
01:18:51,741 --> 01:18:54,835
'cause its leg was -
Something was wrong with its hip.

1466
01:18:55,011 --> 01:18:57,445
And I went to a farmer, I said,
"That cow should be...

1467
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:59,444
put out of its misery
or taken care of. "

1468
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:01,583
And the guy said, "Yeah, I know.
We're gonna call a vet. "

1469
01:19:01,751 --> 01:19:03,981
So my fantasy is that I set it up.

1470
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:07,680
It's hard to be relative and hard to -
I mean, when I was complaining...

1471
01:19:07,857 --> 01:19:11,156
to a nurse one day, she said, "Shall I
take you to the spinal ward, then?"

1472
01:19:11,327 --> 01:19:15,057
You know? In a way, that sobered me up
and made me thankful...

1473
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:19,326
and in another way, I was annoyed that
she's not honoring the place that I'm in.

1474
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:23,597
I never thought I'd want to rush back
from Ireland to have head surgery...

1475
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:27,208
but there's some reconstruction of my skull
that will have to be done next week.

1476
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:29,843
So now I've got another comparison...

1477
01:19:30,011 --> 01:19:32,912
of New York hospitals versus Irish ones,
so who knows what it's about?

1478
01:19:33,081 --> 01:19:35,777
But I think there's enormous
amounts of material there...

1479
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:39,044
that, once processed,
will be something.

1480
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,654
- You have everything you need?
- I think so.

1481
01:19:41,822 --> 01:19:44,120
Want to bring
the cards over, Marissa?

1482
01:19:52,032 --> 01:19:54,296
Hi. Come on over.

1483
01:19:54,468 --> 01:19:56,060
- Are you ushering?
- Yes.

1484
01:19:56,237 --> 01:19:57,966
Okay.

1485
01:19:58,138 --> 01:20:00,436
Does that mean
you get to watch the show?

1486
01:20:01,774 --> 01:20:06,438
Would you be interested
in being interviewed tonight?

1487
01:20:06,613 --> 01:20:08,877
Um, I'm not up to it tonight, no.

1488
01:20:09,048 --> 01:20:10,879
What's that? I can't hear you.
Come on over.

1489
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:14,110
No, actually, I'm not feeling
too great tonight, so -

1490
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:16,278
- You're what?
- I'm not feeling too great tonight.

1491
01:20:16,456 --> 01:20:18,617
- Oh, I know the feeling.
- How are you, by the way?

1492
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:21,123
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

1493
01:20:21,294 --> 01:20:23,694
I woke up and -
I actually woke up - I didn't sleep.

1494
01:20:23,863 --> 01:20:26,797
Oh, you didn't sleep.
I didn't last night either.

1495
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:28,796
No. I, uh -
It was one of those.

1496
01:20:28,967 --> 01:20:31,367
- Yeah? It's hard.
- How are you, by the way?

1497
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:34,767
Oh, so-so.
I'm coming along.

1498
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,602
- I had a few of those.
- Oh, you did?

1499
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:40,540
Accidents?
You had a few accidents?

1500
01:20:46,652 --> 01:20:49,620
I'm going onstage now.
Going backstage.

1501
01:20:50,755 --> 01:20:52,916
Are we going to watch?

1502
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:56,025
- Yeah. Where's Mom?
- Can I watch you?

1503
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:58,991
You can watch
from the audience.

1504
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:11,169
Many people asked me
about the crutches...

1505
01:21:11,342 --> 01:21:15,539
and some people had heard
about this, uh, accident -

1506
01:21:15,712 --> 01:21:19,239
which I hope that that's all it was,
was an accident.

1507
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,782
So I'd like to begin, if I could...

1508
01:21:21,952 --> 01:21:24,978
if you don't mind being an opener...

1509
01:21:25,155 --> 01:21:27,487
and you can come right up
this center stage here.

1510
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:31,420
And I'm not even going
to say your name...

1511
01:21:31,594 --> 01:21:34,586
'cause I know you want to be anonymous.

1512
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:37,892
There's one Irish nurse that stuck
with me in that St. James Hospital...

1513
01:21:38,068 --> 01:21:40,433
that I'll never forget
named Carmella.

1514
01:21:40,602 --> 01:21:43,730
Irish nurses stand for 12 hours.
I kept telling her to sit down.

1515
01:21:43,906 --> 01:21:46,466
She said, "We're trained
to stand for 12 hours at a time. "

1516
01:21:46,642 --> 01:21:49,270
She stands at attention
by my wheelchair, you know?

1517
01:21:49,445 --> 01:21:52,175
And I'm just going crazy
from just boredom...

1518
01:21:52,348 --> 01:21:55,112
and so I start to interview her,
and I said, "Carmella...

1519
01:21:55,284 --> 01:21:58,515
how do you -
Do you go to church?"

1520
01:21:58,687 --> 01:22:01,884
"Oh, no, no.
I'm not real keen on the Catholic Church. "

1521
01:22:02,057 --> 01:22:04,991
- "Why?"
- "With their stand on abortion and all. "

1522
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:07,650
And I said,
"Well, aren't you afraid of dying, then?

1523
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:10,024
Because you won't have the priest there
to do the Holy Communion...

1524
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:12,166
and if you're not going to Mass -"

1525
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:15,166
She said, "Ah, no.
I'm not afraid of death...

1526
01:22:15,336 --> 01:22:18,567
because the only sin
is hurtir someone...

1527
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,833
and I haven't done that. "

1528
01:22:21,009 --> 01:22:24,035
And I looked at her and I knew...

1529
01:22:24,212 --> 01:22:26,043
- she hadrt.
- Wow.

1530
01:22:26,214 --> 01:22:29,376
- And it was startling. Startling.
- Wow.

1531
01:22:29,549 --> 01:22:33,485
- 'Cause I sure couldn't do it, couldn't
say - - What are you worried about?

1532
01:22:33,653 --> 01:22:37,214
The next accident, because I -

1533
01:22:37,391 --> 01:22:40,224
Fuck it all!
I know this one isn't clearing the air.

1534
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:44,057
The next plane crash,
getting home from here.

1535
01:22:44,231 --> 01:22:47,428
When I was in Ireland, the first thing I
did when we were in that country home...

1536
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:49,865
was to climb this hill
to look out over...

1537
01:22:50,037 --> 01:22:54,473
the whole of the countryside
of Westmeath.

1538
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:58,872
And fields and fields and fields
and fields and farmyards -

1539
01:22:59,045 --> 01:23:01,036
"No water" was the first thing that -

1540
01:23:01,213 --> 01:23:03,340
- My eye went for that.
- For the water?

1541
01:23:03,516 --> 01:23:08,249
Yeah. Wherever I am, I'm setting up
myself by direction of water.

1542
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:13,381
So would you be able to help me
with this rooting issue?

1543
01:23:13,559 --> 01:23:15,424
What did you call it?

1544
01:23:15,594 --> 01:23:19,495
This issue of not feeling
you can stay in one place?

1545
01:23:19,664 --> 01:23:23,566
- Yeah.
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

1546
01:23:23,735 --> 01:23:26,033
I'm not sure
if it isn't a hopeless case.

1547
01:23:28,206 --> 01:23:31,642
We've been out here five years,
my family and I.

1548
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,574
- Kathie and the three children.
- How do you like it?

1549
01:23:34,746 --> 01:23:37,874
I have problems with it
in the winter.

1550
01:23:38,049 --> 01:23:40,949
Um, it's not New Age enough for me.

1551
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:46,747
I'm very attracted
to alternative therapies...

1552
01:23:46,924 --> 01:23:49,984
and-and diet...

1553
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,823
and I think I drink too much out here.

1554
01:23:53,997 --> 01:23:57,023
It's a drinking culture.
Either everyone drinks or no one drinks.

1555
01:23:57,201 --> 01:24:00,398
People say that it has to do with the sea -
the mother, the sea.

1556
01:24:00,571 --> 01:24:03,438
The sea is your mother.
You must know that one.

1557
01:24:03,607 --> 01:24:06,507
And that a way to get to the mother
is through inebriation.

1558
01:24:06,676 --> 01:24:08,871
I mean -

1559
01:24:09,045 --> 01:24:12,344
When I drink, I feel like
I'm coming closer to the mother.

1560
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:16,484
That-That old thing of when you're stuck
on the breast, that great -

1561
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:20,247
That, you know - that bliss.

1562
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:23,324
Do you have anything
you want to ask me?

1563
01:24:23,493 --> 01:24:27,327
Um, what are your thoughts
on the meaning of life?

1564
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,827
Well, now that you ask -

1565
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:40,340
I'm not -
Well, I don't believe in fate.

1566
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:45,739
I'm rather a chaos person.

1567
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,644
There's a series of interviews out...

1568
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:52,844
with different philosophers,
and it's called The Glorious Accident.

1569
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,250
Consciousness.
The definition of consciousness.

1570
01:24:55,422 --> 01:24:58,619
The Glorious Accident.
So that's kind of my take on life -

1571
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:01,260
"the glorious accident" -
although my accident was -

1572
01:25:01,428 --> 01:25:03,362
- Not too glorious.
- Yeah.

1573
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,624
Up until now,
I'd said that I've always felt...

1574
01:25:05,799 --> 01:25:08,165
that I was
an embracer of accidents...

1575
01:25:08,335 --> 01:25:10,496
'cause my life has been...

1576
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:13,071
serendipity and accident
and not a lot of planning.

1577
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:17,342
Thank you for coming.

1578
01:25:34,227 --> 01:25:37,355
I was always worried that my epitaph,
which I will never see, will read...

1579
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:39,930
"Spalding Gray,
who found a niche of talking -

1580
01:25:40,099 --> 01:25:42,658
making a living of talking about himself".

1581
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:46,736
And the dog is already howling
for the dead Spalding Gray.

1582
01:25:46,905 --> 01:25:50,773
And I would hope that it would say,
"Talking about himself...

1583
01:25:50,943 --> 01:25:54,037
and his loved ones
and people he's encountered...

1584
01:25:54,213 --> 01:25:56,738
in his travels. "

1585
01:25:56,915 --> 01:25:59,816
You know?
I mean, I am not Samuel Beckett.

1586
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:01,816
I'm not a navel-gazer.

1587
01:26:01,987 --> 01:26:04,285
Beckett's a great writer,
but I'm not a minimalist in that way.

1588
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:06,946
I'm talking about the world as I see it.

1589
01:26:18,436 --> 01:26:21,139
God, that's just wild.
It's like Chekhov.

1590
01:26:23,841 --> 01:26:26,742
It's become a great sound effect.

1591
01:26:29,513 --> 01:26:31,503
I'll think of that at night.

1592
01:26:34,517 --> 01:26:36,678
It's a lamentation.
