1
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,144
<i>Do you even care about your future?</i>

2
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,947
<i>I-- I mean...</i>

3
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,983
<i>...35 days absent.</i>

4
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,987
<i>There is no way we can pass you.</i>

5
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,489
<i>No way.</i>

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,626
Hey, Cisco, we are here for

7
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,429
the same thing every time.

8
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,765
<i>What are you doing with your time?</i>

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,801
Yeah, I...

10
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,236
Babe, I'm on my way home now.

11
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,304
<i>Did you hear what I just said?</i>

12
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,572
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

13
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,507
Alright, then look at me when I'm talkin' to you

14
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,177
and take your feet down off my desk.

15
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,214
Now, look, I know you don't care
about your diploma

16
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:26,485
<i>but you are close to finishing your trade.</i>

17
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,456
To be a mechanic. Bullshit.

18
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,325
<i>Better than being a bum.</i>

19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,296
<i>So what did you say were my choices, again?</i>

20
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:41,100
<i>Automotive technology.
Auto repair.</i>

21
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,935
Auto manufacturing.

22
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,003
Fuck my life.

23
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,338
- What?
- Hmm?

24
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,473
Huh?

25
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,508
I didn't say anything.

26
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,578
<i>Nursing... Culinary.</i>

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,379
Fucking kid's in front of the car.

28
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,381
<i>Finally passed all your classes.</i>

29
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,386
<i>That's some big deal.</i>

30
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,890
<i>You got one more year and you
will be a certified welder.</i>

31
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,093
Yay.

32
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,603
<i>You have to do something with your life, Cisco.</i>

33
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,740
<i>What are you good at?</i>

34
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,738
<i>Hey! Yo! Go home!</i>

35
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,606
Go the fuck home!

36
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,074
Get out of the street.

37
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,043
<i>Yo, get the fuck out of...</i>

38
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,148
What are you doing?
Put your mask back on, bro.

39
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,717
I can't breathe with this shit.

40
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,019
<i>Get that motherfucker out of there, bro.</i>

41
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,453
<i>Get that motherfucker out of there.
Let's go!</i>

42
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,289
<i>Junior, what the fuck, you can't drive.</i>

43
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,357
Shut the fuck up, Patty.
Shut the fuck up.

44
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,725
Get in the whip!
Get in the whip!

45
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,228
Come on, come on, come on.

46
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,701
You talking about gears?
It's a automatic, fool!

47
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,237
<i>Shut the fuck up, bro!</i>

48
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,772
This ain't no stick!
This ain't no stick!

49
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:27,940
That's a red light.
That's a red light.

50
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,142
Stop touching the steering wheel!

51
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:33,011
You're about to fucking kill us, man!

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,460
Yo!

53
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,828
This camera's dope.

54
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,264
But we could record our tricks on this.

55
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,766
Yo, come on, bro, I'm trying to get to the crib.

56
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,968
<i>Yo, Patty!</i>

57
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,470
<i>Uh...</i>

58
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,008
<i>Bro, that's the ugliest shit I've ever seen.</i>

59
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,877
Aw, hell no!

60
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,480
Yo, Junior, stop playin', man,

61
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,881
you a hater.

62
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,515
Yo, Cisco.

63
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,955
- Seventy-five.
- Seventy-five bucks?

64
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,224
Yo, take it or leave it, man.

65
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,493
This car's a 95, mint shape.

66
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,395
You can get like a stack for the body.

67
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,896
- Engine's full--
- Who is this fucking kid?

68
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,798
The car's old, it's busted.

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,067
You playing us, Abi Kadabi?

70
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,138
Yo, Cisco, man, who am I dealin' with?

71
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,840
You or your crew?

72
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,675
Come on, Hassan.

73
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,144
Yo, take it or leave it.

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,051
That's fucked up, dude.

75
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:49,454
Better car...
Better pay, boys.

76
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,794
On the real, Cisco

77
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,697
we can't keep doin' this shit for chump change.

78
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,232
It's better than nothin'.

79
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,570
But he smells funny.

80
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,373
<i>I don't care if he smells funny.</i>

81
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,509
<i>Your job is to make the customer happy.</i>

82
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,744
Baby, just don't do it on my bed.

83
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,113
I mean, how are you gonna be happy when...

84
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,349
I know, I know.

85
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,750
I know, baby.

86
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,062
What's up, Grandma?

87
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,036
Oh!

88
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,106
You buy groceries?

89
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,574
- You miss daddy?
- Hmm.

90
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,509
You miss daddy, hm?

91
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,514
Really?

92
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,316
School lunches?

93
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,664
- What's up, pops?
- Hey.

94
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,899
What's up, boy?

95
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,568
Mama left you some food on the stove.

96
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,509
And the welding masks, they comin' in next week.

97
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,177
Mm-hmm.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,095
<i>Oh, shit, not here, come on.</i>

99
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,498
Let's go this way. Alright.

100
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,700
Oh, shit. Oh!

101
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,137
<i>Hey, what's up, girl?</i>

102
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,788
<i>Three dollars, you could take
her home and keep her, huh?</i>

103
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,865
- What's up, slick?
- Whaddup?

104
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,239
You're gonna get fired.

105
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,842
Shit, I wish.
I hate this fucking job.

106
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,010
If I had young ones, I would have dang quit.

107
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,351
<i>You got pancakes and milk, but no syrup?</i>

108
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,620
How you gonna eat these dry-ass pancakes...

109
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,754
...with water?

110
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,426
Slide $7.50, man.

111
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,172
Want a bag?

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,448
Aye, Cisco the kid.

113
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,782
What's up?

114
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,418
Harry bush tits, whaddup?

115
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,053
Shit, man.

116
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,456
Just trying to get this bus fare.

117
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,996
Shit.

118
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,133
Appreciate you, bro.

119
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,535
Appreciate you.

120
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,706
Brent! Yo, Brent!

121
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,808
- Yo!
- Wassup, Brent.

122
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,478
- Bush tits, wassup?
- Oh, my man, wassup?

123
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,579
What the fuck is this?

124
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,748
- I got more though.
- A dollar?

125
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,724
<i>What's your name again?</i>

126
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,739
Aye, Cisco, get away from the window, man.

127
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,741
Get the fuck away from the window!

128
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,345
Every summer, they want
to while the fuck out, man.

129
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,147
Punk-ass bikers.

130
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,199
Bro.

131
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,541
I don't want to be a janitor.

132
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,711
Man, you don't got to do nothing.

133
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,448
Don't let anybody control you.

134
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,353
What?

135
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,455
My mom used to say that shit.

136
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,726
That's 'cause your mom was the shit.

137
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,361
<i>You know what we gotta do?</i>

138
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,496
Get sponsored this summer.

139
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,598
Start skating for money.

140
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
Dawg, that'd be sick.

141
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,204
I'm fucking tired of Cleveland.

142
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,605
<i>I'm tired of these long winters</i>

143
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,707
of skating in basements.

144
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,211
Man, I want to go somewhere with no rules.

145
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,713
We can chill, shred all day...

146
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,151
...like Cali.

147
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,286
Skate by the beach...

148
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,357
Design my own boards.

149
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,961
<i>Get two bad bitches pregnant.</i>

150
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,629
What?

151
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,304
<i>Hello. Hello!</i>

152
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,340
<i>Dude, I can hear you laughin'.</i>

153
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,941
<i>Give me my car back!</i>

154
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,610
<i>I'm gonna come find you fucking kids.</i>

155
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,819
<i>Can't catch me. Oh, okay.</i>

156
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,220
<i>I see you! I see you!</i>

157
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,755
Oh, my God.

158
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,397
<i>Be careful, this plate's hot.</i>

159
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,067
Come on, guys, stop.

160
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,703
Sit down and eat.
Eat fast, alright.

161
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,071
<i>You're running late.</i>

162
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,706
And you.

163
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,340
Just because you bought food
doesn't mean you can

164
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,710
turn this into a hotel, alright?

165
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,146
Thank you.

166
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:58,183
Does your Uncle even know you're here?

167
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,651
You know, he's not my Uncle.

168
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,921
Junior, come on,
you're gonna be late for school!

169
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,023
You know, it's the last day, right?

170
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,026
So?

171
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,532
Stacey, here, go wake up your brother.

172
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,533
Go.

173
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Why the shitty attitude?

174
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,843
Place is a prison.
It's whack.

175
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,778
Yeah, well, too bad, alright.

176
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,347
That's your school.
No, look at me.

177
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:33,118
I'm counting on you
to take care of Junior, alright?

178
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,486
He looks up to you.

179
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,588
<i>Aye, Stacey!</i>

180
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,557
Sit down and eat.

181
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,226
Get dressed.

182
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,629
I gotta go.

183
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,164
Don't forget your snacks, okay.

184
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,099
Alright, I'm running late.
Bye, guys.

185
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,467
Mom, I get no kiss?

186
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,469
You just make sure your sister goes to school.

187
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,476
It's gonna be sunny today.

188
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,212
Oh, shit!

189
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,446
Man, check this out.

190
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,818
Shit. Yo!

191
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,587
I don't know if we're just allowed
to be walking through here, bro.

192
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,088
This has gotta be private property.

193
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,957
Boobie, stop being a bitch.

194
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,526
Damn, bro, this shit is weird!

195
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,875
<i>Alright, let's go, pussies.</i>

196
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,244
<i>What you got, C?</i>

197
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:39,978
<i>Uh!</i>

198
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,950
<i>Whoo! Whoo!</i>

199
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,019
<i>Fucking C, bro!</i>

200
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,989
<i>Cisco's killin' 'em on the fuckin' low.</i>

201
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,806
This is suicide.

202
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,975
Hey, you wanna get sponsored, right?

203
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,978
Cisco, bro! I'm rolling!

204
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,195
Cisco, you're insane, bro!

205
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,464
Good!

206
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,601
- Guys, I totally got that--
- Oh, shit! Cops! Cops!

207
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,136
Hey! Hey!
Hey, don't-don't move!

208
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,137
<i>Hey!</i>

209
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,374
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

210
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,376
<i>Get off me!
Hey! What the fuck?</i>

211
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,086
Yo, is that Brent?

212
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,355
Yeah.

213
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,490
<i>Thought he dropped out.</i>

214
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,825
<i>What you want my real name for?</i>

215
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,027
Just call me Patty cake.

216
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,844
We gotta make some money.

217
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,612
Well, you can help Hassan with a better car.

218
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,115
Man, fuck Hassan.

219
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,751
You got a better idea?

220
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,820
There's gotta be something, you know.

221
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,421
You can get a job at McDonald's.

222
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,590
But you can't get no bitches
smelling like French fries.

223
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,426
Hmm, pull some fat bitches.

224
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,761
<i>I know where the cafeteria is.</i>

225
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,429
I can walk me. Yo!

226
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,398
Hey, what's up? Thank you.

227
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,034
Yo, his mom's gonna be so pissed at you.

228
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,902
That ain't my fault.

229
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:45,937
What's going on, bro?

230
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,405
Yo...
It's good, bro.

231
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,241
They didn't confiscate that shit?

232
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,010
Guys, they didn't even frisk me.

233
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,778
But they gave me a big ass ticket though.

234
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,213
My mom's gonna be pissed.

235
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,015
She's a fine ass.

236
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,549
Dawg, that's my mom.

237
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,485
Yo, a list of all the skate comps this summer.

238
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,986
<i>Yeah, I mean, it's only a couple of 'em.</i>

239
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,621
Of course, we're in Cleveland.

240
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,989
So what we're in Cleveland?

241
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,924
We show up and get buck like we always do.

242
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,093
Still gotta pay those entry fees.

243
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,295
Decks. Trucks.

244
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,297
That shit ain't free.

245
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,708
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.
Uh, can I take you order?

246
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,844
- Oh, shit! No, no, no!
- <i>No! Oh!</i>

247
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,646
- <i>Boys!
- Yo, don't get none in my apple sauce.</i>

248
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,682
- <i>Boys! Settle down!</i>
- We're good.

249
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,929
Bitches...

250
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,631
Little bitches.

251
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,636
You best get out of the way.

252
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,480
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

253
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,848
<i>You want to die?</i>

254
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,616
Hey, get out of the way.

255
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,987
You wanna play, motherfuckers.

256
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,255
You wanna play?

257
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,798
You trying to fuck with me?

258
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,936
You tryin' to fuck with me.

259
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,342
Let's go, bro.

260
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,812
<i>Let's go!</i>

261
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,157
<i>Fuck, man!
That is the last time I'm doin' this shit, bro.</i>

262
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,959
- <i>We almost died back there.</i>
- <i>Yeah, but you didn't.</i>

263
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,727
<i>It doesn't matter, bro.
I could have.</i>

264
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,762
<i>Yo, shut the fuck up, man.
Chill the fuck out!</i>

265
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,698
- <i>Shut up, strip the car.</i>
- <i>Dumbass.</i>

266
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,967
<i>Yo, shut the fuck up, get the back seat.</i>

267
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,776
Yo, what's up, bro?

268
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,849
- What is that?
- They look like my <i>abuelita's</i> heart pills.

269
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,951
Heart pills in the back of a trunk?

270
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,386
Nah.

271
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,191
Oh, this is Molly.

272
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,792
Shit.

273
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,129
Yo, what the fuck, bro?

274
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,230
Yo, you crazy?

275
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,332
<i>Yo, you guys done?</i>

276
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,067
- <i>Put that shit back.</i>
- <i>Bro, think about it.</i>

277
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,703
<i>We could sell these.
It's just like ecstasy.</i>

278
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,473
- <i>You're crazy, bro.</i>
- <i>We can't just leave it here.</i>

279
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,009
- Bro--
- Knock it off, man.

280
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,712
<i>Yo, what the hell is taking so long?</i>

281
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,389
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

282
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,664
School called.
She ain't havin' it.

283
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,701
Man, what you gonna do with that shit?

284
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,971
Patty cake's right, that's Molly.

285
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,306
It's not a joke.

286
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,979
Hey, you heard?

287
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,556
Whoa!

288
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,291
They're goin' crazy!

289
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,693
They're screamin' his name.

290
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,695
Oh, Cisco!

291
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,498
Cisco! Cisco!

292
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,433
Another one?

293
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,039
I...

294
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,810
I've been meaning to call you.

295
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,845
Is that so?

296
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,848
Listen, Momma.

297
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,989
I picked up the pills from the car.

298
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,391
Then there were these skaters.

299
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,833
<i>Gracias.</i>

300
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,306
What's with the kid?

301
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,042
His name's Elliot.

302
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,845
He's picking up your slack.

303
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,181
Now, look, I need you

304
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,783
to find out who took your car

305
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,253
and who the fuck has my pills.

306
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,470
- Magic wash.
- Hmm.

307
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:33,971
Open it.

308
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,112
It's pure MDMA.

309
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,615
- So this what they stole?
- Basically.

310
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,585
I had it ground down and put in capsules, but...

311
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,687
...this is the last shipment for a while.

312
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,055
So...

313
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,191
Who the connect?

314
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,161
That's not any of your concern.

315
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,729
So, I see you trust this Nigga chino

316
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,398
but you don't trust me.

317
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,901
And he the one who need to be handled.

318
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,202
Oh, yeah, like you dealt with that crew

319
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,137
on the West Side the other night?

320
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,672
Claimin' territory.

321
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,140
Listen, baby.

322
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,044
You're just a dealer on a bike.

323
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,382
When chino finds his car
and traces down our pills...

324
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,720
...we collect.

325
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,523
Until then, try making less noise.

326
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,425
Fuck that shit.

327
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,428
We need to send a message.

328
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,932
Okay.

329
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,503
Look in the glove compartment.

330
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,577
I don't see nothin' in here.

331
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,913
This is how you send a message.

332
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,994
Now...

333
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,733
...I have some food for you
to take home for your mother.

334
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,635
Tell her if she needs anything

335
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,438
to come to my market stand at 25th street.

336
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,541
This is for the wait.

337
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:42,733
Ting.

338
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,871
Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting,
ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.

339
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,777
Look who decided to come home.

340
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,147
Cisco, welcome home.

341
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,017
<i>Hungry?</i>

342
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,153
<i>No, no, no, you're the fuckin' bank.</i>

343
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,022
<i>You guys can extend for as long as you want.</i>

344
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,890
<i>I-- I just need one more month.</i>

345
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,158
Right for as long...

346
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
No...

347
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,262
Okay, thank you very much, miss, thank you.

348
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,331
Fuck off! Fuck you!

349
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,867
<i>Fuck sake! Fuck me.</i>

350
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,469
Holy shit, Cisco, I forgot.

351
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,770
Look what I've invested in, look at this.

352
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,205
<i>Look what I invested in.</i>

353
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,874
This is one of those signs
that you twirl on the corner.

354
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,777
Ooh, that's like those signs that they have

355
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,912
down at the, uh...

356
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,085
...tax places.

357
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,488
Tax places!
You're right, T.

358
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,289
That's exactly right.

359
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,392
So, Cisco.

360
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,594
I was thinkin' maybe
you and Junior can, you know

361
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:46,563
like, stand outside and you
know, they-- they-- they

362
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,765
twirl the...

363
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,099
You paying?

364
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,469
Yeah.

365
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,805
For the roof above your head.

366
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,774
This place here is keepin' us alive.

367
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,676
Keeping you alive.

368
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,511
I'm all you got.

369
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,079
Don't forget that.

370
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,947
And I promised your mama
I would take care of you.

371
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,449
Don't.

372
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:07,451
Don't talk about my mom.

373
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,158
Yup.

374
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,428
Fuck!

375
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,098
What the fuck are you fuckin' doing?

376
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,933
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Where'd you get that shit?</i>

377
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,334
<i>Out of my fuckin' purse!</i>

378
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,770
- <i>You're fuckin' AA.</i>
- Oh, I'm not in AA.

379
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,906
<i>I can't see that shit.
Tryin' to stay fuckin' clean.</i>

380
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:31,375
- Cisco!
- <i>Fuck you and stop fuckin' spittin' on me.</i>

381
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,210
- Fuckin' junkie.
- <i>Cisco, let's go, bro.</i>

382
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,046
Junior, stop poundin' on the...

383
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,015
You're gonna fuckin' break it.
What's up, T?

384
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,616
They servin' 'em nasty ass hotdogs?

385
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,218
Why did you do that?

386
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,020
Wipe this fuckin' down!

387
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,994
Bro, this shit look live.

388
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,296
Name and sponsor?

389
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,298
Uh, Boobie.

390
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,734
But, umm, I'm not sponsored.

391
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,469
You have the registration fee?

392
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,938
- Uh, yeah. How much?
- $150.

393
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,073
Each? Fuck, dude.

394
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,476
We don't have $150 each.

395
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:06,910
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

396
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,112
This is some bullshit.

397
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,246
<i>Name and sponsor?</i>

398
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,581
<i>Hey, we got to skate.</i>

399
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,949
<i>There's a whole bunch of sponsors just watching.</i>

400
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:14,051
I ain't skatin' outside the comp like a bum.

401
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,687
If you guys want, there's
an after-party at Skatopia.

402
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,556
<i>I have extra wristbands.</i>

403
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,041
- Damn!
- Watch out, bro.

404
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,010
Hey, what the fuck, Patty!

405
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,250
Oh, shit.

406
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,519
Bro, let's get in!

407
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,349
Yo!

408
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,702
Yo!

409
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,471
Yo!

410
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,673
Molly?

411
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,170
Molly?

412
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,913
You made all of this tonight?

413
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:23,947
Yup!

414
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,184
Oh, I don't know how to deal but

415
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm in, bro, man.

416
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:34,858
I mean, what?
I'm with this shit, no question.

417
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,226
<i>Come on, Boobie, don't fuck us, man.</i>

418
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,095
<i>You know, it's all or nothing.</i>

419
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,097
What if these dudes come back
looking for this stuff, bro?

420
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,799
- Then we stop.
- And the police?

421
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,735
Bro, they didn't even frisk
Junior when he got caught.

422
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,671
Remember?
Come on, man, it's our dream.

423
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:50,641
To skateboard, bro.
Not be drug dealers.

424
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:52,976
Bro, we're already working cars.

425
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,478
Everybody is doing something to get ahead.

426
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,879
That's true, bro.

427
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,781
I don't know one person who hasn't dealt

428
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,783
something shady to get what they want.

429
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,856
We can even help our families.

430
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,262
We sell enough until we get
into these competitions.

431
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,798
And that's it, we stop?

432
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,133
That's it.

433
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,741
<i>Come on, B.</i>

434
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,047
No?

435
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,282
- Fuck you, guys.
- What?

436
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,784
Chino, chino, got it.
Come on, bro.

437
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,285
- I never tried Molly. Hey!
- What?

438
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,586
I've never fucking tried Molly.

439
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,455
If we traffic this shit, let's take it.

440
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,959
Hey, what are y'all dealing now?

441
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,260
We're not dealers, man.

442
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:20,297
Come on, bro.
You came to see me.

443
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:23,900
At my crib, on my day off.

444
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,702
<i>Don't keep secrets.</i>

445
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,575
Now, that's good quality.

446
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:32,909
How do you know?

447
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,846
You see the powder on the inside of the capsule?

448
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,347
That means it's pure.

449
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,083
And then this...

450
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,120
- <i>What?</i>
- Hey, yo!

451
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,256
- What?
- This is Momma's shit.

452
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:50,093
- Your mom's?
- No, man. This pill.

453
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,696
Belongs to Momma.
Crazy ass lady.

454
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,464
Been running game here for years.

455
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,799
She's not a joke.

456
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,735
Momma.

457
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,109
Tell us more about the pill.

458
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,113
<i>Well, first of all, you can't
be dealing it out of your</i>

459
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,448
<i>dirty ass hands.</i>

460
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,250
<i>You need to find something to package it in.</i>

461
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:16,319
<i>Something small, something you
can get rid of if you need to.</i>

462
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,794
I mean, I know y'all's
breath stink, but goddamn.

463
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,898
Yo, this gonna take a minute.

464
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,333
There's at least 7000 pills in that bitch.

465
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,235
<i>Then you gotta label the shit.</i>

466
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,106
<i>People gotta know it's yours.
So you need a signature.</i>

467
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,274
<i>You need a logo.</i>

468
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:40,210
I just cannot draw.
That one's garbage.

469
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:42,679
We ain't gonna throw away pills
because they don't look right.

470
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,914
Bro, this one is trash, bro.

471
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,449
You're not drawing the Crescent right.

472
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,317
<i>Now it's a party drug.</i>

473
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,087
<i>Night clubs, raves, wherever
people are having a good time</i>

474
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,354
<i>you be there.</i>

475
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,690
Anybody seen my friend, Molly?

476
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,460
She's small, she's white, she's very cute.

477
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,675
<i>Ah, that's the new pieces.
You see what's up?</i>

478
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,611
- Oh, LeBron.
- Oh!

479
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,314
Damn, Uncle Steve.
This makes me wanna slap my Momma.

480
00:36:57,316 --> 00:37:01,918
Patty cake, sit your ass
down, off the fucking counter.

481
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,421
Somebody's gotta fucking clean
this place up all the time.

482
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,223
Sit down, fool.

483
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,011
Leave the sign alone.
Put it down.

484
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,182
<i>What are we looking at right now?</i>

485
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:34,918
- Uh-huh. Hey, bird.
- <i>Yo!</i>

486
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,686
<i>Money, what's up?</i>

487
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,855
- <i>Money, bro.</i>
- <i>You gotta be kidding.</i>

488
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,257
<i>Money, bro.</i>

489
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:43,093
- Twenty...
- One. One.

490
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,662
- Twenty one.
- Twenty one, dollars.

491
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,112
<i>Yo, my man. We're about to close.
You gotta go.</i>

492
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,117
Where's the rest of it?

493
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,152
I don't know, brother.

494
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,687
We get junk from everywhere.

495
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,292
Where's my car, motherfucker?
Where is it?

496
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,093
I don't know what you're talking about, man.

497
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,395
<i>Chino!</i>

498
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,365
What's up, man? What's this?

499
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,303
You found your car?

500
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,574
- What the fuck you doing here?
- I was sent.

501
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,443
To check in on you, bro.

502
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,145
Why would she send you and your little bitch ass

503
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,913
tricycle crew?

504
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,418
Stay in line before I fuck you up.

505
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,823
<i>Cuidado.</i>

506
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,172
Alright, chino.

507
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,842
Let's go.

508
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,750
Here you go, enjoy!

509
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:54,090
Hey, hey, hey, I got dogs on the grill.

510
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,625
How many you want?

511
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,541
Check this out.

512
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:15,311
Two years, clean and sober, baby.

513
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,180
Bam!

514
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,918
It's actually, uh, 382 days,
14 hours, 16 minutes

515
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,421
but who's counting, right?

516
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:26,990
I feel, I feel good.
You know, I-- I feel better.

517
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:31,361
I do, I, uh...
It's a little win, I know

518
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:35,398
but lord knows I need it.
We, we need it.

519
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,066
You know, I've been thinking...

520
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,603
I think I know how to improve our business.

521
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,207
I told you, I don't wanna,
I don't wanna work here.

522
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,809
No, no, I know, I know, you've said it before.

523
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,144
And I...
Hurts a little bit, but I get it.

524
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:51,247
It's a fucking diner,
and you're doing so good now

525
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,715
with your skating and stuff.

526
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,187
So I want in.
Team Uncle Steve.

527
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,355
What?

528
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,358
What, y-- you, you're skating.

529
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,528
I was thinking, that, that,
my business can sponsor you.

530
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,931
You know, at those, uh,
those contests that you do.

531
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,500
And when you win an award,
well, we can split the money.

532
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,268
<i>I mean, I need the money.</i>
There's no money.

533
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,907
You think I'm blind?

534
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,579
Come on, we gotta help each other.

535
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:26,316
Okay, I'm-- I'm, I want it to
be like it was before. I do--

536
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,484
Stop.

537
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,120
What?

538
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,091
<i>You were too young, that's it.</i>

539
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,527
You were too young.
You're, you are, you were.

540
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,963
You don't remember what I did for you.
All the shit that I--

541
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,598
You know, my mom fucking odd 'cause of you.

542
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:47,403
Stop talking like that.
Can't talk that way to me.

543
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,169
<i>Oh...</i>

544
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,577
It's okay.

545
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,848
What you makin' all that noise for, huh?

546
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,239
It's okay.

547
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,178
It's okay, baby.

548
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,682
It's okay.

549
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,552
It's okay.

550
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,424
Baby, it's okay, baby.

551
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,861
It's okay, baby.

552
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,611
Hey, Cisco.

553
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,616
Oh, shit, are you okay?

554
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,517
Come inside, let me clean that up for you.

555
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,088
Ow! Ow, Stace.

556
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,856
Stop being a big baby.

557
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,898
What happened?

558
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,610
No, no, no, no, no.

559
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,812
If I gotta eat it, you gotta eat it.

560
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,750
Ma, can we have some pizza?

561
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:15,852
No.

562
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:17,720
I'll buy it.

563
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,188
Cisco, I'm not buying pizza.

564
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,924
No, just take it.

565
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,465
Where's this money coming from?

566
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,334
Hmm?

567
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:34,303
I mean, I see the skateboards, the clothes.

568
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:35,772
The food? I mean...

569
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:37,674
We've got jobs.

570
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:39,409
Jobs?

571
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:40,810
Yeah, at the diner, you know.

572
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,480
Twirling the sign on the corner and stuff.

573
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,226
No trouble?

574
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,796
No trouble.

575
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,208
Junior, Junior, Junior!

576
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,277
Mommy, Mommy. Junior.

577
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:15,978
- Boo!
- Aah!

578
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,881
<i>Junior, are you kidding me?
You stop or I beat your ass.</i>

579
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:19,982
- Okay.
- Come here.

580
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:22,085
<i>I'm sorry, Ma, okay, okay.</i>

581
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,054
Go apologize to her.

582
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,857
Ma!

583
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,258
No, I don't.
You can't play that game.

584
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,993
- I got him.
- You can't play that game.

585
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,228
<i>Get him, Stacey. Get him!</i>

586
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,501
Here, oh, you're gonna like these.

587
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,703
They are sweet.

588
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:43,740
Oh, he's getting so big, Drey.
Can I?

589
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:45,641
Oh, no, he's sleeping.
No, no, no, that's okay.

590
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,510
Oh, the sleepy face.

591
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:52,081
- You got any kids?
- I have many but none of my own.

592
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,885
- Hey. I found him.
- Speaking of the devil.

593
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,155
Uh, Karen, could you come in and
give them anything they want.

594
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,894
What are you doing here?

595
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:07,930
Chino car.
I found it in the chop shop.

596
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,733
Car? Can't you fucking follow directions?

597
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,468
Look, man, I got the dealer out back.

598
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,936
You want to find your pills or what?

599
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,008
Come on.

600
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,017
<i>He didn't wanna talk.</i>

601
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,187
Did you let him talk?

602
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,625
He looks fucking dead.

603
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,695
And then you bring him to my stand?

604
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,853
You've no idea where the car... came from?

605
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,888
No.

606
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,191
Kids got it before I put it on the lot.

607
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,864
Who are these kids?

608
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,734
I only know one of them.

609
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:22,171
Cisco.
He rides a skateboard with his crew.

610
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,441
Cisco.

611
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,879
Any idea where I can find him?

612
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:32,615
I don't know.
Fuckin' Google him.

613
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:45,228
Look, I told the other guy
I'll pay him back in full.

614
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,662
Whatever the cost.

615
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:52,568
- Other guy?
- Yeah.

616
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:57,073
You know, some Spanish dude.
He came to my lot too.

617
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,989
So how'd you find this guy?

618
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,324
I heard he was stripping people for parts.

619
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,727
Yeah. From who?

620
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,163
People.

621
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,372
Okay, well...

622
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,276
You can keep your eye out for this kid, Cisco.

623
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,457
Brought your stuff?

624
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,585
Hell, no. It's no way.

625
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,121
Come on, bro. Just do it.

626
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,023
This runway is way too bumpy, yo.

627
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,925
See, you're being a bitch, honestly.

628
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,460
Yo, Cisco.

629
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,664
Make sure you call him.

630
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,167
What's up, you good?

631
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:10,339
- Where's he going?
- Business.

632
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,975
<i>Yo, we not goin' to finish the tape?</i>

633
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,211
Now, where is he going?

634
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:16,946
<i>Bro, honestly, I feel like
we should be finishing</i>

635
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:18,381
<i>our tape instead of shooting--</i>

636
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:19,815
Bro, stop bitching.

637
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:22,451
We gonna get that shit.
Don't trip. We out here.

638
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:23,619
Look, we got a penthouse--

639
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,821
Hopefully, there are some bitches in here.

640
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,524
Dawg, don't be calling bitches, bitches, dude.

641
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,426
That's just rude as hell.

642
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,461
Alright, whatever, bro.

643
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,433
Yeah?

644
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,503
Seriously, you're the one...

645
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,306
Wow, come in.

646
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,676
Yeah, Babykin.

647
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,412
I see you, darlin'.

648
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,185
Bad choice, red lights.
That thing.

649
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,455
Oh, we're about to get fucked up.

650
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:02,658
No one's gonna lie.
What's up with y'all?

651
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,061
Okay, alright.
That's some classy shit.

652
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:17,273
What's up?
Is that leather, that dress?

653
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,676
Alright, I've got 150.

654
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,812
200.

655
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:25,881
What?
I'm not giving you anything more than 150.

656
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:27,917
Two hundred, take it or leave it.

657
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,169
Nice view, right?

658
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:23,572
Fucking better be.
I work my ass off for it.

659
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,778
Bro, you can see my crib
from here, I'm not gonna lie.

660
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,480
This spot is crazy.
No one's gonna lie.

661
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,450
This spot is stupid, these windows.
What?

662
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:36,385
You ever got a chick right here, like, naked?

663
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:38,521
You know what I'm saying,
and get complaints and like

664
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:40,990
"yeah, naked bitch is at the crib
or some shit like that, you know?"

665
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,391
Like these bamboo sticks.

666
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:45,327
Great interpretation of
what that shit would look like.

667
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,829
- Be careful with my bamboo, man.
- Who got...

668
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:49,131
Who got, who got shit like this in their crib?

669
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:50,699
It's like only baller motherfuckers.

670
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,868
You gotta fill their crib with just stupid shit.

671
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,203
That's what it is, right?

672
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,704
<i>Yo, Junior.</i>

673
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:58,340
Bro, you gotta come try this
shit she just put me on to.

674
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,544
<i>Molly water,</i> Nigga. Come on.
I'm chattin' up my homeboy.

675
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,078
Eh, eh, eh, Nigga, what's up, wait.

676
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,914
I ain't gonna try that?
What?

677
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,651
Let me get that last little sip, fuck.

678
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,620
Bro, I'm fucked up!

679
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,257
<i>Look at this joker right here, bro.</i>

680
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,993
You shouldn't have swigged the entire thing.

681
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,029
I'm telling you right now, although my shit...

682
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,730
I'm fucking high, bro.

683
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,733
Where's the bathroom in this piece of junk?
I gotta take a piss.

684
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:29,972
Bro, what are you doing?

685
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,643
What y'all doing?

686
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,713
No, get off.

687
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,586
What's going on?

688
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,025
<i>We gotta go, bro.</i>

689
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,161
I'm out.
Yo, I'm done.

690
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:53,262
I mean, the pills are almost gone.

691
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,497
Let's, let's just finish what we started.

692
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,266
Hell yeah.

693
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:59,935
Making money.
I can't get enough of this shit.

694
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:03,038
We eating.
We're fucking bosses, yo.

695
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,940
That back there was not cool, bro.

696
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,442
That's 100.

697
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:08,377
Let's just sell it all at once.

698
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:09,445
<i>How?</i>

699
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,514
Brent.

700
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,049
We'll sell it to Brent and his crew.

701
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,452
Y'all can do that shit.

702
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:18,520
Leave me out of it, bro.
I'm done.

703
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:21,123
Bro, I'm doing this for you,
so that you could skate.

704
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,959
Matter of fact, you should be
thanking me for those shoes.

705
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,828
And that board.
Cisco.

706
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,230
Man, I'm just saying, man.
We got something here. It's our time.

707
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:29,898
We can, we can get out.

708
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,934
And go where, Cisco?

709
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,602
You're really starting to trip, man.

710
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,038
I see it, you could too if you
stop acting like a little bitch.

711
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,339
<i>Yo!</i>

712
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,944
- What?
- Chill, man.

713
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,380
Goddamn.

714
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,320
What we really need right now

715
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:54,423
is a fucking car.

716
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:56,859
'Cause this bus is not about to come, y'all.

717
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,897
- Oh, what a dick.
- What?

718
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,566
He cut the service.

719
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,205
Shit.

720
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,675
Yo, let's be out.

721
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,319
- Oh.
- What's up, pops?

722
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:58,387
What up, boy?

723
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:00,155
So, Mom wanted me to come down?

724
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,958
Yeah.
How y'all boys doin'?

725
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,928
- Chillin', old man.
- Alright.

726
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,764
Here. Give it to your mama
for the rent. Alright.

727
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:10,032
Tell her I'm gonna be home late tonight.

728
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,034
Got some overtime.
Alright.

729
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,672
Boy, you ain't, you ain't got no clothes.

730
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:18,807
I'm representing Puerto Rico.

731
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,009
What, what are you doing?
What?

732
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,379
Oh, the festival.
That's the one.

733
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,715
Hey, here's $10.
Get yourself some pop.

734
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:30,085
- No, pops, I'm good.
- Go on, take it. Get some pop.

735
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,954
<i>Buy that boy a shirt, do something.</i>

736
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,522
Take it. Go on.

737
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,361
Catch you at home.

738
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,579
Oh, I left it at the crib.
Well, come on.

739
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:31,713
Bro, that's your fault.

740
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:34,716
Oh, my God.
I saw a 20 in there like...

741
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:42,191
- What?
- You had enough?

742
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:45,160
- Bro, come on, I saw a five.
- No. No.

743
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,628
Where's your money?

744
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:51,333
I only got about three dollars.
I need...

745
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:54,002
Yo, I see Brent.
I'll be right back.

746
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,340
You got a five?
You're just being a dick.

747
00:57:58,342 --> 00:57:59,808
You got a five?

748
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,353
See what you're doing, man.

749
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,090
Where the fuck my pills at, Nigga?

750
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,993
Man, I told you I didn't take your pills.
Get the fuck off me.

751
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,430
Why the fuck you lyin' to me?

752
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:23,665
He part of your crew?

753
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,967
You ain't gonna say shit, huh?

754
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:27,402
Where the fuck is Cisco, huh?
He in your crew, Nigga?

755
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:29,538
I ain't got your shit.
Get the fuck off me.

756
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,044
You gotta keep moving, bro.

757
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,917
Yo, man.
I said, keep moving.

758
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,022
You ain't shit without your crew, pussy.

759
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,860
You gotta move, bro.
You gotta move.

760
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,797
You gotta move.
He's high.

761
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,146
...what would hurt you?

762
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,215
Nothing. Stop asking.

763
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,585
You good?

764
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:17,819
Yo, what's up?

765
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,189
What did Brent say?

766
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:25,360
It wasn't him.
Come on, let's go.

767
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,411
Where's he going anyway?

768
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:44,580
See, I almost threw up on the last ride.

769
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,750
Turquoise, what's up?

770
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,619
What's up?

771
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,287
Yo, what can I get for a dollar?

772
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,590
You can get the fuck outta my face.

773
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,560
Patty cake, get off the counter.
Get off the counter.

774
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:10,973
You good?

775
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,942
What's up?

776
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,567
<i>Hey, dude, I ain't gonna,
lie, that shit is tight.</i>

777
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,482
Good shit, fellas.

778
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,184
Good shit, man.

779
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:59,855
Hey, man, uh, what's that little
spin thing you did at the end?

780
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:01,990
- Frontside 180?
- Yeah, yeah.

781
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,892
Yeah, that shit was fly, man.
That was nice.

782
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,827
- I worked my ass off trying--
- Yeah, yeah.

783
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,729
Hey, man, hard work pays off, bro.

784
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:11,299
- Do we know you?
- Nah.

785
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,368
But your mans do.

786
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,972
Yeah, I remember you.

787
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,708
From the festival.

788
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,179
Cisco, right?

789
01:01:27,618 --> 01:01:29,317
Damn, Boobie.

790
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:32,320
It's like I've been sponsoring
you for a while, little Nigga.

791
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:34,890
You see this Nigga?
Fresh, ain't he?

792
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,193
<i>What's with this Nigga, bro.</i>

793
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,866
Y'all motherfuckers got somethin'

794
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,436
that don't belong to you.

795
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:49,504
Hand it over...

796
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,273
<i>...we ain't got no problem.</i>

797
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,975
We don't know what y'all talking about.

798
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:58,180
- I think you do.
- Yo, get the fuck off, man.

799
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:00,048
We out, we out, we out.

800
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,588
Man, let's go, come on.

801
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,190
Yeah.

802
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:09,825
Let's get these motherfuckers.

803
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,667
Yo, you knew about this and didn't tell us?

804
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:19,868
They're just trying to scare us, alright?

805
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:20,902
What the fuck you mean?

806
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,370
Those bikers ain't playing around.

807
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:25,373
- They're not gonna do shit.
- What do you mean "do shit?"

808
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,543
They're insane!
And I can't believe you didn't tell us.

809
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:31,313
This is it, Cisco. We in too deep.
You gotta give those pills back.

810
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:33,014
They saw our face already,
bro, it's too late for that.

811
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:35,150
No, it's not too late, 'cause we're
giving the fuckin' pills back.

812
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,918
Give 'em the pills back and the money we made?

813
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,620
Yeah, so fuckin' smart.
Let's do that.

814
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:39,988
Cisco, chill, man.

815
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,757
Man, this whole thing was
stupid from the beginning.

816
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,091
No, bro, I'm done with y'all.

817
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,226
I thought we was in this together.

818
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:45,927
Together?

819
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,096
Look at you, Nigga.
This shit is all going to your fuckin' head.

820
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,397
All you care about is yourself!

821
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:51,833
- Chill, bro.
- And? If I don't, who will?

822
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:53,535
Your miserable ass dad?

823
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:55,937
Yo! Yo, yo, yo!
Back off, Boobie!

824
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,739
No, Cisco, Cisco, we're fam, bro.

825
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,908
Fam? Fuck fam!

826
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,743
Hey, fuck you!

827
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,149
Let's go.

828
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,950
<i>Let's get off these streets.</i>

829
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,561
<i>Shit.</i>

830
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:37,779
I see you see!

831
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:05,607
<i>Happy fourth of July, Cleveland.</i>

832
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,776
<i>Make sure you got your swimsuit ready!</i>

833
01:04:07,778 --> 01:04:10,345
<i>Man, turn them grills on 'cause I wanna play.</i>

834
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,180
<i>And most importantly...</i>

835
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,349
<i>A whole lot of parties going down,</i>

836
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,318
<i>so make sure you hit us up, you know--</i>

837
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,688
- Oh, my fucking shit, Ma.
- Hey, your language.

838
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,623
Well, Ma, how you gonna come in like that?

839
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:25,427
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. <i>Estoy bien.</i>

840
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:29,497
<i>Bueno.</i>
I got the day off at work.

841
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:32,234
- So I wanna go see fireworks.
- Outside?

842
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:35,237
Yeah. Outside.

843
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,017
- Cisco the kid.
- Bush tits.

844
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,785
I got some work for you.

845
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,590
Nice. Nice and calm.

846
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:02,831
How can I help you?

847
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,733
By turning your air conditioner on.

848
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:07,669
You're cooking up your customers in here.

849
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:10,205
Nothing wrong with a little bit of heat.

850
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:13,375
Besides, the ac is sort of
out of commission right now.

851
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:15,076
What can I get you?
Menus.

852
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,078
Um...

853
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:21,449
I don't really see anything I can eat.

854
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:24,052
<i>Do you have any healthy options?</i>

855
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:26,221
Uh, why not just define healthy?

856
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:29,024
Oh, sorry, I didn't, I didn't
mean to be disrespectful.

857
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,927
- I have my own business too.
- Uh-oh, competition?

858
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,829
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

859
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:38,934
Not exactly.
I don't think we're even in the same race.

860
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:40,702
What's that mean?

861
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:43,438
Unless there's something else you're selling

862
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,473
that's not on the menu.

863
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:46,942
Like what?

864
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:52,280
- How about ice tea?
- Well, how about ice tea?

865
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,883
'Cause what's this is, made it myself.

866
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:58,620
It's chamomile, herbal essence, tofu.

867
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,992
Bro... Where we at?

868
01:06:03,994 --> 01:06:06,328
This is where it all goes down.

869
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,997
You're sure he's gonna cop
the whole thing, right?

870
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:14,502
Alright, playa, hold off here.

871
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:16,071
Don't move.

872
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:24,946
My old man said, "no more stove for me."

873
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:27,482
At least, he still gave you the diner.

874
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:30,618
Psst.

875
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,890
- Grandma's here.
- Okay.

876
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,663
She's gonna take you to see the fireworks.

877
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,698
<i>You're going to have so much fun.</i>

878
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,804
Go.

879
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:51,439
Go on, now.

880
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,710
Bye, honey.

881
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,897
Cute kid.

882
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,534
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

883
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:22,203
- Do you have any kids?
- Me? No.

884
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:25,607
I mean, I know it's hard to
understand how a fine specimen

885
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:30,011
such as myself didn't knock up a broad, but no.

886
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:32,781
Uh, it's just that, I know a kid.

887
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,650
Cisco.

888
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,154
I thought he was yours.

889
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,425
What kind of business did you say you are in?

890
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,272
Hey, ray?

891
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,511
Yo.

892
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,013
Guess he's not home.

893
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,785
- That's it?
- Yeah, he's not home.

894
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:11,920
Are you serious?

895
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:14,889
You brought me out here carrying this shit?

896
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,496
Let's say you were robbed

897
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:24,999
you love kids and you definitely
wouldn't want to harm anybody

898
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:28,436
but... It's business.

899
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:32,707
What, what, Cisco robbed you?
He stole from you?

900
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:35,443
Unless you're somehow tied to this mishap?

901
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:36,878
No, no, I know, I didn't steal anything.

902
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,147
But Cisco, yeah, you what, what...

903
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:42,450
He, what did he do?
He was by-- he stole from you?

904
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,886
Just... tell Cisco

905
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:46,020
and his little friends...

906
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:49,023
...I want what's mine.

907
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,861
Don't let your, your father

908
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,762
God rest his soul

909
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:57,632
regret leaving you this diner.

910
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,170
Listen to me

911
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:06,741
you ever go near Cisco or this diner again...

912
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,288
Happy fourth of July.

913
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,085
There go that Nigga right there.

914
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,820
- Shit.
- Come on, get him!

915
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:54,489
Come here.
Come here, motherfucker.

916
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:59,127
<i>Hold him up, hold him up.</i>

917
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:01,796
<i>Ooh.</i>

918
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,066
<i>Let me see this.</i>

919
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:44,839
Let's go. We good, we good.
Come on, let's go.

920
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,641
Get the fuck outta here.

921
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,241
Pops, I can--

922
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,221
I'm selling it to help us.

923
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:39,861
I just-- I don't want you to
have to take care of me, pops?

924
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,398
You think this helps me?

925
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:50,038
I shouldn't have to explain
to you how dangerous this is.

926
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,742
You're a grown man now.

927
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:59,647
Grown man who can make your own decisions.

928
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:06,754
But this, this leaves my house tonight.

929
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:12,460
And you better decide if you gonna go with them.

930
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,398
You alright?

931
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,613
I fucked up.

932
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,586
Yeah, you did.

933
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,030
Listen, bro, you're chillin'.

934
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,568
Your face fucked up, but you're chillin'.

935
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,798
Smile.

936
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,101
Hey, y'all's want pizza?
Ah!

937
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:36,237
<i>Yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go have pizza.</i>

938
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,672
- Hi.
- I want cheese, I want cheese.

939
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:15,343
- I want cheese, I want cheese.
- Ma?

940
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:19,113
Can I get a cheese pizza, half-peperoni?

941
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:20,848
Good looks, okay.

942
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,518
- Stacey--
- Hey! Sorry.

943
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,956
Careful.

944
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:27,648
<i>I got it.</i>

945
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,487
- Come on, guys, be careful.
- <i>Yep.</i>

946
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,858
Thank you.

947
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,264
You care to grab the pop?

948
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,110
- I got it.
- Yep.

949
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:02,850
- <i>Junior, Junior, Mommy!</i>
- Junior?

950
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:06,320
Junior, wake up. Junior.

951
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:08,122
Junior, stop teasing your sister.

952
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,124
Come on, get up.

953
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,493
Junior, get up.

954
01:17:12,495 --> 01:17:15,529
- Junior!
- Junior?

955
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,732
Junior, get up!

956
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:20,101
What happened?
What happened? What happened?

957
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:22,136
- I don't know.
- Junior, come on, wake up.

958
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,038
No, no, no.

959
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,041
Oh, my God. What is it? What...

960
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,044
No! No!

961
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,481
No, please, Junior, wake up, please.

962
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:34,982
Junior, please!

963
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,619
Cisco! Cisco, please!

964
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:40,221
<i>Cisco!</i>

965
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,623
I'm gonna put Stacey to bed.

966
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:52,893
- I got it.
- I can do it.

967
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,963
No, I got it, okay?
You can go home.

968
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,431
- Cisco, I said I got it.
- I-- I-- I can do it.

969
01:18:57,433 --> 01:19:01,869
Go, Cisco!
Get the fuck out of my house already!

970
01:19:01,871 --> 01:19:05,306
I don't need your help, okay? I
don't need you next to my family.

971
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:08,843
I don't need you around me. I don't need
your fucking help, Cisco. Now, get out!

972
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:10,845
<i>Mom.</i>

973
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,885
Where's my money?

974
01:20:57,887 --> 01:21:00,921
Where's my money?
You held out on me.

975
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,758
Where's my money, Steve?

976
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,462
You fucking stole it.
You brought us down, you did.

977
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:12,233
You brought us down.
The money is gone. It's gone.

978
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,935
Aah!

979
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,325
Here you go. Enjoy.

980
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,533
Hey, I'll be with you in just a second.

981
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,206
Okay, how can I help--

982
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:00,714
I didn't know if Uncle Steve
was gonna deliver my message.

983
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:02,516
You killed my friend?

984
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:07,888
Whoa.

985
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,058
I didn't kill anyone.

986
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,194
Those bikers work for you?

987
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,332
Shit.

988
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:25,005
Look, son, I didn't want anyone to get hurt.

989
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:27,074
I just wanted my pills.

990
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,477
So now what?

991
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:33,647
You're gonna shoot me

992
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:36,650
in front of all these witnesses?

993
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:38,585
You're smarter than that, Cisco.

994
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:43,223
You don't know me.

995
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:44,959
But I do.

996
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,597
I'll tell you what.

997
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,904
You need to stop thinking

998
01:22:56,906 --> 01:22:59,540
about your mistakes

999
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:04,611
and move on, hmm?

1000
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:07,247
No regrets in life.

1001
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:11,318
They're just... lessons that show you the way.

1002
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,688
Aim that thing here.

1003
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:19,593
Handle him before he comes
after everyone you know.

1004
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,765
<i>Hey, yo.</i>

1005
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:09,276
You know...

1006
01:29:09,278 --> 01:29:11,545
...you and your buddies still owe me money.

1007
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,299
Leave them out of this.

1008
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,117
Ride?

1009
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,308
<i>Did you brush your teeth?</i>

1010
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:02,409
Yes.

1011
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,077
Is that your final answer?

1012
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:05,278
Mm-hmm.

1013
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,546
I don't know.

1014
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:14,154
Did you brush your teeth?

1015
01:33:14,156 --> 01:33:16,156
Go, brush your teeth. Go.

1016
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:20,513
Alright, is everybody up
there? Guys, I'm rollin'.

1017
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:22,682
Alright. Hit it, Cisco.

1018
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:36,896
Alright, so we out here.

1019
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:40,066
We're deciding which-- which
roller-coasters to go to.

1020
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,901
Guys, which roller-coasters are we going in?

1021
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:45,638
We got that cool one over there.
We got this one over there

1022
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,207
<i>what y'all think?
Guys, what's up?</i>

1023
01:35:47,209 --> 01:35:49,008
- That one.
- <i>You want the big one.</i>

1024
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:02,388
<i>Bro, this feel like it would totally fuck you up</i>

1025
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:03,623
and I'm super down.

1026
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:04,891
<i>Post up.</i>

1027
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:18,238
<i>Tell me what you feel.</i>

1028
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,472
I don't wanna be on camera.

1029
01:36:19,474 --> 01:36:21,040
<i>Alright, I'll put it down here.</i>

1030
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,910
<i>I'm just tryin' to say what's up?
How you feelin'?</i>

1031
01:36:23,912 --> 01:36:26,646
No more cotton candy.

1032
01:36:34,022 --> 01:36:37,857
<i>Yeah, that tape is crazy bro.</i>

1033
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:40,560
<i>That looks like my father.</i>

1034
01:36:49,204 --> 01:36:50,436
<i>They're gonna kick us out of here, bro.</i>

1035
01:36:50,438 --> 01:36:51,805
<i>They'll kick us out of</i> here.

1036
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:03,683
<i>PC, let's go with yours.</i>

1037
01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:05,084
<i>Let me see it.
Okay, yeah, I'll rock with it.</i>

1038
01:37:05,086 --> 01:37:06,419
<i>Yo, genius.</i>

1039
01:37:06,421 --> 01:37:09,722
<i>What's up?
You want knee pads? For what?</i>

1040
01:37:09,724 --> 01:37:11,224
For your mom.
