1
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,945
See you later.

2
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,538
Excuse me. You know
where 42nd Street is?

3
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,499
Hey! What are
you doing?

4
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,711
Stop him,
he took my briefcase!

5
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,005
I got you,
don't worry about it!

6
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,264
Hold on a second, ma'am,
there, I'll get it.

7
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,349
Thank you.

8
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,601
Hey!

9
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,440
Hey, you're holding people up here!

10
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,483
How you doing today?

11
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,943
Not so good.

12
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,989
Through the
turnstile, please.

13
00:01:56,324 --> 00:02:00,953
Yo, we got it! Piano Man, Piano
Man. Billy Joel. Uptown Girl.

14
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:07,000
Hello, beautiful. Anybody selling
tickets to Piano Man? Box seats.

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,254
Piano Man!

16
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,341
Les Misérables, sir.
Les Misérables.

17
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,635
Come on. Billy Joel,
Uptown Girl.

18
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,303
Anybody selling ticket
for Piano Man?

19
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,429
Uptown Girl!

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,016
We Built This City on Rock and
Roll. You know that's it, come on.

21
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,185
Hey, Janet,
how you doing?

22
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,645
You okay today?

23
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,773
You be careful today,
there's cops everywhere.

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,526
Anybody selling
tickets for Piano Man?

25
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,364
IPods! Harry Potter books!

26
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,117
IPods, $20.

27
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,579
Uptown Girl. We Built This City
on Rock and Roll. You know...

28
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,206
How you doing, ma'am?
IPods, $20.

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,834
I like that oriental
jacket you got on.

30
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,002
That's $20 each, ma'am.

31
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,336
Two for $20!
No, no, you got...

32
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,462
That's $20 right
here, ma'am.

33
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,755
You got to give me
another $20.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,550
Ma'am, you got two
of them right there.

35
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,262
How you doing,
young lady?

36
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,930
How much is this
Harry Potter book?

37
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,934
$20. Kids love them things,
that Harry Potter stuff.

38
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,355
You got kids,
they gonna love that.

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,690
Yo, move your shit, man.
What's that?

40
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,858
IPods, $20!

41
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,318
Move your shit, man.
How much is your book?

42
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,569
I'm just trying to
make some money, man.

43
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,362
Harry Potter Versus
the Hipopotamus?

44
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,530
This is misspelled.

45
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,823
No, that's how
you spell it.

46
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,033
Where do you
put the tape?

47
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,243
No, it's not a Walkman,
it's an iPod, sir.

48
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,495
Move all this shit, man.
Move all this shit.

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,539
Excuse me, can I have
my money back?

50
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,209
I want my money back.

51
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,252
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

52
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,172
Get off me!
Get off me!

53
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,465
Come on, stop!

54
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,305
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,474
Drop this, man!

56
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,392
Get off me, I said!

57
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,438
Don't run, bitch!

58
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,984
Watch yourself!

59
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,361
Get off me, man!

60
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,114
Look, I'm sorry. I'm
not trying anything.

61
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,616
Grab that.
Grab that. Grab that.

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,285
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

63
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,414
Hey, what are you doing?
Just watch yourself.

64
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,540
Give me
back my money!

65
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,418
Somebody ought
to call the cops on you.

66
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,509
Walk this way, walk.

67
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,059
Pay your fare!

68
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,683
Hey, Mr. Sou.

69
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,560
How you doing, Mr. Sou?

70
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,645
Good? You know that
Radio Music Hall up there?

71
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,858
Man, I'll tell you, they
tried to kill me up there, man.

72
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,569
I bought some stuff
from downtown.

73
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,530
It was a fake book. I don't
even know how you do a fake book.

74
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,950
I'm gonna get some umbrellas
from you, is that okay?

75
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,997
Can I get some umbrellas from you? Yeah?

76
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,047
You said $100
last time, right?

77
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:26,218
I got in a fight, lost all my
money. This is all I got left.

78
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,678
Is that okay?

79
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,308
That's $100 right there. I
got one $20 left, all right?

80
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,353
Man, I had my stuff at
Radio City Music Hall.

81
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,771
I ain't gonna go down
there no more, though.

82
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,942
They're a bunch of crooks down
there. I'll see you later, Mr. Sou.

83
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,347
It's that kid from before,
Harvey. He's coming in here.

84
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,854
Can I help you?

85
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,149
Come on, look, I want
my money back, okay?

86
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,484
What money are you
talking about?

87
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,695
You know what I'm talking
about. Look, I don't mean no...

88
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,988
Come on.
He took it.

89
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,531
No, he did not... Okay,
I want it back right now.

90
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,199
He took your money? Okay.
Same shirt and everything.

91
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,868
This is Z and
as you can tell,

92
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,453
he's a little retarded
sometimes, okay?

93
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,163
Harvey.
Look, listen.

94
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,248
How much are we talking about
here? Don't give him shit.

95
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,876
No, no, listen. I've
got this. How much...

96
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,504
Hey, that's not nice.
That's not nice.

97
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,007
Here, thank you very much.

98
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,384
I should call the police on
you, you know? You should.

99
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,388
That's exactly what you should do.
I'll wait here for you if you want.

100
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,974
You know, you shouldn't be
robbing people, you know that?

101
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,309
And especially ones that
can come and find you.

102
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,394
Why don't you sit down and
talk to me for a second?

103
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,480
I just want to have
a conversation with you.

104
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,898
I was talking
about you earlier.

105
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,317
Look, try some of these bread
things, they're terrible.

106
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,485
You're going to
go after this kid?

107
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,654
Hey, wait up a second.
Where you going?

108
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,449
You know, that was some show
you put on out there today.

109
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,826
In the streets, you
know, the fisticuff thing.

110
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,828
Can I ask you one
question, though?

111
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,747
I'd much rather you
just stop following me.

112
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm not following you, I'm
walking down the street.

113
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,834
But look, if you
want to make money...

114
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,127
You know...

115
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,337
Sorry, buddy.

116
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,007
There ain't
no friends here.

117
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,677
Think sitting behind a desk,
sucking ass all day, is making money.

118
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,514
Look, I'm Harvey Boarden,
all right?

119
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,475
Let me introduce myself,
I'm Harvey Boarden.

120
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,104
Shawn MacArthur.

121
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,982
Good to meet you.
You like to fight?

122
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,568
If I have to.

123
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,279
I can make you $5,000.

124
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,200
Got you interested, huh?

125
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,910
You see that store
right there?

126
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,831
You ever wonder how little
places like that stay in business?

127
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,127
BMW parked in front of it.
People dressed nicely.

128
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,131
They like people
that like to fight.

129
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,134
You want to make
some money at it?

130
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,553
Huh?

131
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,012
Yes or no?

132
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,639
You don't want to make no
money, you don't have to go.

133
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,140
You can go on
with your life.

134
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,394
I can make $5,000 with
you on one fight alone.

135
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,980
You can stay there
and go home if you like

136
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,065
or you can come
and get $5,000.

137
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,233
Wait, hey.

138
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,235
You ain't got no place to
go, go where you're going.

139
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,320
You better give me $5,000
if I walk across the street.

140
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,865
Come on, break out
one of them umbrellas.

141
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,158
It ain't raining.

142
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,451
You're right.

143
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,665
You know these guys, you
ever seen these guys before?

144
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,085
I'm like an agent for them,
I get them talent and stuff.

145
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,878
Hey, Christopher,
Jack.

146
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,338
Hey, Harvey.

147
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,799
Hey, Claudette, Martinez.

148
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,593
Chinese guy
named Martinez.

149
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,760
What?

150
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,262
Go figure.

151
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,388
That guy was Chinese?

152
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,056
Yeah, his mother
or something.

153
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:04,102
But those guys, they run every
bet place in this whole city.

154
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,938
And that's what matters
'cause that's how you get paid.

155
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:11,651
Hey, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson.

156
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,112
Harvey, I have to thank you so
much for those Billy Joel tickets.

157
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,032
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.
You look lovely tonight, ma'am.

158
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,785
Did he do my favorite song,
the "Downtown Alexa" thing?

159
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,871
Okay. Hey!

160
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,414
What are you doing,
Harvey? No way.

161
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,291
No way. I gotta go to 38th
Street to get some juice.

162
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,751
It's about to rain.

163
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,462
Get in the car, drive.
Get in the car, Z.

164
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,965
I got an umbrella for you
anyway. Come on, get in.

165
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,676
Get rid of the box, you
don't need that anymore.

166
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,511
Where are we going?

167
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:43,475
We're in a $100,000 Mercedes.
That's where we're going.

168
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,561
Okay, so what
happened to the $5,000?

169
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,409
Hey, here's your boy.

170
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,535
Good morning.

171
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,703
Thanks for showing.

172
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,579
I got your text,
so here I am.

173
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,831
You need a soda or anything?

174
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,332
No, I'm cool.

175
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,795
Do me a favor. Go get me
a orange soda or something.

176
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,674
So what goes on here?

177
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,553
Well, we're going to get you an
opportunity. You want to fight, right?

178
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,304
I want to make money.

179
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,641
Okay, first thing, we got
to make you presentable.

180
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,602
Put this on. I don't
want to wear your jacket.

181
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,939
Presentation is everything. Come on.

182
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,067
It's about making money. I'm
going to give you an opportunity.

183
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,944
Real nice smile.

184
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,779
This thing
don't even fit me.

185
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,905
Where's my change?

186
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,282
It was $3.

187
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,993
You know, I can get that
for $1 across the street.

188
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,872
Yeah, and you could have gotten
it for 50 cents at the supermarket.

189
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,666
Comedians.

190
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,627
Come on.
I don't...

191
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,920
We're going to
make some money?

192
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,380
Yeah.

193
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,844
I feel stupid.

194
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,143
If they invite you over,
tell them you can fight,

195
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,436
'cause you can,
you know?

196
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,439
Better yet, don't even say nothing
to them, let me do the talking

197
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,941
and I'll take care
of everything.

198
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,111
Yo, Harvey,
you want a stove?

199
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,285
Hey, Christopher, you guys are
still doing the fight stuff, right?

200
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,955
I've got a guy right here.
Hey, Z, bring him over here!

201
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,792
This kid right here is
an incredible fighter.

202
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,876
Oh, yeah?

203
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,211
Jack. Jack.

204
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,672
Tell me, when was the last
time that you had a white guy

205
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,300
that looked like this
in one of your fights?

206
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,261
And you did college
and everything, right?

207
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,304
You went to college?

208
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,181
That is remarkable.

209
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,475
He's the real thing.

210
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,353
A white kid who went to
college, that's amazing.

211
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,021
How come I never
heard of you?

212
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,147
Well, he's from...

213
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,275
No offense, but I've
never heard of you either.

214
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,031
Look, I'm sorry, you know,
sometimes he's a wiseass.

215
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,409
But he's...
I'm not joking here.

216
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,913
I'll give him a peep.

217
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,543
Yeah,
I'll give him a peep.

218
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,504
White boy who
went to college.

219
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,426
Thanks, Jack.

220
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,391
Can I get my jacket back, please?

221
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,645
Why'd you go
talking to him?

222
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,189
He asked me a question.

223
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,317
You got to let me do the talking
from now on, okay? Please.

224
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,944
Okay.
Please.

225
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,363
You know, I'll beep you
if he calls me. Come on.

226
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,447
Beep me?

227
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,866
Well, I'll page you,
text you, whatever.

228
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,033
Where are y'all going?

229
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,119
What, you lonely,
you need a friend?

230
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,788
We got things to do.
We'll text you.

231
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:25,423
Now there's these junk stores and
these vendors and these big signs and

232
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,092
overhead construction
cranes and all this...

233
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,095
Lady! What are you
yelling about?

234
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,598
You know, they used to
sell drugs in that building.

235
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,099
Well, that's okay,
but now they've got

236
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,893
men riding elevators
to wash the windows...

237
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,437
Well, let them...
Move on, it's okay.

238
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,439
And you take your life in your
hands just crossing the street,

239
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,193
there's so much demolition
stuff all around. Look at it...

240
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,197
After you.

241
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,076
Hey, Giovanni, you got
a refrigerator in there?

242
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,536
Last one, baby,
get it while it's hot.

243
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,539
Baby, come and get one,
buy one, get one free.

244
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,752
Come on over.

245
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,712
They had money on you
not making it.

246
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,880
So this thing's
for real?

247
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,048
Yes, it's very real.
Very real.

248
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,132
$5,000?

249
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,801
Yes, but minus costs.

250
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,678
Hey, be careful with
those shoes there.

251
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,804
Minus what?

252
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,139
Costs. This is Alexander.

253
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,060
Ray, Alexander.
Ray, Shawn.

254
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,187
You roughed them up
the other day,

255
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,439
so they're gonna ride
in the front and drive

256
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,774
and you're going to be
in the back with me.

257
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,484
No, no, I'm driving,
this is my car.

258
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,611
And it's
a very nice car.

259
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,365
You know, if your boy
wants to go, we can go.

260
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,033
Wait a second.
Come on, man, look,

261
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:38,204
I wasn't interested in no trouble
with you, so you need to relax, okay?

262
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,790
Where's this
hostility coming from?

263
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,751
Text me again, and I swear
to God I'm gonna hurt you.

264
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,754
He keeps sending me these
stupid little things, you know.

265
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,091
Just costing me money.
Come on, Harvey.

266
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,718
Why am I sitting in the
car and it ain't moving?

267
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,179
Come on, these little texts
that you keep sending me

268
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,848
are costing me $1 a minute.

269
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,643
So, what, I'm going to fight
this guy, then what happens?

270
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,980
Well, we go in,
you win, you get $5,000.

271
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,356
You lose, you get nothing.

272
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,524
So we get
paid tonight?

273
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,734
Yes,
we will get paid.

274
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,527
You keep asking me
the same question.

275
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,737
All right, Harvey.

276
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,535
So what, they got rules or something?

277
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,038
They don't like scared,
okay. There's the church.

278
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,622
Yeah, if you kick him
in the nuts, you win.

279
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,793
Right.
There's Sydney up there.

280
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,420
Gouge the eyes,
everything.

281
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,880
Come on. Come on, Z.

282
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,214
This is Brooklyn, huh?

283
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,216
Yeah,
as you can see.

284
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,885
Hey, there, Sydney.
How you doing?

285
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,721
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're late.

286
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,726
We have to have this place cleaned
up by the morning, so hurry up.

287
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,935
Okay.

288
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,647
Excuse me.

289
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,317
Here you go, do what you got to do.

290
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,277
Excuse me.

291
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,071
Scratch, bite.

292
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,155
Thank you.

293
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,992
Yo, smells like farts and
ass in here, you smell that?

294
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,577
Smell like pure vodka.

295
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,997
The place is a
playground, but, like, bad.

296
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,209
Filled with bad people.

297
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,670
Fighter.

298
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,847
You ready?

299
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,809
Go make some money.

300
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,124
Hey, Jack.

301
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,418
Harvey, you running on
Caucasian people time, huh?

302
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,796
I'm running. I'm running.

303
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,339
You're running?
Yeah.

304
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,341
Yeah,
you keep running.

305
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,309
Na zdorovie, brother.

306
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,068
Let's see what
you got, Shawn!

307
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,778
Let's see it, Shawn!

308
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,576
Go, go, go, go!

309
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,717
Ow!

310
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,783
Yeah.

311
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,829
Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

312
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,290
Hey, come here.
It's over, it's over.

313
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,001
Come on, have a seat.
Don't smile at nobody.

314
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,587
Just sit down.
Watch yourselves.

315
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,967
You got some tissue in your
pocket? Anybody got tissue?

316
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,885
Give him some tissue.

317
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,597
He can fight, right?

318
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,640
On the water fountain.

319
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,225
Told you
he could fight.

320
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,561
So you both should come to the
club. He's going to need a jacket.

321
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,480
I got to get out of here.
Give him your jacket.

322
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,482
I can't stand Brooklyn.

323
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,360
You tell Jack I know
what I'm doing.

324
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,617
Yeah.

325
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,874
No, we're special guests of Mr. Dancing.

326
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,043
Could you just
see for me?

327
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,878
I'm telling you,
we're on the list.

328
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,923
Will you let Renee know
I'm on the list, please?

329
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,592
Let them through.
Two of you.

330
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,429
Now, come on, Harvey.
Harvey!

331
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,356
I feel like a bum.

332
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,484
No, you look great.

333
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,411
Cordell!
Cordell, Harvey Boarden.

334
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,082
We're VIP.
We're VIP. Hi.

335
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,251
We got VIP.

336
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,716
That's reserved for us. Right
here. They ain't gonna tell us.

337
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,969
Try to ink out. Come here, have a drink.

338
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,808
You gonna introduce me to your friend?

339
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,312
Shawn, this is
Shevonne Dubai.

340
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,396
Am I pronouncing
that right?

341
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,522
Mmm-hmm.

342
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,690
Have a seat.
Have a seat.

343
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,275
Yo, yo, yo!

344
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,943
Come here,
where you going?

345
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,531
Yo, man. I heard you were great
out there in Brooklyn today, man!

346
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,367
He's a winner,
he's a real winner.

347
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,035
Yeah, look, I meant
to say hi to you

348
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,703
the other day on the
street, but with Harvey,

349
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,873
you never know when anybody's
anybody, you know what I'm saying?

350
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,291
Yeah, I think
I saw you out there.

351
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,211
Yeah, yeah, you guys are just coming
from dinner, right, something like that?

352
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,712
Right?
No.

353
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,173
Yeah, listen, man, you ever want
to dine, I'll take you to a place

354
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,093
where you don't have to sit at a
counter, you know what I'm saying?

355
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,177
Shawn, right?

356
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,470
Yeah, that's his name.
Listen.

357
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,806
It seems we're going to be
working together, okay?

358
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,266
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
I heard he'd already lined up

359
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,684
to fight big boy
over there.

360
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,104
Yeah, yeah, well, I was
talking to him about that.

361
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,480
What is this, Harvey,
$10,000?

362
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,482
Since when are you into
this kind of stakes?

363
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,735
Can he just rest for a
minute? He just had a fight.

364
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,903
You want some water?

365
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,946
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,031
Can I get you some
water? Poor Harvey, man.

367
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,200
Let me ask you something.

368
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,244
You think you could beat
big boy over there?

369
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,204
Do we think
he can win?

370
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,956
Harvey,
I wasn't asking you.

371
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,042
I was asking your friend here in
the nice blazer, with the blonde.

372
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,669
Can I do that?

373
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,672
Can you all pardon
me for a second?

374
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,425
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

375
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,805
Hey, Harvey, you're gonna
lose that real quick. Watch.

376
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,726
Excuse me,
Harry Potter book.

377
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,936
You got to be kidding.

378
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,564
Okay.

379
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,898
I knew I was going
to see you again.

380
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,443
Look, I feel bad
about that book.

381
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,945
Look, you remember me?

382
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,029
You remember me,
don't you?

383
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,448
I remember you.
We spoke, you...

384
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,199
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?

385
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,996
Hey, look, I just wanted to
take you to dinner or something.

386
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,789
I'm good, thank you.

387
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,999
No, I was thinking
maybe sometime

388
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,917
something without
a counter. That's all.

389
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,420
That's good. I like that,
without a counter.

390
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,088
I just heard somebody
say that upstairs.

391
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,882
You heard somebody
say that. Okay.

392
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,341
No, look, I just feel
bad about the book,

393
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,010
kind of want to, I don't
know, make it up to you. Hey.

394
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:34,054
Hey. Thank you. Looking
beautiful as usual.

395
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,599
I'm Shawn.

396
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,476
Zulay.
Zulay.

397
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,977
That's pretty.
Thank you.

398
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,270
I believe in fate, so...

399
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,438
I don't.
Oh, no.

400
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,522
What do you think?

401
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,232
If I see you again,
then we'll call it fate.

402
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,526
Okay. One more time.
Okay.

403
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,904
Goodbye.

404
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,322
Counting on it. All right.

405
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,531
Okay.

406
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,991
Zulay.

407
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,496
Bunch of losers
in here, man!

408
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,790
Someone tell that idiot the
whole place is filled with losers.

409
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,375
Right, Harvey?

410
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,296
Hey, so we got
another fight, huh?

411
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,466
Yeah, we are, but we're gonna
talk about it in a second.

412
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,550
I'm going to meet you
over there.

413
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,219
So what did you say,
$10,000, right?

414
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,138
$10,000, that's like
a hundred $100s.

415
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,474
There he is.

416
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,683
Shawn, this is Jerry.
Jerry.

417
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,477
Nice to meet you.
This is Jim.

418
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,313
And that's Joel right there,
and these are their dates.

419
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,648
Look, I'm going to
meet you over there

420
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,857
and we're going to
talk about everything.

421
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,025
Shawn.

422
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,861
You know, we lost a lot of money
betting on your ass to get beat tonight.

423
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,280
Well, maybe you'll bet
the right way next time.

424
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,700
And what's the
right way to bet?

425
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,537
'Cause, you know, I wipe
my ass with a hundred $100s.

426
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,122
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, hey. Just have a seat.

427
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,833
I'll be over
there in a second.

428
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,586
Come on, Jerry.

429
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,223
Excuse me,
we're sitting here.

430
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,393
You're Evan Hailey,
right?

431
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,895
Yeah, and you're
wearing contacts.

432
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,149
Holy shit.
Shawn MacArthur.

433
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,986
I'm sorry,
man, is this your girl?

434
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,153
No. Uh-uh.

435
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,240
So what brings you
to New York, man?

436
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,075
Well, just...

437
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,827
Martinez.
How you doing, man?

438
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,413
Hi, bud, I know who you are. But
you have to excuse me for a second,

439
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,332
I'm just... I'm bugging
out a little bit right now.

440
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,667
You all two
know each other?

441
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,669
I know who you are.

442
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,299
Yeah. Yeah,
we know each other.

443
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,053
I used to wrestle for Shawn's
father back in Birmingham, Alabama.

444
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,514
So how is your father?
Yeah? I'm sure he's fine.

445
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,724
Mmm-hmm.

446
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,769
You know, I'm going to let you
all have a good night, okay?

447
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,813
I'm gonna go ahead
and get out of here.

448
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,024
Hey, come on, man.

449
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,942
Relax, man,
come on, sit down.

450
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,402
Hey. Don't touch me.

451
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,196
"Don't touch. "
You know what...

452
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,365
You worried about your jacket?
Huh? That's the problem?

453
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,492
I'll buy you a new one,
how's that?

454
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,536
I don't need your jacket. No?

455
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,371
Hey, is everything
okay over here?

456
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,497
Harvey.

457
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,124
These two guys are
old friends, man.

458
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,001
Evan just was offering
to buy him a new jacket.

459
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,669
I said I didn't
need a jacket.

460
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,796
Come on, Shawn, look.

461
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,132
You guys.
I'm Harvey Boarden.

462
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,760
Harvey Boarden,
go wash my car, man.

463
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,304
You know, somebody
might hurt you

464
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,847
for doing something
like that.

465
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,183
That somebody
going to be you?

466
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,400
Come on, let's go.

467
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,696
You should go, Harvey.

468
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,200
You're bad, man.

469
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,415
Yeah, Harvey,
you can go now.

470
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,378
Neolithic-looking idiot.
Always saying my damn name.

471
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,466
My daddy used to tell me, "Nothing
good happens after 10:00 p. M."

472
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,010
It's got to be damn
near 2:00 now.

473
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,595
Right?
Yeah.

474
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,766
You knew that guy, huh?

475
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,644
Yeah, he used to wrestle
for my dad's team.

476
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,770
Really?

477
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,647
You know,
I'm gonna go, okay?

478
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,440
Well, where you going?

479
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,608
What, you need
a friend now?

480
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,693
What?

481
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,986
I'm just gonna
go for a walk.

482
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,039
Okay.

483
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,847
Good night, Zulay.
Good night, Zulay.

484
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,515
Good night.

485
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,494
Zulay. Like July?

486
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,124
Yeah, that's right.
I say that right?

487
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,375
You did.

488
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,628
I figured I'd take fate
into my own hands, you know.

489
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,339
And you did.
I have to go. I...

490
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,759
Nice seeing you, Shawn.

491
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,261
Oh, you called me
Shawn. That's cool.

492
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,305
Hey, you make sure
she gets home okay.

493
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,389
Okay. Thank you.

494
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,807
All right?

495
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,892
Thank you, Shawn.

496
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,894
Uh-oh! Don't use it again.

497
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,855
My name. That's good.
Good night.

498
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,684
Hey, King Arthur,
it's Merlin.

499
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,270
Hey, man.

500
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,231
What you doing here?

501
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,566
That's what I was
gonna ask you.

502
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,195
What time is it?

503
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,572
You fell asleep
on the bench.

504
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,491
You look like a crackhead.

505
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,495
I just sat down
for a second. And...

506
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,205
Wow.

507
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,499
I can't believe you just
saw me sleeping on the...

508
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,918
I just sat down,
just for a minute

509
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,295
and I don't know, I just
kind of went to sleep.

510
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,130
I can't believe it.

511
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,134
I've got an extra room at
my place. You can stay there.

512
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,386
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I'm okay.

513
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,929
If you like.
No, you're not okay.

514
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,681
I was just about to
go to a hotel, man.

515
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,267
Yeah, 7:00 in
the morning.

516
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,144
They don't even check
you in until 1:00.

517
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,688
You don't have to
stay at a hotel,

518
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,648
I've got a place
right around the corner.

519
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,234
But you can stay there
until you find another place.

520
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,527
All right, look,
I'm gonna pay you.

521
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,571
Yeah, you're going to
pay me back for sure.

522
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,489
Come on,
grab your stuff.

523
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,534
If somebody saw you sleeping out
here, you know what they'd think?

524
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,953
We wouldn't make
no more money.

525
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,039
Nothing's free
in this world.

526
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,917
I just was there
for a minute or two.

527
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,503
Well, you're in deep
with Harvey Boarden now.

528
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,255
So we're going
to work it out.

529
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,800
Make sure you wipe your feet
on that carpet right there.

530
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,969
I'll shut the door.

531
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,599
Okay, so here we are.

532
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:38,145
Fresh paint job, new lamps.
It's all right for now.

533
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,521
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

534
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,858
You know, for now, at least.
But anyway, here's your area.

535
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,069
That's a Sealy ostropedic.
I got that new.

536
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,113
You like Broadway? You know? Yeah.

537
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,908
'Cause I got tickets, you know,
like Legally Blonde and Wicked.

538
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,744
Wicked's a very good one.
I don't go too often,

539
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,496
but when I do,
I go and see that one.

540
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,332
Is that you?

541
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,919
Yeah, don't mind those,

542
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,172
that's me, Jack and
Martinez, you know, and...

543
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,174
Well, we were going to be
these moguls, you know?

544
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,092
We used to sell tickets
at the Garden.

545
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,761
It was when
we first got here.

546
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,262
So you ain't
from here, either?

547
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,599
Are you kidding me? I'm from
a place with some culture.

548
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,476
Chicago, you know?

549
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,229
But I guess you've got
your own story, too, right?

550
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,649
You left your suitcase
out here.

551
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,320
What, you got
gold in there?

552
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,658
My father used to always say, "Stay
business, ready for business. "

553
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,203
Well, you got to...

554
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,456
So you got a plan
or something?

555
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,501
You know, like a big plan
with this fight stuff?

556
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:47,381
Yeah, I didn't travel all the way
to New York just to be some hustler.

557
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,301
I figured I'd save up some cash,
play some professional ball.

558
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,055
Open up a IHOP. You know,
with an office in it

559
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,682
and my name on the door.

560
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,977
What, like an International
House of Pancakes?

561
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,356
Turns out all I ever was
was a two-bit hustler.

562
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,486
Well. Guess that's not
so bad though, right?

563
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,699
Well, by definition, that's just
somebody who can't win, that wins.

564
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,325
We just won.

565
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,495
I'm just saying.
You know, if that's...

566
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,457
Get you some rest,
Shawn MacArthur.

567
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,962
Go to sleep. We got
a big fight coming up.

568
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,368
$10,000, right?

569
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,536
Yup.

570
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,792
Jerome. This
is Jerome, right?

571
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,675
Looks like
we're here.

572
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,057
Yeah. Look at this tough.

573
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,517
I bet they won't complain about somebody

574
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,728
putting up new buildings
around here.

575
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,898
Come on, you guys,
get in.

576
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,900
It took you
long enough, man.

577
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,985
That guy's
waiting on you.

578
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,073
Shawn, ready to
get your ass busted?

579
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,575
This is where you take me,
Harvey? That's for suckers, man.

580
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,244
Hello, ladies. This is
what I'm talking about.

581
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,246
What's up, girls? Yeah.

582
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,707
How you doing?
She's cute, yo.

583
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,209
I like that.

584
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,756
You're cute, why you got a mad face?

585
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,967
Put a smile on your
face. Not my fault.

586
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,182
I wonder why I don't come
to the Bronx that often.

587
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,149
You know this
kid, right?

588
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,943
Yeah, man,
he's a big dude.

589
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,696
Don't get too close.

590
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,657
Yeah, thanks for that.

591
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,253
There you go,
there comes the king.

592
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,798
Yeah. Get a good
look at that, all.

593
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,605
Bring out the cash, papa.
Bring out the cash.

594
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,108
Do it.

595
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,529
Whoop his ass.

596
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,252
Come on.
Come on, Shawn.

597
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,053
Move, Shawn! Move, Shawn!
Stick and move!

598
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,814
Work it! That's what
I'm talking about!

599
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,886
Ah! My throat!

600
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,149
Come on, Shawn.

601
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,625
Shawn! Shawn!

602
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,379
No, no! No, Shawn! Shawn!

603
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,147
What are you doing?

604
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,982
He knocked my shit over!

605
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,400
My ear!

606
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,277
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,740
We don't want no trouble!
We don't want no trouble!

608
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,743
Hey, come on, move!
We don't want no trouble!

609
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,079
I don't want no trouble!

610
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,915
I swear to God,
I don't want no trouble!

611
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,668
Come on, open the door!

612
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,171
Push gas!

613
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,756
Yo, my ear, man!

614
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,526
He's okay, right?

615
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,030
Yeah, his ear's a little
messed up, but he's all right.

616
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,699
He didn't... Did he
say it was a dog?

617
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,952
You know, he didn't fill out
no police report or nothing?

618
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,871
A dog?
Yeah, a dog.

619
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,791
Can you call him?

620
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,002
Yeah. Nobody's
getting paid.

621
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,631
I'm going inside.

622
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,925
You should put some ice on that hand.

623
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,051
Gotcha.

624
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,969
It was a good
fight, man.

625
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,304
Thanks, man.

626
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,889
Hey.
All right.

627
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,267
We really ain't
getting paid?

628
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,394
We ain't getting
nothing

629
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,271
'cause of them damn
maniacs in the Bronx.

630
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,150
I really need money,
you know.

631
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,194
Really.

632
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,031
Look, I'm gonna work
something out, okay?

633
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,285
Okay.

634
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,962
I'm late every day
for work.

635
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,672
It doesn't matter.
Go, do your job.

636
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,590
I will, and the last
time, it wasn't done.

637
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,050
Please, let me do the job. Okay.

638
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,594
Lila, you're going to be good,
okay? Remember what I told you.

639
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,680
Abuela, I know,
I'm just telling you.

640
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,764
I'm telling you,
I'm reminding you

641
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,933
because you forget a lot
of things, you know?

642
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,435
Take it easy, young lady.
Let me go.

643
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,103
Out? Okay, out.

644
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,604
Let me go.
You relax.

645
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,481
Are you sure you know
how to get home safely?

646
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,774
You make me excited.
I know how to drive

647
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,067
better than you,
you know that.

648
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,319
Okay. Bye.
You know better.

649
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,531
Oh, my goodness,
what kind of lady?

650
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,408
Be good, Lila.

651
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,371
Oh, my God.

652
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,039
Huh?

653
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,877
It's a funny thing, us
keeping meeting like this.

654
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,462
Are you going
into work now?

655
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,173
Yeah. What are
you doing here?

656
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,259
I was just walking by, for the past
two hours, hoping you'd show up.

657
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,635
Oh, stalking? Okay.

658
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,803
No, I just wanted to see
if you wanted to come

659
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,889
get something
to eat with me.

660
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,057
I have to work.
I have 20 minutes.

661
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,142
Just like...

662
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,020
Twenty minutes? You're the
first one here anyway, come on.

663
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,648
Remember, I've been here for
a while. So you want to go?

664
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,109
Yeah? I have to be back, though,

665
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,569
'cause I work here. I'll
get you back, come on.

666
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,154
Twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes.

667
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,572
Like, you don't have to
go if you don't want to go.

668
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,991
Twenty minutes.
Okay, let's go.

669
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,160
Twenty minutes.

670
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,328
If my boss calls me,
I have to go.

671
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,829
Okay, let's go.

672
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,122
Thank you.

673
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,083
Here, let me get that for you. Oh, okay.

674
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,462
I'll get you some sparkling water, okay?

675
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,172
Okay, thanks.
Is that good?

676
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,424
Yeah, yeah.
No, that's good.

677
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,634
So, is this
okay for you?

678
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,011
No, this is good, this
is good. This is...

679
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,179
It's good? Okay.

680
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,264
I'm trying to figure out
what I'm gonna eat.

681
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,600
I think I'm just gonna
have a calamari.

682
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,726
Okay.
By: BackFire

683
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,686
You know,
I ain't that hungry.

684
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,979
All right.

685
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,856
You're not hungry?

686
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,527
No, not really. Thank
you, though. I'm good.

687
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,241
So, that little girl in the
car, that was your daughter?

688
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,077
Yeah.

689
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,622
She seems sweet. I saw the
way she was looking at you.

690
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,501
Yeah, she's sweet.

691
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,881
What? I'm sorry.
There's a big pink thing

692
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,091
coming down the road.

693
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,300
Yes.

694
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,885
That's pink bunny man.

695
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,928
You think that's funny?

696
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,304
Wow. That's a lot of
bunnies right there.

697
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,890
You want one of them things? No.

698
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,267
You know, I'm gonna go get
you one, hold on a sec.

699
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,687
No. He's really
gonna go get one.

700
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,980
Excuse me, sir.

701
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,064
Can I get one
of these bunnies?

702
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,232
Yeah, right on, my man.

703
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,483
How much are they?
$5.

704
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,402
$5? Here you go. Thank
you very much, sir.

705
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,028
You have a good day, okay?
You too.

706
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,488
Excuse me.

707
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,159
Pink bunny.

708
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,204
Thank you.

709
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,081
You didn't want
that thing, did you?

710
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,249
My daughter's
going to love this.

711
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,419
She thinks the guy's from
outer space or something.

712
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,587
So what's her name?

713
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,713
Lila.

714
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,924
Lila?
That's a good name.

715
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,677
Oh!

716
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,928
That must be my boss.

717
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,055
I can't stay. I can't be
late for work again, so...

718
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,765
Well, you just ordered.

719
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,350
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm
just late. No, no, no, no.

720
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,602
This is our date.
This is our date.

721
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,937
Don't even worry about it,
I'll wait for the check.

722
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,939
Date?
Yeah, it's a date.

723
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,400
Date, okay.
All right, well...

724
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,484
Yeah, get out of here.

725
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,528
Don't be late.
See you later.

726
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,864
Okay. You're in
a rush always.

727
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,198
Sorry, I know.

728
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,540
Here you go.

729
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,752
Thank you.

730
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,484
Harv.

731
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,071
What the hell is
wrong with you?

732
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,364
What is this?

733
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,158
What happened to the
whole, I don't know,

734
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,203
"be ready for business,
business ready" thing, huh?

735
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,498
When I'm not being chased
out of the damn Bronx

736
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,376
trying to hustle up you some
money, I'll be a little more alert.

737
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,252
That ain't my fault.

738
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,840
In fact, they actually want you
for another fight this Friday.

739
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,717
Are you up for that?

740
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,013
Yeah. How'd you do that?

741
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,475
Well, I told you, I got
my connections, you know.

742
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,268
It wasn't easy either.

743
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,605
How much this time?

744
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,149
Well, that's what I want
to talk to you about,

745
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,193
but give me a second, I
need to put my clothes on.

746
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,950
It's about this guy you're
about to go up against.

747
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,453
You know, I know you're a
tough guy and everything, Shawn,

748
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,122
but you're not
going to beat him.

749
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,124
But he's gonna... Come
on, I can handle myself.

750
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,543
I know you can, that's why,

751
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,002
when he puts you
in the choke move,

752
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,296
you're gonna go to
sleep, it's that easy.

753
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,132
What are you saying?

754
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,593
I think you know
what I'm saying.

755
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,803
No, I don't know what
you're saying.

756
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,013
Sounds like you're saying
you want me to throw it.

757
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,809
Well, whatever you want
to call it, you know?

758
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:33,354
We're gonna make some money,
not like up in the Bronx.

759
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,899
You're complaining about
that whole thing, right?

760
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,818
No, I'm not losing.

761
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,486
I know you're
not gonna lose,

762
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,739
you're gonna do what
I'm telling you to do.

763
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,866
I appreciate everything
you did for me.

764
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,162
But, you know, the only way I'm
going to lose is if somebody beats me.

765
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,873
Okay, then, whatever,
let him beat you.

766
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,169
I'm serious.

767
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,254
Martinez came up
to me, he said,

768
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:01,507
"You know, hey, if you go around
with me, that's fine, man. "

769
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,633
I don't know.

770
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,843
What?

771
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,096
You and Martinez what?

772
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,264
What do you mean, "what"?

773
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,267
I want to hear why, you
know, you said, "Martinez... "

774
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,186
I didn't say I was
gonna do anything.

775
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,688
No, I want to know what
you're gonna do, 'cause...

776
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,317
I mean, here I'm trying to talk
to you about making you some money,

777
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,153
and, you know, nobody made
anything up in the Bronx, right?

778
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,237
You know that.

779
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,489
I know that. I understand. I know.

780
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,115
And you're gonna threaten me now, right?

781
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,283
What? I'm not
threatening you.

782
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,578
You're not threatening me? I
take you off of a park bench,

783
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,580
and you're going to
threaten me in my house?

784
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,873
Harvey, I ain't
threatening you.

785
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,374
No, I know you're
not threatening me,

786
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,459
'cause you know why?

787
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,461
'Cause you're gonna get
out of my house now, Shawn.

788
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,004
Look, hold on.
I'm sorry, okay?

789
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,130
No.

790
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,049
No, no.
Get out of my house.

791
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,593
Grab your garbage
and go. Okay?

792
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,682
Okay.

793
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,587
Hey, there,
Ms. Florence.

794
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,301
Dog's got a demon in it.

795
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,764
Demons.

796
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,351
You know, I gave you
a place to stay, Shawn,

797
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,644
'cause that's
what you needed.

798
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:40,523
It was a place to stay, it didn't
have any of this other stuff.

799
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,275
I understand that.

800
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,489
You saw that picture I showed
you of Martinez and Jack and me?

801
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,617
I didn't say I was
gonna go with him.

802
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,120
I had a whole
lot then, Shawn.

803
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,917
He broke my leg for $100.
That's crazy, right?

804
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,669
$100.

805
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,629
All I was saying is,
I wanted to win.

806
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,173
That's it,
that's all I wanted.

807
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,093
It's funny, you lose
one step in this game

808
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,555
and everybody leaves you.

809
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,810
At one point, there was
a whole lot of people

810
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,647
that would put a whole
lot of money on me.

811
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,285
You really think you
can beat this kid, huh?

812
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,872
I hear he's fierce,
you know?

813
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,837
'Cause if you lose,
you get nothing.

814
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,675
You win, you get...

815
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,094
You get $30,000.

816
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,263
Hmm.

817
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,567
Okay.

818
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,197
Okay, we'll do it.

819
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,896
Hi.

820
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,403
Hey, sweetie.

821
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,154
Hi.
Hi.

822
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,781
How are you?

823
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,533
So what are you
doing here?

824
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,952
Waiting for you
the whole time.

825
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,704
That's a man, bro.

826
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,289
You're a man?

827
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,750
Hell, no.

828
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,849
Sit.

829
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,017
Thank you.

830
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,270
I'll be right back.

831
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,093
Z, fold this up.

832
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,996
Harvey, you know you got no
business in a place like this, right?

833
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,958
Come on, Shawn.

834
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,865
Shit!

835
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,595
Holy shit!

836
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,989
Yeah! Yeah!

837
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,132
Get out of there!

838
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,470
Get out!

839
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,020
Pick his ass up!
Come on! Get up!

840
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,818
Yeah! Yeah!

841
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,363
There it is!

842
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,369
Yeah!

843
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,721
Yo, Shawn, get up.

844
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,849
We won!

845
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:37,189
Yeah, baby! We won!
Get up, get up, yeah!

846
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,025
No more deliveries tonight, man. You!

847
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,486
Your man
got knocked out!

848
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,781
What, baby! That's us!

849
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,702
What! You saw that!
You saw that! That's us!

850
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,580
Yeah, baby!

851
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:59,295
Well, looks like
Harvey's got a winner.

852
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,006
That's us, baby,
all the way!

853
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,635
Get out of the car...

854
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,345
No, no.
I'm proud of you.

855
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,723
You put the works on
Bruce Lee, though, man!

856
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,974
I got to give
it to you.

857
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,434
Get out of my car.

858
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,768
Come on, Harv. Let me out.

859
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,980
Come on,
Harvey, let's go.

860
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,606
Let's get a drink,
Harvey.

861
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,691
Aren't you going
to have one?

862
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,027
No, I don't want to. Go, it's
your night, have a good night.

863
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,486
Man, it's raining,
come on.

864
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,989
I'm going to go home and
count my money. Leave me alone.

865
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,824
All right, grandpa.

866
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,621
Don't get in no trouble.
I'm serious, though.

867
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,666
Come on, serious.
Come in, just have one.

868
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,209
I ain't got nothing, go.

869
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,086
Thanks for tonight.

870
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,759
Thanks, Renee,
I appreciate it.

871
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,926
Yes, sir.

872
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,728
Please tell me you're not still
putting money in your sock.

873
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,439
What'd your father
used to call that?

874
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,401
Niggerish, that's what
it was, right?

875
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,158
So this is who you hanging
out with these days, Shawn?

876
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,785
These your boys?

877
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,330
Saw you step out your fancy
stretch limousine there.

878
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:20,209
What, did you all pass
around a hat to get that?

879
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,086
Take up a collection?

880
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,881
You know, the only enjoyment
I got back in college, Shawn,

881
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,341
was watching
your asshole father

882
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,718
humiliate your shit
all over the place.

883
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,011
Really?

884
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,473
Until your bitch-ass cold-clocked
him in front of the whole gym.

885
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,564
Come on!

886
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,817
I'm right here!

887
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,902
Do something!
I'm right here!

888
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,237
Shawn! Look at me!

889
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,530
Like your bitch-ass daddy.

890
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,990
Shawn, Shawn,
what are you doing?

891
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,660
I ain't your father.

892
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,328
You can't go to
a club and have fun.

893
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,415
That's right. I'm cool.
I'll see you around.

894
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,961
Let's get out of here.

895
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,636
It's ridiculous. I don't
even... I can't stand him.

896
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,393
I just... It's not late.

897
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,274
This guy's always putting
these notes on people's doors.

898
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,027
It's not late,
though. Sorry.

899
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,529
It's okay.

900
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,364
I hit you with
the door. So...

901
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,533
This is my living room.

902
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,995
I have to go and check
on Lila, so have a seat.

903
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,539
It's nice, right?

904
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,707
It's really nice.

905
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,125
Thank you.

906
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,626
Big TV.

907
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,503
It is, right?
Yeah.

908
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,214
Okay.
Okay.

909
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,930
Hi, I'm Shawn.

910
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,059
I'm Zulay's friend.

911
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,688
She brought
me over to...

912
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,734
Zulay. Zulay.

913
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,486
What happened?

914
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,112
This is...
I'm sorry, this is...

915
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,405
This is Shawn.
Shawn, this is...

916
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,781
I don't care
who is he.

917
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,452
I care why you bring anybody
at this time to the house.

918
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,578
He look like
a criminal.

919
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,662
I know...

920
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,748
You're not supposed to bring
nobody at this time to the house.

921
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,791
I'm sorry... Don't be sorry.
Don't do that to me no more.

922
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:25,918
Okay?

923
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,587
Please,
don't say "por favor. "

924
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,214
I don't want to hear nobody
in the house at this time.

925
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,177
Hi. What are you
doing up this late?

926
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,930
What's that?

927
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,181
My pink bunny.

928
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,807
Sorry. What are
you doing up?

929
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,559
My grandma thinks
you killed someone.

930
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,979
He didn't kill somebody.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

931
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,147
Why are you up, baby?

932
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,399
I want to see
the scary man.

933
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,570
I hear that I'm gonna
cook for you.

934
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:57,074
I'm gonna do it, but as soon as
you eat, please, you got to go.

935
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,534
Okay?
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

936
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,576
Look at the way you are.
Look at you.

937
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,702
Please, it's okay.

938
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,704
I'm sorry, actually, you
know what? Look at you. Look!

939
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,498
You know what?
I need some thread.

940
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,707
What a shirt.

941
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,959
I'm going to
fix it for him.

942
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,961
I'm gonna take a needle and do some job.

943
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,921
That way he don't
gotta stay like that.

944
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,381
You don't feel bad?
I do.

945
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,383
What kind of men look
like that on the street?

946
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,552
Thank you so
much for the...

947
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,389
Come on, no. Back.
Back, let's go back.

948
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,974
I don't want
to go to bed.

949
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,308
Let's go back,
back to sleep.

950
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,648
Mmm-hmm.

951
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,150
Uh-huh?

952
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,738
Shawn has something
he wants to tell you.

953
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:37,990
What?

954
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,249
I don't understand what you
talk. Talk English, Spanish?

955
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,170
Okay.

956
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,507
She's wide awake.

957
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,759
This is going good.

958
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:03,015
I don't know, so... Hey, that
notice that was on your door,

959
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,933
everything all right?

960
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,312
Like, if you...

961
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,938
You know,
if you need anything.

962
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,653
Just let me know.

963
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,863
So...

964
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:25,203
That guy, Evan, from
the club, you know him?

965
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,790
Yeah. I mean,
yeah, I know him.

966
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,375
How do you know him?

967
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,794
Well, I don't, I just...

968
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,796
People were talking about
him at the club all night.

969
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,215
I guess he's a pro or something?
What, does he fight? A boxer?

970
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,800
Yeah, I mean,
a couple, you know,

971
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:39,926
the guys at the club
or whatever,

972
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,845
we just came back
from this...

973
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,681
You know, it's not a
professional thing, but...

974
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,350
Out in, like, you know,
Korea land,

975
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,894
we just came
from a fight, too.

976
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,688
You know,
it went pretty well.

977
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,565
So you're a fighter?

978
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,983
No, I mean, yeah.

979
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,194
But not professional. Just,
you know... I don't know...

980
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,988
I got this guy, he's an
agent/coach sort of thing.

981
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,075
I mean, it's been going
pretty good, though.

982
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,705
What?
I don't know.

983
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,807
So how do you know all
those guys at the club?

984
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,433
I don't. I...

985
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,811
I don't even know
your name, really.

986
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,313
What's your name?
Your last name?

987
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,108
MacArthur.

988
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:40,946
Shawn MacArthur. Like
a knight. I like it.

989
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,496
What are you
thinking about?

990
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,627
So...

991
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,795
Simple as that.

992
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,342
I can fix this for you.

993
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,761
Hmm?

994
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,722
I want to fix
this for you.

995
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,557
It's not so bad.
You want to fix it?

996
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,766
Mmm-hmm.

997
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,603
I want to kiss you.

998
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,777
Come on...

999
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,991
Why are you shaking?

1000
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,202
Because I lied about
being able to sew.

1001
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,750
It looks like
you're doing a good job.

1002
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,837
Look at that mess.

1003
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,091
Wow, I am shaking.

1004
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,013
Wait, come here for a second.

1005
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,433
Give me your finger.

1006
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,686
Make a wish.

1007
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,567
I got mine,
you got yours?

1008
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,735
Mmm-hmm.

1009
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,529
I do.

1010
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,951
Excuse me! You got to go.
I'm sorry. I know.

1011
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,286
Enough is enough.
Please go.

1012
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,329
Yes, ma'am.

1013
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,080
I believe it's enough
for today.

1014
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,624
You can meet
later today.

1015
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,750
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

1016
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,793
Just a second to say bye.

1017
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,712
No second. Come in.
You come in.

1018
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,923
Thank you so much, Mrs.
Valez, I appreciate it.

1019
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,509
I'm no Mrs. Valez,
I'm Mrs. Guzman. Okay?

1020
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:26,760
And you got to go. Go.

1021
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,303
Give me one second
to say bye, please.

1022
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,889
Oh, my goodness, you give
me so much trouble today.

1023
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,391
I'm sorry.

1024
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,978
She could have come a little
bit later, that's for sure.

1025
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,063
That would have
been nice.

1026
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,147
Totally. I know.

1027
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,733
Okay, so...

1028
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,153
Okay.

1029
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,655
Good night, yeah...

1030
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,365
So I'm going to
see you again?

1031
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:50,742
Yeah.
Yeah. When?

1032
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,878
You sleeping?

1033
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,006
Who can sleep with all
that banging up there?

1034
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,385
Told you we'd win, huh?

1035
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,513
Did you get our money?

1036
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,683
Right at it, huh?

1037
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:15,851
Yes, sir.

1038
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,896
Look, I know we already had a
fight, but any word on another one?

1039
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,356
I just want to make sure
we're capitalizing

1040
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,191
on everything we got
going on here.

1041
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,861
I told you, if you like,
anything I got,

1042
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,071
the tickets, the hats,
the sneakers,

1043
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:30,657
you can sell those until
I get you another fight,

1044
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:33,034
if that's what
you want to do.

1045
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,369
Go ahead,
turn around.

1046
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,537
Huh?

1047
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,497
You wanna get paid,
right?

1048
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,291
Go ahead, man, get it,
I ain't gonna rob you.

1049
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,584
I know you're not
gonna rob me,

1050
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,710
'cause you're gonna
turn around.

1051
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,211
After tonight,
you don't trust me?

1052
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,713
Okay, fine.
I've turned around.

1053
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,089
This is me,
all right?

1054
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,382
I've turned around,
go ahead.

1055
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,050
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

1056
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,094
I've turned around, go.

1057
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,976
I was with this girl
from the club tonight.

1058
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,271
Keep looking and you're
going to be with her now.

1059
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,481
You can turn around now.

1060
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,279
Man, she got a daughter.

1061
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:13,158
She's kind of having a little
trouble with the rent, I think.

1062
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,702
I kinda wanted
to help her.

1063
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,204
Stop smiling at me, I know
what you're going to say.

1064
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,831
Yeah, I bet...

1065
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,500
Why wouldn't I
help her, then?

1066
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:27,047
Beyond the kid and
the need for money...

1067
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,798
Why you gotta break
everything down?

1068
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,760
That's your problem, man,
you don't trust nobody.

1069
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,844
Here you go.

1070
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,430
I'm never trusting you,
you and your suitcase.

1071
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,765
My suitcase?

1072
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,893
Yeah, your suitcase
don't trust nobody either.

1073
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,270
There's $10,000 right here.

1074
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,439
Yeah. Nice, isn't it?

1075
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,191
I was right, wasn't I?

1076
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,736
Look, I just...

1077
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,239
We shouldn't be selling
tickets and sneakers no more.

1078
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:57,827
I tell you, we gotta... This
is what we're doing right now.

1079
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,163
So...

1080
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:04,793
This girl. She works
over at the Marquee?

1081
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,713
Yeah, Zulay.

1082
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,300
Zulay. She's nice, man.

1083
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,052
Zulay.
Yeah.

1084
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,805
Okay.

1085
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,060
You get some rest,
all right?

1086
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,354
There's $10,000
right here.

1087
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:27,232
Yeah. Get some rest,
all right?

1088
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,826
Hey, you know
where Zulay is?

1089
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,426
What do you want
to talk about?

1090
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,637
Isn't there something
you should be telling me?

1091
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,723
What are you talking
about, Harvey?

1092
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,017
You're gonna
make me say it?

1093
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:48,021
Why didn't you tell me that
you were sleeping with him?

1094
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,481
Why couldn't
you tell me that?

1095
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,566
'Cause I don't have to tell
you everything. That's why.

1096
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,277
Now you want him
paying your bills?

1097
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,820
I did not ask him
to pay my bills.

1098
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:56,905
Are you kidding me?

1099
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:01,076
You're bringing him around your
daughter, you like him like that?

1100
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,412
What, you think he's
better than me, right?

1101
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,497
No. That's...

1102
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,581
You think you're
better than me,

1103
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:10,085
that's why you fill his
head with all this garbage.

1104
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,128
About riding off
into the sunset,

1105
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,380
like this is a movie
or something, huh?

1106
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,424
No, no, come here I'm talking
to you. Don't touch me.

1107
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:17,467
I'm talking to you.

1108
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,552
Don't touch me.
Stop it.

1109
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,639
If he decides to up
and leave you tomorrow,

1110
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:24,390
you think you're
part of his plans?

1111
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,684
You think
your daughter is?

1112
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,437
Maybe. What about your grandmother?

1113
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,563
You're always so paranoid.

1114
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,900
Yeah, that's what I am,
I'm paranoid. I'm paranoid.

1115
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,402
You still believe
in fairy tales.

1116
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,158
But you think
I'm paranoid, okay.

1117
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:44,536
Does he know
how we met?

1118
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,956
You in the back seat,
sleeping in your car,

1119
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,208
with your daughter
in the front seat?

1120
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,379
Is that something
to be paranoid about?

1121
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:01,678
Okay.

1122
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,681
You think that little thing
right here between your legs

1123
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,516
is gonna make everything
okay, don't you?

1124
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,476
That's what you think.

1125
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,894
It isn't.

1126
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,940
You use that on him.

1127
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:17,068
Don't put no more
garbage in his head.

1128
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,871
Yo, check this out, yo.

1129
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,373
Check what out, this
dirty-ass crib you got?

1130
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,001
There are bare wires
laying around, man.

1131
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,085
Clean this shit up.

1132
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,670
When was the last time
you cleaned this shit?

1133
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:38,464
Shut up, bro, I'm about to kick you out.

1134
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:42,886
Evan Hailey KO's Richards.
It's your man from the club.

1135
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,929
This dude's corny.

1136
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,516
No, check it. A dude like this
man, you got to take serious, man.

1137
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,351
Yeah, look
how he punches.

1138
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,229
He look like he's punching like a
girl, but those punches hurt, man.

1139
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,647
It's your man, Shawn.
Who is that?

1140
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,191
That's that dude
from the club, bro.

1141
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,818
No, man, he's the real deal.
Yo, Shawn, no disrespect, man,

1142
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:01,487
he's fighting for real
money in real venues.

1143
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,199
Shawn over here
bullshitting with us.

1144
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,997
Look at you, Harvey.

1145
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:57,001
You know, you've been doing
that for some time now.

1146
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:10,056
It's called bi-polar
or manic depressive.

1147
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,684
What? What?

1148
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,352
Oh, my God.

1149
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,355
Harvey, come in. Come
in, sit down. Come in.

1150
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,691
We were just talking about
you. Come in, come in.

1151
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,236
Special occasion, you
got the suit broke out.

1152
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:24,529
Nice suit.

1153
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:25,863
Jacket, at least.

1154
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:27,657
That's nice.

1155
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,284
Beautiful,
you're looking good.

1156
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,368
Not bad, Harvey.

1157
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,705
Listen, I didn't
come here, you know,

1158
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:34,956
to take up a whole
lot of your time.

1159
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,124
I'm just here
to tell you

1160
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,959
that if you've got
something for Shawn...

1161
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:40,003
Look at little Harvey,
he's like a little kid.

1162
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:45,258
He's very excited, like he
has a secret to share with us.

1163
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,385
What's the secret,
Harvey?

1164
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,345
I'm just saying, if you...

1165
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,806
If you got something for us,
we're ready to go, you know.

1166
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,391
He's the biggest draw
in this town,

1167
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,811
and if you're ready for
something, we're ready for it.

1168
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,021
Wow.

1169
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:02,233
It must be very hard for you
to come in here and grovel

1170
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,945
in front of all of us
here. Especially Martinez.

1171
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:12,618
You know, Jack, I don't have to
stay here and take this from you.

1172
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,579
Guess what, Harvey?

1173
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,664
We were talking about
you and we said that

1174
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,709
maybe we should put your
man in one of our fights.

1175
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:24,255
A big fight. $100,000
to the winner, Harvey.

1176
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,009
Harvey's excited, huh, Harvey?

1177
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,886
You excited, Harvey?

1178
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,929
$100,000.

1179
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:35,433
Evan Hailey's going to
rock your boy's world.

1180
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,853
Time out. He couldn't
wait to tell you that one.

1181
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:40,480
See, this is the way
it's going to be.

1182
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:43,483
Evan Hailey versus
Shawn MacArthur.

1183
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,985
And we're going to play
up this whole thing

1184
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,196
about how they went
to the same school,

1185
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,783
you know,
the education rivalry.

1186
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,744
Rivalry for education.

1187
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,086
Okay.
I know.

1188
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,882
As soon as we
get the word out,

1189
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,176
the phone's just going
to ring off the hook.

1190
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:14,263
We'll let both
of you know.

1191
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,330
Harvey, you sure you're
ready for this, Harvey?

1192
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,918
Can't help but keep
calling my name, huh?

1193
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:46,879
I don't know, Harvey,
maybe I'm stupid, you know?

1194
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,090
But I'm not stupid enough to think
that Shawn's going to win this.

1195
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,425
That's stupid, Harvey.
Yeah, really.

1196
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,926
Really?

1197
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,053
You just don't know how
good he is, you know?

1198
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,806
Yeah, I do.
That's why I got Evan.

1199
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:01,227
And the loser gets shit,
Harvey. And you still get shit.

1200
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,578
Hey, man.

1201
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:22,123
We need to take a walk
and talk for a second.

1202
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,793
Okay.

1203
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,088
So you gonna tell me?

1204
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:32,341
Well, I got you
another fight.

1205
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,760
Yeah? How much?

1206
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,307
$100,000.

1207
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,435
What?

1208
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:43,561
Yeah.

1209
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:51,652
They want us to fight
Evan Hailey.

1210
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,073
He's your opponent.

1211
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:58,576
Great.

1212
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:06,834
I'm taking all my money and
I'm placing it against us.

1213
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,631
You ain't got no money.

1214
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:14,175
You have any idea
how much money

1215
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:16,594
I can raise for
something like this?

1216
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,846
Then raise it and
put it on us to win.

1217
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,098
People like a guarantee,
Shawn.

1218
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,517
Then guarantee it.

1219
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,894
You saw Jerry,
those Wall Street guys,

1220
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,771
even Martinez would
get in on this.

1221
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:27,980
We're talking
real money.

1222
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,440
No, you're talking
about money.

1223
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,816
No, come on, Shawn.

1224
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:33,444
What do you think, there's a
trophy involved in all of this?

1225
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,863
Nobody cares about it.

1226
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:40,034
And if we lose, you know we get
nothing. You get that, right?

1227
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,702
What? Come on, Shawn.

1228
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,539
Look, all right, look...

1229
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,832
You think I don't
understand that I'm nothing?

1230
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,126
I'm nothing, I get it.
I ain't worth nothing.

1231
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,379
Nobody said anything like
that. I mean, come on.

1232
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:53,172
All I'm saying is that
I don't want to lose.

1233
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,924
That's all I'm saying
is I don't want to lose.

1234
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:56,008
I'm telling you, Shawn...

1235
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,760
Look, I know it sounds
stupid to you.

1236
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:59,845
It's stupid.
But that's what I...

1237
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,682
I don't want to do it,
so I won't. Okay?

1238
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:03,891
Cut all that stuff,
man, listen to me.

1239
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,017
I mean it.

1240
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,228
Listen, listen.
I'm talking to you.

1241
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:08,354
Harvey.

1242
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:09,981
What, you gonna hit me?

1243
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,065
No, I'm not gonna
hit you... I'm sorry.

1244
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:12,525
You think I'm your
father?

1245
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:15,319
You're going to slap me around
like I'm your father, huh?

1246
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,113
Okay, okay, I get it.

1247
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:19,365
You think I don't know
who you are, Shawn.

1248
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,242
What?
I know all about you.

1249
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:24,996
I said, can the moral
garbage with me, Shawn.

1250
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:27,206
It don't work here.

1251
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,460
Harvey, you don't ever
talk about my father, okay?

1252
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,170
You gonna hit me?

1253
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,634
You don't ever
talk about my father.

1254
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,276
Hey.

1255
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,444
So you came back.

1256
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:59,030
You know me, the stalker.

1257
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,283
You caught me
taking a shower.

1258
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,244
So, what are you
doing here?

1259
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:09,373
Nothing, I was just... I don't
know, just kinda wanted to see you.

1260
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,208
Okay, well, come in.

1261
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,211
My grandmother has
Lila, so, come in.

1262
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:20,551
I know it's really
hot in here, so,

1263
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,929
if you want, just grab a
seat and I'll be right back.

1264
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,891
Hey, listen.
Look, I made some money

1265
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,352
and I kinda wanted to help
you with the notice that I saw

1266
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:31,896
on the door the other day.

1267
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,357
That's really... No...
That's sweet, but...

1268
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,441
No. For Lila.

1269
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:36,609
No, I don't need it.

1270
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,944
Listen, hold on, hold on.
Just for Lila.

1271
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:41,489
Hold on a second. Just,
please, just listen.

1272
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:44,075
I don't know what
I'm trying to say...

1273
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:47,787
The last thing I want
to do is upset you.

1274
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:48,871
All I want...

1275
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,084
You came in here
offering me money.

1276
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,130
Just don't...
It's no big deal, okay?

1277
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,303
I don't know how to...

1278
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:09,076
What?

1279
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,537
Your hair smells good.

1280
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:12,872
Thank you.

1281
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:16,208
You know, when you wash
your hair in the sink,

1282
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,210
they call it
a Puerto Rican shower.

1283
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:21,422
My grandfather used to hate
when people called it that.

1284
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,466
Of course, he can say it.

1285
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:32,391
I like this,
this is nice.

1286
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:37,021
I know what
happened with your dad.

1287
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:39,940
Oh.

1288
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,066
Is that okay?

1289
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,944
I read... Me and Lila
were on the computer,

1290
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,113
and we just kinda
stumbled across...

1291
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,285
Wow...
I'm sorry...

1292
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:54,789
No... Checking up on me?
That's all right.

1293
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,081
It's okay?

1294
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,208
Yeah.

1295
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,461
So you think
I'm crazy now?

1296
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:02,838
No.

1297
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,217
Well, I mean...
You'd be right.

1298
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,178
I mean, I did. I went
a little crazy, so...

1299
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:14,183
You know that guy Evan,
the other night,

1300
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:15,601
at the club, you know,
after the whole thing?

1301
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:16,894
Yeah.

1302
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,981
We were on the same team
and my dad coached us.

1303
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,817
Man, he loved Evan.

1304
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,654
I was a freshman, and they
always used to mess with me.

1305
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:30,241
And I just couldn't take it
no more. I kind of lost it.

1306
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,954
And me and Evan went at it.
And my dad got between us

1307
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:36,622
and I didn't even
see him, you know.

1308
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:39,083
I just kinda...
I hit him.

1309
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,502
I hit my father.

1310
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:44,630
And I just didn't stop.

1311
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:47,091
You know?
I just couldn't stop.

1312
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:53,556
My father never forgave
me. 'Cause he shouldn't.

1313
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:00,312
I got to go get that.

1314
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,409
Okay, I have
to get going

1315
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:16,370
because I have to go do something
at the club, I realized. I'm sorry.

1316
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,205
I have to go and do
something at the club

1317
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,040
that I completely
forgot about. So...

1318
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,125
Okay...
Please hurry up.

1319
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,209
I'll walk you.
I'm hurrying.

1320
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,711
We do have to go.
I'm sorry, I just...

1321
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,547
Okay. I heard you the first
time, I'm going, I'm going.

1322
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:27,756
I'm sorry.

1323
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:28,924
It's okay.

1324
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:33,095
I just forgot I had to
go get this stuff done.

1325
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,473
You okay?

1326
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,225
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

1327
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,852
Just wondering.

1328
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:43,689
You're good?
Yeah.

1329
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:49,111
Hey, Harvey.

1330
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,323
Wait. What?
What's going on here?

1331
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:53,449
Um...

1332
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:56,285
I was going to tell
you, I know Harvey.

1333
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,788
Wait, hold on. You all know each other?

1334
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:03,125
Yeah, I know her.
I know her.

1335
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:07,671
Listen...
Wait, how do you know...

1336
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,382
I mean, how do you
know each other?

1337
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,637
What's going on, 'cause, are
you together or something?

1338
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:16,430
No.
Listen, Shawn...

1339
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:17,932
No, no, no...
I'm talking to her...

1340
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,016
I'm talking...

1341
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,935
No, no, let me... I just
want to hear it from her.

1342
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:22,227
Let me talk
to you, okay?

1343
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,772
What did I say? I said
I'm talking... What now?

1344
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:26,732
Shawn...
I want to talk to her.

1345
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:28,317
I'm talking to you.
I want to talk to her!

1346
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:29,401
Get your hands off me!
Shut up!

1347
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,946
Get your hands off of
me! Get out of my head!

1348
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,323
Look, everything
isn't what you think.

1349
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,450
You're not the only one
that worked with me.

1350
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:37,660
She works with me, too.

1351
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,578
It's what I was explaining
at the apartment.

1352
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:43,207
Nobody knows we know each
other. She places bets for me.

1353
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,292
Okay, that's
what it is.

1354
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,503
I was going to
tell you, Shawn.

1355
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:50,798
You asked about my...
You asked about my father.

1356
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,801
Shawn...
Why would you do that?

1357
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:04,019
You better learn
to answer your phone.

1358
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:05,437
Why didn't you answer?
That's all you had to do.

1359
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,480
Why did you call?

1360
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:09,441
Why didn't you text me
and say something?

1361
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:50,941
Listen, Harvey and I have been
friends for a really long time.

1362
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,153
Listen to me. I should
have told you, I know that.

1363
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,195
I don't know what I
might say to you, okay.

1364
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,615
Wait. Just listen
to me, okay?

1365
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,076
Look, I make $11
an hour, okay?

1366
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,327
Is that what you
want to know?

1367
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:04,496
I make $11 an hour,
I'm broke.

1368
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:07,041
I pick up glasses from people
that I hate all night long,

1369
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,961
and I'm not really supposed
to be doing this right now.

1370
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:14,089
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

1371
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:17,634
Because.

1372
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:25,809
Harvey... We're just friends.
He just gives me this money,

1373
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,730
and I just go place bets for him
and that's all there is to it.

1374
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:31,356
Nobody even knows that
we know each other.

1375
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,276
Then why couldn't you
just say that to me?

1376
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:55,214
Is this thing still on?

1377
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,052
Listen, man...

1378
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:01,303
Yeah, I understand.

1379
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:05,265
Throw it. No one will
ever know the better.

1380
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:10,771
And you're going to tell me
you're okay with that, huh?

1381
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,233
Yeah.

1382
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,694
Whatever you raise,
I want half.

1383
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:23,617
We ain't talking about
anything here, you know.

1384
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,452
No, forget it, then.

1385
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:27,788
Okay.

1386
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,373
Just like that,
though, huh?

1387
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,917
Yeah. Just like that.

1388
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,755
All right.

1389
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,300
Then, you know once
you get out there,

1390
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,594
all those eyes are
going to be on you.

1391
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:47,266
And if there's even a hint that
you're throwing this thing...

1392
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,434
And that's
both of us dead.

1393
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,312
You understand
how much money they...

1394
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:56,650
They don't scare me, Harvey.
This city doesn't scare me.

1395
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:03,198
I'm gonna do what you want. And
you're never going to see me again.

1396
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,076
None of you.

1397
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,097
This isn't tickets,
Harvey.

1398
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:30,142
You understand there's
$250,000 in this bag.

1399
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:38,775
And, Harvey, don't make
us come looking for you.

1400
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,792
Nice office, Harvey.

1401
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:57,669
Glad you could
make it.

1402
01:26:57,754 --> 01:27:00,255
Yeah, you should
get a receptionist.

1403
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,885
Is he going to listen
to you, Harvey?

1404
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:09,056
If you don't believe me, he's right
out there, you can ask him yourself.

1405
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,016
I'm asking you,
Harvey.

1406
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,272
There's $250,000
in here.

1407
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,734
And if he decides
he don't like losing,

1408
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:24,488
and by some miracle he wins,
I still want my money, Harvey.

1409
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:33,497
I don't get my money,
Harvey, I'll kill you.

1410
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:51,807
Lot of money.

1411
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,785
Come on in.

1412
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,247
Zulay, did you have
another dream?

1413
01:28:58,124 --> 01:28:59,499
It's a lot of money,
Jack.

1414
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:00,834
Oh, yeah?

1415
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:05,756
How much are we
talking about?

1416
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,924
Half a million dollars.

1417
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,510
Hmm?

1418
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,514
So what are you doing
walking around the street

1419
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,892
with half a million dollars
in your bag?

1420
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,978
I have investors.

1421
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,104
Investors.

1422
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,566
If it's too much
money, I can...

1423
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,859
Too much?

1424
01:29:26,652 --> 01:29:28,236
Listen to that.

1425
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:32,282
She's cleaning up the
dumpster, now she's in the club.

1426
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:40,999
Tell your rich-ass and your
drunk-ass investor friends

1427
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,252
that I will be happy
to pay them off.

1428
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:48,006
And happier not to.

1429
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:54,638
Count it.

1430
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,146
The man
is here. Outside.

1431
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:50,944
We need to get everybody out on
the terrace so we can do this thing.

1432
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:53,447
People, the show's
going to start. Outside.

1433
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:55,574
You have a nice place here. Of course.

1434
01:30:55,658 --> 01:30:58,160
City Hall, I've got
the Woolworth Building.

1435
01:30:58,244 --> 01:31:00,036
My meditation room.

1436
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,247
Let's go, people.

1437
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:13,967
Look, I'll meet you out.

1438
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:15,802
Let me talk to you
for a second.

1439
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,471
You know what we're
dealing with here, right?

1440
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:20,223
Let's just go.
Let's get it over with.

1441
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,874
Look at this, Harvey.

1442
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:50,587
Now you see how far
you've come?

1443
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:57,886
Hey, everybody,

1444
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,971
Jerry invited us all
up here so we could

1445
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,599
catch a glimpse of
his bank account.

1446
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,142
That's nice, huh?

1447
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:07,145
Here's to Jerry.

1448
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,358
But what
the thing is...

1449
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:13,401
I mean, the real shit
of this thing is,

1450
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,695
is what's going on
right here.

1451
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:19,282
So, Jerry, right now,
you should step off.

1452
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:23,161
And gentlemen,
you should step up.

1453
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,415
Let's go baby, let's go!

1454
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:33,421
We're going
to sit down, people.

1455
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:37,467
And these two gentlemen are going
to go toe to toe, blow to blow.

1456
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:42,055
Whatever goes on
up here, whatever.

1457
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:47,102
Whatever you do to
each other, whatever.

1458
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:53,400
Whatever you say to
each other, whatever.

1459
01:32:55,861 --> 01:32:59,864
In the words of the late,
great, American poet,

1460
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,117
Mr. Marvin Gaye,

1461
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:07,289
"Let's get it on!"

1462
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,462
Let's go, baby,
let's go! Yeah!

1463
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:19,050
You froze? Huh?

1464
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:22,345
It's a stare-down.

1465
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:25,015
Oh.

1466
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:27,183
It's the evil eye.

1467
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:33,982
Is that what you gave
your old man? Huh?

1468
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:36,276
Knock that smile
off his face, let's go!

1469
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:47,454
Yeah, baby!

1470
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:56,212
All right. Let's play.
Let's play, Shawn.

1471
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,007
Show him what
you got! Do it!

1472
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:01,843
Do it, baby!

1473
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,430
Go on, Shawn! Yeah!

1474
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,424
Get him, Shawn!
Get him! Get him!

1475
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:51,601
Right here, Shawn.

1476
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:56,481
He's talking shit!

1477
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:02,779
You can't stay there,
Shawn!

1478
01:35:22,174 --> 01:35:23,466
Oh, shit!

1479
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:35,603
Hey, hey,
that's it! That's it!

1480
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:38,773
That's it! That's it!
That's enough! Call it!

1481
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:42,902
That's it! That's it!

1482
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:47,490
Go on, Shawn!
Get up! Get up, bro!

1483
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:56,499
Get up! Get up!

1484
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:03,173
Get out of it! Get out of it! Get out!

1485
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:05,884
Come on, Shawn!

1486
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:12,557
You got to fight!
Come on! Get out of it!

1487
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,228
Fight!

1488
01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:31,743
Come on, Shawn! Yeah!

1489
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,460
No! No!

1490
01:36:45,007 --> 01:36:46,841
Harvey, what's
going on, Harvey?

1491
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:47,967
No!

1492
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,011
Come on! Yeah!

1493
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:52,847
Holy shit!

1494
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:30,093
No!

1495
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:51,739
Yeah, boy!

1496
01:37:57,621 --> 01:37:59,038
Yeah, Shawn!
Yeah, Shawn!

1497
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,249
You got it, Shawn.
Let's start moving, boys.

1498
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,087
Yeah!

1499
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:07,839
What up now, bitch?

1500
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,259
Harvey, I'd like to
shake your hand, man.

1501
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:16,806
You're a dead man.

1502
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:20,101
You're a dead man,
Harvey. Dead man.

1503
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:21,311
Thank you.

1504
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,478
You're welcome.

1505
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,190
What up now, bitch?

1506
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:31,738
Yeah, baby!

1507
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:49,797
I'll need a drink
after that, man, right!

1508
01:39:01,143 --> 01:39:03,853
Thank you, Evan,
you fight like a bitch.

1509
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:07,315
Harvey, we're going out,
VIP Harvey, we out of here.

1510
01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:09,901
Whoa, there he is!

1511
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:13,321
You're the shit, man.

1512
01:39:13,405 --> 01:39:16,449
Yeah, last night was
great, man. Thanks a lot.

1513
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:17,659
Thanks for the ride.

1514
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:19,077
Thanks for
being there.

1515
01:39:19,161 --> 01:39:21,204
Yo, we're going to the club
tonight, kid. You wanna come?

1516
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:22,997
VIP all night,
drinks all night.

1517
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:24,248
Come on. Let's go.

1518
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,291
No, I'm beat up.

1519
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,377
VIP, Harvey. VIP.

1520
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:30,129
VIP, you all
be careful.

1521
01:39:37,429 --> 01:39:40,098
Well, tonight,
show your butt off.

1522
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:47,772
You know, I'd be lying if I didn't
say, secretly I wanted you to win.

1523
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,275
That's crazy, right?

1524
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:55,196
If I wasn't a dead man,
I'd be happy, you know.

1525
01:39:56,156 --> 01:39:58,658
But you killed me
with that, Shawn.

1526
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:04,163
You know, you do what
you do, you know.

1527
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:07,542
Look, Shawn,
in a couple of minutes

1528
01:40:07,626 --> 01:40:10,086
there's going to be some men
that's going to come here,

1529
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:13,256
and you can't be here
when they get here, okay?

1530
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:37,155
Me and Zulay,
we put it on us to win.

1531
01:40:38,073 --> 01:40:39,157
Yeah.

1532
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:41,534
We knew you'd
never go for it,

1533
01:40:41,618 --> 01:40:44,287
so we didn't say
nothing, but...

1534
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,921
There's $1 million
in there.

1535
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:03,097
Business ready
for business, huh?

1536
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,891
Business ready.

1537
01:41:04,975 --> 01:41:06,267
You taught me that.

1538
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:07,894
Okay.

1539
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:18,321
That's a lot of
money in there.

1540
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:19,822
Mmm-hmm.

1541
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:23,117
No, I'm not kidding, Shawn.
That's a lot of money.

1542
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:27,997
That's a lot of IHOPs.
We're going to Birmingham.

1543
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:29,582
Okay...

1544
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,001
You know, we're going
to go and see my family.

1545
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:35,046
See what's left of it.
You know what I mean?

1546
01:41:35,714 --> 01:41:38,883
Maybe stop by Chicago,
or something.

1547
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:43,096
On your way to
Birmingham, Chicago.

1548
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,514
Right. Yeah.

1549
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:46,182
Mmm-hmm.

1550
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:50,353
Why don't you come?

1551
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:08,871
So Birmingham is
where you're thinking?

1552
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,040
Yeah.
It's where I'm from.

1553
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,837
Okay, what we
should do, then...

1554
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:18,131
Hear me out.

1555
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:21,676
I think we should go past
Birmingham to some place warm.

1556
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,302
If you're going all the way to Chicago,

1557
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,638
through Birmingham,
whatever...

1558
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:26,806
Take it to California.

1559
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,684
You know, they've got a whole lot
of great opportunities out there.

1560
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:31,102
I've been doing
a lot of reading,

1561
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,187
I'm not giving those
people this money.

1562
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:35,314
I don't give...
Unless...

1563
01:42:36,358 --> 01:42:39,318
We shouldn't give nobody none
of this. We should just go.

1564
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:40,862
"'I believe in love,'
said Grandma,

1565
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:43,781
"I'm going to go to Africa
because my boyfriend is there.

1566
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:47,702
"And then I change my mind,
maybe. Because love is beautiful. "

1567
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:50,079
Oh, my God.
It's amazing, Alabama.

1568
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:54,500
Alabama. Alabama. All the
time, Alabama, Alabama, Alabama.

1569
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:55,668
Would you
all shut up already?

1570
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:56,752
You're driving me crazy.

1571
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,422
You're making
my ears bleed in here.
