1
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,552
THE PATIENCE STONE

2
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:50,817
Al-Qahhar...

3
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,917
Al-Qahhar...

4
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,750
Try to hold your breath.

5
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,850
Just once.

6
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:21,319
If you're able to breathe,
you can hold your breath.

7
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:24,783
Hold it!

8
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:31,383
Can you hear me?

9
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,350
No.

10
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,283
Nothing.

11
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:53,652
The mullah said that after two
weeks, you would talk and hear.

12
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:55,783
Today

13
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:59,184
is the 16th day.

14
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,684
Still nothing.

15
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:04,684
What else can I do?

16
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:07,618
I've had enough of praying

17
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,083
all day long.

18
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,514
I must talk to the mullah about it.

19
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,816
Mommy!

20
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,882
Mommy!

21
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,617
I'm coming!

22
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,250
What do you want?

23
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,917
There are no bananas left.

24
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,984
We'll go buy some.

25
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,917
You're killing me.

26
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:25,017
I'll fetch some more serum.

27
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:27,683
Okay?

28
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:33,383
Come on, girls.

29
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:35,616
We're going out.

30
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:40,351
We're coming, we're coming!

31
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:42,182
Bibi!

32
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,951
Come on, let's go!

33
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:57,851
- Bibi, has the water-bearer been yet?
- No.

34
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,651
Come on!

35
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,417
Hurry.

36
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,984
Here's your medicine.

37
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:06,349
Sister, you need to pay me.

38
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,948
The pharmacist refused.
We owe him too much.

39
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,384
We'll do the same as before.

40
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,715
Water with sugar and salt in it.

41
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:17,551
It'll keep you going a few days.

42
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:25,485
I have to go see my aunt.

43
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,217
To ask her for money.

44
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:38,183
I'm going, all right?

45
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,219
Why do I ask for permission?

46
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,517
Who is it?

47
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,583
What do you want?

48
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:42,984
I'm here to see my aunt.

49
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,915
Your aunt? She moved out.

50
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,183
Where is she?

51
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:48,016
I don't know.

52
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,284
- Where?
- I don't know.

53
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,517
My aunt has left.

54
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,950
She didn't let me know.

55
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,917
No one knows where she is.

56
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:06,517
I have no one left!

57
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,286
She doesn't know what
has happened to us.

58
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:17,917
What's going to become of us?

59
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,417
What's going to become of us?

60
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,950
Don't leave me alone.

61
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:36,550
Don't leave me alone.

62
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,518
Your brothers have left, too.

63
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,018
With your mother.

64
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:52,185
The brothers so proud
to see you fight.

65
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:57,652
A mother who'd have sacrificed
herself for a lock of your hair!

66
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,652
They've all left
instead of helping me.

67
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,550
The cowards!

68
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:30,653
They didn't try to find out
why you were wounded.

69
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:35,917
They didn't know you fought

70
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:37,984
because of an insult

71
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:42,118
just because a man said to you,

72
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:50,719
"I spit in your mother's pussy!"

73
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:57,017
Someone on your own side!

74
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,648
You get insulted

75
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:07,418
and end up with a
bullet in the neck.

76
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:10,717
A fight...

77
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:13,518
Such an absurd fight!

78
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:19,983
They've all left.

79
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:27,949
The cowards!

80
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,116
Come back!

81
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:36,983
Come back, for the love of God.

82
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:43,650
My God, help him.

83
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,018
Help him!

84
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:48,517
He fought so long for you,

85
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,251
and now you abandon him like this!

86
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,451
The mullah won't come tonight.

87
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,451
He's afraid of stray bullets.

88
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,351
The water-bearer
hasn't been either.

89
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:14,618
I hope he's still alive.

90
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,084
Mommy, it's dark.

91
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:27,750
I'm scared.

92
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:30,318
I'm coming. Don't be scared.

93
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,517
I'm here.

94
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,251
Mommy, I'm thirsty.

95
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,450
Me, too.

96
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,450
So is Mommy.

97
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:01,784
There's no water left.

98
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,315
Mommy, who are you talking to?

99
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:08,217
Your father.

100
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:10,583
Why is Daddy angry?

101
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,016
He isn't,

102
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,885
but he will be if we bother him.

103
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,317
Who is it?

104
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,217
It's me, the mullah.

105
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,116
Hello, my sister.

106
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:20,184
I'm here for the prayer.

107
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,450
- Not today.
- Why not?

108
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:25,182
Since yesterday, I'm impure.

109
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:26,517
What?

110
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,650
Impure!

111
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,450
I have my period!

112
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,284
- So did Eve.
- All right, all right.

113
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:35,583
It was a Tuesday, wasn't it?

114
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,217
A Tuesday?

115
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:41,486
Perhaps... That's possible.
I'll come back in a few days' time.

116
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:44,648
If you want your husband
to recover, pray.

117
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,283
May God preserve you.

118
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:53,149
Daddy?

119
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:57,850
Are you asleep?

120
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:00,883
Take this out!

121
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,284
There's a fly!

122
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:07,117
Yuck! Get it out.

123
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:12,050
Daddy, tell us a story.

124
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:16,551
What are you doing?

125
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,116
Get out!

126
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:23,216
There's a fly in Daddy's mouth!

127
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,184
What have they done to you?

128
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:31,317
I hope they haven't hurt you.

129
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:48,352
Just a second, I want
to check on something.

130
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,416
Still not healed.

131
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:56,884
It's taking so long!

132
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,117
Can you feel anything?

133
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,650
Does it hurt?

134
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,417
No...

135
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:17,350
It doesn't hurt.

136
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:22,049
You're not in pain.

137
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,218
You're never in pain.

138
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,954
How can you live with a
bullet in your neck?

139
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,414
You're the one wounded,

140
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:36,450
and I'm the one suffering.

141
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,349
Brothers,

142
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,614
the enemy plans to
attack our homes.

143
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:43,082
Come to the mosque!

144
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,514
Our venerable commander
will give you weapons

145
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:49,818
to protect your families
and your honor!

146
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:56,684
They're handing out more weapons!

147
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,650
They're going to fight.

148
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,383
They're pleased.

149
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,351
Get up! They'll kill you!

150
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,084
Come on, get up!

151
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:24,152
I don't know what to
do with my brother.

152
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:29,985
He refuses to set
foot on the ground.

153
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:22,151
In God's name, be careful!

154
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,452
What have you done to him?
The poor thing!

155
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:28,849
Are you okay?

156
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,681
It's better here, right?

157
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:33,049
You see.

158
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:49,017
They're behind that wall.

159
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,651
The water-bearer still hasn't been.

160
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,752
The war still isn't over.

161
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,985
There'll be reprisals tonight.

162
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,718
I can't leave you here.

163
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:56,651
You should be down in the cellar.

164
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,050
But that's impossible.

165
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:03,017
Your head mustn't move.

166
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,118
If only a stray bullet
could finish you off.

167
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:09,083
I'll go back down.

168
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:12,317
I can't leave the girls alone.

169
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,984
Freeze!

170
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:43,718
Otherwise, I'll waste your ass!

171
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,483
You hear me?

172
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:50,985
- What's that in his mouth?
- No idea!

173
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:53,183
Where's your gun?

174
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:55,650
There are no guns here.

175
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:00,517
Someone else finished
him off first.

176
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:02,815
He doesn't need his ring.

177
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,151
Search the other rooms.

178
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,617
Nor his watch.

179
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,150
Go on, get lost!

180
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:24,984
Can you hear me?

181
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,684
You're dead to the world?

182
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:34,450
I'm talking to you.

183
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,283
Or you're dead?

184
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:43,817
Guys, where are you?

185
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:45,850
What are you doing?

186
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:48,917
Look, he has a wife.

187
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:52,349
- I know.
- How? Did he talk?

188
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,315
He took his ring!

189
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:55,950
Let's go!

190
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,850
Where's his wife?

191
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:01,451
There's no one in the house.

192
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,650
I think I know him.

193
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:06,683
- Is he one of ours?
- I think so.

194
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,483
He's a good Muslim.

195
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,614
We didn't bomb the
neighborhood for nothing!

196
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:17,982
Let's go!

197
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:53,718
Mommy, have you seen this?

198
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,018
What is it?

199
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:58,083
Go inside.

200
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,884
What on earth?

201
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:11,548
Your wedding ring?

202
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,050
Your watch?

203
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:15,884
Was someone here?

204
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,684
Thieves?

205
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:25,017
They searched the house?

206
00:25:27,515 --> 00:25:28,949
Bibi djan!

207
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:31,083
Bibi!

208
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,015
Did you see anyone in my house?

209
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:35,617
King of kindness!

210
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:38,384
I weep over my loneliness

211
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:42,349
It is time to return

212
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,915
King of kindness!

213
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:46,885
I weep over my loneliness...

214
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:49,616
The king was here.

215
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,816
He caressed me.

216
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:56,514
Do you have bread, my daughter?

217
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:59,282
I gave all my bread to the king.

218
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:00,748
Where are they?

219
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:03,451
- Your husband, your son?
- Right there.

220
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:05,183
In the house.

221
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:09,153
They're angry. They won't
speak to me anymore.

222
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:11,115
They'll talk to you.

223
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:13,317
- Where are they?
- Come and see...

224
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:15,049
Look!

225
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,185
My heart grows impatient
at your absence...

226
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:26,683
My daughter...

227
00:26:27,316 --> 00:26:29,284
The king caressed her...

228
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,951
I can't go on.

229
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:39,051
I can't stay here any longer!

230
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,915
Come on, girls!

231
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,717
Get your things ready!

232
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,216
We're leaving!

233
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:48,184
We're leaving right now!

234
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:01,717
I have to find my aunt.

235
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:03,717
Go to hell!

236
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:50,950
- My doll!
- Stay here.

237
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,350
You again?

238
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:05,581
- I beg you, tell me.
- I already answered you!

239
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:08,017
Tell me or I won't move from here.

240
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:11,283
I'm staying here!

241
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,150
Thank you.

242
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:29,249
Let's go.

243
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:30,815
Up you get!

244
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,151
Right, I'm leaving.

245
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,683
I'll bring her back tomorrow.

246
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,984
You can come in now.

247
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,117
I've been lucky.

248
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,883
I've finally found my aunt.

249
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:21,384
She lives in the north of the city.

250
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:25,185
I didn't know about
a lot of her life.

251
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:28,351
You knew that I'd been married?

252
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:35,117
Yes, I did hear that.

253
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:40,352
My parents married me
to a very rich man...

254
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:42,016
A fool.

255
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:48,587
Two years later, we realized
that I was sterile.

256
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,685
I was no use at all.

257
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:55,217
My husband sent me to his parents.

258
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:58,248
To become their servant.

259
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:01,148
When my father-in-law
found out I was sterile,

260
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,448
he came to fuck me every night.

261
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:05,715
One evening, I snapped.

262
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,884
I couldn't take any more.

263
00:30:09,882 --> 00:30:12,851
Using his own pickaxe

264
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:16,718
that I had hidden under my bed,

265
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,283
I split his skull open.

266
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:21,484
He died instantly.

267
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:24,950
I fled.

268
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:28,985
I made them believe
I'd killed myself.

269
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,283
I vanished.

270
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,149
I left the children there.

271
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:38,084
She gave me a little money.

272
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:42,883
I think...

273
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:46,783
That...

274
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:49,651
I can't do anything more for you.

275
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:57,585
I heard our neighborhood
is the front line.

276
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:01,817
They'll destroy everything here.

277
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:07,284
You knew that, didn't you?

278
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:12,717
You knew it very well.

279
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:15,750
But you didn't tell me.

280
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:19,017
You knew it.

281
00:31:19,482 --> 00:31:21,483
His brothers knew it, too.

282
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:24,448
That's why they all left.

283
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,451
You know why they didn't take you?

284
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:29,383
Your husband was alive.

285
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:35,683
Because you were alive.

286
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:42,452
If you had been dead...

287
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:47,784
One of your brothers
would have married me.

288
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:55,352
Perhaps they wished you were dead.

289
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,451
They could have fucked me...

290
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:02,516
At last.

291
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:15,685
Your brothers have
always wanted me.

292
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,318
The three years you were away,

293
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:26,617
when I washed,

294
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:29,985
they watched me through
the bathhouse fanlight.

295
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:32,451
I could hear them panting.

296
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:35,817
They were masturbating.

297
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:44,384
I don't know what I'm saying.

298
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:46,850
I'm sick.

299
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:09,418
You're listening to me for once.

300
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,551
You've never listened to me.

301
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:16,651
We've been married 10 years.

302
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:19,951
How long have we
actually lived together?

303
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,949
Two years?

304
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:24,517
Three years?

305
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:30,484
You were never there.

306
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:32,484
Even at the wedding!

307
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,985
Like all heroes, you were absent.

308
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:41,084
At our engagement,

309
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:45,350
a photo stood in for you.

310
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:51,250
I was proud.

311
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:56,185
Proud to be engaged
to a hero at 17!

312
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:00,817
Your mother would say,

313
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,284
"Victory is coming soon!

314
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:05,850
"My son will return!

315
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:08,251
"Victorious!"

316
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:10,450
When she saw

317
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,250
that victory was still
a long way off,

318
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,051
she must have said,

319
00:34:18,316 --> 00:34:23,721
"Leaving a fiancée so long at
her parents' is dangerous.

320
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,816
"She has to marry."

321
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:30,619
That's why you got
married to his dagger.

322
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:38,350
I got married

323
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:41,784
to you

324
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,484
without you.

325
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,785
In the meantime, I had to
sleep with your mother.

326
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:53,151
She watched over my virginity.

327
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:58,451
The day you returned
from the front,

328
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:04,251
when I saw you for
the first time...

329
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:16,583
I remember it so well

330
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:22,251
like it was yesterday.

331
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:25,317
You were just like you are now.

332
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:29,984
Not a word, not a look.

333
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:34,717
You sat down next to me,

334
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,018
indifferent.

335
00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:41,483
But me,

336
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:44,317
I was watching you on the sly.

337
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:50,586
I knew nothing about men,
about husbands...

338
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,484
I watched your every gesture.

339
00:35:57,849 --> 00:35:59,183
But you...

340
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:02,751
You were still thinking
about the war.

341
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:13,385
I wonder if you even
noticed me that day.

342
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:24,151
I have to leave.

343
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,051
I've talked a lot.

344
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:32,484
I have to see to the girls.

345
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:56,019
My only example of married
life were my parents.

346
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,650
What an example!

347
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:03,414
The only thing that my father
was ever interested in

348
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:05,183
were his quails,

349
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:07,283
his fighting quails.

350
00:37:07,716 --> 00:37:09,484
I would often see him

351
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:12,284
kiss his quails,

352
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:14,881
but never my mother,

353
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:16,481
my sisters,

354
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:17,749
Me.

355
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:19,383
Never.

356
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:22,318
He would always sit cross-legged,

357
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:27,048
take his quail in one hand and
rest it against his lower belly.

358
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,648
With his other hand,
he'd stroke it...

359
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:31,650
He'd stroke it for hours.

360
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:35,385
Even if we had visitors,
he'd keep on doing it.

361
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:02,284
If he lost at a quail fight,

362
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:04,116
he would go mad.

363
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,217
As soon as he got back,

364
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:09,815
he would look for any
excuse to beat us.

365
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:12,685
As if it were our fault.

366
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,683
He would hit my mother,

367
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,116
my sisters.

368
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:20,117
I hated his quails.

369
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:24,818
But he was so proud of them.

370
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:29,352
It was as if they were
all he lived for.

371
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:33,083
I remember...

372
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:38,219
I was nine or 10.

373
00:38:39,682 --> 00:38:41,617
It was very cold.

374
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:44,917
I saw my father

375
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:48,115
put one of his quails

376
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:49,650
in his trousers.

377
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,118
Be gone with you!

378
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,450
For a long time, I thought

379
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:59,952
all men had a quail
between their legs.

380
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:04,719
One day, he must have won
a lot of money at a fight.

381
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:06,650
Well, I suppose so.

382
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:09,881
He had bought a quail,

383
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:11,581
a very expensive one.

384
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,251
He trained it for weeks on end.

385
00:39:18,582 --> 00:39:19,916
But he lost.

386
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,981
There you are at last!

387
00:39:29,982 --> 00:39:32,584
Hello. May I?

388
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:37,453
- Brought your quail?
- Yes, I have it with me.

389
00:39:39,016 --> 00:39:41,182
Your bird's running off!

390
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:43,251
That's it, you lose!

391
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:50,818
Come on, hand over the money!

392
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:54,617
He had staked too much.

393
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,284
He couldn't afford to pay.

394
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:04,786
So he gave away my elder
sister to honor his bet.

395
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:08,752
My sister, aged 12,
left with a man of 40.

396
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:22,616
I was scared

397
00:40:24,816 --> 00:40:29,320
of becoming the stake
in a bet, too.

398
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:32,950
I was really scared.

399
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:37,816
Guess what I did.

400
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:42,451
A cat used to come to our garden.

401
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:46,082
One day,

402
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:50,451
I took the quail from its cage.

403
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,851
I gave it to the cat.

404
00:40:54,716 --> 00:40:58,953
It carried it off to a
corner to eat it in peace.

405
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:01,116
I followed it.

406
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:04,318
But the cat turned on me.

407
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:07,450
It scratched my face.

408
00:41:12,682 --> 00:41:14,717
Right here.

409
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:24,084
You never asked me about this scar.

410
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,818
Why am I telling you all this?

411
00:41:36,382 --> 00:41:39,484
I never wanted anyone to know,

412
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,250
not even my sisters,

413
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:43,984
not even my aunt.

414
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:47,784
It's because of you.

415
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:51,851
You're compelling me to talk.

416
00:41:53,615 --> 00:41:55,750
You hear everything I say.

417
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,951
I'm sure of that!

418
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,484
You just want me to talk,

419
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:04,817
to tell you everything.

420
00:42:21,716 --> 00:42:23,784
Go to hell!

421
00:42:41,882 --> 00:42:44,117
Dear God, forgive me.

422
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:06,150
Leave us.

423
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:14,284
What's happened?

424
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:18,949
Are you scared?

425
00:43:20,716 --> 00:43:22,217
Scared?

426
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:25,784
No, I have a strange feeling.

427
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:28,116
I have the impression...

428
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:30,784
A bad feeling?

429
00:43:31,216 --> 00:43:33,317
A diabolic sensation?

430
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:39,450
Diabolic?

431
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,550
No.

432
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:47,250
Ever since he was wounded

433
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,618
and I tell him everything,

434
00:43:50,582 --> 00:43:53,951
I feel delivered of a burden.

435
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:00,784
Strange, isn't it?

436
00:44:01,582 --> 00:44:05,548
What you're saying reminds
me of my childhood.

437
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:08,885
My father talked about a stone.

438
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:11,618
A magical and legendary stone.

439
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,453
He'd say, "If you find this stone,
set it down before you,

440
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:19,715
"tell it of your suffering
and your secrets.

441
00:44:19,716 --> 00:44:21,284
"The stone listens.

442
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:26,453
"Everything you never
dare say to others,

443
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:28,950
"say it to the stone. Talk to it.

444
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:31,417
"It listens to all your secrets.

445
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,950
"It hears everything.

446
00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:37,248
"And, one day,

447
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:39,015
"the stone shatters.

448
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:40,951
"It falls to pieces.

449
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:44,118
"And, that day, you're delivered,

450
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,318
"delivered of all your pain."

451
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:51,581
What's it called?

452
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:53,150
The stone?

453
00:44:53,582 --> 00:44:55,016
The patience stone.

454
00:44:56,149 --> 00:44:58,017
The patience stone.

455
00:45:33,515 --> 00:45:35,817
Yesterday, I nearly abandoned you.

456
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:40,118
I had the impression that
you wanted that, too.

457
00:45:40,582 --> 00:45:43,518
That idea comforted me,

458
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:45,817
relieved me.

459
00:45:47,183 --> 00:45:49,651
But, this morning, I realized

460
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,585
that it wasn't your
death that relieved me.

461
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:56,350
It was something else.

462
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,984
It was the fact of talking,

463
00:46:05,816 --> 00:46:07,917
talking to you,

464
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:17,285
revealing my secrets,

465
00:46:22,415 --> 00:46:24,350
revealing all my secrets to you.

466
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:28,652
You have stayed alive
just to listen to me.

467
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:33,618
You've been living for three weeks
with a bullet in your neck.

468
00:46:33,682 --> 00:46:36,985
You're living to deliver
me of all my suffering,

469
00:46:38,515 --> 00:46:42,685
of everything I've kept in my
heart in 10 years of marriage.

470
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:46,284
In 10 years!

471
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:52,084
You've grown old so fast!

472
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:56,284
I've never kissed you.

473
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,617
Never.

474
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,650
And now...

475
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:05,252
I can do anything with you.

476
00:47:07,249 --> 00:47:09,150
I can do everything.

477
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,785
I can talk about everything...

478
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:36,283
Everything.

479
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:39,583
My patience stone.

480
00:47:57,415 --> 00:48:00,250
Do you remember our first night?

481
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:03,751
Without a word, you pounced on me,

482
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,817
excited,

483
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:09,983
panicked.

484
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:16,215
Your mother

485
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:18,117
was keeping an eye out.

486
00:48:20,216 --> 00:48:25,621
She was dying to know if the
virgin had been deflowered,

487
00:48:27,882 --> 00:48:31,151
if she could have a
grandson or not.

488
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:39,917
A few months later,

489
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:44,452
when she saw that
I wasn't getting pregnant,

490
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:46,950
she started complaining,

491
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:50,651
thinking I was sterile.

492
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:54,484
Sterile!

493
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,918
She'd always come looking for me.

494
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:06,417
She'd pester me.

495
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:15,752
She'd urge you to
take a second wife.

496
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:18,916
And you...

497
00:49:24,249 --> 00:49:28,286
You don't know what I had
to do to make you keep me.

498
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:34,951
If you had known,
you'd have killed me.

499
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:43,618
I didn't want you to abandon me.

500
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:48,784
If you had abandoned me,

501
00:49:49,183 --> 00:49:51,818
everyone would have rejected me.

502
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:54,518
My father, my mother...

503
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:57,183
Everyone.

504
00:50:00,382 --> 00:50:03,084
I still have so much to tell you.

505
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:10,284
Someone's in the yard!

506
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:34,085
They're burying the
neighbors in their garden.

507
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:36,316
Sister?

508
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:47,983
Hello, sister.

509
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,016
Hello.

510
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:53,483
Are you well?

511
00:50:53,882 --> 00:50:54,948
I'm alive.

512
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:56,950
How is your husband?

513
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,450
He's alive.

514
00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:01,215
They'll be launching more rockets.

515
00:51:01,216 --> 00:51:02,750
Stay indoors.

516
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:04,817
May God preserve you.

517
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:07,617
May God preserve you.

518
00:51:23,649 --> 00:51:26,117
There'll be more bombing tonight.

519
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:28,083
I have to leave.

520
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,518
The militia are everywhere.

521
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:20,784
They're searching houses.

522
00:52:23,882 --> 00:52:26,584
If they find you, they'll kill you.

523
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:32,250
The cellar is flooded.

524
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,285
I won't let them kill you.

525
00:53:23,049 --> 00:53:24,450
Your head!

526
00:53:57,515 --> 00:53:58,782
Just a second.

527
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:12,084
I won't let them kill you.

528
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,516
Go back in!

529
00:54:53,016 --> 00:54:54,450
Sit down!

530
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,450
Sit down!

531
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:07,016
Are you alone?

532
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:11,816
Are you alone?

533
00:55:12,582 --> 00:55:13,816
No.

534
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:18,317
God is with me.

535
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:28,284
Hey, you. It's me!

536
00:55:34,515 --> 00:55:35,749
Come in!

537
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:50,817
What's going on?

538
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,484
Ceasefire.

539
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,317
What?

540
00:55:58,016 --> 00:56:00,117
Ceasefire.

541
00:56:00,283 --> 00:56:03,085
- Until when?
- I... I don't know.

542
00:56:03,716 --> 00:56:06,985
Go and stand guard.
We'll camp here tonight.

543
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,318
- Go on!
- Cigarette.

544
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,650
Here! Go!

545
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:26,516
Go!

546
00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:29,683
All alone...

547
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:32,517
Aren't you afraid?

548
00:56:36,183 --> 00:56:37,915
Don't you have anyone?

549
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,951
No, I'm a widow.

550
00:56:42,183 --> 00:56:43,751
Do you have children?

551
00:56:45,249 --> 00:56:46,516
Yes.

552
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:48,450
Two daughters.

553
00:56:49,749 --> 00:56:51,684
Where are they?

554
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:56,681
At my aunt's.

555
00:56:56,682 --> 00:56:58,783
Why are you here alone then?

556
00:57:00,782 --> 00:57:02,049
I...

557
00:57:03,216 --> 00:57:04,950
I work.

558
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:08,752
I have to earn my living. I have
two young daughters to feed.

559
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:10,984
What's your job?

560
00:57:13,716 --> 00:57:15,450
I sell my body.

561
00:57:16,382 --> 00:57:17,582
What?

562
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:21,715
My body.

563
00:57:21,716 --> 00:57:23,083
I sell my body.

564
00:57:23,716 --> 00:57:25,284
I don't understand.

565
00:57:26,682 --> 00:57:29,684
I sell my body for men's pleasure.

566
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:32,284
Shame on you, insolent,
debauched woman.

567
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,948
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Of what?

568
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:37,548
- Of what you say.
- Of what I say or of what I do?

569
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:39,282
Don't smooth-talk me.

570
00:57:39,283 --> 00:57:41,715
You understand?
Are you a Muslim or not?

571
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:43,115
A Muslim? Why?

572
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:46,282
I'll stone you right
here on the spot!

573
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:47,349
Insolent creature!

574
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,619
I curse your father!
You soil the name of Muslims!

575
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:53,781
They're being killed
and you sell yourself.

576
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:55,616
I'll kill you!

577
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,450
I curse your father, bitch!

578
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:00,183
Whore!

579
00:58:24,382 --> 00:58:26,483
Forgive me.

580
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:32,953
That's enough, go and
squabble elsewhere!

581
00:58:33,183 --> 00:58:35,548
Now, what was I saying? Ah, yes!

582
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:38,915
You were right to say that
or they'd have raped you.

583
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,715
Come on in.

584
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:43,485
- That's what I thought.
- You were right.

585
00:58:44,216 --> 00:58:46,351
They never rape a whore.

586
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:51,921
You know why?
Because that kind of man

587
00:58:52,016 --> 00:58:53,948
doesn't put his dirty thing

588
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:56,618
in a hole that's been
used thousands of times.

589
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,548
But raping a virgin

590
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:03,051
makes them proud.

591
00:59:03,816 --> 00:59:05,917
It proves their virility.

592
00:59:06,515 --> 00:59:08,349
They're stronger.

593
00:59:10,682 --> 00:59:12,316
Stay here tonight.

594
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,519
I'm afraid he'll run out of serum.

595
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:18,850
Have some tea then.

596
00:59:50,482 --> 00:59:52,884
I wanted to come back to you.

597
00:59:54,016 --> 00:59:55,650
To stay with you.

598
00:59:58,716 --> 01:00:01,518
I'm afraid something bad
will happen to you again.

599
01:00:05,183 --> 01:00:08,085
The girls are safe with my aunt.

600
01:00:12,283 --> 01:00:14,184
They love my aunt.

601
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:20,918
Every evening,
she tells them a story.

602
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:23,917
What would they do here?

603
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:26,284
There's no water or electricity.

604
01:00:27,482 --> 01:00:28,916
Halt!

605
01:00:46,316 --> 01:00:48,918
I still have so much to tell you.

606
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:53,751
Maybe I'll tell you everything.

607
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:58,551
I don't know how you'll take it,

608
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,318
what you'll say about it.

609
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,548
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

610
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:07,749
All right?

611
01:01:08,816 --> 01:01:10,684
I'm tired.

612
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:14,750
I have to sleep.

613
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:00,717
Who are you?

614
01:02:02,982 --> 01:02:05,784
- How... How much?
- What do you want?

615
01:02:06,283 --> 01:02:07,550
What?

616
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:12,349
How much is it?

617
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:13,550
What?

618
01:02:17,116 --> 01:02:18,581
How... How...

619
01:02:18,582 --> 01:02:19,883
...much is it?

620
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:24,950
But I'm not a whore!

621
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:52,015
Is it over?

622
01:02:52,016 --> 01:02:53,216
Shut...

623
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:55,384
Shut up!

624
01:02:56,515 --> 01:02:58,183
Was it your first time?

625
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:03,550
Get up now!

626
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,149
Or...

627
01:03:08,649 --> 01:03:10,550
Let me get up.

628
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:36,117
Are you from here?

629
01:05:40,449 --> 01:05:41,850
The poor boy...

630
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:45,417
He made me think of you.

631
01:05:46,216 --> 01:05:48,551
His heart was beating so hard.

632
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:52,184
You were as clumsy as he was.

633
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:56,050
I didn't know what to do.

634
01:05:56,216 --> 01:05:59,786
I had no idea of what I had to do.

635
01:06:01,216 --> 01:06:04,452
I thought the way you did
it was the right way.

636
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:07,884
I felt nothing,

637
01:06:08,316 --> 01:06:10,618
only pain.

638
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:16,519
Afterwards, I started
pleasuring myself.

639
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:22,286
Some nights, when you
slept, I'd caress myself.

640
01:06:25,216 --> 01:06:28,952
One night, you woke up
asking me what I was doing.

641
01:06:29,016 --> 01:06:30,350
I told you

642
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:32,417
that I had a fever.

643
01:06:33,682 --> 01:06:36,217
I was hot and drenched in sweat.

644
01:06:37,382 --> 01:06:40,418
You sent me to sleep
with the children.

645
01:06:43,716 --> 01:06:45,617
My aunt is right to say,

646
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:50,619
"Those who don't know how
to make love make war."

647
01:07:17,782 --> 01:07:19,583
The mullah came back.

648
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:23,284
I lied to him again.

649
01:07:24,849 --> 01:07:27,885
I told him I still had my period.

650
01:07:28,316 --> 01:07:30,184
He wasn't pleased.

651
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:33,050
He left again, complaining.

652
01:07:34,515 --> 01:07:37,117
The poor man has become a coward.

653
01:07:42,283 --> 01:07:44,351
I've lied to you, too.

654
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:47,784
On our first night,

655
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:53,085
you thought it was the
blood of my virginity.

656
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,351
But I had my period.

657
01:07:58,649 --> 01:08:00,550
I kept that from you,

658
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:04,618
on my aunt's advice.

659
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:09,118
I was a virgin but I was afraid...

660
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:13,184
Afraid of not losing any blood.

661
01:08:22,283 --> 01:08:23,349
Out!

662
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,550
Come on!

663
01:08:26,515 --> 01:08:27,782
Get out!

664
01:08:28,615 --> 01:08:31,048
Go and play in the garden.

665
01:08:31,049 --> 01:08:32,516
Come on!

666
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:42,452
- What are you doing?
- You can see what!

667
01:08:42,716 --> 01:08:44,684
It's time now.

668
01:08:45,016 --> 01:08:46,981
Take it off!

669
01:08:46,982 --> 01:08:50,618
You've been stringing me
along for three days!

670
01:08:51,049 --> 01:08:53,282
Show a little modesty!

671
01:08:53,283 --> 01:08:55,351
You're kidding!

672
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:17,585
- Can you deliver me some water?
- All right.

673
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:30,417
I have a little money.

674
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:34,251
I've bought serum and eye drops.

675
01:10:06,782 --> 01:10:09,351
I've bought food, too.

676
01:10:10,449 --> 01:10:12,648
I'll wash the sheet.

677
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:14,116
I won't be long.

678
01:10:41,049 --> 01:10:42,950
What do you want now?

679
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:54,583
I felt pity for him.

680
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:02,185
At one point, I got the giggles.

681
01:13:03,482 --> 01:13:07,285
He thought I was making fun
of him. He nearly left.

682
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:11,617
Do you know why I laughed?

683
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,784
Because of my aunt.

684
01:13:18,549 --> 01:13:21,384
I told her about that boy,

685
01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:24,917
his stammer,

686
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:27,683
and how he came too fast.

687
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:29,783
My aunt told me,

688
01:13:30,316 --> 01:13:31,950
"Advise him

689
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:37,520
"to fuck with his tongue
and talk with his dick."

690
01:13:38,382 --> 01:13:41,618
As soon as I remembered
those words,

691
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:43,583
I laughed!

692
01:13:46,682 --> 01:13:49,918
Then I thought of you
and I stopped laughing.

693
01:13:51,149 --> 01:13:55,119
It's dangerous to hurt a young
man's feelings like that.

694
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:59,753
They only think of their
dicks and nothing else.

695
01:14:01,882 --> 01:14:03,683
Anyhow, it's over now.

696
01:14:07,183 --> 01:14:08,617
Water-bearer!

697
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,784
Water-bearer!

698
01:14:12,216 --> 01:14:13,416
The toilets!

699
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,284
They're empty!

700
01:14:32,949 --> 01:14:35,117
The boy's a fast learner.

701
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,483
He isn't like you.

702
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:43,319
He accepts everything
that I teach him.

703
01:14:43,716 --> 01:14:45,684
It doesn't anger him.

704
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:53,118
You'd have killed me if
I'd said such things.

705
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:58,152
All that mattered to
you was your soul.

706
01:14:58,682 --> 01:15:01,451
Your soul, your honor.

707
01:15:02,183 --> 01:15:04,752
And what was I? Nothing.

708
01:15:05,749 --> 01:15:07,617
A piece of meat.

709
01:15:11,615 --> 01:15:13,449
With that boy...

710
01:15:16,615 --> 01:15:18,516
I take his hand.

711
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,617
I place it on my breasts,

712
01:15:22,682 --> 01:15:24,483
between my thighs.

713
01:15:25,549 --> 01:15:27,350
He doesn't resist.

714
01:15:28,782 --> 01:15:30,917
I guide him.

715
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:43,283
Where are the prayer beads?

716
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:51,584
Why am I telling you this?

717
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:56,350
The other women never
talk about it!

718
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,517
Never.

719
01:15:59,415 --> 01:16:00,849
But me...

720
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:04,650
I'm possessed

721
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:07,517
by a satanic spirit.

722
01:16:07,949 --> 01:16:09,583
The Koran?

723
01:16:11,582 --> 01:16:13,517
Have you seen the Koran?

724
01:16:26,016 --> 01:16:28,318
Which sura had I got to?

725
01:16:28,615 --> 01:16:30,316
The peacock's feather?

726
01:16:31,415 --> 01:16:33,149
The peacock's feather?

727
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,917
Where is it?

728
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:39,585
It holds all my secrets.

729
01:16:49,116 --> 01:16:50,784
Forgive me.

730
01:16:51,249 --> 01:16:52,850
Forgive me.

731
01:16:53,049 --> 01:16:55,784
I shouldn't talk about all that.

732
01:17:06,415 --> 01:17:09,250
Today, I wanted to
tell you everything.

733
01:17:11,749 --> 01:17:13,450
I couldn't manage it.

734
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:18,150
Someone has mended the gate.

735
01:19:28,982 --> 01:19:31,083
Last night, I had a dream.

736
01:19:33,449 --> 01:19:35,717
I gave birth to a boy.

737
01:19:37,849 --> 01:19:40,718
His face was all wrinkled,

738
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:45,084
like my grandfather's.

739
01:20:00,183 --> 01:20:01,414
It's you!

740
01:20:01,415 --> 01:20:03,848
Hello.

741
01:20:03,849 --> 01:20:05,015
Hello.

742
01:20:05,016 --> 01:20:07,082
Not today, I can't.

743
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:08,851
Not today.

744
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,915
Only...

745
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,684
No, no.

746
01:20:23,415 --> 01:20:25,049
I can't.

747
01:20:25,415 --> 01:20:28,017
- Today, I can't.
- I...

748
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:31,448
Mended the gate.

749
01:20:31,449 --> 01:20:33,350
So that was you?

750
01:20:33,849 --> 01:20:35,316
Thank you.

751
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:39,652
Can... Can I... Come in?

752
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:43,219
No, I said no, I have to work.

753
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,981
One... Minute.

754
01:20:56,982 --> 01:20:59,248
I know we can do it quickly.

755
01:20:59,249 --> 01:21:01,217
But I have work to do.

756
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,485
I'm expecting someone else.

757
01:21:20,316 --> 01:21:22,718
Only...

758
01:21:23,283 --> 01:21:26,719
Only to...

759
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:29,517
Talk.

760
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,283
Go on in.

761
01:21:53,749 --> 01:21:55,717
What do you want from me?

762
01:22:05,183 --> 01:22:08,219
I told you that I couldn't today.

763
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:34,818
I have to see someone else.

764
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:44,217
All right, tell me.

765
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:55,781
The commander from...

766
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:57,815
From... The other day...

767
01:22:57,816 --> 01:22:59,884
What's this on your body?

768
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:03,083
What is it?

769
01:23:03,515 --> 01:23:07,718
It's a burn. A... Cigarette burn.

770
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:11,514
Who did this?

771
01:23:11,515 --> 01:23:14,581
The commander...

772
01:23:14,582 --> 01:23:17,384
Who came here the other day.

773
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:22,851
I have burns on my back, too.

774
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:48,018
The bastard.

775
01:23:48,515 --> 01:23:51,317
The son of a bitch.

776
01:23:57,249 --> 01:23:59,818
That commander who spat at me.

777
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:02,051
The one who wanted to kill me.

778
01:24:03,816 --> 01:24:06,585
You know what he does to that boy?

779
01:24:08,316 --> 01:24:10,217
He was an orphan.

780
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:14,385
He found him on the street.

781
01:24:17,582 --> 01:24:20,648
By day, he puts a
Kalashnikov in his hands,

782
01:24:20,649 --> 01:24:23,585
and, at night, bells on his feet.

783
01:24:28,782 --> 01:24:31,484
His body is covered with burns.

784
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:34,684
His chest...

785
01:24:35,149 --> 01:24:36,683
His back...

786
01:24:40,649 --> 01:24:43,518
He burns him with the
barrel of his gun

787
01:24:44,782 --> 01:24:46,650
and with his cigarettes.

788
01:24:50,649 --> 01:24:52,083
The bastard!

789
01:24:55,582 --> 01:24:57,383
The son of a devil!

790
01:25:00,116 --> 01:25:02,414
Allah asked Muhammad to say,

791
01:25:02,415 --> 01:25:04,481
"If I knew the hidden meaning,

792
01:25:04,482 --> 01:25:07,848
"I would have made kindness mine

793
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:10,414
"and turned evil away from me."

794
01:25:10,415 --> 01:25:13,748
One day, the Prophet
said to his wife,

795
01:25:13,749 --> 01:25:16,848
"Oh, Khadija, I am
going to go mad soon.

796
01:25:16,849 --> 01:25:18,550
"I am possessed.

797
01:25:18,615 --> 01:25:21,514
"I hear voices coming
from the stones.

798
01:25:21,515 --> 01:25:24,614
"At night, a monster
approaches me."

799
01:25:24,615 --> 01:25:28,915
So Khadija told him,

800
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:33,282
"Warn me when it next appears."

801
01:25:33,283 --> 01:25:37,182
And, one day, the Prophet said,

802
01:25:37,183 --> 01:25:39,681
"Khadija, I see it."

803
01:25:39,682 --> 01:25:44,815
So Khadija bared her hair

804
01:25:44,816 --> 01:25:47,818
and asked Muhammad,
"Do you still see it?"

805
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:50,148
"No, I don't see it now."

806
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:53,681
So Khadija said,

807
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:57,215
"That wasn't a monster or a jinn.
That was an angel.

808
01:25:57,216 --> 01:26:01,248
"A jinn would have had
no respect for my hair.

809
01:26:01,249 --> 01:26:03,614
"It wouldn't have Fled..."

810
01:26:03,615 --> 01:26:06,250
What bothers you about that story?

811
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:08,884
That the Prophet says,

812
01:26:08,949 --> 01:26:10,915
"If I knew the hidden meaning,

813
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,614
"I would have made kindness mine

814
01:26:13,615 --> 01:26:15,815
"and turned evil away from me."

815
01:26:15,816 --> 01:26:17,183
So?

816
01:26:18,816 --> 01:26:21,585
Evil could have
attained the Prophet?

817
01:26:21,615 --> 01:26:24,350
My girl, the Prophet was a man,

818
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:26,917
an envoy of God,

819
01:26:27,249 --> 01:26:29,484
like the hundred
thousand other prophets.

820
01:26:29,682 --> 01:26:31,781
What did Khadija want?

821
01:26:31,782 --> 01:26:33,383
Khadija?

822
01:26:33,716 --> 01:26:37,719
She didn't want the
Prophet to feel...

823
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,283
Bewitched.

824
01:26:39,749 --> 01:26:42,318
She wanted to open his eyes.

825
01:26:43,482 --> 01:26:46,418
She wanted to tear him
away from his illusions.

826
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:48,850
She wanted...

827
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:53,719
Muhammad to attain his
prophetical truth.

828
01:26:56,249 --> 01:26:59,552
Khadija is the one who
should have been a prophet.

829
01:27:06,283 --> 01:27:08,918
Everything's calm today.

830
01:27:09,415 --> 01:27:12,551
Maybe they'll raise the curfew.

831
01:27:13,515 --> 01:27:15,683
I can stay late.

832
01:27:17,016 --> 01:27:19,184
I'm very tired.

833
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:22,584
I didn't sleep well last night.

834
01:27:32,283 --> 01:27:33,817
Who's that?

835
01:28:35,016 --> 01:28:38,018
Someone just dropped this off.

836
01:28:51,749 --> 01:28:53,517
He's gone mad.

837
01:28:55,415 --> 01:28:57,483
He's lost his mind.

838
01:29:03,183 --> 01:29:05,985
I should have killed
him the first day.

839
01:29:07,816 --> 01:29:09,417
I couldn't.

840
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:20,252
You don't mind me
telling you about him?

841
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:22,748
That I welcome him here?

842
01:29:22,749 --> 01:29:25,184
I have no illusions.

843
01:29:25,816 --> 01:29:27,684
Don't worry.

844
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:33,885
I know he can become horrible,

845
01:29:35,049 --> 01:29:36,249
like you.

846
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:41,386
If you come back to life, you will
become the same animal again.

847
01:29:44,582 --> 01:29:45,816
Right?

848
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:53,017
Or you'll change.

849
01:29:55,183 --> 01:29:56,751
You'll change.

850
01:29:57,615 --> 01:29:59,082
I'm sure of it.

851
01:30:04,515 --> 01:30:07,017
You'll smile at me.

852
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:10,317
You'll kiss me.

853
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:14,851
You'll take me in your arms.

854
01:30:17,982 --> 01:30:21,818
You'll make love to
me the way I want.

855
01:30:25,283 --> 01:30:27,351
You'll love me.

856
01:30:35,016 --> 01:30:38,652
Because now you know
all my secrets.

857
01:30:41,482 --> 01:30:43,083
You and me,

858
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:46,651
we're not the same anymore.

859
01:31:04,982 --> 01:31:06,917
What am I doing?

860
01:31:09,682 --> 01:31:12,084
My God, what am I doing?

861
01:31:15,016 --> 01:31:17,051
God, help me!

862
01:31:17,316 --> 01:31:18,516
The Koran!

863
01:31:19,449 --> 01:31:21,317
Where's the Koran?

864
01:31:22,049 --> 01:31:24,017
Someone's taken it.

865
01:31:24,415 --> 01:31:25,882
My God!

866
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:30,717
Help me.

867
01:31:31,382 --> 01:31:33,050
I'm going mad.

868
01:31:35,249 --> 01:31:36,683
No, no.

869
01:31:40,216 --> 01:31:42,551
No, I'm not mad.

870
01:31:42,816 --> 01:31:44,650
Neither mad,

871
01:31:45,615 --> 01:31:47,449
nor bewitched,

872
01:31:47,782 --> 01:31:49,483
nor possessed.

873
01:31:50,582 --> 01:31:53,017
I don't need anyone.

874
01:31:53,615 --> 01:31:55,216
Anyone.

875
01:32:18,782 --> 01:32:22,118
I thought it would be
hard to say it to you.

876
01:32:22,549 --> 01:32:24,350
Impossible even.

877
01:32:25,816 --> 01:32:27,317
But now...

878
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:32,885
Now, with you,
everything is possible.

879
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:35,349
We can do everything,

880
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:37,516
say everything.

881
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:44,318
Where shall I begin?

882
01:32:46,216 --> 01:32:48,151
With our first child.

883
01:32:50,549 --> 01:32:54,786
When I was pregnant,
I prayed I'd have a miscarriage.

884
01:32:55,882 --> 01:32:58,284
That child carried my secret.

885
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:00,817
He was my secret.

886
01:33:03,549 --> 01:33:07,486
At the birth, I wanted to
stifle him between my legs...

887
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,948
But they gave me opium.

888
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:13,518
I was too dazed to do it.

889
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:18,818
On seeing it was a girl,
I felt reassured.

890
01:33:19,582 --> 01:33:22,818
A girl wouldn't give away
her mother's secret.

891
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:30,386
Do you know why
I didn't want that child?

892
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,683
She wasn't yours.

893
01:34:01,782 --> 01:34:04,050
Neither was the second.

894
01:34:06,449 --> 01:34:09,351
I wasn't sterile. You were.

895
01:34:10,249 --> 01:34:11,616
Nobody knew that.

896
01:34:13,749 --> 01:34:17,185
Your mother didn't want to know.
Remember?

897
01:34:19,415 --> 01:34:22,484
She wanted you to
take another wife.

898
01:34:23,716 --> 01:34:25,350
What would have become of me?

899
01:34:26,549 --> 01:34:29,082
My aunt came to my rescue.

900
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,218
I asked her for advice.

901
01:34:31,482 --> 01:34:33,383
She found the solution.

902
01:34:33,449 --> 01:34:37,386
Tell your mother there was a
healer who worked miracles.

903
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:42,952
All the money your mother spent!

904
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:46,050
She said nothing to you.

905
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:53,186
Each time, she told me,
"It's your last chance."

906
01:34:59,216 --> 01:35:03,119
After several consultations
with him, I got pregnant.

907
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:07,851
Want to know who he was?

908
01:35:14,582 --> 01:35:16,683
He was my aunt's pimp.

909
01:35:31,415 --> 01:35:33,883
Want to know what his miracle was?

910
01:35:35,415 --> 01:35:37,016
Shall I tell you?

911
01:35:48,249 --> 01:35:52,886
He put me in a dark room
with a man in a blindfold.

912
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:57,151
A totally dark room.

913
01:36:00,049 --> 01:36:02,781
The man wasn't allowed
to speak to me,

914
01:36:02,782 --> 01:36:04,516
or touch me.

915
01:36:05,816 --> 01:36:07,984
We were never naked.

916
01:36:09,049 --> 01:36:11,684
I never saw his face.

917
01:36:13,415 --> 01:36:16,851
I think he was young and strong,

918
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:19,817
but inexperienced.

919
01:36:21,316 --> 01:36:24,619
My aunt gave me
advice to guide him.

920
01:36:32,283 --> 01:36:34,685
The first time, nothing happened.

921
01:36:35,882 --> 01:36:37,349
At first,

922
01:36:38,415 --> 01:36:40,817
I wept softly.

923
01:36:43,283 --> 01:36:46,018
Then I cried out and threw up.

924
01:36:46,749 --> 01:36:48,784
They hounded me from the room.

925
01:36:49,549 --> 01:36:52,017
I didn't want to go back.

926
01:36:54,216 --> 01:36:57,852
Little by little, I got used to it.

927
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:02,883
I accepted it...

928
01:37:04,982 --> 01:37:09,019
With a feeling of guilt.

929
01:37:16,916 --> 01:37:21,019
When I got pregnant, your
mother praised the healer.

930
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:23,718
She told people he worked miracles.

931
01:37:23,916 --> 01:37:27,285
She often bought
talismans from him.

932
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:38,115
For the second child, I don't
know if it was the same man.

933
01:37:38,116 --> 01:37:39,984
Always in the dark.

934
01:37:43,682 --> 01:37:44,882
You?

935
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:53,117
You've come back to life?

936
01:37:55,549 --> 01:37:56,950
My patience stone.

937
01:37:58,882 --> 01:38:00,783
You've come back to me!

938
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:04,717
The patience stone.

939
01:38:05,249 --> 01:38:06,983
You've shattered!

940
01:38:07,749 --> 01:38:09,450
I've brought you back...

941
01:38:10,149 --> 01:38:11,349
Me...

942
01:38:13,049 --> 01:38:14,249
Me alone.

943
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:40,318
I have become a prophet

944
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,051
who has accomplished a miracle.

945
01:38:56,615 --> 01:38:58,883
I have become a prophet...
