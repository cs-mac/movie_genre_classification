1
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:32,621
By 300 AD, the Roman Empire
extended from Arabia to Britain.

2
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,456
But they wanted more.

3
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:39,060
More land.

4
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:42,856
More peoples
loyal and subservient to Rome.

5
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:49,181
But no people so important
as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.

6
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:53,464
Thousands died on that field.

7
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:58,462
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth
day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive

8
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:03,575
were members of the decimated
but legendary cavalry.

9
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:09,185
The Romans, impressed by their bravery
and horsemanship, spared their lives.

10
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,416
452 AD

11
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:16,139
In exchange, these warriors were
incorporated into the Roman military.

12
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:20,101
Better they had died that day.

13
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:30,098
(neighing)

14
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:38,103
Father.

15
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:40,098
They are here.

16
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:46,701
For the second part of the bargain they
struck indebted not only themselves...

17
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:48,266
The day has come.

18
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:51,384
..but also their sons,
and their sons, and so on,

19
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:54,186
to serve the empire as knights.

20
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,537
I was such a son.

21
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:15,183
There is a legend that
fallen knights return as great horses.

22
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:18,816
He has seen what awaits you,
and he will protect you.

23
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,741
lancelot! lancelot!

24
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,182
lancelot.

25
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,061
Don't be afraid. l will return.

26
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:56,425
- How long shall we be gone?
- 1 5 years,

27
00:02:56,507 --> 00:03:00,705
not including the months it'll take
to get to your post.

28
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:05,096
lancelot!

29
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,223
(all shout out ''Rus!'')

30
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:32,538
(lancelot) Our post was Britain -
or at least the southern half,

31
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:37,496
for the land was divided by a 7 3-mile wall
built three centuries before us

32
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:41,819
to protect the empire from
the native fighters of the north.

33
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:45,104
So, as our forefathers had done,

34
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:49,305
we made our way and reported
to our Roman commander in Britain,

35
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:52,697
ancestrally named for the first Artorius,

36
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,698
or Arthur.

37
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:57,984
1 5 YEARS lATER

38
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,579
Ah, as promised, the bishop's carriage.

39
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:19,660
- Our freedom, Bors.
- Mm. l can almost taste it.

40
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,021
And your passage to Rome, Arthur.

41
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:54,739
(horse whinnies)

42
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:07,376
Argh!

43
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,105
(war cries)

44
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,466
Woads!

45
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,860
( uproar, swords clinking)

46
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,027
Yaa-rgh!

47
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,260
Yah!

48
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,057
Argh!

49
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:26,906
Argh!

50
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,217
(triumphant cry)

51
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:19,227
Rus! Aagh!

52
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:27,545
Rus!

53
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:31,779
Rus.

54
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:43,426
Gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta
tu in mulieribus et Dominus tecum.

55
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:47,295
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.

56
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:48,820
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...

57
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:52,502
Save your prayers, boy.
Your god doesn't live here.

58
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:14,466
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?

59
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,625
Spill my blood with Excalibur and...

60
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,823
make this ground holy.

61
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,977
Pick it up.

62
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,862
Pick it up.

63
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,977
- Bors.
- What a bloody mess.

64
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,017
That's not the bishop.

65
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,385
God help us.

66
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:40,186
- What are they?
- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.

67
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:42,019
You're not a Christian, are you?

68
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,142
Does this really work?

69
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,301
(mutters gibberish)

70
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,546
Nothing.

71
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:58,822
Maybe l'm not doin' it right.

72
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:02,460
(man chuckling) Arthur!

73
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:06,222
Arthur Castus. Your father's image.

74
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,662
l haven't seen you since childhood.

75
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:12,103
Bishop Germanius. Welcome to Britain.

76
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:15,777
l see your military skills
are still of use to you.

77
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,858
Your device worked.

78
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:21,576
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.

79
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:30,739
And these are the great Sarmatian knights
we have heard so much of in Rome.

80
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:38,383
l thought the Woads control
the north of Hadrian's Wall.

81
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,822
They do, but they
occasionally venture south.

82
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,820
Rome's anticipated withdrawal from Britain
has only increased their daring.

83
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:48,502
- (man) Woads?
- British rebels who hate Rome.

84
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,259
Men who want their country back.

85
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:53,259
- Who leads them?
- He's called Merlin.

86
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:55,542
A dark magician, some say.

87
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:58,585
Tristan, ride ahead
and make sure the road is clear.

88
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,865
Please do not worry, Bishop.
We will protect you.

89
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:04,380
Oh.

90
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,265
l've no doubt, Commander.

91
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,258
No doubt.

92
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:24,105
Dozens don't worry me
nearly so much as thousands.

93
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:26,098
Thousands?

94
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:43,583
Well, now that we're free men,
l'm gonna drink till l can't piss straight.

95
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,659
- You do that every night.
- l never could piss straight.

96
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,456
Too much of myself to handle...
down there.

97
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:52,424
Well, it's a problem.

98
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,941
No, really, it is. lt's a problem.

99
00:11:55,027 --> 00:12:01,262
- lt's like a baby's arm holding an apple.
- (all) ..baby's arm holding an apple.

100
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,178
(laughter)

101
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,221
l don't like him, that Roman.

102
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:37,266
lf he's here to discharge us,
why doesn't he just give us our papers?

103
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:40,464
- ls this your happy face?
- (Bors laughs)

104
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,936
Galahad, do you still
not know the Romans?

105
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,257
They won't scratch their arses
without holding a ceremony.

106
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,384
Why don't you just kill him,
and then discharge yourself after?

107
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:51,221
l don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.

108
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:55,823
Well, you should try it someday.
You might get a taste for it.

109
00:12:56,507 --> 00:13:00,420
- lt's a part of you. lt's in your blood.
- No, no, no. No.

110
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:04,018
As of tomorrow
this was all just a bad memory.

111
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,540
Ohh.

112
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:10,863
l've often thought about what going home
would mean after all this. What will l do?

113
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,858
lt's different for Galahad.

114
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:16,144
l've been in this life longer than the other.

115
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,700
So much for home.
lt's not so clear in my memory.

116
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:25,383
You speak for yourself. lt's cold back there
and everyone l know is dead and buried.

117
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,903
Besides, l have, l think, a dozen children.

118
00:13:29,347 --> 00:13:31,622
Eleven.

119
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:35,939
You listen. When the Romans leave here,
we'll have the run of all this place.

120
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:39,815
l'll be governor in my own village
and Dagonet will be my personal guard

121
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:42,819
and royal arse-kisser. Won't you, Dag?

122
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:46,582
First thing l will do when l get home is
find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.

123
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,623
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?

124
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:51,460
Why do you think we left in the first place?

125
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,458
(moos like a cow)

126
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,617
What about you, lancelot?
What are your plans for home?

127
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,858
Well, if this woman of Gawain's
is as beautiful as he claims,

128
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:04,666
l expect to be spending
a lot of time at Gawain's house.

129
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:07,784
- His wife will welcome the company.
- l see. And what will l be doing?

130
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:12,657
Wondering at your good fortune
that all your children look like me.

131
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:16,581
ls that before or after l hit you with my axe?

132
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:18,982
(whistles)

133
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:28,505
Where you been, now? Where you been?

134
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:31,826
And what will you do, Arthur,
when you return to your beloved Rome?

135
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:34,660
Give thanks to God that l survived to see it.

136
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:37,102
You and your god! You disturb me.

137
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:40,145
l want peace, lancelot. l've had enough.

138
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:42,538
- You should visit me.
- Ah!

139
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:45,016
lt's a magnificent place, Rome.

140
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:48,543
Ordered, civilised, advanced.

141
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:49,980
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.

142
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:53,662
The greatest minds in all the lands
have come together in one sacred place

143
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:55,419
to help make mankind free.

144
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:01,098
And the women?

145
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:13,577
(guard) Open the gate!

146
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:44,940
- Welcome back, Arthur.
- Jols.

147
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,904
lancelot.

148
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:55,106
Bishop, please, my quarters
have been made available to you.

149
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,621
Oh, yes. l must rest.

150
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,698
(Bors chuckles lewdly)

151
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,465
- Where have you been?
- Oh...

152
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:07,506
- l've been waiting for you.
- Oh, my little flower. Such... passion!

153
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,384
Where's my Gilly? Gilly.

154
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:14,820
- You been fighting?
- Yes.

155
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,976
- You been winning?
- Yes.

156
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,978
That's my boy.
Come on, all my other bastards!

157
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,501
(all cheer)

158
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,578
Pelagius.

159
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:40,263
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.

160
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:43,225
But, of course, it is to be expected.

161
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,423
(knocking)

162
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:54,261
Sir, l'm here to escort you
to the fortress hall.

163
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:04,980
When my master meets with your knights,
he must be seated last

164
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,900
and he must be seated
at the head of the table.

165
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:11,900
Your master can plonk his holy arse
wherever he chooses.

166
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:14,581
(laughter)

167
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:19,138
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.

168
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:28,103
A round table?
What sort of evil is this?

169
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,741
Arthur says for men to be men
they must first all be equal.

170
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,261
l was given to understand
there would be more of you.

171
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:37,976
There were. We have been
fighting here for 1 5 years, Bishop.

172
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,342
Oh, of course.

173
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:44,739
Arthur and his knights
have served with courage

174
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:51,175
to maintain the honour of Rome's empire
on this last outpost of our glory.

175
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:54,942
Rome is most indebted
to you noble knights.

176
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:57,985
To your final days
as servants to the empire.

177
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,456
Day. Not days.

178
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:05,503
The Pope's taken
a personal interest in you.

179
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,976
He inquires after each of you,

180
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:14,256
and is curious to know if your knights have
converted to the word of Our Saviour or...?

181
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:18,306
They retain the religion of their forefathers.
l have never questioned that.

182
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:20,264
Of course, of course.

183
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:22,577
They are pagans. Hm?

184
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:27,743
For our part, the Church
has deemed such beliefs innocence,

185
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:31,581
but you, Arthur,
your path to God is through Pelagius?

186
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,502
- l saw his image in your room.
- He took my father's place for me.

187
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:38,738
His teachings on free will and equality
have been a great influence.

188
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,341
l look forward to our reunion in Rome.

189
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:42,826
Ah.

190
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:46,422
Rome awaits your arrival
with great anticipation.

191
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,179
You are a hero.

192
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:52,055
ln Rome, you will live out your days
in honour and wealth.

193
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,702
Alas...

194
00:18:56,547 --> 00:19:00,301
Alas, we are all but players
in an ever-changing world.

195
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:04,983
Barbarians from every corner
are almost at Rome's door.

196
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:10,380
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father
have decided to remove ourselves

197
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:14,506
from indefensible outposts,
such as Britain.

198
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,740
What will become of Britain
is not our concern any more.

199
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:20,660
l suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.

200
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,817
- Saxons?
- Yes.

201
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:26,980
ln the north a massive
Saxon incursion has begun.

202
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:31,265
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.
- And only kill everything.

203
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:35,340
So you would just
leave the land to the Woads.

204
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:37,179
And l risked my life for nothing.

205
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:38,461
Hm.

206
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:40,378
Gentlemen,

207
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:44,904
your discharge papers with safe conduct
throughout the Roman Empire.

208
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:48,662
But first, l must have a word
with your commander.

209
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,540
- ln private.
- We have no secrets.

210
00:19:57,747 --> 00:19:59,738
(slams table)

211
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:05,942
Come. let's leave Roman business
to Romans.

212
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:11,657
let it go, Bors.

213
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:23,225
Rome has issued a final order
for you and your men.

214
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,706
Final order?

215
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:29,303
You are to travel north
to rescue the family of Marius Honorius

216
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:34,222
and return, in particular,
with Marius's son, Alecto.

217
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:40,346
Alecto is the Pope's
favourite godchild and pupil.

218
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:45,616
lt is his destiny to become a bishop,
perhaps even pope one day.

219
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:48,904
On this day you ask this of my men.

220
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,418
On this day.

221
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:01,176
They have risked their lives for 1 5 years
for a cause not of their own.

222
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:05,579
And now, on the day they are to be
liberated, you send them on a mission

223
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,500
which is far more dangerous
than any other they have undertaken.

224
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:11,385
You tell me, Bishop,
how do l go to my men and tell them

225
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,265
that instead of freedom l offer death?

226
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:18,784
lf your men are truly the knights
of legend, perhaps some will survive.

227
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,744
lf it is God's will.

228
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,738
Your men want to go home,

229
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:27,617
and to get home they need to cross
the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.

230
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:32,220
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.

231
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:34,778
Will you defy the Pope, Arthur?

232
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:36,937
Rome? God himself?

233
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,097
Everything l've done has been
for the Church and for Rome.

234
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:41,860
Do not mistake a loyal soldier
for a fool, Germanius.

235
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:45,735
Would you leave a defenceless
Roman boy, destined to lead our Church,

236
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:48,057
at the hands of the Saxons?

237
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:53,863
Fulfil this mission, and your men
will receive their discharge.

238
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:59,097
Their papers will be waiting here
the moment they return.

239
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,666
You have my word.

240
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:06,424
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop,
for l will hold you to it.

241
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:11,382
Break it, and no Roman legion,

242
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:14,498
papal army,

243
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:18,296
nor God himself will protect you.

244
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,864
That is my word.

245
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:33,224
- (man) She gave me fleas.
- (man #2) You better hope they're fleas.

246
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:38,341
Best of three.

247
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:42,781
(baby mewling)

248
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,539
Who wants another drink?

249
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:47,061
- (lancelot) Ahh.
- (sighs)

250
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,103
When you gonna leave Bors
and come home with me?

251
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:51,655
My lover is watching you.

252
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,426
Mmm...

253
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:05,021
You look nothing like him.

254
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:06,699
You're all Bors.

255
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,542
- Tristan...
- How do you do that?

256
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:15,779
l aim for the middle.

257
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:18,058
Oh, they want more!

258
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,662
- Here. Be a mother to your son.
- Oh, come here.

259
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:26,257
Dagonet, where you been?
We've got plans to make.

260
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,504
Here, please. Sing.

261
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:29,906
- No.
- Just a last one.

262
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:32,865
- No, l'm trying to work.
- Come sing. Shut up!

263
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:35,461
Vanora will sing.

264
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,300
- (Vanora) No, no.
- (chants of ''Sing!'')

265
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:42,782
- (man) Sing about home.
- ( Gawain) Don't drop the baby.

266
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:49,226
* land of bear and land of eagle

267
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:53,459
* land that gave us birth and blessing

268
00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:57,506
* land that called us ever homewards

269
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:01,500
* We will go home across the mountains

270
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:05,546
* We will go home
We will go home

271
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:09,825
* We will go home across the mountains

272
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,741
* We will go home singing our song...

273
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,057
(singing fades)

274
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:35,135
* ..hear our singing, hear our longing

275
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:39,505
* We will go home across the mountains

276
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:43,944
* We will go home
We will go home...

277
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,222
(singing fades)

278
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:51,139
Arthur!

279
00:24:51,347 --> 00:24:53,542
Arthur!

280
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:59,015
Arthur! You're not
completely Roman yet, right?

281
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:01,223
Rus!

282
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,177
Knights...

283
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:09,497
brothers in arms...

284
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,543
your courage has been tested
beyond all limits.

285
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:12,855
Yes.

286
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:15,142
But l must ask you now for one further trial.

287
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:16,899
Drink.

288
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:22,983
We must leave on a final mission for Rome
before our freedom can be granted.

289
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:30,100
Above the wall, far in the north,
there is a Roman family in need of rescue.

290
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:32,257
They are trapped by Saxons.

291
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,542
Our orders are to secure their safety.

292
00:25:34,627 --> 00:25:37,016
let the Romans take care of their own.

293
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:39,667
Above the wall is Woad territory.

294
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:45,097
Our duty to Rome,
if it was ever a duty, is done.

295
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:47,938
Our pact with Rome is done.

296
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:52,703
Every knight here
has laid his life on the line for you.

297
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,300
For you.

298
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,345
And instead of freedom
you want more blood?

299
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:59,622
Our blood?

300
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,857
You think more of Roman blood
than you do of ours?

301
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:03,665
Bors! These are our orders.

302
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:07,422
We leave at first light, and when we return
your freedom will be waiting for you.

303
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:09,179
A freedom we can embrace with honour.

304
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,303
l am a free man!

305
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,343
l will choose my own fate!

306
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:16,066
Yeah, yeah.
We're all going to die someday.

307
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:19,378
lf it's a death from a Saxon hand
that frightens you, stay home.

308
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:21,458
listen, if you're so eager to die,
you can die right now!

309
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,538
- Enough. Enough!
- l've got something to live for!

310
00:26:23,627 --> 00:26:26,346
The Romans have broken their word.

311
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:29,942
We have the word of Arthur.
That is good enough.

312
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:31,900
l'll prepare.

313
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:34,864
Bors?

314
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:37,063
- You coming?
- Of course l'm coming!

315
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:40,219
Can't let you go on your own!
You'll all get killed!

316
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:43,780
l'm just saying what you're all thinking!

317
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,978
Vanora'll kill me.

318
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,018
And you, Gawain?

319
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:57,178
l'm with you.

320
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,381
Galahad as well.

321
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:38,860
O merciful God,
l have such need of your mercy now.

322
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:44,104
Not for myself, but for my knights,

323
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:46,417
for this is truly their hour of need.

324
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:48,020
Deliver them from the trials ahead,

325
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:52,225
and l will repay you a thousandfold
with any sacrifice you ask of me.

326
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:54,703
And if, in your wisdom,

327
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:58,143
you should determine that that sacrifice
must be my life for theirs,

328
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:02,266
so they may once again taste the freedom
that has so long been denied to them,

329
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,383
l will gladly make that covenant.

330
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:08,176
My death will have a purpose.
l ask no more than that.

331
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:11,225
Why do you always talk to God
and not to me?

332
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:14,617
Oh, pray to whomever you pray
that we don't cross the Saxons.

333
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:19,098
My faith is what protects me, lancelot.
Why do you challenge this?

334
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:21,417
l don't like anything
that puts a man on his knees.

335
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:24,226
No man fears to kneel
before the god he trusts.

336
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,775
Without faith, without belief in something,
what are we?

337
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:29,301
To try and get past the Woads
in the north is insanity.

338
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:32,220
- Them we've fought before.
- Not north of the wall!

339
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:37,619
How many Saxons? Hm?

340
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:39,743
How many?!

341
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:44,946
Tell me. Do you believe in this mission?

342
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,619
These people need our help.

343
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:49,460
- lt is our duty to bring them out.
- l don't care about your charge,

344
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:53,586
and l don't give a damn about
Romans, Britain or this island.

345
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,865
lf you desire to spend eternity in this place,
Arthur, so be it,

346
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:58,824
but suicide cannot be chosen for another!

347
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:01,785
- And yet you choose death for this family!
- No, l choose life!

348
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,461
And freedom for myself and the men!

349
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:14,778
How many times in battle have we
snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?

350
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:18,064
Outnumbered, outflanked,
yet still we triumph.

351
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:21,776
With you at my side, we can do so again.

352
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,623
lancelot, we are knights.

353
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:28,222
What other purpose do we serve
if not for such a cause?

354
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:31,583
Arthur, you fight for a world
that will never exist.

355
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,180
Never.

356
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:35,986
There will always be a battlefield.

357
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,139
l will die in battle.

358
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:43,741
Of that l'm certain.

359
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:46,899
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.

360
00:29:48,627 --> 00:29:51,460
But if it be this one,

361
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:53,822
grant me a favour.

362
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:56,819
Don't bury me in our sad little cemetery.

363
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,260
Burn me.

364
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:02,181
Burn me and cast my ashes
to a strong east wind.

365
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:26,898
(woman screaming)

366
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,817
Don't touch their women.

367
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:54,696
We don't mix with these people.

368
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:01,062
What kind of offspring
do you think that would yield?

369
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,739
Weak people.

370
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,738
Half people.

371
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:09,737
l will not have our Saxon blood
watered down by mixing with them.

372
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:14,343
According to our laws, no man
may deny me the spoils of our conquest!

373
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:16,338
He speaks the truth, Father.

374
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:36,344
My lord! O, my lord!

375
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,463
God's thanks, my lord.

376
00:31:38,547 --> 00:31:40,105
Thank you.

377
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:41,819
Thank you.

378
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:46,706
Kill her.

379
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:49,265
(wails)

380
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:52,101
No! No!

381
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:54,747
(softly) Are you challenging me?

382
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:59,264
lf you want to challenge me,
you have to have a sword in your hand.

383
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:04,218
As long as my heart beats,
l rule and you hold your tongue.

384
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,697
Or l'll cut it out.

385
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,057
(neighing)

386
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,777
We are three days' march from
the Great Wall, if we camp at night.

387
00:33:57,867 --> 00:34:00,062
We won't camp.

388
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,820
The wall - what troops are stationed there?

389
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,421
light Roman infantry

390
00:34:05,507 --> 00:34:08,067
and possibly Sarmatian knights.

391
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,739
Arthur Castus is their leader.

392
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:12,022
Arthur? Who is this Arthur?

393
00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:16,942
lt is said he has never been defeated
in battle. lt is said he is a great warrior.

394
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,618
Why should l trust you?

395
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:23,977
You're a traitor to your own people.

396
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:27,264
Tell my father of the Roman estate.

397
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:29,258
Speak up!

398
00:34:30,347 --> 00:34:32,986
A very high-ranking family live there.

399
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,865
They are of great importance to Rome.

400
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:40,020
Father, their ransom
could pay for the entire campaign.

401
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:52,856
l'll attack from the north
with the main army.

402
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:57,338
You bring your men down here.
Cut off their retreat to the south.

403
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,383
Burn every village, kill everybody.

404
00:35:01,187 --> 00:35:06,056
Never leave behind you a man, woman
or child who can ever carry a sword.

405
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:23,379
Saxon.

406
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,657
How many?

407
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:26,780
Thousands.

408
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:36,178
(horse whinnying)

409
00:35:42,147 --> 00:35:45,139
(Tristan) Woads. They're tracking us.

410
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:47,978
(Arthur) Where?

411
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:49,659
Everywhere.

412
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:19,059
Yaah!

413
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,146
Get back!

414
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:33,178
Get back!

415
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:48,740
This way!

416
00:36:56,787 --> 00:36:58,698
(war cries)

417
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:03,065
Yaah!

418
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,338
What are you waiting for?

419
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:52,579
Inish.

420
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,783
Devil ghosts.

421
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:59,816
- Why would they not attack?
- Merlin doesn't want us dead.

422
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:06,059
We should have killed them, Merlin.

423
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:10,661
There might be a purpose
for Artorius and his Knights.

424
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:11,664
No!

425
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:14,980
He is our enemy!

426
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,739
So is the Saxon!

427
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,738
(clap of thunder)

428
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:25,507
( Gawain groaning)

429
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:29,023
Oh, l can't wait to leave this island.

430
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:32,497
lf it's not raining, it's snowing.
lf it's not snowing, it's foggy.

431
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:33,656
And that's the summer!

432
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:37,706
The rain is good.
Washes all the blood away.

433
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:39,823
Doesn't help the smell.

434
00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:44,537
Hey, Bors, do you intend to take Vanora
and all your little bastards back home?

435
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:47,824
Oh, l'm trying to avoid that decision...

436
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:49,818
by getting killed.

437
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:57,102
Dagonet, she wants to get married
and give the children names.

438
00:38:57,187 --> 00:38:58,540
Women!

439
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,936
The children already have names,
don't they?

440
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:03,018
Just Gilly.

441
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,497
lt was too much trouble,
so we gave the rest of them numbers.

442
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:09,465
That's interesting.
And l thought you couldn't count.

443
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:15,658
You know, l never thought
l'd get back home alive.

444
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:20,218
Now l've got the chance,
l... l don't want to leave my children.

445
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:24,061
- You'd miss 'em too much.
- l'll take them with me.

446
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:28,777
l like the little bastards.
They mean something to me.

447
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:33,586
Especially number three.

448
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:37,060
- He's a good fighter.
- That's because he's mine.

449
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:41,380
l'm going for a piss.

450
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:43,378
(laughter)

451
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:08,903
- (guard) Who are you?
- l am Arthur Castus,

452
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:12,582
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights,
sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.

453
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:14,737
Open the gate.

454
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,736
(man) lt is a wonder you have come.

455
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:28,342
Good Jesus.
Arthur and his knights.

456
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:33,021
You have fought the Woads.
Vile creatures.

457
00:40:33,107 --> 00:40:36,816
Our orders are to evacuate you
immediately.

458
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:38,704
But that... that is impossible.

459
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,497
- Which is Alecto?
- l am Alecto.

460
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,742
Alecto is my son.

461
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:50,105
And everything we have is here in the land
given to us by the Pope of Rome.

462
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:55,784
- Well, you're about to give it to the Saxons.
- They're invading from the north.

463
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:58,665
- Then Rome will send an army.
- They have. Us.

464
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,659
- We leave as soon as you're packed.
- l refuse to leave.

465
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:09,135
Go back to work! All of you!

466
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:11,821
- You heard! Go!
- All right, all right.

467
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:15,300
- Go!
- Get back to work, all of you!

468
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,578
Go back!

469
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:23,416
lf l fail to bring you and your son back,
my men can never leave this land.

470
00:41:23,507 --> 00:41:25,020
So you're coming with me

471
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:29,623
if l have to tie you to my horse and drag
you all the way to Hadrian's Wall myself.

472
00:41:29,707 --> 00:41:31,743
My lord.

473
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,136
lady, my knights are hungry.

474
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,619
Go.

475
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:44,106
Come!

476
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,776
Come. let us go, hm?

477
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:09,018
(man) Sir, you're famous.
You're Arthur, aren't you?

478
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:12,179
l'm Ganis. l'm a good fighter and l'm smart.
l'd serve you proudly.

479
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:15,258
Are you from Rome?

480
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:17,258
From hell.

481
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:21,385
- Sir.
- Who is this man?

482
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:24,061
He's our village elder.

483
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:26,456
What is this punishment for?

484
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:30,017
- Answer me!
- He defied our master, Marius.

485
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,742
Most of the food we grow
is sent out by sea to be sold.

486
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:35,546
He asked that we keep
a little more for ourselves, that's all.

487
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:38,266
My arse has been snappin' at the grass
l'm so hungry!

488
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,942
You're from Rome. ls it true
that Marius is a spokesman for God

489
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:44,302
and that it's a sin to defy him?

490
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:50,261
l tell you now.

491
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:52,383
Marius is not of God.

492
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:57,461
And you, all of you,
were free from your first breath!

493
00:43:05,907 --> 00:43:07,465
Help this man.

494
00:43:07,547 --> 00:43:09,936
Help him!

495
00:43:10,027 --> 00:43:13,986
Now hear me. A vast and terrible army
is coming this way.

496
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:16,865
They will show no mercy, spare no one.

497
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:18,938
Those of you who are able
should gather your things

498
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:21,222
and begin to move south
towards Hadrian's Wall.

499
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,741
Those unable shall come with us.

500
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:26,466
You, serve me now.
Get these people ready.

501
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:28,378
( Ganis) Right, you heard him.

502
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:31,106
You go grab enough food and water
for the journey.

503
00:43:31,187 --> 00:43:32,779
let's get a hurry on, else we're all dead!

504
00:43:38,627 --> 00:43:40,538
Come on, hurry.

505
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:45,545
They have flanked us to the east.

506
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:48,460
They're coming from the south,
trying to cut off our escape.

507
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:49,980
They'll be here before nightfall.

508
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:52,740
- How many?
- An entire army.

509
00:43:52,827 --> 00:43:54,818
And the only way out is to the south?

510
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:56,260
East.

511
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:59,737
There is a trail heading east
across the mountains.

512
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:05,301
lt means we have to cross behind Saxon
lines, but that's the one we should take.

513
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:08,826
Arthur, who are all these people?

514
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,818
They're coming with us.

515
00:44:12,627 --> 00:44:14,299
Then we'll never make it.

516
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:17,698
(distant drums beating)

517
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,658
- Come on, get back to work!
- Back to work!

518
00:44:38,707 --> 00:44:40,379
Move.

519
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:42,418
Move.

520
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:45,818
Move!

521
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:49,506
- What is this?
- You cannot go in there.

522
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:52,499
No one goes in there.
This place is forbidden.

523
00:44:53,987 --> 00:44:57,024
(Marius) What are you doing?
Stop this!

524
00:45:00,947 --> 00:45:02,346
Arthur, we have no time.

525
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:06,547
Do you not hear the drums?

526
00:45:08,987 --> 00:45:10,898
Dagonet.

527
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:17,945
Agh!

528
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:20,058
Agh!

529
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:31,820
- Key.
- lt is locked.

530
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:33,818
From the inside.

531
00:45:48,307 --> 00:45:50,696
- You, you... go.
- (whimpers)

532
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:52,220
Move!

533
00:45:57,587 --> 00:46:01,546
- Gawain.
- (man chanting) Exaudi orationem meam.

534
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:06,218
Exaudi orationem meam.

535
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:12,257
In nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis
et in virtute Spiritus Sancti.

536
00:46:14,227 --> 00:46:16,946
Who are these defilers
of the lord's temple?

537
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,938
Out of the way.

538
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:38,579
The work of your god.

539
00:46:39,707 --> 00:46:42,744
ls this how he answers your prayers?

540
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:44,863
See if there's any still alive.

541
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:55,304
How dare you set foot in this holy place?

542
00:46:58,707 --> 00:47:01,744
- There was a man of God.
- Not my god!

543
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:06,344
- (Arthur) This one's dead.
- By this smell, they are all dead.

544
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:09,544
And you.
You even move, you join him.

545
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,981
Arthur!

546
00:47:21,387 --> 00:47:22,979
You must not fear me.

547
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:47,776
Water! Give me some water!

548
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:18,498
His arm is broken.

549
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:21,698
And his family?

550
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:25,858
She's a Woad.

551
00:48:28,107 --> 00:48:30,018
l'm a Roman officer.

552
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,818
You're safe now.

553
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:37,417
- You're safe.
- Stop what you are doing!

554
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:39,421
What is this madness?

555
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:42,260
- They're all pagans here!
- So are we.

556
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:45,066
They refuse to do the task
God has set for them!

557
00:48:45,147 --> 00:48:46,739
They must die as an example!

558
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:50,103
You mean they refused to be your serfs!

559
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:51,905
You are a Roman.

560
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:53,625
You understand.

561
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:55,504
And you are a Christian.

562
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:57,862
You! You kept her alive!

563
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:04,336
- (soldier) My lord!
- No! No, stop!

564
00:49:06,187 --> 00:49:09,975
When we get to the wall
you will be punished for this heresy.

565
00:49:10,067 --> 00:49:13,616
Perhaps l should kill you now
and seal my fate.

566
00:49:13,707 --> 00:49:16,665
l was willing to die with them.

567
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:19,898
Yes, to lead them to their rightful place.

568
00:49:19,987 --> 00:49:23,263
lt is God's wish
that these sinners be sacrificed.

569
00:49:23,347 --> 00:49:25,861
Only then can their souls be saved.

570
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:29,379
Then l shall grant his wish.

571
00:49:30,907 --> 00:49:33,740
- Wall them back up.
- Arthur.

572
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:35,581
l said wall them up!

573
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:39,546
Don't you see it is the will of God
that these sinners be sacrificed?

574
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:44,098
- Unhand me, defil... They're sinners!
- Get in there!

575
00:50:20,463 --> 00:50:22,294
We're moving too slow.

576
00:50:22,383 --> 00:50:24,692
The girl's not gonna make it,
and neither is the boy.

577
00:50:24,783 --> 00:50:27,900
The family we can protect, but we're
wasting our time with all these people.

578
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,894
We're not leaving them.

579
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:32,932
lf the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.

580
00:50:33,023 --> 00:50:35,412
Then save your anger for them.

581
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:40,212
ls this Rome's quest or Arthur's?

582
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:01,854
(weak moans)

583
00:51:05,183 --> 00:51:07,094
- Arthur.
- How is he?

584
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,456
He burns.

585
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,535
Brave boy.

586
00:51:48,823 --> 00:51:51,815
Some of your fingers are out of place.

587
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:53,700
l have to push them back.

588
00:51:56,103 --> 00:52:00,574
lf l don't do this, there's a chance
you may never use them again.

589
00:52:12,223 --> 00:52:14,020
- (cracking)
- (cries)

590
00:52:18,463 --> 00:52:20,374
(cracking)

591
00:52:31,823 --> 00:52:33,654
They tortured me.

592
00:52:35,183 --> 00:52:37,253
With machines.

593
00:52:43,023 --> 00:52:48,143
To make me tell them things that...
that l didn't know to begin with.

594
00:52:50,503 --> 00:52:52,414
And then...

595
00:52:55,703 --> 00:52:58,092
l heard your voice in the dark.

596
00:53:02,383 --> 00:53:04,977
l am Guinevere.

597
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,213
You are Arthur...

598
00:53:09,223 --> 00:53:12,260
of the Knights from the Great Wall.

599
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:14,501
l am.

600
00:53:15,263 --> 00:53:18,539
The famous Briton
who kills his own people.

601
00:53:42,983 --> 00:53:46,532
l found tracks coming from the south,
but none going back.

602
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,535
Horsemen travelling light and fast.

603
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:51,454
Could be Roman cavalry.

604
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:52,976
Could be knights.

605
00:53:55,463 --> 00:53:57,419
They know we're after them.

606
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:01,176
They'll head east now,
through the mountains.

607
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:05,814
God's holy work has been defiled.
l am a servant of God!

608
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:08,463
No, please, l... Agh!

609
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:13,576
He says they walled him up in a building
and took the family.

610
00:54:14,183 --> 00:54:17,653
Someone who goes
by the name of Artorius.

611
00:54:17,743 --> 00:54:19,335
lt's him.

612
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,857
lt's Arthur.

613
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:24,503
Take your men east. Hunt them down.

614
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:29,062
l'll take the main army to the wall.
Bring the family there.

615
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:32,658
- (man) And the monks?
- Put them back where you found them.

616
00:54:32,743 --> 00:54:34,859
l am a servant of God!

617
00:54:34,943 --> 00:54:38,015
Please, l... l am a servant of God!

618
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:42,501
(monk) Unhand me, you defiler!

619
00:54:44,263 --> 00:54:45,981
(sighs)

620
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:47,018
Burn it all.

621
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:18,735
Yah!

622
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:33,061
My father told me great tales of you.

623
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:34,576
Really?

624
00:55:34,663 --> 00:55:36,574
And what did you hear?

625
00:55:37,703 --> 00:55:39,614
Fairy tales.

626
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:46,215
The kind you hear about people so brave,
so selfless, that they can't be real.

627
00:55:46,303 --> 00:55:48,453
Arthur and his knights.

628
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:51,455
A leader both Briton and Roman.

629
00:55:52,623 --> 00:55:55,820
And yet you chose your allegiance
to Rome.

630
00:55:56,743 --> 00:55:59,541
To those who take
what does not belong to them.

631
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:02,456
That same Rome that took your men
from their homeland.

632
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:07,219
listen, lady, do not pretend
you know anything about me or my men.

633
00:56:07,303 --> 00:56:08,656
How many Britons have you killed?

634
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:11,416
As many as tried to kill me. lt's the natural
state of any man to want to live.

635
00:56:11,503 --> 00:56:17,180
Animals live! lt's a natural state of any man
to want to live free in their own country.

636
00:56:21,183 --> 00:56:23,743
l belong to this land.

637
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:26,098
Where do you belong, Arthur?

638
00:56:31,903 --> 00:56:33,177
How's your hand?

639
00:56:35,943 --> 00:56:38,503
l'll live, l promise you.

640
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:47,535
ls there nothing about my land
that appeals to your heart?

641
00:56:47,623 --> 00:56:49,739
Your own father married a Briton.

642
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,895
Even he must have found something
to his liking.

643
00:56:58,383 --> 00:57:00,294
(gallops away)

644
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:11,859
We'll sleep here.
Take shelter in those trees.

645
00:57:11,943 --> 00:57:15,333
- Tristan.
- You wanna go out again? Yeah.

646
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:52,980
lt is here, given to us by the Pope.
These people, they send an army for us.

647
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,339
(rustling)

648
00:59:13,423 --> 00:59:15,095
(footsteps)

649
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:20,742
You betrayed me.

650
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,620
He means you no harm.

651
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:26,218
Peace between us this night,
Arthur Castus.

652
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:34,293
So Rome is leaving. The Saxon is come.

653
00:59:34,383 --> 00:59:38,535
The world we have known
and fought for is ended.

654
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,341
Now we must make a new world.

655
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:43,335
Your world, Merlin, not mine.
l shall be in Rome.

656
00:59:43,423 --> 00:59:45,812
To find peace?
The Saxon will come to Rome.

657
00:59:45,903 --> 00:59:48,133
My knights trust me
not to betray them to their enemy.

658
00:59:48,223 --> 00:59:51,659
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.

659
00:59:51,743 --> 00:59:53,415
We have no fight between us now.

660
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:55,733
You tell that to the knights
you killed before my eyes,

661
00:59:55,823 --> 00:59:57,461
whose bones are buried in this earth.

662
00:59:57,543 --> 00:59:58,942
We have all lost brothers.

663
00:59:59,023 --> 01:00:01,821
You know nothing of the loss l speak!

664
01:00:01,903 --> 01:00:03,655
Shall l help you remember?

665
01:00:03,743 --> 01:00:07,656
An attack on a village.
The screams of an innocent woman.

666
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:13,980
Mother!

667
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:15,974
Artorius!

668
01:00:22,383 --> 01:00:24,214
Mother!

669
01:00:24,423 --> 01:00:26,334
Mother!

670
01:00:29,503 --> 01:00:33,382
I ran to the burial mound
of my father to free her.

671
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:40,213
To kill you.

672
01:00:41,543 --> 01:00:45,377
Father, please let loose your sword.

673
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,814
l feel the heat of that fire
on my face even now.

674
01:01:06,503 --> 01:01:08,061
l did not wish her dead.

675
01:01:08,143 --> 01:01:12,022
She was of our blood, as are you.

676
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:17,336
lf you were so determined to leave us
to slaughter, why did you save so many?

677
01:01:24,383 --> 01:01:28,092
My men are strong,
but they have need of a true leader.

678
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:30,333
They believe you can do anything.

679
01:01:31,023 --> 01:01:33,662
To defeat the Saxon
we need a master of war.

680
01:01:33,743 --> 01:01:36,735
Why do you think
l spared you in the forest?

681
01:01:40,303 --> 01:01:46,412
That sword you carry is made of iron
from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.

682
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:51,258
lt was love of your mother
that freed the sword, not hatred of me.

683
01:01:51,343 --> 01:01:53,254
love, Arthur.

684
01:02:11,023 --> 01:02:12,775
Seize him!
