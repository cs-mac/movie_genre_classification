1
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,150
No!

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,780
Lady.

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,450
Lady.

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,180
Detective... The culprit...

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
Lady, are you okay?

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,780
Let's get out of here. Now.

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,180
Detective, the culprit is over there...

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,749
That's not important right now.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,849
Detective... I...

10
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,879
Lady, don't worry.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,120
- It's just...
- Don't worry.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,320
I'll save you. Trust me. Just trust me.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,580
Ms. Yoo will be okay, right?

14
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,350
Hang in there, lady. You're a strong woman.

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,020
You'll be fine.

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,980
Hang in there.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,979
- Seol Ok!
- Get out of the way!

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,779
- Goodness.
- What happened to her?

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,019
What happened? How bad is it?

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,579
- Please move.
- Goodness.

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,080
It's not serious, is it?

22
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,720
No, Seol Ok.

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,920
Wake up. Please, Seol Ok.

24
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,479
Wake up.

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,580
What did you do? What happened to Seol Ok?

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,020
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

27
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,950
Sorry isn't going to cut it!

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,779
What are you doing? Mom's going to faint!

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,220
- Goodness.
- Doctor.

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,420
Mother.

31
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,420
Seol Ok.

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,650
Goodness, Seol Ok.

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,080
(Episode 16)

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,920
Sit down.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,820
I'll give you some tea.

36
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,150
Welcome back. You're in your place again.

37
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,850
Is Hyun Soo...

38
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,580
dead?

39
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm sick of this.

40
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,550
Stop bringing this up.

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,850
I've waited 17 years for her.

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,850
I'm all worn out.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,250
I want to know if she's dead.

44
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,420
Did you make them do it?

45
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,350
The statute of limitation already ran out.

46
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,979
Even if you speak the truth...

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,220
It'll be of no use.

48
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,220
Is Ms. Yoo Seol Ok's guardian here?

49
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,780
How is my child?

50
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,580
We removed the bullet.

51
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,949
It was right next to her aorta.

52
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,150
If it was a millimeter closer,
it would've been bad.

53
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,490
Is she over the worst condition?

54
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,050
She bled quite a lot,

55
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,520
so we'll have to wait and see.

56
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,820
Oh my goodness.

57
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,420
Mom.

58
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,520
Lady.

59
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,490
Don't be mistaken just
because I'm staring at you.

60
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,620
It's not because I like you.

61
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,050
It's because this is our last time.

62
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,780
I won't be able to see you again.

63
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,820
I don't care about the truth anymore.

64
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,950
I want to break free from my past.

65
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,320
So you should forget about me too.

66
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,850
I can't sit around seeing you in danger.

67
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,480
And I'm sorry...

68
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,780
about your parents.

69
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,950
I really wanted to catch
the culprit for you.

70
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
This is as far as I'll go.

71
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,720
Have a great life.

72
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,150
Goodbye.

73
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Seol Ok.

74
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,480
Seol Ok.

75
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,020
Seol Ok.

76
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,550
It's me.

77
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,880
Ms. Yoo.

78
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,480
Ms. Yoo, it's me.

79
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,820
Where's Detective Ha?

80
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,180
Wan Seung is too busy to come.

81
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,426
I know he's busy, but
how can he not stop by?

82
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,620
She got hurt while trying
to clear his accusation.

83
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,420
I have no idea. I can't
get a hold of him either.

84
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
(Director Ha Wan Seung)

85
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,650
(Report of cases taken in 2017)

86
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,480
(Signed by Director Ha Wan Seung)

87
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,520
You're working hard.

88
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,090
I quit being a detective.
Of course, I'll work hard.

89
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,220
Wow, is this really the Wan Seung I knew?

90
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,350
I realized I needed power to protect...

91
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,780
the things I like.

92
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,849
Is that why you're going
on an arranged date...

93
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,720
with the daughter of Minister of Justice?

94
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,680
Why? Do you still have
feelings left for me?

95
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,880
Excuse me. I have a meeting coming up.

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,849
My gosh, that's too heavy for you to carry.

97
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,549
You should've called me.

98
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,720
No, it's okay. I can do that much.

99
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,620
Be careful.

100
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,250
Don't make me stand by your sickbed.

101
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,149
Gosh, did you know how much older I got...

102
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,019
from running this lunchbox place,

103
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,926
making porridge, and bringing
it to your hospital?

104
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,979
All right. I'll never get sick again.

105
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,549
You should sit and rest.

106
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,220
I'll carry this in. Goodness.

107
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,250
Hey, how's your new house?

108
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,880
It looked too small.

109
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,880
That's all the space I
need to live by myself.

110
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,090
I don't care what it is,
but don't get divorced.

111
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,149
Just spend some time
away from each other...

112
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,350
and move back in later.

113
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,419
Right, I should help Captain Bae.

114
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,279
That's a lot to do by himself.

115
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,420
Whatever.

116
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,780
Did you two fight?

117
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,450
But you were always so lovey-dovey.

118
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,590
Lovey-dovey?

119
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,090
Hey.

120
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,280
He's not my type.

121
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,819
I was just being nice because...

122
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,749
he helps me out in the
kitchen with heavy stuff.

123
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,350
Don't try to fool me. What is it?

124
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,950
I'm belittled by his actions.

125
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,980
I think he's playing hard to get.

126
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,420
He completely drew a line to me.

127
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,720
It's like he's saying,
"Don't come any further."

128
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,150
Wait, that was him and not you?

129
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,380
Whatever.

130
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,480
I don't want him either.

131
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,519
Come on, you're going to hurt your hand.

132
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,020
Just get the cabbages ready.

133
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,180
What's going on with you and Gyung Mi?

134
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,919
I thought you two liked each other.

135
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,820
You always came to visit me together.

136
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,380
I'm sure you know this as her friend.

137
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,220
She's very popular among guys.

138
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,920
Yes, of course.

139
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,819
She's smart, cool,

140
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,780
a good cook, and a great businesswoman.

141
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,020
She's an all-round player.

142
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,180
Yes, of course.

143
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,250
I am...

144
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,379
a man who has nothing,

145
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
a detective who never gets promoted,

146
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,350
old, and I even have a kid.

147
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,680
I shouldn't even think about it.

148
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,920
You do like her.

149
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm glad I can stay next
to her like I'm doing now.

150
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,880
What if someone else takes her?

151
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,350
I can't ruin her future.

152
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,020
I'll leave you two alone.

153
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
You're quick at picking things up.

154
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,480
I'm quick at learning how to cook too.

155
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,820
I don't think so.

156
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,850
Goodness, I can hardly read this.

157
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
What is it?

158
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,680
I got a text from Mrs.
Kim, but I can't read it.

159
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Let me see.

160
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
There.

161
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,549
Make the font the biggest size.

162
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,849
(Make the font the biggest size.)

163
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,090
(The font size has been reset.)

164
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,850
- Goodness.
- You should make the screen brighter.

165
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,220
You said your vision's blurry these days.

166
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,549
Make the screen brighter.

167
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,719
(Make the screen brighter.)

168
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,920
(The screen is now brighter.)

169
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,750
What? I can do this myself.

170
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Thanks.

171
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,650
Then I don't have to clean anymore, right?

172
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,250
Then I don't have to give
you allowance, right?

173
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,650
All right, I'll clean.

174
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,350
If you won't do your laundry,

175
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,850
don't wear something like that.

176
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,520
That one is hard to wash.

177
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,920
Whatever. I like this shirt.

178
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,380
Hi, Seol Ok.

179
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,680
I bought a TV.

180
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,950
I'll send it to you.

181
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,550
Give me your address.

182
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,050
Mother, it's okay.

183
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,920
I can watch things on my laptop.

184
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,850
It's not okay.

185
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,850
I miss you, you know.

186
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,850
The house feels empty without you.

187
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,319
Ho Soon is no fun,

188
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,350
so I'm bored.

189
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,550
I also...

190
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,580
miss your bad cooking.

191
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,920
Mother, do you have a lot
of leftover side dishes?

192
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,780
Thank you, Mother.

193
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Ho Cheol.

194
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,720
Hi, Seol Ok.

195
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,820
When did you get in? Mother
doesn't know you're here.

196
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,920
I was just on the phone with her.

197
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,020
You talk with my mom, but
you never pick up my calls.

198
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,850
I didn't tell her because...

199
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,620
I have to get back right away.

200
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,380
I see.

201
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,520
How is Jeju Island?

202
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,850
Well... It's all right.

203
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,850
Ho Cheol.

204
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,850
- I...
- Don't make your decision yet.

205
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,920
It's all right.

206
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,850
You need some time, don't you?

207
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,580
Now that I'm with Jeju Prosecutor's Office,

208
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,220
I regret not solving the
Shinim-dong case...

209
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,850
when I was with Ansan Prosecutor's Office.

210
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,020
I should've solved the
case and quit my job.

211
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,040
Would I have been a great husband to you...

212
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,320
if I had done that?

213
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,750
You said you'd become an
international lawyer.

214
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,950
Why are you back so early?

215
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,720
I think Korean law school would be better.

216
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,480
The US schools weren't impressive.

217
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,420
Then what did you do in the US?

218
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,620
Well, this and that. I
looked into MBA programs...

219
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,580
and traveled.

220
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,120
How is Wan Seung these days?

221
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,150
He exercises in the morning...

222
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,680
and comes to work at Ha And Jung on time.

223
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,650
He doesn't see his former
colleagues from the police.

224
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,180
He often goes drinking...

225
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,320
with his new judiciary acquaintances.

226
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,920
Anything unusual?

227
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,650
Recently he bought very
expensive handmade...

228
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,920
Swiss watches with his company credit card.

229
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,980
Find out why he has been to the US.

230
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,220
(7080 Live Pub)

231
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,349
You said you'd be an international lawyer.

232
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,449
Why are you back so soon?

233
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,479
Come on, I'm too old to study.

234
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,680
I just went there for fun.

235
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,420
And to find someone.

236
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,320
Find who?

237
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,820
I already find the person.

238
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,150
The US is great.

239
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,860
Private detectives are
quicker than the police.

240
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,220
As long as you give them money.

241
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,850
Who did you find?

242
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,980
You'll be surprised.

243
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Hyun Soo.

244
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,520
See? I told you you'd be surprised.

245
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,080
Seo Hyun Soo?

246
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,450
Was she really in the US?

247
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,050
I only saw her in pictures.

248
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,320
She's gotten old.

249
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,980
She was very different...

250
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,380
from how I imagined her to be.

251
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,680
How did she end up in the US?

252
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,150
The private detective said...

253
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,850
she was chased out to Japan.

254
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,520
She met a Korean-American there...

255
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,920
Did she get married?

256
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,080
She did and got divorced.

257
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,550
I misunderstood my dad all along.

258
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,520
What will you do now?

259
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,980
I'll make her come back.

260
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,420
Jang Do Jang is dead now.

261
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,480
As long as I'm with Ha And Jung,

262
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,520
nobody can hurt Hyun Soo.

263
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,720
Will you get back together with Hyun Soo?

264
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,220
What? Seo Hyun Soo?

265
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,180
Seo Hyun Soo?

266
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,020
You're crazy.

267
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,820
Seo Hyun Soo is dead.

268
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,319
(Comics)

269
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Are you sure Seo Hyun Soo is dead?

270
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,450
Mr. Ha is being suspicious.

271
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,020
I buried her with Do Jang.

272
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,480
Jang Do Jang is already dead.

273
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,980
Who's going to prove it?

274
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,680
You didn't...

275
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,820
let Seo Hyun Soo run off,

276
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,580
did you?

277
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,220
You know I don't have the nerves.

278
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,050
What's all that?

279
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,980
Hyun Soo.

280
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,150
I don't want her to stay in a hotel.

281
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,850
I wonder if she only wears
pants like she used to.

282
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,850
When will she be here?

283
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,350
On the 29th.

284
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I already sent her the flight ticket.

285
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,580
She's not doing well financially.

286
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,080
The 29th?

287
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,820
It's a good thing I moved in here.

288
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,650
Hyun Soo doesn't have a
place to stay in Korea.

289
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,350
There will be a welcome back party...

290
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,750
on the 30th. Do you want to come?

291
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,020
You've been curious about Hyun Soo.

292
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,050
Who's this?

293
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,650
What are you trying to do?

294
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,220
Seo Hyun Soo is dead.

295
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,150
I buried her myself.

296
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,850
She isn't dead.

297
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,180
I carried her to the hospital myself.

298
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,020
Hyun Soo.

299
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,180
Excuse me. Could you please help?

300
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,520
You need to help her.

301
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,720
She bled a lot, so she fell unconscious.

302
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,780
However, the doctor said the
wound itself wasn't deep.

303
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,880
Hyun Soo...

304
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,820
walked out of the hospital alive.

305
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,380
I checked the security footage too.

306
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,720
Did she walk out of the hospital?

307
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,350
Do you know why?

308
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,380
It's because of you.

309
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,880
The moment he walks into
this hospital room,

310
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,320
I'm going to fire.

311
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
You need to leave before he walks in.

312
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,980
There's a car waiting for you
in front of the hospital.

313
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,480
Can you do that?

314
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,750
Then I can ask Hyun Soo myself.

315
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,650
It'll be an interesting story.

316
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,520
I knew it was odd for you
to work for Ha And Jung.

317
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,820
I know you.

318
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,050
You're scheming something, right?

319
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,450
But I won't fall for it so easily.

320
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,119
You look busy. I'll leave.

321
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,650
Will you? I thought you had a question.

322
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,720
It's nothing. I'll see
you at work tomorrow.

323
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,480
Mr. Ha, this is Jung Ji Won.

324
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,820
Wan Seung saw a video of Ms.
Seo walking out.

325
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,820
We'll find the video too.

326
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,180
That's when there weren't many cameras.
I didn't know.

327
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,650
They just put one up in
the entrance for a test.

328
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,919
Why did she have to be on the footage?

329
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,250
Is that your excuse?

330
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,820
Mr. Ha has the video footage.

331
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,350
He's suspicious of you.

332
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,250
Once Mr. Ha turns his back on you,

333
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,020
I can't help you anymore.

334
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,180
I clearly buried her deep.

335
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,820
Then...

336
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,980
you must be sure that her body is there.

337
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,820
I saw a video...

338
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,980
of Hyun Soo walking out of the hospital...

339
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,120
with my own two eyes.

340
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,520
She died right after that.

341
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,720
How could I believe that?

342
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,980
You hid the fact that she was hospitalized.

343
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,350
He remembers the place where he buried her.

344
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,820
Detective Ko, I mean.

345
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,050
Are you having...

346
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,150
any other ideas by any chance?

347
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,450
Do you think I hid her away?

348
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,450
Were you really unable to find...

349
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,626
that thing she had?

350
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,450
Mr. Ha, I'm very disappointed.

351
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,420
I'm the one who is desperate to find that.

352
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,150
Then would you like to see
her body with your eyes?

353
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,750
How would I recognize her
body after 17 years?

354
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,020
We'll know for sure after a DNA test.

355
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,880
We will...

356
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,080
collect her DNA on our side.

357
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,550
As you wish.

358
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,280
All right.

359
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,420
Give me a call when you have the date.

360
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,950
I'm here.

361
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,580
Have a great life.

362
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,220
Goodbye.

363
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,520
We can catch him.

364
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,820
The culprit.

365
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,450
Lady.

366
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,080
Lady, are you okay?

367
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,780
We can...

368
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,450
catch him.

369
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,350
It's no use. The statute
of limitation ran out.

370
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,350
Wait, did you hear everything I said?

371
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,380
Do you know what time it is?

372
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,780
Then why did we set up
a time for a meeting?

373
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,650
Did you look into a similar
case in Shinim-dong?

374
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,880
Yes.

375
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,180
Was it wrapped up after the
victim, Yoo In Sang, died?

376
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,649
Wow, there is your superhuman sense again.

377
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,920
How did you know?

378
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,850
They covered up Hyun Soo's
case with Shinim-dong case.

379
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,519
Ms. Seo's name wasn't on the will,

380
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,920
but it was odd how you
knew about the two cases.

381
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,550
That means the person who
gave you the case file knows.

382
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,920
That taxi driver killed Ms. Seo.

383
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,280
If they covered up one case with the other,

384
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,820
there must be another designer
other than Detective Ko.

385
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,650
The statute of limitation
doesn't apply anymore.

386
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,280
We just have to get the culprit.

387
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,019
Oh, gosh, what's wrong with this?

388
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,249
I'm sorry. Something else was on my mind.

389
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,320
Goodness.

390
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,080
You have an expensive watch,
but you're always late.

391
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,820
The surveillance is harsher than ever.

392
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,080
Wow, that's a good sign.

393
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,249
And this watch is a fake.

394
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,650
I'm paying for this place
by selling those watches.

395
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,520
All of my watches are fake now.

396
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
You're here.

397
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,650
Wait, are you coming just now?

398
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,920
Then why did we set up
a time for a meeting?

399
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,419
I got here first.

400
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,820
I was in the bathroom.

401
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,550
Take a seat.

402
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,820
My gosh, why isn't he coming?

403
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,120
Captain Bae.

404
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,620
Goodness.

405
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,826
Hey. You're here.

406
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,380
If you're going to sleep, why
did we set up this time?

407
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,656
I'm sorry, man.

408
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,419
I was on a stakeout yesterday.

409
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,180
Gosh, darn it.

410
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,620
There's no use in catching
just Detective Ko.

411
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,120
He's chased after for Jang
Do Jang's murder anyway.

412
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,850
We need the murder instigator.

413
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,019
Murder instigation gives you...

414
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,750
the same sentence as committing a murder.

415
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,480
But...

416
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,550
would that be all right?

417
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
What is?

418
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,120
He's your dad.

419
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,520
Have you been seeing Ho Cheol again?

420
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,280
It looked like you are.

421
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,380
It looked like you're often
on the phone with Ms. Jung.

422
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,620
That's work-related.

423
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,750
Wait, are you jealous?

424
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,449
I mean, Ms. Jung is on Ha And Jung's side.

425
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,580
I'm suspicious that you
might be spying on us.

426
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,249
You just got out of the hospital.
Stop drinking.

427
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,690
You should take care of your health.

428
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,450
It's because I made these meatballs.

429
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,950
You can't eat that without alcohol.

430
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,680
You cooked something inedible again.

431
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,350
My cooking got much better.

432
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,350
You never tasted any of it.

433
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,050
According to Officer Lee
from Shinim Police Station,

434
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,679
the other detectives seem to be...

435
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,650
looking out for Detective Ko.

436
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,980
Of course, Ha And Jung's behind them.

437
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,350
Where do you think he is?

438
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,380
Here you go.

439
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,679
Because of that,

440
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,750
Ha And Jung can't really
cut Detective Ko loose.

441
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,450
Everyone's connected.

442
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,649
Detective Ko's been quite active.

443
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,220
He uses the public phone
next to his hideout often.

444
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,720
Did you drop enough hints
that Hyun Soo's alive?

445
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,296
Everyone should've heard by now.

446
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,280
I call her every day.

447
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,820
Secretary Pyo even pulled my call records.

448
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,550
The client didn't see her
die and can't be sure.

449
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,819
I don't know about the rest...

450
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,220
but Lawyer Jung fell for it.

451
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,250
Seo Hyun Soo's alive.

452
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,850
It can't be.

453
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,020
It's a groundless rumor.

454
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,379
He mentioned her to a Mr. Kim.

455
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,850
Like he was reporting back.

456
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,280
Mr. Kim?

457
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,189
I heard at a private club that...

458
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,650
everyone's trying to get his number.

459
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,720
He's great at cleaning up.

460
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,950
Mr. Kim changes his number every month.

461
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,750
No one knows his name or face but...

462
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,250
he knows more than the
National Intelligence Service.

463
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,020
Do you think Hyun Soo died...

464
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,420
because she knew something she shouldn't?

465
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,280
I'm positive that this Mr.
Kim works for my dad.

466
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,620
Detective Ko works for that Mr. Kim.

467
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,420
Mr. Ha agreed to a DNA test.

468
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,720
So, where did you bury the body?

469
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,650
I will tell you on the day.

470
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,319
We need to check first to...

471
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,980
I will take you there myself.

472
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,720
Do you not trust me?

473
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,350
You're the one who doesn't trust me.

474
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,690
Mr. Ha's leaving to Hangook Hospital.

475
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,350
Dad's really busy.

476
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,420
He went to a hospital.

477
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,220
He's way too healthy.

478
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,850
The DNA test.

479
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,120
How do you know where your father is?

480
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,020
I bought his people with his money.

481
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,480
We should get ready.

482
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,980
It's almost time to wrap up.

483
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,650
Go, go.

484
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,620
I thought he was exercising too much.

485
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,549
A tangsuyuk and noodles, right?

486
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,690
Leave it there.

487
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,850
Enjoy.

488
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,350
(Comics)

489
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,150
Okay, perfect.

490
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,650
To Hangook Hospital?

491
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Yes.

492
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
Mr. Ha.

493
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,080
Do you want to strike a deal...

494
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,420
with information on Wan Seung?

495
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,980
Whatever it is,

496
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,690
he will come back in due time.

497
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,720
You are so foolish.

498
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,850
Have you forgotten the accident?

499
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,920
Do not forget.

500
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,150
It doesn't end with me.

501
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,550
There's something bigger than our law firm.

502
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Have you eaten yet?

503
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,350
Are we close enough to ask each other that?

504
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,690
A lot has happened...

505
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,080
between us.

506
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,720
Get to the point.

507
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,080
Did serving Mr. Ha...

508
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,620
make your life any better?

509
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,350
The point, please.

510
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,020
Work with me.

511
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,620
Let's take the law firm.

512
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,720
Why should you bow to Mr. Ha?

513
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,750
What do you have on Wan Seung?

514
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,920
Why did he come back?

515
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,350
It's something you can't handle.

516
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,650
This is the last time.

517
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,420
Get creative again and you're
banned from the kitchen.

518
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,450
Stick to the recipe.

519
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,550
I'm doing as it says.

520
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
That's enough.

521
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,950
I almost added too much again.

522
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,120
Not bad.

523
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,579
Now let it simmer.

524
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,580
Okay.

525
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,850
That must be a customer.

526
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,079
Keep stirring so it doesn't stick.

527
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Okay.

528
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,279
Stir.

529
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Right.

530
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Detective?

531
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,580
He's on the move.

532
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
What happened?

533
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,850
Seol Ok.

534
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,520
You're banned from the kitchen!

535
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,650
Why are you suddenly refusing to be there?

536
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,620
If I were to be at the scene,

537
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,380
you might suspect me of...

538
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,380
switching the DNA samples.

539
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,779
What if you suspect me
because I am there alone?

540
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,580
What are you talking about?

541
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,250
I trust you completely.

542
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,020
Very well.

543
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,950
I'll tell you the results
as soon as I have them.

544
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,220
Lawyer Jung.

545
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,420
You gave me information.

546
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,820
I'll give you what you want.

547
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,320
What do you want?

548
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,950
Ha And Jung.

549
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,920
What? Get in.

550
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,850
You still believe Hyun
Soo's alive, don't you?

551
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,550
I know there's no possibility.

552
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,896
If you don't think you can see the corpse,

553
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,719
we can go without you.

554
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,080
It might not be her.

555
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,720
Right.

556
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,420
We shouldn't be biased.

557
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,120
Let's go and check.

558
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,020
Keep stirring so it doesn't stick.

559
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,350
Stir.

560
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,750
What?

561
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,980
Were you really scared to get in?

562
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,780
You're different today.

563
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,820
You get scared?

564
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,750
This is it.

565
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:42,780
Let's go.

566
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,920
See? I told you I'd buried her.

567
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,180
The test results will
tell us whether it's her.

568
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,380
Go and get a sample.

569
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,219
Get it from a femur and the
cartilage from a right rib.

570
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,350
Okay.

571
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,580
The test will take 24 hours.

572
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,980
No one else can find out about this.

573
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,220
Yes, sir.

574
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,550
We shall...

575
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,850
run some tests on this ourselves.

576
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,850
Our results...

577
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,120
should correspond, shouldn't they?

578
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,950
Of course, they should and will.

579
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,150
If that's all, we can go.

580
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,480
Cover it back up carefully.

581
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,780
What are you doing here?

582
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,680
I heard you found Hyun Soo.

583
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,620
I came to see if she's really dead.

584
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,950
What are you doing here?

585
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,280
To set up a murder for hire?

586
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,850
Are you here to check...

587
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,850
if you killed her the first time?

588
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,620
Was it a trap?

589
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,480
You set for me?

590
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,450
I will tell you everything that I know.

591
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,580
Why Wan Seung joined Ha And Jung...

592
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,720
and what's he's up to now.

593
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,380
You're under arrest for...

594
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,950
murder and the disposal of a body.

595
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,826
You don't know what you've done.

596
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,120
Everyone should pay the price
for what they've done.

597
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,320
Hyun Soo.

598
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,850
I said I'd find you.

599
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,850
That I wouldn't die before I do.

600
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,580
It's so pretty.

601
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,720
Thank you.

602
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,450
I love you.

603
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,980
Me too.

604
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,350
I love you.

605
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,580
I love you.

606
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,519
The CEO of Ha And Jung,
Korea's largest law firm...

607
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,050
was questioned for instigating a murder.

608
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,379
17 years ago, Mr. Ha Jae Ho...

609
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,449
instructed a Shinim-dong detective...

610
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,620
to kill a young Ms. Seo.

611
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,080
(Mr. Ha)

612
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,220
You...

613
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,250
know nothing about Seo Hyun Soo.

614
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,920
She's not the woman you think she is.

615
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,650
So you had her killed?

616
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,220
Or...

617
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,320
did she see something she shouldn't have?

618
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,780
It was all because of you.

619
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,450
You started to look into her death...

620
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,180
and to save your life...

621
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,850
I got involved.

622
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,519
If only you hadn't joined the police...

623
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,980
and reported her missing...

624
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,850
in order to find her,

625
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,680
I could have...

626
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,150
lived the rest of my life
not knowing about her.

627
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,050
Why are you taking the fall?

628
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,520
There's more, isn't there?

629
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,850
I will...

630
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,380
get out soon enough.

631
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,180
You have solved nothing.

632
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,980
It's so nice and clean.

633
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,479
Those windows are so high
up, so I can't reach them.

634
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,179
You should've told me sooner.

635
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,720
I love a good arm workout.

636
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,819
- Did you get those?
- Yes.

637
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,819
- It's hot, I'll open the window.
- Okay.

638
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,850
This feels great.

639
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,650
Oh, right.

640
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,780
Seol Ok will be here alone tomorrow.

641
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,380
I'm off to see Dong Ho.

642
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,250
Shall I come along?

643
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,120
Kids can't get enough of a policeman.

644
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,320
I'll show him my handcuffs and police car.

645
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,820
Shall I show up in my uniform?

646
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,920
Forget it, you're too busy.

647
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:16,850
Boys don't like to hang
out with their moms.

648
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,020
They need physical playtime.

649
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,180
Is that why he gets bored
when he's with me?

650
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,479
He's full of energy at that age.

651
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,820
What can he do with you?

652
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,150
There's something on your face.

653
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,980
- What's this?
- Where?

654
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,550
What's this here?

655
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,080
She's been living by herself now.

656
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,780
Let's not get on her nerves.

657
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,050
Hey.

658
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,120
You get more on my nerves when you do that.

659
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,520
You can stick together, all right?

660
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,150
She became sulky.

661
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,150
We should be careful.

662
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,180
I'm telling you, that's not the case.

663
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,580
Please, go on.

664
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,450
I'm sorry.

665
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:16,850
Me too.

666
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:20,350
- Goodness.
- I'm sorry.

667
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,180
Me too.

668
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,380
Why are you here again? I
heard you were reinstated.

669
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,350
My sixth sense tends to work when I'm here.

670
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,850
To be honest, I'm in charge
of a difficult case.

671
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,849
Stop luring me into it..

672
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,720
My exam is coming up.

673
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,550
I'm only going to study for a while.

674
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,250
You're like Sherlock.
Of course, you'll pass.

675
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,050
And you're fast, so you'll
pass the fitness test.

676
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,120
I'm bad at pushups and sit-ups.

677
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,720
And I don't know anything
about criminal procedure law.

678
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,620
Open the page. I'll teach you.

679
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,520
Go and catch your criminals.

680
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
You're so cheap.

681
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,180
I hope you fail the police employment test.

682
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,320
What is it?

683
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,820
What is the case anyway?

684
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,350
I'm so curious.

685
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,420
Gosh, he never helps.

686
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:43,950
Detective Ha.

687
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,120
What's the case?

688
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,020
Detective Ko died.

689
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,780
He was killed.

690
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,080
And Hyun Soo's DNA...

691
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,750
was illegible.

692
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,650
They even did mitochondria DNA test,

693
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,620
but five testing labs
said it was illegible.

694
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,850
The case...

695
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,250
isn't over yet.

696
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,180
I have a feeling about this.

697
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,850
Something smells fishy.

698
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,950
There's something bigger.

699
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,280
I'm not sure how big this is,

700
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:40,350
but if you have sinned,
you must pay for it.

701
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,650
Mr. Kim?

702
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,350
I heard you've been looking for me.

703
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,580
Who are you?

704
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,350
It's me, Hyun Soo.

705
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,350
Seo Hyun Soo.

706
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,979
We should go to the
detention center first...

707
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,519
to catch the one who killed Detective Ko.

708
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,820
Lady, even a police officer
can't go in there.

709
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,280
- I have a way around.
- A way around?

710
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,126
Aren't you going to take the
police employment test?

711
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,626
I'll take it again next year.

712
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,120
You always say that.

713
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,819
You should come work for me.
I'll take a good care.

714
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,079
Why would I go work for you?

715
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,479
Wait, there's an age limit to the test.

716
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,980
How old are you again?

717
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,780
I still have more time.

718
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,520
- I think this is your last year.
- No, it's not.

719
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:09,020
- My gosh.
- Let's just go get some coffee.

720
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,579
(Thank you for watching Queen of Mystery.)

721
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,750
("Queen for Seven Days"
will be aired next week.)
