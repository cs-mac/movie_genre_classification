1
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:46,214
<i>My grandfather, King George-</i>

2
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:48,517
<i>he take'em me walkabout...</i>

3
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:51,683
<i>teach me blackfella way.</i>

4
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,423
<i>Grandfather teach'em me</i>
<i>most important lesson of all.</i>

5
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,656
<i>Tell'em story.</i>

6
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:05,668
<i>That day I down the billabong.</i>

7
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,007
<i>King George-he teach me how</i>
<i>to catch'em fish using magic song.</i>

8
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:16,840
<i>See, I not blackfella.</i>
<i>I not white fella either.</i>

9
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,408
<i>Them white fellas call me mixed-blood...</i>

10
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:23,219
- <i>half-caste-</i>
- Yea!

11
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,758
<i>creamy.</i>

12
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:28,761
- <i>Hyah!</i>
- <i>I belong no one.</i>

13
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,855
<i>That day I see'em them white fellas.</i>

14
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:34,628
<i>They were pushing</i>
<i>them cheeky bulls across the river...</i>

15
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:37,603
<i>onto Carney land.</i>

16
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:45,708
<i>King George angry at them white fellas.</i>

17
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:51,776
<i>King George say</i>
<i>them white fella bad spirit.</i>

18
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:54,480
<i>Must be taken from this land.</i>

19
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:22,142
<i>Shh.</i>

20
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,191
Coppers.

21
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,066
<i>Them coppers come take me away.</i>

22
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:20,039
<i>They want to put me</i>
<i>on that Mission Island.</i>

23
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,737
<i>Make me into a white fella.</i>

24
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,806
<i>But they're not coppers.</i>

25
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:33,677
Whoa there. Whoa. Whoa.

26
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,248
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

27
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,318
<i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>

28
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:46,332
<i>The strangest woman I ever seen.</i>

29
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,664
<i>She's not from this land.</i>

30
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:56,904
<i>This land my people</i>
<i>got many names for...</i>

31
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,968
<i>but white fellas call it...</i>

32
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:02,739
<i>Australia.</i>

33
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,652
<i>But this story not begin that day.</i>

34
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:13,091
<i>This story begin a little while ago</i>
<i>in a land far, far away.</i>

35
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,357
<i>That land called England.</i>

36
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:25,229
My husband must sell Faraway Downs.

37
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:28,707
<i>But the offer from</i>
<i>this "Cattle King,"Mr. Carney...</i>

38
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:31,108
is only one-sixth
of what it was once worth.

39
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:33,112
We need the money, Ramsden.

40
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,705
But Maitland
is just about to muster the fats.

41
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,080
What?

42
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,119
Get the-the big cows ready for market.

43
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:41,120
<i>Ramsden, you and I both know...</i>

44
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:45,352
there is only one reason my husband
has spent so much time down under...

45
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:48,054
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with cows.

46
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,995
At least not of the animal variety.

47
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:53,260
Lady Ashley,
I-I do think that's a bit harsh.

48
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:56,394
- Oh, Ramsden, drink your tea.
- Lady Ashley!

49
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,303
<i>What do you intend to do?</i>

50
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,568
I intend to travel
to this cattle station...

51
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:03,337
sell it...

52
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,935
and bring Maitland home myself!

53
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:09,505
<i>But, Lady Ashley, it's Australia.</i>

54
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:13,480
<i>Darling Sarah, I implore you, do not travel.</i>

55
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:15,613
<i>Outbreak of war imminent. Stop.</i>

56
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,489
<i> Maitland, your concern</i>
<i>regarding war duly noted. Stop.</i>

57
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,528
<i>Have plan concerning cattle.</i>

58
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:24,029
<i>Sale to King Carney not necessary.</i>

59
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:27,590
- <i>Need more time. Stop.</i>
- <i> Nonsense. Stop.</i>

60
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:32,037
<i>Expect contract for sale of station</i>
<i>to be drawn by time of my arrival. Stop.</i>

61
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:35,269
<i>Cannot meet you. Stop.
Am mustering. Stop.</i>

62
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:38,709
<i>Have sent trusted man. Stop.</i>
<i>The Drover. Stop.</i>

63
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,438
The Drover?

64
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:56,526
<i>Drover, you boong lover.</i>

65
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:03,499
Any of you other Carney boys
want to have a go?

66
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:12,405
Come on, fellas.
Don't let fear stand in your way.

67
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:14,912
I'll have ya.

68
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:19,250
Hey! No boongs in here!

69
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,687
He's not in the pub, Ivan.

70
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:27,492
<i> Go on.</i>

71
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:31,998
<i>Run after your boong friend, 'cause as far</i>
<i>as this town's concerned, you</i> are <i>a black.</i>

72
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,500
You work with them,
you eat with them...

73
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:36,502
and you sleep with them.

74
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,538
Oh, crikey.

75
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,541
When you see her, wave your hat.

76
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,821
What are you waiting for, an invitation?

77
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,316
I hate coming to town.

78
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:06,026
Lady Sarah Ashley.

79
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,934
A genuine aristocrat
living right here in Darwin.

80
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,766
Administrator, we're at war.

81
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,306
Oh.

82
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,239
<i>As the officer...</i>

83
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,971
<i>in charge of livestock purchases</i>
<i>for the armed forces-</i>

84
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:21,208
- She's quite a looker.
- <i>I fail to see...</i>

85
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:24,148
what Lady Sarah Ashley...

86
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:28,245
<i>has to do with Carney's stranglehold</i>
<i>of the beef industry.</i>

87
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,620
<i>Her husband, Lord Ashley...</i>

88
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:33,785
claims he's mustering fats
at Faraway Downs.

89
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,829
- <i>Faraway Downs?</i>
- Faraway Downs.

90
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:38,922
The only cattle station
in the whole of the north...

91
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:42,594
not owned by Leslie "King" Carney.

92
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,505
- Lord Maitland Ashley
is mustering on Faraway Downs?

93
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,765
<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

94
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,435
- Isn't quite what we had in mind, is it, Neil?
- <i>No. Yeah.</i>

95
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,105
And now his missus has arrived
on the flying boat.

96
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,014
<i>Doesn't look like they're gonna sell</i>
<i>Faraway Downs to me, Neil.</i>

97
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:59,018
Ah, she won't last.

98
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:03,022
A delicate English rose withers
in the outback. Hmm.

99
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,421
You with me?

100
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:06,823
If you must know, I am to be met-

101
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:09,954
by my husband's trusted man,
a Mr. Drover.

102
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,463
The bloody Drover?

103
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,463
Bring it. Yes.

104
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:20,029
Move it.

105
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:24,305
Look at my wife and daughter down there
giving her the royal welcome.

106
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:27,677
My fiancé, Neil Fletcher,
manages Faraway Downs.

107
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:30,873
Good day.

108
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:35,111
A bit pale.

109
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:38,283
Not a bad-looking sheila,
but what's the story on the luggage?

110
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:41,191
Wants to settle down
in the outback, does she?

111
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:46,198
<i>If she stays and Lord Ashley manages to</i>
<i>get his cattle down onto that wharfthere...</i>

112
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:49,497
<i>then we've got a competitor</i>
<i>for the army contract, Neil.</i>

113
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,734
<i>Carney's control of every</i>
<i>cattle station in the north...</i>

114
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:57,709
jeopardizes the supply of <i>beef</i>
to our troops.

115
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,475
But it's a poor war that doesn't make
a decent patriot rich, so...

116
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:04,915
<i>I don't want a single beast</i>
<i>from Faraway Downs...</i>

117
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:08,477
to set a hoof on that wharf.

118
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,193
- You with me, Neil?
- Yeah, yeah. Nature will take its course.

119
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,894
<i>What about the missus?</i>

120
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,903
No, I've arranged for someone special
to give her the old scenic route.

121
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:28,202
Give her a taste of the outback.

122
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,334
No!

123
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:35,173
- <i> Who's taking her?</i>
- The Drover.

124
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,620
The Drover?

125
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:45,624
<i>Enjoy the ride, sweetheart.</i>

126
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,096
I'm Sarah Ashley.

127
00:10:57,671 --> 00:10:59,639
My husband, Lord Ashley...

128
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,072
has sent a trusted man to collect me.

129
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:03,575
<i>A, uh-A Mr. Drover.</i>

130
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:08,572
It seems as if he has been waylaid.

131
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:12,312
No women.

132
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:13,910
Ladies' lounge next door.

133
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:17,445
<i>The hen parlor's thataway, my dear.</i>

134
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,492
No wonder your establishment is empty.

135
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:24,489
Good day.

136
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,665
Oh! Oh!

137
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,904
You can take him!

138
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,405
No!

139
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,534
Oh! No, no!

140
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:04,696
<i>No, not my bags. Not my-</i>

141
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,763
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

142
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:16,407
<i>Here.</i>

143
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,417
Welcome to Australia.

144
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,990
<i>Drover take Mrs. Boss to Faraway Downs...</i>

145
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,356
<i>in a great, big, fancy truck.</i>

146
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:31,659
<i>He even let her sit in his special seat.</i>

147
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:35,691
<i>She even drinks</i>
<i>Drover's own water bottle.</i>

148
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:36,963
<i>That's it.</i>

149
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:39,665
<i>They get along like a burnin' house.</i>

150
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,731
<i>Now, Magarri-he sit'em up top.</i>

151
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:44,800
<i>And Magarri's cousin Goolajbaloong-</i>

152
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:46,846
<i>he come along for the ride.</i>

153
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:49,381
- Oh!
- <i>They make'em friends right away.</i>

154
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,041
Water.

155
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,312
Oh.

156
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:55,253
That's it. That's it. Stay, Jedda. Stay.

157
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,490
"Trusted man."
Typical of my husband.

158
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,496
Actually, your husband's
a pretty good bloke.

159
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,862
Yes, well, he certainly knows
how to choose his employees.

160
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,925
- Employee?
- Mmm. No wonder the place is bankrupt.

161
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:12,028
- Lady, I'm not an employee.
- <i> Really?</i>

162
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,097
So you're just driving me
all the way out to Faraway Downs...

163
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:17,336
- as a personal favor to my husband, are you?
- No.

164
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:19,504
Him being
such a good bloke and all, hmm?

165
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,878
I'm driving you out there because he
promised me a drove of 1,500 head of cattle.

166
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,008
- What, to buy?
- No, you goose. To drove.

167
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,282
I'm a drover, right? I move
the cattle from "A" to "B."

168
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:31,791
<i>All right? I work on commission.</i>
<i>No man hires me, no man fires me.</i>

169
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,257
- Oh-
- Everything I own...

170
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,193
I can fit in my saddlebag,
which is the way I like it.

171
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:41,064
Oh! Yes, well, it's all-
all very "outback adventure," isn't it?

172
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:43,364
- I'm not saying it's for everyone.
- No.

173
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,701
Definitely not for everyone.

174
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,707
Most people like to own things.
You know, land, luggage, other people.

175
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:52,711
<i>Makes them feel secure.</i>
<i>But all that can be taken away.</i>

176
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:56,215
And in the end, the only thing
you really own is, uh-

177
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:58,410
is your story.

178
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,476
Just tryin' to live a good one.

179
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:04,012
Yes, yes. An adventure story.
Mmm. You sound just like my husband.

180
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,953
Oh!

181
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,259
Oh, they're kangaroos!

182
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,561
- <i>Big reds.</i>
- Oh! Lovely.

183
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,999
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

184
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,094
<i> I've never seen a kangaroo.</i>
<i>Beautiful, jumping.</i>

185
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:20,162
- <i> Yeah, they're jumping.</i>
- Oh!

186
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,731
Oh, it's beautiful.

187
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,142
- <i>Uh-</i>
- Oh! Look at them jumping!

188
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,354
Ah!

189
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,984
Mr. Drover.

190
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:14,651
Hey, Miss Boss.

191
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:16,161
Tucker, Mrs. Boss?

192
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:18,527
- Mr. Drover.
- Yeah?

193
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,998
- There's only one tent.
- That's right.

194
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:21,879
For the four of us?

195
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,230
Well, you know, it gets
pretty chilly here at night.

196
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:27,671
We, uh-We like to bunk up together,
eh, Magarri? Goolaj, huh?

197
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:30,039
Nice and close, you know.

198
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,638
Oh!

199
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,707
Oh, come on, Lady Ashley.

200
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,844
We're just having a laugh.

201
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:44,914
Never really slept in a tent in our life.
We just bunk around the fire, you see?

202
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:48,017
- See, we're not really used to, um-
- A woman?

203
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:51,325
<i>I suppose you think I should be</i>
<i>back in Darwin at the church fete...</i>

204
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:53,559
<i>or the ladies'. uh, whatever you call it.</i>

205
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:56,227
Well, I will have you know
that I am as capable as any man.

206
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:02,734
Guests. We're not used to guests.
That's what I was about to say.

207
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,903
But now you mention it, I happen to
quite like the women of the outback.

208
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,709
But they're mostly native women.

209
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:10,272
Aboriginal women.

210
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,444
<i>They're very easy to, uh-</i>

211
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,954
to get along with, if you try.

212
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:18,616
<i># Whoa, babe</i>
<i>something is bothering me #

213
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:21,951
Go!

214
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:24,189
- <i>Ho!</i>
- Him always punctual.

215
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:31,232
Get out of here!

216
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:34,171
- <i> What's that?</i>
- Your accountant.

217
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:38,143
<i> Hey, Drover!</i>
<i>He's your bloody problem now!</i>

218
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:40,202
<i>See you, Drover!</i>

219
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,778
Kippelly Flymm.

220
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:51,255
- Kippelly Flynn.
- I'm sorry. What was your name again?

221
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:55,488
Lipelling Klymm, mi- mila- milady.

222
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:57,621
Kipling Flynn.

223
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,656
Thanks.

224
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,672
<i>How long till we reach Faraway Downs?</i>

225
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,677
<i> Oh, we've been on it</i>
<i>for the last two days.</i>

226
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:17,742
- Drover! Hey, Drover!
- <i>Yeah, love. How you doing?</i>

227
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,217
<i>Good. Aren't you gonna stop</i>
<i>and have a rest for a while?</i>

228
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,755
Nah, gotta make a delivery.
Put the kettle on.

229
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:25,791
- I'll be round in a couple days. Give us a kiss.
- Okay.

230
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,384
See you soon.

231
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,827
- She's easy to get on with.
- Ah, she's trouble, that one.

232
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:32,831
- See you later!
- <i>Bye!</i>

233
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:35,834
You and my husband
share an interest.

234
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:37,529
An interest? Really?

235
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:41,335
Come on. We all know the real reason
that my husband is out here.

236
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:44,343
Oh. Right.
You mean the breeding. Yeah.

237
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,709
- Breeding?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

238
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,873
No, we're both dead keen on breeding.

239
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,883
I have this idea,
which, uh-which he loves.

240
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:53,545
You might be quite excited
about it too, actually.

241
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,351
Now, I'm a brumby man,
but his fancy English filly, Capricornia...

242
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:59,153
<i>has really caught my eye.</i>

243
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,785
I got to admit.
She is gorgeous. Really gorgeous.

244
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,126
Gorgeous creature.

245
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:11,537
<i>I've always wanted to mate an English</i>
<i>thoroughbred with a bush brumby.</i>

246
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:15,540
<i>I mean, it'd be magic, wouldn't it?</i>
<i>Magic.</i>

247
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,667
- <i>Imagine that combination.</i>
- Don't. Don't you say another word.

248
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,542
- I know what you're implying.
- You've thought about it, too, haven't you?

249
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:22,740
Capricornia-You- Poppycock!

250
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,579
- What are you talking about?
- Poppycock!

251
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:37,496
Coppers.

252
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:41,159
- What are you talking about?
- You-You want-

253
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:47,239
- You want to have it on with me.
- What? What was that?

254
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,241
Oh, you know exactly what I'm saying.

255
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,436
<i>Just like you have it on with</i>
<i>that poor girl you're exploiting...</i>

256
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:53,672
and-and-and God knows how many others.

257
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:55,112
What are you talking about?

258
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:01,618
- You got a filthy mind, lady.
- You're an animal!

259
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:04,714
I wouldn't have it on with you
if you were the only tart left in Australia.

260
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,554
- Animal! You are a-
- Believe me, I wouldn't-

261
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:08,059
<i>You-</i>

262
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,122
<i>Oh!</i>

263
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:17,600
Oh!

264
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,932
<i>What was that?</i>

265
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,166
- Stay in the car.
- No, no.

266
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:24,039
Get your hands off me.

267
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,145
For once in your life,
do as you're bloody told.

268
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,598
<i>There she is.</i>

269
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:51,871
Faraway Downs.

270
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:05,706
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

271
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:08,515
- <i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>
- Oh! Oh!

272
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:26,931
Lady Ashley, wait! Don't go in there!

273
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm so sorry.

274
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:26,631
<i>My family has had the honor of serving...</i>

275
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:30,430
the owners of Faraway Downs
for three generations.

276
00:21:30,503 --> 00:21:33,063
<i>We know how hard this land can be.</i>

277
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,006
<i>But Lord Maitland Ashley-he-</i>

278
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:38,009
he never gave up.

279
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:41,740
The only thing that could stop this decent
and courageous man was a spear...

280
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:45,773
<i>from a murderous black,</i>
<i>the so-called King George.</i>

281
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:48,719
<i>And he will be brought to justice.</i>

282
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:52,019
<i>Let us now pray for Maitland Ashley...</i>

283
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:55,686
<i>that his soul may enter peacefully</i>
<i>through the gates of heaven.</i>

284
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:08,601
Lady Ashley, we can leave for Darwin
first thing in the morning.

285
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,700
Yes, yes. Certainly, Mr. Fletcher.

286
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:12,438
Watch the, um-

287
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,679
I can't understand what my husband
would have seen out here.

288
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:22,748
Yeah, this land has a strange power.

289
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:06,624
<i>That first night, when the sun go to sleep...</i>

290
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:11,193
<i>King George tell me</i>
<i>this land be healed.</i>

291
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:16,265
<i>He tell'em me that woman-</i>
<i>that far, far away woman-</i>

292
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:19,140
<i>she be like the rain.</i>

293
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:23,308
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>I'm gonna sing her to me.</i>

294
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:28,513
<i> Make the land sing.</i>

295
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:13,895
I let you see me now.

296
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:16,025
Who are you?

297
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:18,195
I Nullah.

298
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:20,171
How did you get in here?

299
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:23,106
I make myself invisible...

300
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:25,337
with <i>gulapa</i> magic!

301
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:36,319
What do you want?

302
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:39,825
That <i>balanda</i> Fletcher
been curse to this place.

303
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:44,325
<i>But you like Rainbow Serpent.</i>

304
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,629
You <i>mien-muk.</i>

305
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,693
<i>You heal this land, so I sing you to me.</i>

306
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:56,039
Like I sing a fish to me.

307
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:08,983
<i>I sing, too...</i>

308
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:12,616
when Mama and Fletcher...

309
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,251
make wrong-side business.

310
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:17,887
Wrong-sided business?

311
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,432
You know.

312
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,434
Laying down and tickling.

313
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:26,268
- Oh, my goodness.
- Me and you secret.

314
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:29,672
Oh, my goodness. Mr. Fletcher?

315
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:32,074
I got to sing to Mama to warn her...

316
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:34,170
that Lord Boss Ashley is coming down.

317
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:36,511
Maitland? I- I-

318
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:39,073
<i>I mean, Lord Ashley?</i>

319
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:41,586
Yeah. He plenty funny.

320
00:25:41,654 --> 00:25:46,284
So that's why I took him down the billabong,
shown him all the big, fat, cheeky bulls.

321
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:49,328
Come here. Look'em. Look.

322
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,454
Get pushed across that river...

323
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,465
over to Carney land.

324
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,262
The bulls.

325
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,529
<i>"Billabong"?</i>

326
00:25:57,603 --> 00:25:59,730
<i>That's where Maitland was killed.</i>

327
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:02,001
<i> But, Mrs. Boss, that spear was-</i>

328
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,939
Please don't.

329
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,807
Don't make'em that policeman
take away my boy.

330
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:09,043
Them coppers. That bad Fletcher.

331
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:12,983
He say you see me,
you send me to the Mission Island.

332
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:16,112
To that lock-lock.
Throw away bloody key.

333
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,358
Please, missus! Quick!

334
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:21,985
I make us invisible.

335
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:47,901
- Mrs. Boss.
- Oh! Oh. It's you.

336
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,972
Last night, I show you-

337
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,142
Hyah!

338
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:54,652
where-

339
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,414
Yeah.
She's a beautiful day, isn't she?

340
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,755
How was your sleep? Restful?

341
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:03,954
I wouldn't say so, no.

342
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,590
Yeah, now, the boys are-
the boys are just finishing up.

343
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:10,124
Gotta tell you, they're a pretty sorry mob
of cattle. Seems hardly worth the effort.

344
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:12,136
Ready to go, Lady Ashley?

345
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,131
Billabong.

346
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:16,071
Mr. Fletcher...

347
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:18,940
<i>tell me about the big,</i>
<i>fat cows that cross the river...</i>

348
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:20,945
down at the "billabalong,"
or whatever you call it.

349
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:23,675
Near the billabong?
No, that's Carney property over there.

350
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:25,239
Our cattle don't cross the river.

351
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:27,650
- Apparently they do.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

352
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,244
Who-Who says they do?

353
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:32,314
That little boy there.

354
00:28:38,698 --> 00:28:42,361
<i>Oh, you mean the little half-caste fella?</i>

355
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:44,835
Hey. Hey, little fella. Come here.

356
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:48,635
<i>Come and tell Mr. Fletcher</i>
<i>what you told me last night.</i>

357
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,600
Yeah, come on, Nullah.

358
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:55,004
- <i> Yes.</i>
- They're funny ones.

359
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:05,515
Now...

360
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:08,719
did you see big, fat cattle
crossing Marmont River?

361
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:13,288
<i>Or were they just Carney cattle on</i>
<i>the other side of the river having a drink?</i>

362
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,636
<i>Them just Carney cattle, Mr. Fletcher.</i>

363
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:21,502
- I been lookin' myself.
- Yeah?

364
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:29,911
Ah, you tell great, big,
tall stories, don't ya, eh?

365
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:34,078
<i> It's all right, Mr. Fletcher.</i>
<i>I'm sure the boy just made a mistake.</i>

366
00:29:34,153 --> 00:29:36,519
<i> All right.</i>
<i>We best get going, Lady Ashley.</i>

367
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:40,821
Sing Song. Take the little fella to the kitchen.
Give him a big feed of that tucker he likes.

368
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:43,862
- Forgive me, Mr. Fletcher.
- Look. I understand.

369
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:45,692
You barely slept.

370
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:47,756
- Wait, wait.
- Let me go.

371
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,033
Yeah. Well, that old windmill
hasn't turned in years.

372
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:54,402
He's a sweet little boy.
I don't think he meant any harm.

373
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:57,499
Yeah, no, they're funny, little creamies.
They're all a bit soft in the head, yeah.

374
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:00,602
<i>That's why the, uh, government</i>
<i>sends them to the mission.</i>

375
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,547
<i>They all tell bloody monstrous lies.</i>
<i>Yeah. And the next one, quick.</i>

376
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:05,550
<i>Come on. We haven't got all day.</i>

377
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:07,449
<i>I no bloody liar!</i>

378
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:12,018
<i>He liar! He say this not work!</i>

379
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:26,433
Fletcher liar!

380
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:29,703
- <i>No! Leave him alone!</i>
- Nullah!

381
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:32,243
- Fletcher!
- I curse you!

382
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:35,144
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

383
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:38,650
- Please!
- Run! Run! Run, Nullah! Run!

384
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:40,948
I curse you!

385
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,284
Leave him alone!

386
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:46,256
<i>Mr. Fletcher!</i>

387
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:49,123
- Leave him alone!
- Mr. Fletcher!

388
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,292
<i> Get off my property.</i>

389
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,267
You no longer work for me.

390
00:30:57,336 --> 00:31:00,737
<i> If I go, my men go with me.</i>

391
00:31:00,806 --> 00:31:04,765
There won't be a single bloody beast in the
stockyard to start the drove in the morning.

392
00:31:04,844 --> 00:31:07,904
<i>You heard what I said.</i>
<i>Get off my property!</i>

393
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,914
- Yeah?
- <i>Go!</i>

394
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:12,507
Now!

395
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:17,749
You're the boss.

396
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:20,858
<i>Flynn, get in the car.</i>

397
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,860
I'll give you a new job somewhere else.

398
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,987
Bunchemup, grab the gear.
Pack it up.

399
00:31:25,064 --> 00:31:27,362
<i>I'll see you in Desperation Creek</i>
<i>in a few days.</i>

400
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:35,066
Bloody old fool.

401
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,813
Carney's gonna get this property.

402
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:49,878
Been a pleasure working for ya.
Real pleasure.

403
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,684
<i>Yeah.</i>

404
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:21,716
<i> That strange woman-</i>
<i>she fire'em that Fletcher.</i>

405
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:29,321
<i>He can't hurt Mama no more.</i>

406
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:39,602
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>we call her... Mrs. Boss.</i>

407
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:47,169
Why would Fletcher block the water pump?

408
00:32:47,246 --> 00:32:49,646
I don't know. All crazy.

409
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:52,616
- White fella, blackfella- all crazy.
- Crazy.

410
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:06,063
<i> Mr. Flynn.</i>

411
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:10,266
- Milady.
- Don't get up.

412
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:14,104
The truth, Mr. Flynn.

413
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,473
This, uh, ledger...

414
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:26,610
which, um, Fletcher had me keep
for the benefit of your husband...

415
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:29,711
is a tale of decline and ruin...

416
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:33,383
redolent of the great Gibbon.

417
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,893
There is, however, another...

418
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:38,259
kept for the benefit...

419
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,128
of Mr. Carney...

420
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,660
<i>in which is recorded</i>
<i>all the unbranded...</i>

421
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:47,729
fat cattle...

422
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:52,106
- siphoned off across the river and into his herd.
- <i>## </i>

423
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:54,407
And the boy.

424
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,972
<i>He's Fletcher's son, isn't he?</i>

425
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,282
As with all things Fletcher,
it's impossible to prove anything.

426
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:04,948
Still, if Carney's good Christian wife...

427
00:34:05,024 --> 00:34:07,993
ever comes to the same conclusion
as yourself...

428
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,861
Fletcher's chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed.

429
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:15,799
I'm going to the authorities,
and I will be telling them-

430
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:18,530
- Carney <i>is</i> the authority here.
- Are you suggesting...

431
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:22,665
I let him steal my cattle and buy my property
for a fraction of what it's worth?

432
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:27,769
<i>I'm suggesting that you continue</i>
<i>to do what your husband set out to do.</i>

433
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:30,880
Drove.

434
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:34,952
Drove the cattle to Darwin.

435
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,786
Would you mind?

436
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,018
I need a drink.

437
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:43,926
My lady, drove.

438
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:47,056
Drove the cattle to Darwin,
sell them to the army...

439
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:49,032
and you'll break Carney's monopoly.

440
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:51,899
Use the profits to put Faraway Downs
back on its feet.

441
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:54,030
You go back to London.

442
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:56,199
You're sitting pretty
for the rest of your life.

443
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:58,243
That's what Maitland
said he was doing.

444
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,076
And there's no reason
why you can't do the same.

445
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:13,091
<i>There is just one small problem.</i>

446
00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:18,188
Having dismissed Fletcher,
there's no one to muster the cattle.

447
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:30,775
Hyah! Hyah!

448
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:35,512
<i>Flynn! Mrs. Boss!</i>

449
00:35:35,581 --> 00:35:37,776
<i>It's the Drover!</i>

450
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:53,563
Drover! Drover!

451
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:55,623
Hyah!

452
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,603
Hyah!

453
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:10,911
Yeah, Drover! Yeah!

454
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:12,974
Teach me how to
break them brumbies!

455
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:16,644
- See any boys in there?
- <i>No.</i>

456
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:18,815
Goolaj, go see if they're
out in the top paddock.

457
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:21,758
- Mr. Drover!
- <i>Just get the bloody brumbies in there.</i>

458
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:24,387
- I'll find out what the hell's going on.
- Teach me to break them horses.

459
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,590
- Fill the water trough, son.
- I need to speak to you!

460
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:29,259
<i>Where the hell are</i>
<i>all the bloody stockmen, eh?</i>

461
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:32,326
- That's what I need to speak to you about.
- Where's Fletcher?

462
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:36,067
- We disagreed, and I dismissed him.
- Dismissed?

463
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:38,803
- Yes.
- Wa- Hang on. What about the cattle?

464
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:40,868
Well, it beggars belief,
but as he was leaving...

465
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:44,575
he deliberately let the cows out of
the, uh- I don't know-whatever you call it...

466
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,776
and they ran off!

467
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:48,843
Damn! Do you realize, woman,
what you've done?

468
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:51,481
Mr. Drover, do not take that tone with me.
Thank you very much!

469
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,491
- Don't take that tone with you, huh?
- No.

470
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,527
I'm asking you, woman,
do you know what you've done?

471
00:36:55,594 --> 00:36:58,825
I won't get another drove this late in the season.
You've cost me my living.

472
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:02,162
- Can't you just round them up?
- Round them up, huh? Oh, round them up. Yeah!

473
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:05,294
- Yes. You just go get them.
- 1,500 head of cattle-

474
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:05,521
Oh!

475
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:08,635
Scattered over a million acres
with just me and my two men.

476
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:10,766
That's a great idea. Stupid cow.

477
00:37:10,843 --> 00:37:13,334
Mr. Drover,
I was right to dismiss Mr. Fletcher...

478
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:14,777
on moral grounds.

479
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:16,178
Moral grounds?

480
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:19,411
<i>You're at that again, are ya?</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

481
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:21,646
He wanted to, uh, exploit you, did he?

482
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,449
- Fancy you, did he?
- What?

483
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:24,095
Stop it. I -

484
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,719
Is there any man in this
world who doesn't fancy you?

485
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,555
- Please.
- Huh?

486
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:31,528
Mr. Fletcher is working for Mr. Carney.

487
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:34,725
<i>They were pushing the best</i>
<i>of the unbranded cattle...</i>

488
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,703
across the river
onto Mr. Carney's property.

489
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:42,331
They were stealing!

490
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:48,011
- There's no surprises there.
- No, he's a bad man.

491
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,913
All right, all right.
But look. You can't prove it, right?

492
00:37:50,983 --> 00:37:53,042
- Well-
- <i>You can't.</i>

493
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:57,384
And you can't win against Carney.
So just take my advice, lady.

494
00:37:57,456 --> 00:38:01,688
Grab King Carney's offer and go the hell
back to England as quickly as possible.

495
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,661
That way you'd make everybody happy,
especially me.

496
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:10,602
So you're just going to walk away?

497
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:12,762
I learned a long time ago
not to fight other people's wars.

498
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:15,398
Wait! Wait! Wait! Mr. Drover, wait!

499
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:18,375
Please, please, please!
Mr. Drover, please! Please! Wait!

500
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:21,003
Please. I-


501
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,674
Listen. You said that your dream was
to breed a thoroughbred with a-

502
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,012
with a bush brumby.

503
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,450
<i>If you agree to help me, I-</i>

504
00:38:29,788 --> 00:38:31,949
I will give you my Capricornia.

505
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:46,627
And how we gonna do a drove
with just me and my two men, huh?

506
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:52,767
Oh, crikey.

507
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:55,108
<i>Mum was a drover's boy for Fletcher.</i>

508
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,876
<i>Bandy was a drover's boy</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

509
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,317
<i>Some white stockmen like to have</i>
<i>an Aboriginal woman on the drove...</i>

510
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,320
to keep 'em company at night.

511
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:05,948
<i>They shave their heads,</i>
<i>make 'em look like boys...</i>

512
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:08,652
<i>and work 'em like any other stockman</i>
<i>during the day.</i>

513
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:10,661
That's, uh-What do you call it?

514
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:13,562
- Exploiting them.
- Exploiting, yes.

515
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,501
Anyway, we're still in trouble.

516
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:21,505
We gotta have seven good riders at least,
and the most I can count is five.

517
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:23,632
- What have we got? We've got me-
- You.

518
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,973
- Magarri.
- Yeah, Magarri!

519
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:27,477
- Goolaj-
- Great.

520
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:30,344
We got Daisy. Nice ride.
And, uh, Bandy. Good work.

521
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:33,111
<i>Oh. What about Mr. Sing Song?</i>
<i>Mr. Sing Song, ride horse?</i>

522
00:39:33,185 --> 00:39:35,847
- Hey. Don't look at me.
- Sing Song, me real good cooker.

523
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:38,151
Cook's wagon at best.
We got five, right? It's not enough.

524
00:39:38,223 --> 00:39:40,157
We need two more experienced riders.

525
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:43,319
I did that run once back in 1935...

526
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,413
with Magarri, Dingo Jones
and the Drongo brothers-

527
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:46,125
Drongo brothers.

528
00:39:46,198 --> 00:39:49,634
- true knights of the outback.
- Mr. Flynn. Can you ride?

529
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:51,532
- I can.
- I won't carry a drunk.

530
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:52,797
But don't.

531
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:54,805
<i>I ride'em real bloody good!</i>

532
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:58,365
I drove those no-good cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

533
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:02,004
- All right. Five and a quarter.
- Six and a quarter.

534
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,775
<i>What?</i>

535
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:06,374
Lady, this ain't trotting
in Kensington Gardens.

536
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:11,013
<i> Mr. Drover, I could show you</i>
<i>a thing or two about horses.</i>

537
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,525
Pretty sure, when it comes to horses,
there's nothing you can show me.

538
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:17,960
- Bring the horse.
- You can't be serious.

539
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,123
Bring the horse.

540
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:22,189
Oh, this should be interesting.

541
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:27,394
<i>Move along! Move along!</i>
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

542
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:29,030
Move along!

543
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:30,904
Rah! Rah!

544
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,206
- What are you doing?
- <i>Shoo! Shoo!</i>

545
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:36,338
Rah, rah! Rah. Rah! Move it!

546
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:39,179
- Lady Ashley-
- Move it! Move it! They're going the wrong way.

547
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:41,185
Rah! Rah!

548
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:43,744
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

549
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:47,417
Oh! It's easy.
Stubborn things. Silly cows.

550
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:50,325
- Hey, hey, hey. What the bloody hell you doing?
- Come on.

551
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:53,558
You're scattering them all over the place.
Get up the back there, up the tail.

552
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:59,564
Get up there. Go, go, go, go, go!
Don't let 'em break away.

553
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:02,004
Go on.

554
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,244
Run, you cows! Move, you cows!

555
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:13,011
We're trying to get the cows up there.

556
00:41:14,453 --> 00:41:17,752
- Not too bad, Lady Ashley.
- I've got him! I've got him!

557
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:21,092
I think we're doing pretty well.

558
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:26,197
You crazy- take all this stuff.

559
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:28,255
Where you think you going?
Shanghai?

560
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,460
A lady never knows
what she might need.

561
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:52,949
Run, Nullah! Run! Run!

562
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:56,289
- Coppers! Coppers!
- <i>Tank! Run! Tank.</i>

563
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,886
Tank, Nullah! Tank!

564
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:02,530
<i>Bandy, coppers!</i>

565
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:05,297
Hurry up!

566
00:42:23,722 --> 00:42:24,366
Turn 'em loose.

567
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,283
<i> Go on. Get out.</i>
<i>You two, check the east side.</i>

568
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,157
<i>Move, move! Hurry up!</i>

569
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,499
<i>Daisy's in the tank.</i>

570
00:42:44,576 --> 00:42:47,670
Shh!

571
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:51,181
Bandy, tea. Tea.

572
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:56,911
<i> Where's the creamy?</i>

573
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,826
<i>Trackers.</i>

574
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:15,637
<i>Nullah.</i>

575
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:28,011
Lady Ashley, Sergeant Callahan
of the Northern Territory Police.

576
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:38,759
Grab the float.

577
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:46,028
I can't begin to tell you,
Lady Ashley, how the...

578
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:49,267
tragedy which befell
your late husband has...

579
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:53,971
wrung sympathy from the hearts of every civilized
man and woman in the Northern Territory.

580
00:44:01,586 --> 00:44:03,918
Let me assure you, Lady Ashley...

581
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:06,753
that the suspect, King George,
will be brought to justice.

582
00:44:06,825 --> 00:44:11,319
But surely a witch doctor could conceal
his own tracks, Sergeant, could he not?

583
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:14,388
Makes no difference.
It's only a matter of time.

584
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,490
Shh!

585
00:44:52,304 --> 00:44:56,434
Oh, incidentally, I met up with
your former manager, Neil Fletcher.

586
00:44:56,508 --> 00:45:00,467
He informed me that there's a half-blood
Aboriginal child out here somewhere.

587
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:04,675
I thought we might pick him up
and put him in the good hands of the church.

588
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:08,818
I will be sure to look out for him.

589
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:13,747
Till we meet again, Lady Ashley.

590
00:45:15,894 --> 00:45:18,658
<i>Get 'em in the back, Constable. Let's go.</i>

591
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:35,470
<i>They're in the tank!</i>

592
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:36,707
<i>Drover!</i>

593
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:40,547
<i>Drover, help them! Quickly!</i>

594
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:46,517
Mama!

595
00:45:46,591 --> 00:45:48,684
Easy. That's it. I got you. I got you.

596
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:02,498
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

597
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:27,898
<i>Daisy! Daisy!</i>

598
00:46:27,966 --> 00:46:30,093
Daisy! Daisy!

599
00:46:33,672 --> 00:46:37,005
<i>Daisy! Daisy.</i>

600
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:40,067
<i>Daisy!</i>

601
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:27,648
Daisy.

602
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,443
When someone dies
in the Aboriginal culture...

603
00:47:52,517 --> 00:47:55,281
you're not supposed to
say their name again.

604
00:47:58,223 --> 00:48:00,453
He needs motherin'.

605
00:48:00,525 --> 00:48:02,686
Mothering?

606
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:04,752
<i>Yep.</i>

607
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:09,323
<i>You're a woman,</i>
<i>so, go on, get down there.</i>

608
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,133
I'm, uh- I'm not, uh, uh-

609
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:16,503
What?

610
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,601
Good with children.

611
00:48:20,678 --> 00:48:23,806
Oh. Huh.

612
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:45,259
<i>Nullah.</i>

613
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:50,238
I wanted to extend my condolences.

614
00:48:50,308 --> 00:48:52,572
Go away.

615
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:19,697
Would you, uh-
Would you like to hear a story?

616
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:22,501
What story?

617
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:29,070
Uh, well, it's, uh- it's called-

618
00:49:36,554 --> 00:49:39,216
- It's called <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>
- What's a wizard?

619
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,259
Well, a wizard is a sort of...

620
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:43,726
magic man.

621
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:47,023
<i>Gulapa.</i>

622
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:53,137
<i>Mama say I gulapa.

623
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,371
- I magic man.
- Really?

624
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,706
I wizard man.

625
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:06,548
We can't say
Mama's name no more.

626
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:12,779
No. Well-

627
00:50:12,857 --> 00:50:15,951
Uh, anyway, there's a girl...

628
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:18,552
and there's a dog.

629
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:22,430
Ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff!
And there's a tornado-

630
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,765
- Well, no. It's a- In the film, it's a twister.
- Who twister?

631
00:50:25,837 --> 00:50:29,398
Oh, no, no. Twister's not a person.
It's like a big-Whoosh!

632
00:50:29,474 --> 00:50:31,567
- Like a storm.
- Like the wet?

633
00:50:31,643 --> 00:50:34,077
Like the wet.

634
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:38,445
Anyway,
the story takes place in a, um-

635
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:41,246
well, a faraway land...

636
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:43,310
called Oz.

637
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:46,847
- This good story.
- Oh, well-

638
00:50:46,925 --> 00:50:50,827
- Got song?
- Yes, yes. Lots of songs.

639
00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:52,362
I like song.

640
00:50:53,932 --> 00:50:55,923
You sing'em me,
I learn'em song.

641
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,491
No, no, no. No.

642
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:02,032
No.

643
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:07,236
Well, I- Uh, some.

644
00:51:07,312 --> 00:51:09,644
- I'll sing a little.
- Good.

645
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:14,515
# Somewhere over the, uh-
the rainbow #

646
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:16,678
- Rainbow Serpent?
- Yes.

647
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:19,587
That bloody good. Keep going.
You funny singer, but good song.

648
00:51:19,657 --> 00:51:23,024
Oh.
# Somewhere #

649
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:30,160
#There's some birds and they-#

650
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,293
- Uh- Oh-
- Keep going. Come on.

651
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:37,398
# Someday I'll wish upon a- a star #

652
00:51:37,475 --> 00:51:39,409
#And #

653
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:43,506
- Come on. Sing more.
- Uh-Yes.

654
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:47,711
#Wake up where the clouds
are far behind #

655
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:51,721
# Dreams really do come #

656
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:55,418
#True ##

657
00:51:57,495 --> 00:51:59,486
Oh!

658
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:03,256
Dreaming song.

659
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:06,703
<i>Mrs. Boss...</i>

660
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:10,070
we gotta get those no-good, cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

661
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:12,940
That's right.

662
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:15,377
That's what dreaming songs
tell us, Mrs. Boss.

663
00:52:16,748 --> 00:52:19,114
We've got to get those
no-good, big, bloody bulls...

664
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:21,117
into that metal ship.

665
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:31,317
I'm sorry. I thought he could-
I thought he could do it.

666
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:34,854
Yeah, well, people don't change,
Miss Ashley.

667
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:47,277
Twister. Twister!

668
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,619
- No desert comes drier than Kipling Flynn, milady!
- Well done!

669
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:58,246
<i>Well done, Kipling!</i>

670
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:00,085
Hey!

671
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:02,888
Flynn Kipling! Yea!

672
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,827
Hey, hey!

673
00:53:05,897 --> 00:53:08,923
- Welcome! Welcome!
- <i>Hey, Nullah!</i>

674
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,161
All right.

675
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:14,432
<i>Well, Mr. Drover, I believe</i>
<i>we have the appropriate number.</i>

676
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:17,099
- The appropriate number, huh?
- Yes.

677
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:20,008
Well, listen up.
I'm only gonna say this once.

678
00:53:20,078 --> 00:53:23,570
I run the show.
Everybody does exactly...

679
00:53:23,648 --> 00:53:25,582
as she's told.

680
00:53:26,717 --> 00:53:29,413
- Understood?
- Understood.

681
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,919
No matter your experience
or your age, you pull your weight.

682
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,416
Yes, boss.

683
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:38,587
And above all,
the Drover's law: no grog.

684
00:53:38,663 --> 00:53:41,461
Now...

685
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:44,262
if there's a rush and the cattle
are stampeding towards you...

686
00:53:44,335 --> 00:53:47,202
it's not much good prancing
and dancing about on your show pony.

687
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:50,263
There's only one thing cattle fear
more than a man on a horse...

688
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:53,242
and that's a man standing
on his own two feet...

689
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:55,802
staring 'em right between the eyes.

690
00:53:57,248 --> 00:54:00,149
Now, you sure you mob
are still up for it?

691
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:01,310
Mm-hmm.

692
00:54:04,622 --> 00:54:06,783
You can count on us.

693
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:08,849
Oh, crikey.

694
00:54:10,228 --> 00:54:13,493
Well, we're what we are.

695
00:54:13,564 --> 00:54:15,930
Gotta get to Darwin
before the ship sails.

696
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,991
Let's get cracking.

697
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:19,969
The rest of you jokers follow me.

698
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:22,028
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

699
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:25,098
I'll get the gate.
Stay back. Don't let 'em scatter.

700
00:54:30,114 --> 00:54:32,514
There, mate. Push 'em over.
Don't let 'em go down there.

701
00:54:34,218 --> 00:54:37,381
- That's it.
- Get 'em up!

702
00:54:37,455 --> 00:54:40,754
- Whoo!
- <i>Hyah!</i>

703
00:54:40,825 --> 00:54:42,952
Get up there!

704
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:57,538
<i>So we start cracking them whips...</i>

705
00:54:57,608 --> 00:55:01,738
<i>and driving them cheeky bulls</i>
<i>all the way across the land...</i>

706
00:55:02,747 --> 00:55:05,773
<i>to that place they call'em Darwin.</i>

707
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:12,552
All right.
We'll push 'em straight across here.

708
00:55:12,623 --> 00:55:14,022
Ho!

709
00:55:16,427 --> 00:55:19,885
Very good. Keep 'em movin'.
Nice and steady.

710
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:24,066
<i> Go on!</i>

711
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:25,261
- <i>Go on!</i>
- Hyah!

712
00:55:25,336 --> 00:55:26,769
<i>Keep 'em moving.</i>

713
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:31,602
Giddyup! Giddap!

714
00:55:36,214 --> 00:55:39,650
<i> While the war rages on</i>
<i>in Europe, the Japanese are on the march.</i>

715
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:42,277
<i>There are reports of an alliance</i>
<i>between the warmongers...</i>

716
00:55:42,353 --> 00:55:45,186
of Germany, Italy and Japan...

717
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:49,249
which threatens to expand World War II
to the shores of Australia.

718
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:52,125
<i>This is a war of the air,</i>
<i>but on the ground...</i>

719
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:55,632
<i>the War Office will announce</i>
<i>who has won the army's contract...</i>

720
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,430
<i>to supply good Aussie beef to the troops.</i>

721
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:00,800
Couple of days
won't make any difference, Captain.

722
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:02,805
Might as well sign
the contract now, eh?

723
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:05,706
I wouldn't be too sure of that,
Mr. Carney.

724
00:56:05,776 --> 00:56:10,804
Air force chaps just spotted a big mob of cattle,
1,500 head, crossing the Marmont River.

725
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:14,578
Marmont River?
That's Faraway Downs.

726
00:56:14,652 --> 00:56:18,713
Are you, uh, running cattle
out of Faraway Downs, Mr. Fletcher?

727
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:20,814
Uh, no, no.
I don't work there anymore.

728
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:24,258
Well, I suppose Lady Ashley's droving
the cattle herself.

729
00:56:24,328 --> 00:56:27,627
Someone must be helping her.

730
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:31,594
That's right, Neil.
Someone must be helping her.

731
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:47,612
<i>When Mrs. Boss first come to this land...</i>

732
00:56:47,685 --> 00:56:49,619
<i>she look but she not see.</i>

733
00:56:55,393 --> 00:56:59,489
<i>Now she got her eyes open</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

734
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:14,343
<i>Some places got spirits.</i>

735
00:57:14,412 --> 00:57:16,380
<i>White fellas don't know.</i>

736
00:57:17,415 --> 00:57:19,713
<i>Some places no good to go.</i>

737
00:57:33,197 --> 00:57:36,098
You gonna sing'em
them cattle tonight?

738
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:40,604
No, Nullah. Not me.
I'm the orchestra.

739
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:43,435
That's why I always carry this-

740
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:47,568
the famous J. Albert & Son
boomerang harmonica.

741
00:57:47,645 --> 00:57:49,579
Can you play that rainbow song?

742
00:57:51,082 --> 00:57:56,145
Well, I've got the latest 100 songs
of the hit parade here.

743
00:58:06,697 --> 00:58:08,858
<i>I like that rainbow song.</i>

744
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:12,391
<i>It's all about the dreaming.</i>

745
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,461
<i>Gulapa</i> not teach me that yet.

746
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:16,301
Who's <i>gulapa?</i>

747
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:19,901
He's my grandfather, King George.

748
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:25,305
King George... is your grandfather?

749
00:58:25,383 --> 00:58:27,544
<i>He teach me sing a fish song.</i>

750
00:58:27,618 --> 00:58:29,552
<i>He teach me sing down fear.</i>

751
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:34,250
<i>Fear, evil spirit, wild beast.</i>

752
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:36,623
Gulapa <i>teach me plenty songs.</i>

753
00:58:36,694 --> 00:58:39,754
<i>Gulapa</i> teach me
that day down the billabong.

754
00:58:48,773 --> 00:58:51,674
Mr. Drover, what is that chanting?

755
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:54,609
<i>Goolaj and Magarri singing the cattle.</i>

756
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:56,612
Just keeps them calm at night.

757
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,083
<i>We do it in shifts. Those boys will</i>
<i>finish up in a couple hours. So, Bandy-</i>

758
00:59:01,152 --> 00:59:02,676
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- You show Mrs. Boss...

759
00:59:02,753 --> 00:59:04,846
- <i>how it's done, all right?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

760
00:59:04,922 --> 00:59:07,891
Sing Song, you and me are gonna
serenade 'em till 3:00, and, uh...

761
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:11,826
the safest shift is predawn, so that's
the boy soprano and his orchestra.

762
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:14,421
- All right? You're on till the sun comes up.
- Yes, boss.

763
00:59:14,498 --> 00:59:16,489
All right.
Everybody get some shut-eye.

764
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:18,967
Uh, Mr. Drover...

765
00:59:19,036 --> 00:59:22,836
I really don't think it's appropriate
to work a child of Nullah's age like that.

766
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:25,467
<i>Now, I am more than willing</i>
<i>to take his shift.</i>

767
00:59:25,543 --> 00:59:28,273
- But, Mrs. Boss, I plenty old enough.
- <i>No.</i>

768
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:31,280
- I'm talking now, hmm? Manners.
- <i> Oi, oi, oi. Steady on.</i>

769
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:34,283
<i>I'm</i> talking.
Look. Just relax, will ya?

770
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,285
The boy's gotta pull his weight
like everyone else.

771
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:38,514
When I was his age,
I was manning outstations.

772
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:41,149
- Not everybody's you, Mr. Drover.
- That's right.

773
00:59:41,225 --> 00:59:44,217
Not everyone's me. I'm the boss.

774
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,223
You're on the 3:00 shift. All right?

775
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:49,994
Yes, boss.

776
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:52,535
- <i>Night, boss.</i>
- 3:00 a. m?

777
00:59:52,603 --> 00:59:55,367
- Relax, lady. He'll be fine. Good night.
- Night, Mrs. Boss.

778
00:59:55,439 --> 00:59:58,203
Oh. Good night.

779
00:59:58,275 --> 01:00:00,300
Good night, Sing Song.

780
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:02,650
<i>You're on the 12:00 shift.</i>
<i>I suggest you get some sleep.</i>

781
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:03,642
<i> Night, Bandy.</i>

782
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:05,682
- <i>Night, Nullah.</i>
- <i> Good night, Flynn.</i>

783
01:00:05,749 --> 01:00:08,240
Night, Nullah.

784
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:10,383
<i>Night-night, Jedda.</i>

785
01:00:28,572 --> 01:00:32,508
Lord Ashley was killed
by a glass-tipped spear.

786
01:00:32,576 --> 01:00:34,441
Are you sure?

787
01:00:34,512 --> 01:00:36,377
You and me secret.

788
01:01:15,152 --> 01:01:17,086
Rush! Rush!

789
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:24,623
<i>They're heading towards the cliff face!</i>

790
01:01:24,695 --> 01:01:26,424
<i>A stampede! Where's Nullah?</i>

791
01:01:26,497 --> 01:01:30,160
Get on your horse
and stay with Goolaj.

792
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:34,261
<i>Come on. Split up and circle the herd</i>
<i>before they go over the edge!</i>

793
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:36,670
Sing Song, pack the camp.
Get the hell out of there!

794
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:47,315
<i>Head them off!</i>

795
01:01:51,722 --> 01:01:53,349
Don't let them split!

796
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:58,517
Get in the front!

797
01:02:05,603 --> 01:02:07,969
Hyah! Hyah!

798
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:11,997
<i> Good boy! Come on!</i>
<i>Pull them round! Pull them round!</i>

799
01:02:15,446 --> 01:02:18,813
Nullah!
You're too close to the edge!

800
01:02:18,882 --> 01:02:21,851
<i>Courage, my boy! Courage!</i>

801
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:24,854
Well done, my boy!

802
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:37,723
<i>Nullah!</i>
<i>We have to turn the herd!</i>

803
01:02:47,077 --> 01:02:49,238
Hyah!

804
01:02:49,313 --> 01:02:51,247
Hey, hey!

805
01:02:51,315 --> 01:02:54,182
Never fear, Flynn is here!

806
01:02:54,251 --> 01:02:57,880
- Yeah, Flynn!
- Hyah!

807
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:15,666
Flynn!

808
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:30,711
Flynn!

809
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:37,593
Nullah, run!

810
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:17,629
Nullah!

811
01:04:51,668 --> 01:04:54,364
<i>Nullah!</i>

812
01:04:54,438 --> 01:04:56,463
<i>Nullah!</i>

813
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,771
Oh! Oh.

814
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:04,840
Oh.

815
01:05:04,915 --> 01:05:07,315
It's all right. You're safe.

816
01:05:08,919 --> 01:05:10,853
I've got you.

817
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:13,515
You're safe.

818
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,581
You're safe with me.

819
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:24,690
I'll stay with you.

820
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:40,012
Hey.

821
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,779
How's the little fella?

822
01:05:42,853 --> 01:05:45,686
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.
- Yeah.

823
01:05:47,191 --> 01:05:52,686
I have a feeling I might not be able
to complete the next lesson.

824
01:05:58,035 --> 01:06:01,061
Right, old mate.
I'm gonna get you some water, huh?

825
01:06:01,138 --> 01:06:06,371
Water's the last thing I want
at this moment in my life.

826
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:11,005
Under the wagon-
a bottle of Poor Fella.

827
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:14,847
I'm sorry, Drover. Just in case.

828
01:06:14,918 --> 01:06:18,684
Of course, mate. Of course.

829
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:21,849
If you'd all share a drop.

830
01:06:23,126 --> 01:06:25,924
It would be a terrible shame
to waste it.

831
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:35,203
The spear- Nullah told me.

832
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:40,868
A glass-tipped spear.

833
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:43,572
Tell milady I'm sorry.

834
01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:47,883
I was a coward.

835
01:07:31,762 --> 01:07:35,960
We lost just about everything,
except for a few swags and tins of beef.

836
01:07:36,033 --> 01:07:37,967
And this.

837
01:07:41,305 --> 01:07:45,002
I can't believe I was so insistent
upon bringing these...

838
01:07:45,075 --> 01:07:47,009
silly things.

839
01:07:48,745 --> 01:07:51,509
It was Fletcher who did this,
wasn't it?

840
01:07:53,483 --> 01:07:56,646
The last thing Flynn told me
before he died was that-

841
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,621
<i>that your husband was killed by a-</i>

842
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,851
by a glass-tipped spear...

843
01:08:01,925 --> 01:08:04,723
like the ornamental ones
in the homestead.

844
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:08,231
<i>Glass-tipped is a Kimberley spear.</i>

845
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:09,993
King George is from Arnhem.

846
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:13,366
<i>Fletcher was trying to make it</i>
<i>look like King George.</i>

847
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:17,168
- Fletcher.
- It can't be proved.

848
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,174
<i>Sorry.</i>

849
01:08:21,878 --> 01:08:24,244
Maitland-

850
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:46,262
We can't let them win.

851
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:49,672
We won't.

852
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:04,586
Get 'em up!

853
01:09:05,956 --> 01:09:08,720
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

854
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:35,573
They pushed on during the night.

855
01:09:35,652 --> 01:09:38,542
Maybe that little creamy
has got the blackfella magic.

856
01:09:38,543 --> 01:09:39,383
Shut up, Bull!

857
01:09:41,258 --> 01:09:44,750
They're gonna need more than magic
to get 'em to Darwin.

858
01:09:54,805 --> 01:09:56,830
Hey, Nullah.

859
01:09:56,907 --> 01:10:00,104
Nullah, after you're done, I need you
to help hobble these horses. All right?

860
01:10:00,177 --> 01:10:02,111
Yes, boss.

861
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:06,608
<i>I never thought I'd see this day.</i>

862
01:10:06,683 --> 01:10:10,449
- We're gonna break the Drover's law.
- I plenty old enough too!

863
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,320
Yes, you are, and that is why you
are gonna keep an eye on the rest of us.

864
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:17,019
All right?

865
01:10:17,094 --> 01:10:19,790
- All right, everyone. Let's be upstanding.
- Good girl, Jedda. Here.

866
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:23,995
To the memory of the gentleman.

867
01:10:24,067 --> 01:10:27,935
- To the gentleman.
- To Flynn!

868
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:44,983
I'd say one more before dinner.

869
01:11:00,737 --> 01:11:02,671
- Let's dance.
- No.

870
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:04,468
- Come on!
- No. No.

871
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,873
Come on. Please?

872
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:09,468
- No. I don't know how.
- It's easy. I'll show you.

873
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:12,140
You put your hands on my shoulders.

874
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,811
And you step back.

875
01:11:20,824 --> 01:11:23,384
- Back. No, no.
- Oh, back. Sorry.

876
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,451
- I'm a bad teacher.
- Stop!

877
01:11:25,529 --> 01:11:27,690
You don't drink much, do you?

878
01:11:27,764 --> 01:11:29,698
No.

879
01:11:29,766 --> 01:11:33,759
<i>I'll give it a go. Come on.</i>
<i>I can do it. I can do it. All right?</i>

880
01:12:16,613 --> 01:12:19,377
<i>Now you do wrong-side business?</i>

881
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:21,144
Uh-

882
01:12:21,218 --> 01:12:23,982
<i>No, mate. No.</i>
<i>We're just having a dance here.</i>

883
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:29,819
- <i>Ceremonial dance?</i>
- Uh, yes. It's called the fox-trot.

884
01:12:29,893 --> 01:12:33,556
Fox dance?
You gonna teach me that dance?

885
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:36,292
- Uh, you're a bit too young for her, mate.
- <i> Nullah!</i>

886
01:12:36,366 --> 01:12:40,462
Get down from that tree now!
Got bad spirits up there.

887
01:12:40,537 --> 01:12:43,005
You're in big trouble.

888
01:12:45,356 --> 01:12:48,435
<i> Come on, Nullah.</i>
<i>Time to go to bed now.</i>

889
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:51,071
<i>You know better</i>
<i>than to go up in the tree.</i>

890
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:54,275
<i>Have you ever fallen</i>
<i>into wrong-side business?</i>

891
01:12:56,786 --> 01:13:00,017
Uh, yeah.

892
01:13:01,024 --> 01:13:03,618
- Oh.
- Yeah. I was married once.

893
01:13:03,693 --> 01:13:06,856
- Really?
- Mmm. To a lovely girl.

894
01:13:10,367 --> 01:13:13,359
That was before I went off to war.

895
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:22,010
And what happened?

896
01:13:25,448 --> 01:13:27,609
Well, I marched off
for Mother England...

897
01:13:27,684 --> 01:13:31,552
and by the time I came back,
she was sick...

898
01:13:31,621 --> 01:13:34,385
with T.B.

899
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:39,417
But back then, the hospitals
wouldn't treat, um, blacks.

900
01:13:44,968 --> 01:13:47,937
Oh, right. I see. Yeah.

901
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:55,567
Do you have children?

902
01:13:58,448 --> 01:14:01,383
- No.
- Well, that's a shame.

903
01:14:02,485 --> 01:14:04,851
I think you would have
made a great father.

904
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:11,392
- You?
- No.

905
01:14:13,096 --> 01:14:15,656
I can't.

906
01:14:16,733 --> 01:14:18,360
Oh.

907
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:23,062
That's too bad.

908
01:14:27,377 --> 01:14:29,709
You would have made a great mother.

909
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:39,821
Well, good night.

910
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:44,016
- Good night.
- Yeah.

911
01:15:17,127 --> 01:15:19,925
- Water no good, boss.
- No.

912
01:15:19,996 --> 01:15:21,725
Might be Carney boys
already been here, eh?

913
01:15:21,798 --> 01:15:24,460
There has to be water
some other place.

914
01:15:24,534 --> 01:15:26,559
- Next bore is five days.
- There has to be water.

915
01:15:26,636 --> 01:15:28,900
You can be sure Fletcher
will have been there as well.

916
01:15:31,174 --> 01:15:33,142
- <i>Hey, boss.</i>
- What?

917
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:37,077
There's water three days' ride away.

918
01:15:37,147 --> 01:15:39,274
<i>We'd have to cross the Kuraman.</i>

919
01:15:39,349 --> 01:15:43,718
<i>The Kuraman?</i>
<i>That's Never-Never Land. No.</i>

920
01:15:43,787 --> 01:15:46,813
- We've got to try.
- We can't.

921
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,154
- We've got to try.
- No one has drove the Never-Never.

922
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:51,625
There's nothing to guide you.
You don't know where you are.

923
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:55,596
You get caught out there,
you're gonna lose more than your cattle.

924
01:15:59,936 --> 01:16:02,700
I'm sorry.

925
01:16:04,574 --> 01:16:06,508
Boss!

926
01:16:06,576 --> 01:16:08,510
<i>Look!</i>

927
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,334
<i>He a wizard.</i>
<i>He gonna sing for us.</i>

928
01:16:43,246 --> 01:16:45,077
Sing?

929
01:16:45,148 --> 01:16:47,981
He can find his way anywhere.

930
01:16:48,051 --> 01:16:51,487
<i>The ancestors created songs for everything.</i>

931
01:16:51,554 --> 01:16:54,523
<i>For every rock and tree.</i>

932
01:16:54,591 --> 01:16:58,823
<i>They're all linked,</i>
<i>so when</i> gulapa, <i>the magic man...</i>

933
01:16:58,895 --> 01:17:02,558
<i>sings them in order, he'll sing us to water.</i>

934
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:04,759
<i>Even across the Never-Never.</i>

935
01:17:15,078 --> 01:17:17,410
<i>And we went on for three days.</i>

936
01:17:18,915 --> 01:17:22,646
<i>Every day drier-hotter.</i>

937
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,051
<i>All that dead land.</i>

938
01:17:25,121 --> 01:17:28,113
<i>Then come that big dust storm.</i>

939
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:35,394
Keep driving into the wind!

940
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,625
<i>Nullah, stay close to me!</i>

941
01:17:39,702 --> 01:17:44,105
<i> Them cattle stop moving.</i>
<i>Magarri and Goolaj stop moving.</i>

942
01:17:44,173 --> 01:17:46,334
<i>We all stop moving.</i>

943
01:17:49,746 --> 01:17:52,647
I'm <i>gulapa.</i>

944
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:56,276
I magic man. I wizard man.

945
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:12,726
<i> Dead. All of them.</i>
<i>That's what he said.</i>

946
01:18:12,802 --> 01:18:15,794
<i>The pilot swooped down</i>
<i>to get a closer look.</i>

947
01:18:15,872 --> 01:18:19,205
Dead as doorposts they were.

948
01:18:19,275 --> 01:18:22,836
- It's a real tragedy.
- How terrible!

949
01:18:22,912 --> 01:18:24,903
<i>And on the eve of the ball too.</i>

950
01:18:24,981 --> 01:18:27,347
What were they doing in the Kuraman?

951
01:18:28,952 --> 01:18:30,920
<i>Nothing personal, Captain...</i>

952
01:18:30,987 --> 01:18:35,481
but I got a business to run,
and you got an army to feed.

953
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:37,924
So let's not muck about.

954
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:44,530
I suppose it's not a real war
unless someone's making a profit.

955
01:18:46,903 --> 01:18:50,100
- You got 'em ready to load, Neil?
- Yeah, we're right to go.

956
01:18:50,173 --> 01:18:54,132
'Cause I got a feeling the captain's
gonna put pen to paper.

957
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:58,306
All hail the king. Yeah.

958
01:19:10,126 --> 01:19:12,856
<i> Where'd he come from?</i>

959
01:19:12,929 --> 01:19:15,295
Oh, look.

960
01:19:15,365 --> 01:19:18,732
Hello, little sweetie.

961
01:19:41,324 --> 01:19:44,157
What the bloody hell is that?

962
01:19:53,503 --> 01:19:55,664
Gentlemen!

963
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,568
I'm Sarah Ashley,
owner of Faraway Downs.

964
01:20:00,643 --> 01:20:05,512
<i>We are making delivery of 1,500 head</i>
<i>of prime F.D. branded shorthorns.</i>

965
01:20:05,581 --> 01:20:08,243
<i>We will require a holding yard.</i>

966
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:10,877
- We're full.
- Says who?

967
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:14,354
- The owner.
- You must be Mr. Carney.

968
01:20:14,424 --> 01:20:16,654
Too right, love.

969
01:20:18,194 --> 01:20:20,219
<i>Lady Ashley, I'm Emmett Dutton.</i>

970
01:20:20,296 --> 01:20:22,287
I'm the officer in charge
of livestock purchases.

971
01:20:22,365 --> 01:20:27,268
We will accept 20% less than what
the Carney Cattle Company is asking.

972
01:20:27,336 --> 01:20:30,965
No can do, love.
You're late. The contract's signed.

973
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,874
This contract is not binding
until the cattle are loaded.

974
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:40,149
Load the bloody cattle now!

975
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:42,874
We've got to load the cattle
on the ship before Carney.

976
01:20:42,952 --> 01:20:45,785
- Get off your backsides!
- You drive 'em straight down the wharf.

977
01:20:45,855 --> 01:20:48,790
I'll try and keep Carney's cattle
in the yard.

978
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:54,290
Load the bloody cattle now!

979
01:20:55,431 --> 01:20:58,798
- Drover!
- Hyah!

980
01:21:02,305 --> 01:21:04,432
Load!

981
01:21:08,377 --> 01:21:11,005
You blokes, load!

982
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,844
Hyah!

983
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:18,944
Hey, Bull!
Open the bloody crush!

984
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:21,819
Come on!
Close that flamin' gate!

985
01:21:37,507 --> 01:21:39,168
You missed the boat, sunshine.

986
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:42,541
<i>Yeah. Good luck, Drover, you drongo!</i>

987
01:21:42,612 --> 01:21:44,603
Over here, Drover.

988
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:58,859
Hyah!

989
01:22:14,277 --> 01:22:16,802
<i>Drover!</i>

990
01:22:16,879 --> 01:22:19,609
Push 'em straight down the wharf!

991
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:24,643
Hah!

992
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,019
Hyah!

993
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:36,764
Hyah!

994
01:22:39,235 --> 01:22:41,362
<i>Hyah!</i>

995
01:22:43,606 --> 01:22:46,905
<i> There are cattle being</i>
<i>driven down the wharf.</i>

996
01:22:46,976 --> 01:22:49,706
My husband must have
a problem with the loading.

997
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:53,078
<i>They're not Carney cattle.</i>

998
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:57,785
- Mmm?
- It's Lady Ashley.

999
01:23:00,423 --> 01:23:02,357
Get out of the way!

1000
01:23:02,425 --> 01:23:04,893
<i>Looks like, uh,</i>
<i>we've got a bit of competition...</i>

1001
01:23:04,961 --> 01:23:07,521
back in the meat business.

1002
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:19,138
Now that's it!

1003
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:21,938
Hyah! Ho!

1004
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:32,544
Ho! Push them up!

1005
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:38,751
- Hyah!
- Cheeky bulls down the wharf!

1006
01:23:38,828 --> 01:23:41,456
Cheeky bulls down the wharf,
Mrs. Boss!

1007
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:09,689
- Hyah!
- <i>Get him down the wharf. That's it, Nullah.</i>

1008
01:24:09,759 --> 01:24:12,853
<i>Get him up, Nullah.</i>

1009
01:24:12,929 --> 01:24:16,160
I got the last big, bloody, cheeky bull
in the big, bloody metal ship.

1010
01:24:16,232 --> 01:24:18,029
All right!

1011
01:24:19,135 --> 01:24:22,502
<i>Yea! Yea!</i>

1012
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:29,703
Lady coming through.
There's a lady coming through.

1013
01:24:33,849 --> 01:24:36,147
Two Poor Fella rums, Ivan.

1014
01:24:36,218 --> 01:24:38,880
Shut up!

1015
01:24:38,955 --> 01:24:41,947
No women.
Ladies' lounge next door.

1016
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:48,964
<i>She's no lady, Ivan. She just drove</i>
<i>a mob of cattle across the Never-Never.</i>

1017
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:52,330
She deserves a drink like any man.

1018
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:54,801
Too bloody right.

1019
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:57,737
Too bloody right.

1020
01:25:09,218 --> 01:25:11,345
I never drink Poor Fella alone.

1021
01:25:17,927 --> 01:25:21,522
Crikey!

1022
01:25:21,597 --> 01:25:23,724
<i>One, two, three!</i>

1023
01:25:23,799 --> 01:25:27,667
<i># Where's that jolly jumbuck</i>
<i>you've got in your tucker bag #

1024
01:25:27,737 --> 01:25:30,797
<i># You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me ##</i>

1025
01:25:30,873 --> 01:25:34,036
I didn't want to see a single beast
from Faraway Downs...

1026
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:37,079
set a hoof on that wharf, Neil.

1027
01:25:37,146 --> 01:25:40,274
But that's what happens
when you send a boy to do a man's job.

1028
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:42,943
Now, find out if she's going
to the ball tomorrow night.

1029
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:45,010
I'll take care of it myself.

1030
01:25:57,033 --> 01:26:00,867
<i>So everybody get what they want.</i>

1031
01:26:00,936 --> 01:26:02,927
<i>Everybody happy.</i>

1032
01:26:03,005 --> 01:26:06,338
<i>Mrs. Boss is gonna sell Faraway Downs...</i>

1033
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:09,207
<i>and go back to England.</i>

1034
01:26:09,278 --> 01:26:11,212
Shh.

1035
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,941
That's it. Good girl.

1036
01:26:13,015 --> 01:26:16,451
<i>Drover, he get'em that horse,</i>
<i>Capricornia.</i>

1037
01:26:16,519 --> 01:26:18,453
That's it. Good girl.

1038
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:21,957
<i>Everybody happy, except for me.</i>

1039
01:26:24,794 --> 01:26:27,285
<i>'Cause I not white fella.</i>

1040
01:26:27,363 --> 01:26:29,593
<i>I not blackfella either.</i>

1041
01:26:29,665 --> 01:26:31,656
<i>Me half-caste.</i>

1042
01:26:33,002 --> 01:26:35,596
<i>Creamy.</i>

1043
01:26:35,671 --> 01:26:37,764
<i>Me belong no one.</i>

1044
01:26:47,817 --> 01:26:50,183
Good girl.

1045
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:53,949
<i>Back, back, back. Back. Good.</i>

1046
01:26:55,925 --> 01:27:01,363
<i>Easy, easy. Good, good. That's it.</i>

1047
01:27:06,402 --> 01:27:09,337
That's a good girl. That's it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1048
01:27:10,673 --> 01:27:13,506
You really do have a gift with horses.

1049
01:27:15,344 --> 01:27:18,177
Up. Up.

1050
01:27:20,549 --> 01:27:22,141
You look different.

1051
01:27:22,218 --> 01:27:26,917
I've agreed to be patroness at the ball
at Government House tomorrow night.

1052
01:27:26,989 --> 01:27:28,957
Yeah? And?

1053
01:27:30,025 --> 01:27:33,461
Drover, I-

1054
01:27:33,529 --> 01:27:35,963
I'm going to finish
what Maitland set out to do...

1055
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:39,831
and I am going to bring
Faraway Downs back to life.

1056
01:27:39,902 --> 01:27:41,870
I don't follow you.

1057
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:44,132
Well, this is perfect.
I'm going to need a manager.

1058
01:27:46,575 --> 01:27:50,067
Well, I thought that...

1059
01:27:50,146 --> 01:27:53,138
it would be a good job for you.

1060
01:27:56,152 --> 01:27:58,677
Anyway, I almost forgot something.
I got a suit for you.

1061
01:27:58,754 --> 01:28:01,814
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Don't do that.
- Do what?

1062
01:28:01,891 --> 01:28:04,223
The thing you do
when you get a head full of ideas.

1063
01:28:04,293 --> 01:28:07,194
- Like crossing the Kuraman?
- <i>Come on, mate.</i>

1064
01:28:07,263 --> 01:28:11,597
You don't know what you're talking about.
Running a station? Manager?

1065
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:14,932
I'm a drover. All right?
No man hires me, no man fires me.

1066
01:28:17,006 --> 01:28:19,600
- So you don't want to go to the ball?
- Ball?

1067
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:24,178
Sarah.

1068
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:28,780
I'm as good as black to that mob up there.

1069
01:28:28,851 --> 01:28:33,117
I mix with dingoes, not- not duchesses.

1070
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:39,186
They keep out of my way,
and I keep out of theirs.

1071
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:41,252
That's the way it is.

1072
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:45,164
Just because it is
doesn't mean it should be.

1073
01:28:51,574 --> 01:28:53,565
But that's the way it is.

1074
01:29:04,286 --> 01:29:06,220
<i>Cheer up, little fella.</i>

1075
01:29:06,288 --> 01:29:09,553
You and that Chinaman gonna take me out
on a big night at the pictures.

1076
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:11,559
How?

1077
01:29:11,627 --> 01:29:14,152
<i>You can't take half-caste</i>
<i>to picture show.</i>

1078
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:18,599
- Coppers take him!
- He won't be half-caste.

1079
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:21,727
He got every right to be there.

1080
01:29:22,838 --> 01:29:24,829
We use magic.

1081
01:29:26,008 --> 01:29:28,772
You got every right to be there.

1082
01:29:33,482 --> 01:29:36,280
'Cause you're a special boy.

1083
01:29:36,352 --> 01:29:38,684
He's a special boy.

1084
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:42,485
<i>Nobody gonna stop you</i>
<i>from going. Nobody.</i>

1085
01:29:42,558 --> 01:29:45,186
<i># Somewhere #

1086
01:29:45,261 --> 01:29:48,594
# Over the rainbow #

1087
01:29:48,664 --> 01:29:53,658
#Way up high #

1088
01:29:53,736 --> 01:29:58,867
<i># There's a land that I heard of#</i>

1089
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:02,104
<i># Once in a lullaby #

1090
01:30:03,912 --> 01:30:10,511
# Somewhere over the rainbow #

1091
01:30:10,586 --> 01:30:14,386
# Skies are blue #

1092
01:30:15,691 --> 01:30:18,387
<i># And the dreams #

1093
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:21,452
<i># That you dare to dream #

1094
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:26,467
<i># Really do come true ##</i>

1095
01:30:31,707 --> 01:30:33,732
<i>How good of you, Lady Ashley...</i>

1096
01:30:33,809 --> 01:30:37,074
to take an interest
in Dr. Barker's work on the mission.

1097
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:40,877
Well, actually, Administrator,
my interest is of a more personal nature.

1098
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:43,474
I must say, Lady Ashley-

1099
01:30:43,552 --> 01:30:46,020
- Smashing.
- Would you excuse me?

1100
01:30:46,088 --> 01:30:48,682
Amongst the leading lights of Darwin.

1101
01:30:48,757 --> 01:30:51,658
I was wondering if you could
introduce me to Dr. Barker.

1102
01:30:51,727 --> 01:30:53,718
- Sarah?
- Ah, Captain Dutton.

1103
01:30:53,796 --> 01:30:57,197
Lady Ashley, I'll leave you
in the capable hands of the captain.

1104
01:30:57,266 --> 01:31:00,497
I'm sure he would be happy
to introduce you to Dr. Barker.

1105
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:03,129
- I want to talk to you.
- Her husband barely in the grave...

1106
01:31:03,205 --> 01:31:05,230
and there she is
cavorting with the captain.

1107
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:07,298
- His mother has passed away.
- And that dress.

1108
01:31:07,376 --> 01:31:10,106
Yes.
Bidding should go through the roof.

1109
01:31:10,179 --> 01:31:13,046
He is a little boy.
He needs someone to look after him.

1110
01:31:13,115 --> 01:31:15,549
- Sarah-
- I'm desperate to speak to Dr. Barker.

1111
01:31:15,617 --> 01:31:19,075
I'm going to adopt him. It's only a matter
of time before they take him away.

1112
01:31:19,154 --> 01:31:22,487
Adopting an Aboriginal child is much
more complicated than you realize.

1113
01:31:22,558 --> 01:31:26,289
Neil! Come on.
I want to talk with Lady Ashley.

1114
01:31:26,362 --> 01:31:28,523
Yeah. No. We will later, love.

1115
01:31:28,597 --> 01:31:31,998
I don't mind if you bid for her in
the auction tonight. I won't be jealous.

1116
01:31:32,067 --> 01:31:36,231
- She's an inspiration.
- Yeah, she's full of surprises.

1117
01:31:36,305 --> 01:31:39,331
But surely, Doctor, life on the station
with people who care for these children...

1118
01:31:39,408 --> 01:31:42,104
is far better than life
on a government institution.

1119
01:31:42,177 --> 01:31:44,577
Oh. The auction.

1120
01:31:44,646 --> 01:31:47,774
Our gracious patroness, Lady Ashley!

1121
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:49,909
<i>Bravo!</i>

1122
01:31:49,985 --> 01:31:51,976
<i>Now, for the auction of the first dance-</i>

1123
01:31:52,054 --> 01:31:56,491
The mixed-race children must be dislocated
from the primitive, full-blood Aborigine.

1124
01:31:56,558 --> 01:32:00,119
- Do I hear a first bid? Please.
- Five pounds here.

1125
01:32:00,195 --> 01:32:03,062
- <i>Five pounds! </i>
- How else are we to breed the black out of them?

1126
01:32:03,132 --> 01:32:07,228
I bid more than that for a dance with Mrs. Allsop!
Remember, it's for the mission.

1127
01:32:07,302 --> 01:32:10,738
Has anyone asked their mothers
how they feel about this?

1128
01:32:10,806 --> 01:32:13,775
- Lady Ashley, please.
- For the war effort, do I hear 20 pounds?

1129
01:32:13,842 --> 01:32:17,642
It's a fact of science that the Aboriginal
mother soon forgets her offspring.

1130
01:32:17,713 --> 01:32:21,672
- Fifty pounds!
- <i>Fifty pounds!</i>

1131
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,911
- Seventy pounds!
- Ninety-five!

1132
01:32:23,986 --> 01:32:27,114
No mother forgets her child, Dr. Barker.

1133
01:32:27,189 --> 01:32:30,249
- Lady Ashley!
- This is most inappropriate.

1134
01:32:30,325 --> 01:32:32,486
100!

1135
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:36,657
- That is a new record.
- We can't very well ask their fathers, can we?

1136
01:32:36,732 --> 01:32:39,530
- How dare you?
- Going once!

1137
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:42,934
- Or perhaps we should.
- Going twice!

1138
01:32:43,005 --> 01:32:45,269
- <i>After all, they're right here in this room.</i>
- That's a lie!

1139
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:48,036
<i>500 quid!</i>

1140
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,180
<i>500 pounds!</i>

1141
01:32:54,249 --> 01:32:56,945
<i>Well, indeed.</i>

1142
01:32:57,019 --> 01:32:58,953
If it isn't the man who-

1143
01:32:59,021 --> 01:33:01,546
<i>almost single-handedly...</i>

1144
01:33:01,623 --> 01:33:03,989
<i>made the Australian beef industry...</i>

1145
01:33:04,059 --> 01:33:07,222
<i>what it is today.</i>

1146
01:33:07,296 --> 01:33:11,562
<i>Mr. King Carney</i>
<i>of the Carney Cattle Company.</i>

1147
01:33:15,737 --> 01:33:18,968
For the benefit of the missions.

1148
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:25,872
<i>Well, there's nothing more to say...</i>

1149
01:33:25,948 --> 01:33:28,746
but let the king take his prize.

1150
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:38,221
- <i>Can I get a picture, please? Smile.</i>
- Ah.

1151
01:33:43,532 --> 01:33:45,966
Let me say, Lady Ashley,
just how sorry I was...

1152
01:33:46,034 --> 01:33:48,468
to hear of your husband's death...

1153
01:33:48,537 --> 01:33:51,062
at the hands of that wild savage.

1154
01:33:51,139 --> 01:33:53,073
A savage, yes, Mr. Carney...

1155
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:58,044
but you and I both know that my husband
was not killed by an Aborigine.

1156
01:33:58,113 --> 01:34:00,172
No, I did not know that.

1157
01:34:00,249 --> 01:34:02,945
Perhaps you should ask Mr. Fletcher.

1158
01:34:05,287 --> 01:34:09,087
- Are you making an accusation?
- Not one I can prove.

1159
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:12,354
In business, I've been fortunate.

1160
01:34:12,427 --> 01:34:15,021
<i>In family, a little less so.</i>

1161
01:34:15,097 --> 01:34:18,794
I'm prepared to go to 75,000 pounds.

1162
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:21,927
This is not about the money, Mr. Carney.
There is a little boy.

1163
01:34:22,004 --> 01:34:24,370
There is a-

1164
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:28,307
There are people who are living-
living on the station...

1165
01:34:28,377 --> 01:34:30,368
for whom I am responsible.

1166
01:34:30,445 --> 01:34:32,310
And who will take care of them?

1167
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:36,078
A cattle station is like a country.

1168
01:34:36,151 --> 01:34:39,712
And you have no one to look after it.

1169
01:34:39,788 --> 01:34:42,120
Now, I can offer protection...

1170
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:46,889
to every man, woman and child.

1171
01:34:46,962 --> 01:34:48,896
And child?

1172
01:34:50,566 --> 01:34:52,796
You will do that?

1173
01:34:52,868 --> 01:34:56,326
How can I keep you at your word?

1174
01:34:56,405 --> 01:34:59,465
I'll put it in the contract.

1175
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:02,601
<i> King Carney and Lady Ashley.</i>
<i>That was a marvelous treat.</i>

1176
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:09,245
<i>No one can close a deal</i>
<i>more quickly than King Carney.</i>

1177
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:13,186
<i>Now, the raffle for the war effort.</i>

1178
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:15,849
The last flying boat...

1179
01:35:15,924 --> 01:35:18,518
leaves tomorrow because of the war.

1180
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:28,794
Will I tell my lawyer
to draw up a contract?

1181
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:33,864
<i>But the true blue Australian man</i>
<i>like King Carney is-</i>

1182
01:35:44,987 --> 01:35:46,955
Inform your lawyer-

1183
01:35:47,022 --> 01:35:48,455
Uh-

1184
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:11,308
<i>Inform your lawyer that Faraway Downs</i>
<i>is no longer for sale.</i>

1185
01:36:19,788 --> 01:36:21,722
Fox-trot!

1186
01:36:55,123 --> 01:36:57,216
Here you are.

1187
01:36:57,292 --> 01:37:00,955
Well, you didn't think I was gonna
waste my dance lesson, did you?

1188
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,930
Let's really give the bastards
something to talk about, huh?

1189
01:37:07,002 --> 01:37:10,301
Oh, crikey.

1190
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,134
She's invited that man.

1191
01:37:16,178 --> 01:37:18,408
- Hey, Doris.
- Get you a drink, Drover?

1192
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,415
Beer would be good.
Hello, love. Nice dress.

1193
01:37:33,095 --> 01:37:35,359
- All right.
- Fox dance?

1194
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:37,421
- Fox dance.
- Mm-hmm.

1195
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:42,000
- Back. Back.
- Step.

1196
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:44,004
- Step.
- Sorry.

1197
01:38:06,762 --> 01:38:08,753
Let's clear out of here.

1198
01:38:24,246 --> 01:38:28,478
- There it is. First storm of the wet.
- Ahh.

1199
01:38:30,385 --> 01:38:32,376
What's it like?

1200
01:38:32,454 --> 01:38:34,012
It's beautiful.

1201
01:38:34,089 --> 01:38:36,057
There's millions of birds.

1202
01:38:36,124 --> 01:38:40,458
Creeks turn into rivers,
dry plains into lakes.

1203
01:38:40,529 --> 01:38:44,226
Faraway Downs
will be reborn as an island-

1204
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:46,460
green and flowering
and fat with life.

1205
01:38:46,535 --> 01:38:48,696
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Quick, quick, quick!

1206
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:51,261
We'll be cut off
from the rest of the world!

1207
01:38:52,841 --> 01:38:55,207
- Sarah.
- Mm-hmm?

1208
01:38:55,277 --> 01:38:58,212
In the dry- I'll be gone, droving.

1209
01:39:08,089 --> 01:39:10,614
But right now it's raining.

1210
01:39:30,846 --> 01:39:33,280
<i>Can you help me?
Can you help me?</i>

1211
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:35,407
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to be helped any longer.</i>

1212
01:39:35,483 --> 01:39:38,732
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1213
01:39:38,733 --> 01:39:39,317
I have?

1214
01:39:39,387 --> 01:39:41,355
But why didn't you tell her before?

1215
01:39:41,423 --> 01:39:43,414
Because she wouldn't have believed me.

1216
01:39:44,793 --> 01:39:46,852
My darling Cath!

1217
01:39:46,928 --> 01:39:49,556
Daddy!

1218
01:40:08,984 --> 01:40:10,918
Hey, Drover.

1219
01:40:34,342 --> 01:40:36,310
Maitland Ashley met his death...

1220
01:40:36,378 --> 01:40:40,075
at the hands of a wild savage, did he?

1221
01:40:40,148 --> 01:40:43,345
You're not part of any plan
concerning this family.

1222
01:40:43,418 --> 01:40:45,409
Nothing's in your name...

1223
01:40:45,487 --> 01:40:49,617
and if anything should happen to
my darling Cath, you lose everything.

1224
01:41:00,368 --> 01:41:04,031
There's no place like home.

1225
01:42:41,669 --> 01:42:45,264
<i>Just like Drover say,</i>
<i>that rain make everything come alive.</i>

1226
01:42:46,441 --> 01:42:49,001
<i>That land, it grow green and fat...</i>

1227
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:52,478
<i>and we all go back to Faraway Downs.</i>

1228
01:42:53,782 --> 01:42:56,774
<i>Mrs. Boss happy. Drover happy.</i>

1229
01:42:56,851 --> 01:42:59,911
<i>Even that copper Callahan happy.</i>

1230
01:42:59,988 --> 01:43:02,582
<i>Mrs. Boss say he likes her tea so much...</i>

1231
01:43:02,657 --> 01:43:05,922
<i>it gives him a blind eye-</i>

1232
01:43:05,994 --> 01:43:08,258
<i>make me invisible, keep me safe.</i>

1233
01:43:10,265 --> 01:43:12,256
<i>I hear for the first time...</i>

1234
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:14,563
<i>that thing called...</i>

1235
01:43:14,636 --> 01:43:16,900
<i>Christmas.</i>

1236
01:43:27,015 --> 01:43:30,109
<i>Then the rain, it stops.</i>

1237
01:43:31,686 --> 01:43:35,622
<i>And that Drover, he go droving.</i>

1238
01:43:38,259 --> 01:43:42,218
<i>That Mrs. Boss,</i>
<i>she always misses Drover.</i>

1239
01:43:42,297 --> 01:43:45,460
<i>But I know he's gonna come back.</i>

1240
01:43:54,676 --> 01:43:56,667
Whoo! Yeah!

1241
01:44:01,249 --> 01:44:03,479
<i> King George</i>
<i>tell me you gotta be looking out.</i>

1242
01:44:03,551 --> 01:44:08,113
<i>'Cause that croc,</i>
<i>he always watching, he always waiting.</i>

1243
01:44:28,576 --> 01:44:30,635
Hah! Get up!

1244
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:40,879
<i>That Fletcher, he the new king now.</i>

1245
01:44:50,765 --> 01:44:55,099
Emmett, why didn't you radio?
I'm so glad you're here.

1246
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:56,933
Would you get some tea, Bandy?

1247
01:45:01,009 --> 01:45:03,341
<i>Geez, you done the place up nice.</i>

1248
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:06,608
I hope you don't mind.
Bandy let me in.

1249
01:45:07,949 --> 01:45:11,385
My father would have been proud.

1250
01:45:11,452 --> 01:45:13,386
It's bloody beautiful.

1251
01:45:13,454 --> 01:45:17,288
<i>Geez, I bet you got all the mod cons.</i>

1252
01:45:17,358 --> 01:45:19,758
What do you want?

1253
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:25,366
What I've always wanted-
Faraway Downs.

1254
01:45:25,433 --> 01:45:27,367
Bandy, call the men.

1255
01:45:27,435 --> 01:45:29,562
Bunchemup, Mr. Fletcher needs
to be escorted off the property-

1256
01:45:29,637 --> 01:45:32,231
Callahan won't be having
any more cups of tea.

1257
01:45:33,508 --> 01:45:35,567
I will though. Cup of tea.

1258
01:45:35,643 --> 01:45:39,044
<i>Thanks, Bandy.</i>
<i>You know how I like it. Yeah.</i>

1259
01:45:40,148 --> 01:45:42,878
It's all right, Bandy.

1260
01:45:42,951 --> 01:45:45,317
<i>You know, these days,</i>
<i>I can pull a few strings.</i>

1261
01:45:45,386 --> 01:45:48,082
I can probably bring your creamy in,
if you like.

1262
01:45:48,156 --> 01:45:52,058
Or... I can talk to Dr. Barker
and get you guardianship.

1263
01:45:52,126 --> 01:45:54,754
- I will never sell you my land.
- <i>Your land?</i>

1264
01:45:54,829 --> 01:45:57,696
My family worked this property
for three generations.

1265
01:45:57,765 --> 01:46:00,256
My father died
making people like you rich.

1266
01:46:00,335 --> 01:46:02,565
<i>Faraway Downs belongs to me.</i>

1267
01:46:04,939 --> 01:46:09,308
Just like... you believe
the little creamy belongs to you.

1268
01:46:10,712 --> 01:46:12,942
<i>I'll pay you what it's worth.</i>

1269
01:46:13,014 --> 01:46:16,780
Can use the money, go south,
get the little one an education.

1270
01:46:16,851 --> 01:46:19,319
I'll go to the highest levels
of government, to the High Court.

1271
01:46:19,387 --> 01:46:21,321
Beyond this country, if I have to.

1272
01:46:21,389 --> 01:46:23,584
An unmarried woman,
living with the likes of the Drover?

1273
01:46:23,658 --> 01:46:27,822
I will tell your wife he is your son!

1274
01:46:27,895 --> 01:46:30,762
That would be a mistake.

1275
01:46:34,602 --> 01:46:36,536
Kimberley spear.

1276
01:46:38,539 --> 01:46:40,973
Glass-tipped.

1277
01:46:42,443 --> 01:46:44,741
Real collector's items.

1278
01:46:46,414 --> 01:46:50,612
<i>Oh! You're missing one.</i>

1279
01:46:50,685 --> 01:46:54,280
<i>Anyway, I was just out here,</i>
<i>checking on all the properties.</i>

1280
01:46:54,355 --> 01:46:57,620
Might do a little
buffalo hunting later. Yeah.

1281
01:46:57,692 --> 01:46:59,922
Oh.

1282
01:46:59,994 --> 01:47:02,929
Did you hear about the king?

1283
01:47:02,997 --> 01:47:06,296
Terrible accident. Yeah.

1284
01:47:06,367 --> 01:47:08,460
<i>Very dangerous place out here,</i>
<i>even for locals...</i>

1285
01:47:08,536 --> 01:47:10,629
<i>like the Drover and the little creamy.</i>

1286
01:47:10,705 --> 01:47:12,969
<i>You with me?</i>

1287
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:15,066
Anyway...

1288
01:47:15,143 --> 01:47:18,169
you ought to think about it, Lady Ashley.

1289
01:47:18,246 --> 01:47:22,080
After all, pride's not power.

1290
01:47:29,857 --> 01:47:32,155
The Drover mustn't know.

1291
01:47:33,261 --> 01:47:35,991
<i>Hyah! Hyah!</i>

1292
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:39,192
Drover! It's the Drover!

1293
01:47:46,841 --> 01:47:48,775
Hey! Yah!

1294
01:48:03,858 --> 01:48:05,917
Come on, you two! Wake up!

1295
01:48:05,993 --> 01:48:08,291
Come on!

1296
01:48:08,363 --> 01:48:11,264
- Come on. Wake up! We got brumbies to break.
- All right, all right.

1297
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:28,240
Yeah, break him. Ride that brumby!
Ride him! Ride him!

1298
01:48:28,316 --> 01:48:33,720
Yea, Drover! Ride him!
Yeah, Drover! Drover!

1299
01:48:35,623 --> 01:48:38,421
- You a man, Drover?
- Yeah, I try to be.

1300
01:48:38,493 --> 01:48:41,053
Sometimes man
got to get away from woman.

1301
01:48:41,129 --> 01:48:43,063
Maybe.

1302
01:48:43,131 --> 01:48:46,259
- That's why you go droving.
- I go droving 'cause that's my job.

1303
01:48:46,334 --> 01:48:49,235
If you don't go droving,
you not a man.

1304
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:54,774
All right, boys. That'll do.

1305
01:48:54,842 --> 01:48:56,776
Bring 'em down
to the back paddock, will you?

1306
01:48:56,844 --> 01:48:58,903
King George tell me
I gotta go walkabout.

1307
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:03,178
If I a man, I gotta go walkabout.
Learn'em be a man.

1308
01:49:04,685 --> 01:49:06,619
Yeah.

1309
01:49:06,687 --> 01:49:09,918
Listen, it's up to Mrs. Boss
what you do, all right?

1310
01:49:09,991 --> 01:49:12,789
<i> Come on inside, boys.</i>
<i>It's time for dinner.</i>

1311
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:15,124
<i>I'm coming. Jedda, come on!</i>

1312
01:49:15,196 --> 01:49:17,187
Come on, Jedda.

1313
01:49:21,936 --> 01:49:25,235
<i>One day, Captain Dutton came and visit us.</i>

1314
01:49:25,306 --> 01:49:28,571
<i>He tell Drover</i>
<i>about the big army drove.</i>

1315
01:49:28,643 --> 01:49:29,524
<i>## </i>

1316
01:49:29,525 --> 01:49:31,771
And we need
the best stockmen possible.

1317
01:49:31,846 --> 01:49:35,145
- It may take six months or so.
- Overland.

1318
01:49:35,216 --> 01:49:38,014
Absolutely not. You just got back.

1319
01:49:46,027 --> 01:49:48,552
What's wrong?

1320
01:49:48,629 --> 01:49:51,894
I'm just not used to people
making decisions for me. That's all.

1321
01:49:51,966 --> 01:49:55,367
<i>I was just expressing an opinion.</i>

1322
01:49:55,436 --> 01:49:58,337
Captain Dutton was telling me about
this wonderful School of the Air.

1323
01:49:58,406 --> 01:50:01,534
It's conducted all across the country.

1324
01:50:01,609 --> 01:50:04,373
He wants to go walkabout
with King George.

1325
01:50:04,445 --> 01:50:07,471
That's ridiculous.
He's a little boy. It's not safe.

1326
01:50:07,548 --> 01:50:11,678
<i>He'd be safer in Arnhem Land than</i>
<i>he would be hanging around here.</i>

1327
01:50:11,752 --> 01:50:14,243
- I thought you said-
- <i>You can't change him, Sarah.</i>

1328
01:50:15,923 --> 01:50:18,255
I thought you said
it had nothing to do with you.

1329
01:50:18,326 --> 01:50:20,385
It doesn't.

1330
01:50:20,461 --> 01:50:24,227
<i>It's just sooner or later,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to let that boy go.</i>

1331
01:50:26,567 --> 01:50:28,831
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

1332
01:50:28,903 --> 01:50:32,532
<i>If he doesn't go through ceremony,</i>
<i>he'll have no country.</i>

1333
01:50:32,607 --> 01:50:35,235
He'll have no story, no dreaming.

1334
01:50:36,944 --> 01:50:38,935
And he'll be all alone.

1335
01:50:42,884 --> 01:50:45,375
<i>This big army drove-</i>

1336
01:50:45,453 --> 01:50:48,513
- Let's have dinner, shall we?
- <i>I'm gonna take it.</i>

1337
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:52,813
Time to go walkabout, Mrs. Boss.

1338
01:51:54,021 --> 01:51:57,650
- You belong here.
- No, Mrs. Boss.

1339
01:52:33,227 --> 01:52:36,458
<i>Sarah, I gotta go.</i>

1340
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:38,464
Sarah!

1341
01:52:39,934 --> 01:52:41,868
<i>Drover!</i>

1342
01:52:43,237 --> 01:52:45,705
Drover!

1343
01:52:48,442 --> 01:52:50,706
He's not down at the billabong!

1344
01:52:50,778 --> 01:52:52,276
Then he's gone walkabout.

1345
01:52:52,277 --> 01:52:55,511
He wouldn't have just left
without saying good-bye.

1346
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:58,484
Get the pack horse ready.
We're going up to Punctuation Point.

1347
01:52:58,552 --> 01:53:00,486
- Sing Song?
- <i>Yes?</i>

1348
01:53:00,554 --> 01:53:03,250
- Tin food. We're going after him.
- You're not listening.

1349
01:53:03,324 --> 01:53:06,122
- What?
- <i>Sarah, he's gone on walkabout!</i>

1350
01:53:06,193 --> 01:53:08,024
Oh, come on, Drover.
He is a child.

1351
01:53:08,095 --> 01:53:12,555
Well, he's not our child!
He's an Aboriginal child! He's gone walkabout!

1352
01:53:12,633 --> 01:53:14,863
- Bandy!
- <i>The next time you see him...</i>

1353
01:53:14,935 --> 01:53:16,926
will be when he wants to see you.

1354
01:53:17,004 --> 01:53:19,598
He'll be halfway to Arnhem Land by now.
You'll never find him.

1355
01:53:19,674 --> 01:53:22,575
You could find him.
You know that land better than anyone.

1356
01:53:22,643 --> 01:53:24,907
- You and Magarri can find him.
- <i>And do what, huh?</i>

1357
01:53:24,979 --> 01:53:28,039
<i>Bring him back here and lock him up?</i>
<i>You could start your own mission.</i>

1358
01:53:28,115 --> 01:53:31,573
Oh! You're just trying to be clever
because you don't want to be responsible.

1359
01:53:31,652 --> 01:53:33,415
He's not my son!

1360
01:53:36,057 --> 01:53:37,991
What did you say?

1361
01:53:40,828 --> 01:53:44,059
- I better go.
- <i>Don't leave! Drover, don't.</i>

1362
01:53:45,266 --> 01:53:47,791
I understood when you said
you had to be free.

1363
01:53:47,868 --> 01:53:52,168
I understood that,
but that was between you and me.

1364
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,469
<i>But it's different now.</i>

1365
01:53:54,542 --> 01:53:56,703
We've got Nullah.

1366
01:53:58,212 --> 01:54:00,146
- I gotta go.
- I need you to stay.

1367
01:54:00,214 --> 01:54:03,047
- I'll be back in six months.
- I need you to stay with me!

1368
01:54:03,117 --> 01:54:05,244
And if you can't do that, then I-

1369
01:54:05,319 --> 01:54:07,913
I would prefer it if you didn't return.

1370
01:54:12,493 --> 01:54:14,461
All right.

1371
01:54:14,528 --> 01:54:16,462
You're the boss.

1372
01:54:20,367 --> 01:54:23,165
Drover.

1373
01:54:34,014 --> 01:54:36,983
<i>I can feel them bad spirits coming...</i>

1374
01:54:37,051 --> 01:54:39,986
<i>so I chase after that King George.</i>

1375
01:54:40,054 --> 01:54:43,683
<i>But that Callahan,</i>
<i>he been stopped drinking Mrs. Boss's tea.</i>

1376
01:54:48,763 --> 01:54:52,756
<i>He lose his blind eye,</i>
<i>and I not invisible anymore.</i>

1377
01:54:59,406 --> 01:55:01,738
Jedda!

1378
01:55:03,778 --> 01:55:06,303
Fletcher,
we've apprehended that young'un.

1379
01:55:07,047 --> 01:55:12,178
<i>And in the course of our duties, we arrested</i>
<i>the suspected murderer of Lord Ashley.</i>

1380
01:55:12,253 --> 01:55:13,845
<i>King George.</i>

1381
01:55:20,861 --> 01:55:23,830
No!

1382
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,997
You finally lifted the game, Callahan.
Good on you.

1383
01:55:28,068 --> 01:55:31,299
- Things are looking up.
- <i> The militarization of Darwin.</i>

1384
01:55:31,372 --> 01:55:34,739
<i>Their cattle yards</i>
<i>are alive with military activity...</i>

1385
01:55:34,809 --> 01:55:38,540
<i>and the Carney Cattle office,</i>
<i>once that proud icon of Darwin...</i>

1386
01:55:38,612 --> 01:55:41,376
is now military headquarters.

1387
01:55:41,448 --> 01:55:44,178
<i>At 6:15 a.m. local time...</i>

1388
01:55:44,251 --> 01:55:48,210
the United States Pacific Fleet
was attacked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii...

1389
01:55:48,289 --> 01:55:50,655
by the empire of Japan.

1390
01:55:50,724 --> 01:55:54,057
The United States has joined the war.

1391
01:55:55,229 --> 01:55:58,198
As the Japanese horde pours southward...

1392
01:55:58,265 --> 01:56:01,928
the final evacuation of Darwin
is under way.

1393
01:56:10,077 --> 01:56:13,240
Get those boxes cleared on the double!

1394
01:56:13,314 --> 01:56:15,145
- Come on.
- This way, boys.

1395
01:56:15,216 --> 01:56:16,877
Quickly. Quickly.

1396
01:56:35,536 --> 01:56:38,403
<i>Hey, creamy! Creamy!</i>

1397
01:56:38,472 --> 01:56:41,100
<i>Doesn't your mommy want you?</i>

1398
01:56:51,852 --> 01:56:54,320
- <i>You filthy creamy!</i>
- Come on.

1399
01:56:54,388 --> 01:56:57,289
Come, my child.
Come on! Come on, my child.

1400
01:56:57,358 --> 01:56:58,985
Creamy! Hey, creamy!

1401
01:57:22,249 --> 01:57:23,614
- Excuse me.
- Nullah!

1402
01:57:23,684 --> 01:57:25,311
- <i>Lady Ashley.</i>
- It's Lady Ashley.

1403
01:57:25,386 --> 01:57:27,581
- Father Benedict, you deal with this.
- Nullah!

1404
01:57:27,655 --> 01:57:30,317
- Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!
- No! This is madness!

1405
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:33,292
Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away!
I don't want to go!

1406
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,658
Was she hugging a pickaninny?

1407
01:57:35,729 --> 01:57:37,788
People do the most extraordinary things.

1408
01:57:37,865 --> 01:57:40,925
- Go on.
- I don't want to go! Mrs. Boss!

1409
01:57:41,001 --> 01:57:41,676
It'll be all right.

1410
01:57:41,677 --> 01:57:43,629
These poor unfortunates
will be safe in God's hands.

1411
01:57:43,704 --> 01:57:46,138
These are not unfortunates!
These are children!

1412
01:57:46,206 --> 01:57:49,175
These are no different than the children
you are taking south to protect!

1413
01:57:49,243 --> 01:57:52,212
- Don't let them take me away! No!
- Nullah! Nullah!

1414
01:57:52,279 --> 01:57:54,873
- She's humiliating herself.
- Please help me!

1415
01:57:54,949 --> 01:57:57,042
- We've got to help her.
- Lady Ashley!

1416
01:57:57,117 --> 01:57:59,881
- Help me! That's my child.
- I understand what you're saying.

1417
01:57:59,954 --> 01:58:00,461
Please! Nullah!

1418
01:58:00,462 --> 01:58:02,286
You don't have an essential job.
You must evacuate.

1419
01:58:02,356 --> 01:58:06,122
- Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away.
- The church has a plan for them.

1420
01:58:06,193 --> 01:58:08,957
To leave those children behind
while we send ours to safety?

1421
01:58:09,029 --> 01:58:11,657
- Control yourself, Catherine.
- How can you all be so heartless?

1422
01:58:11,732 --> 01:58:14,633
You be a brave boy for me.
You be brave.

1423
01:58:14,702 --> 01:58:18,263
Neil, I want you to do something about this.
I want you to help Lady Ashley.

1424
01:58:18,339 --> 01:58:20,705
Yeah, now, look,
I could probably sort it out.

1425
01:58:20,774 --> 01:58:23,504
Show the ladies their cabins,
and I'll see what I can do.

1426
01:58:23,577 --> 01:58:25,135
<i>Come on, ladies.
To the upper decks.</i>

1427
01:58:25,212 --> 01:58:27,203
I will come find you,
whatever happens.

1428
01:58:27,281 --> 01:58:29,579
Whatever it takes,
we'll be together again. I promise.

1429
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:33,848
- I believe you, Mrs. Boss.
- Come along, child. Quickly. Quickly.

1430
01:58:33,921 --> 01:58:35,855
Mrs. Boss.

1431
01:58:37,257 --> 01:58:40,658
- I sing you to me.
- You be brave.

1432
01:58:42,429 --> 01:58:45,057
- Nullah.
- Come, boy. Come quickly.

1433
01:58:48,769 --> 01:58:51,431
Nullah! It'll be all right!

1434
01:58:57,011 --> 01:59:00,003
<i>I will find you! I will!</i>

1435
01:59:07,955 --> 01:59:11,186
<i>Nullah! Nullah!</i>

1436
01:59:18,432 --> 01:59:21,424
I sing you to me, Mrs. Boss!

1437
01:59:21,502 --> 01:59:24,562
And I will hear you, my darling!

1438
01:59:30,677 --> 01:59:33,111
There's a radio tower on Mission Island...

1439
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:36,581
directly in the path
of the oncoming Japanese.

1440
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:39,141
Be the first place the Japs hit.

1441
01:59:40,721 --> 01:59:42,655
You're monstrous.

1442
01:59:46,693 --> 01:59:49,753
I'll have the original contract with
the original offer drawn up and ready.

1443
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:53,994
<i>You can get yourself a room at Ivan's,</i>
<i>and I'll get you a job with Cath at H.Q.</i>

1444
01:59:54,068 --> 01:59:58,061
<i>I'll give you a call.</i>
<i>You will do this, Lady Ashley.</i>

1445
01:59:58,138 --> 02:00:01,972
After all, pride's not power.

1446
02:00:05,646 --> 02:00:08,774
Yeah, pride's not power.

1447
02:00:39,012 --> 02:00:41,537
<i>Mission Island to H.Q.</i>

1448
02:00:41,615 --> 02:00:44,846
Mission Island to H.Q.
Visibility good.

1449
02:00:44,918 --> 02:00:47,887
<i>All clear. Over and out.</i>

1450
02:00:49,623 --> 02:00:53,719
<i># Ave Maria #

1451
02:00:53,794 --> 02:00:57,992
<i> I was on Mission Island</i>
<i>lock-lock for two whole months.</i>

1452
02:00:59,066 --> 02:01:03,002
<i>Mrs. Boss promised she'd come for me...</i>

1453
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:05,561
<i>so I play my magic song.</i>

1454
02:01:10,077 --> 02:01:12,045
<i>But that Drover-</i>

1455
02:01:12,112 --> 02:01:14,740
<i>him been gone far, far away...</i>

1456
02:01:14,815 --> 02:01:17,215
<i>on that big army drove.</i>

1457
02:01:18,318 --> 02:01:21,651
<i>Him been gone so long, so far away...</i>

1458
02:01:21,722 --> 02:01:26,318
<i>maybe he not hear me.</i>

1459
02:01:28,128 --> 02:01:31,894
Leave it off.

1460
02:01:31,965 --> 02:01:34,092
What? No whistling?

1461
02:01:34,168 --> 02:01:36,500
Just not that tune.

1462
02:01:49,917 --> 02:01:52,385
<i>Not that one either.</i>

1463
02:01:52,452 --> 02:01:54,852
<i>No music?</i>

1464
02:01:54,922 --> 02:01:57,049
You must be properly hurtin'
for Mrs. Boss.

1465
02:01:57,124 --> 02:01:59,058
Shut your damper hole, will ya?

1466
02:01:59,126 --> 02:02:01,686
I can see why Mrs. Boss
gave you the boot.

1467
02:02:01,762 --> 02:02:04,196
- You wanna know why she gave me the boot?
- Yeah.

1468
02:02:04,264 --> 02:02:06,926
'Cause I wouldn't stop Nullah
from going walkabout.

1469
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,968
He went walkabout?

1470
02:02:09,036 --> 02:02:11,561
Yeah. I tried to explain to her
what that means, but-

1471
02:02:11,638 --> 02:02:14,436
- <i>See him go?</i>
- Nah.

1472
02:02:14,508 --> 02:02:17,204
So he's gone.

1473
02:02:17,277 --> 02:02:20,940
- Yeah. I told you. He went walkabout.
- You don't know?

1474
02:02:21,014 --> 02:02:22,914
Eh?

1475
02:02:22,983 --> 02:02:27,317
<i>That little fella, he could have walked</i>
<i>into a big hole or got eaten by a croc.</i>

1476
02:02:27,387 --> 02:02:30,823
- What if the cops have got him?
- Don't you bloody start. He's an Aboriginal boy!

1477
02:02:30,891 --> 02:02:36,295
Wait. You're just hiding behind that
blackfella business so you don't get hurt.

1478
02:02:36,363 --> 02:02:38,831
<i>This isn't about walkabout, is it?</i>

1479
02:02:38,899 --> 02:02:42,335
Is it? You're running.

1480
02:02:43,537 --> 02:02:45,937
- I'm not running, mate.
- Yes, you are, brother.

1481
02:02:48,008 --> 02:02:51,466
<i>You're scared of getting your heart hurt</i>
<i>like before, when my sister died.</i>

1482
02:02:54,781 --> 02:02:57,909
<i>But knowing you, you probably never</i>
<i>told Mrs. Boss that you loved her, eh?</i>

1483
02:03:00,053 --> 02:03:03,113
You got no love in your heart...

1484
02:03:03,190 --> 02:03:05,181
<i>you got nothing.</i>

1485
02:03:08,829 --> 02:03:11,798
<i>No dreaming, no story.</i>

1486
02:03:12,866 --> 02:03:14,834
Nothing.

1487
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:27,712
<i>Hey. Big mob of army fellas.</i>

1488
02:03:30,417 --> 02:03:32,885
Must be diggers, eh?

1489
02:03:32,953 --> 02:03:35,888
<i>They're not diggers, mate.</i>
<i>They're Yanks.</i>

1490
02:03:35,956 --> 02:03:38,424
What the bloody hell are they doing here?

1491
02:04:11,758 --> 02:04:13,692
Once you've signed the contract...

1492
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:17,025
I'll get one of the brothers to take you
out to the mission on the sloop.

1493
02:04:17,097 --> 02:04:21,090
You can be happily reunited
with your little creamy.

1494
02:04:21,168 --> 02:04:23,728
No loss of pride, Lady Ashley.

1495
02:04:27,841 --> 02:04:30,275
<i>Good morning, Ivan!</i>

1496
02:04:33,246 --> 02:04:37,683
- You look happy.
- I am. I get my little boy today.

1497
02:04:37,751 --> 02:04:41,414
Oh, and, Ivan, we're leaving
the territory tomorrow.

1498
02:04:41,488 --> 02:04:44,719
Good! I need the room.

1499
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:47,259
I'll miss you too, Ivan!

1500
02:05:19,025 --> 02:05:22,017
- Cath, sorry I'm late.
- Quick changeover, girls.

1501
02:05:23,029 --> 02:05:25,395
- Did you speak to Neil?
- Yes.

1502
02:05:25,465 --> 02:05:28,059
I'm seeing him about Nullah
after my shift.

1503
02:05:28,135 --> 02:05:30,626
- Look. I was just thinking-
- What?

1504
02:05:30,704 --> 02:05:33,104
About Nullah.

1505
02:05:33,173 --> 02:05:35,607
What?

1506
02:06:05,172 --> 02:06:07,231
I'm getting a signal from Mission Island.

1507
02:06:07,307 --> 02:06:10,538
Large air formation bearing down.
Suspect visibility.

1508
02:06:28,528 --> 02:06:32,225
If you can't understand the ordnance...

1509
02:06:32,299 --> 02:06:34,290
how can you understand the order?

1510
02:06:49,316 --> 02:06:51,716
What's happening?

1511
02:06:58,258 --> 02:07:00,988
<i>We're under attack!</i>
<i>We're under attack!</i>

1512
02:07:08,635 --> 02:07:11,001
Hurry up!

1513
02:07:20,146 --> 02:07:21,704
Let them free!

1514
02:08:42,495 --> 02:08:47,626
<i>Drover! Hey! Drover! Magarri!</i>

1515
02:08:47,701 --> 02:08:52,104
Goolaj, where's Mrs. Boss?

1516
02:08:52,172 --> 02:08:55,664
She at that army H.Q. - old Carney place!

1517
02:08:55,742 --> 02:08:58,267
Okay. Come on!

1518
02:09:00,046 --> 02:09:02,014
Drover,
I'll see you at Faraway Downs!

1519
02:09:05,719 --> 02:09:09,815
You can't go in there, mate!

1520
02:09:14,694 --> 02:09:17,322
- Drover!
- Callahan?

1521
02:09:17,397 --> 02:09:19,524
<i>Is she in there? Sarah Ashley.</i>

1522
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:21,863
- It's too late.
- She's in there!

1523
02:09:21,935 --> 02:09:23,926
Hold it, mate!

1524
02:09:25,071 --> 02:09:29,337
Let me in there! Sarah! Sarah!

1525
02:09:29,409 --> 02:09:32,708
Let me in there!

1526
02:09:32,779 --> 02:09:36,010
I'll handle this. You get your man
out of here right now!

1527
02:09:36,082 --> 02:09:38,516
- She's a part of dreaming now.
- Get out of my way!

1528
02:09:38,585 --> 02:09:40,052
- Go on! Hit me!
- Get out of my-

1529
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:42,816
Go on! Hit me!
It's not gonna bring her back.

1530
02:09:42,889 --> 02:09:44,584
She's in there! Sarah!

1531
02:09:44,658 --> 02:09:47,388
Clear the corridor! Come on!

1532
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:50,725
Nobody past this point unless they're
at death's door or already through it.

1533
02:09:50,797 --> 02:09:52,765
<i>You got a name?</i>

1534
02:09:52,832 --> 02:09:55,426
Ashley. Sarah Ashley.

1535
02:10:00,006 --> 02:10:01,940
What did he say?

1536
02:10:40,714 --> 02:10:43,376
<i>But right now it's raining.</i>

1537
02:10:44,651 --> 02:10:48,417
<i>It's different now.</i>
<i>We've got Nullah.</i>

1538
02:10:51,057 --> 02:10:53,048
<i>Here you are.</i>

1539
02:11:06,206 --> 02:11:08,436
<i>She deserves a drink like any man.</i>

1540
02:11:10,510 --> 02:11:12,501
- <i> Too bloody right.</i>
- <i> Crikey!</i>

1541
02:11:18,585 --> 02:11:21,179
Hey, no boongs in here.

1542
02:11:36,636 --> 02:11:38,627
You didn't say that, did you?

1543
02:11:38,705 --> 02:11:41,265
That's how it is.

1544
02:11:42,575 --> 02:11:44,566
Just because it is...

1545
02:11:46,546 --> 02:11:49,538
doesn't-
doesn't mean it should be.

1546
02:11:53,186 --> 02:11:55,279
Serve him a fuckin' drink!

1547
02:12:20,747 --> 02:12:23,511
Ah, what does it matter?

1548
02:12:24,951 --> 02:12:26,976
I'm a total bloody ruin.

1549
02:12:27,053 --> 02:12:30,489
<i>I'm evacuating south,</i>
<i>like everybody else.</i>

1550
02:12:30,557 --> 02:12:32,718
You're short one glass.

1551
02:12:37,297 --> 02:12:41,165
<i>One... more... glass.</i>

1552
02:12:48,975 --> 02:12:53,036
I leave this place
for the looters and the Japs.

1553
02:12:58,451 --> 02:13:00,442
Why not the boongs?

1554
02:13:17,170 --> 02:13:20,333
<i>I saw her this morning...</i>

1555
02:13:20,406 --> 02:13:22,374
<i>before she went to the work.</i>

1556
02:13:22,442 --> 02:13:24,433
<i>She was so happy.</i>

1557
02:13:25,812 --> 02:13:28,610
She was gonna get that...

1558
02:13:28,681 --> 02:13:31,878
<i>little boy and go south.</i>

1559
02:13:33,286 --> 02:13:35,447
What about the children
on Mission Island?

1560
02:13:35,521 --> 02:13:40,015
<i>The creamies?</i>
<i>They are left out there.</i>

1561
02:13:40,093 --> 02:13:43,961
- They left them out there?
- Safe in the hands of God.

1562
02:13:44,030 --> 02:13:46,328
They left them-

1563
02:13:46,399 --> 02:13:48,993
<i>They say the island was hit first.</i>

1564
02:13:49,068 --> 02:13:52,060
<i>They say no one would have survived.</i>

1565
02:13:57,210 --> 02:14:00,008
They say a lot of things.

1566
02:14:02,916 --> 02:14:04,907
<i>There's been some mistake.</i>

1567
02:14:06,019 --> 02:14:08,010
That's Cath Fletcher.

1568
02:14:09,222 --> 02:14:11,281
Oh, God. Cath.

1569
02:14:11,357 --> 02:14:14,690
- Oh, God!
- Sort her out.

1570
02:14:14,761 --> 02:14:17,696
- Sarah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, God!

1571
02:14:17,764 --> 02:14:19,925
Nullah. I've got to get to Nullah.

1572
02:14:19,999 --> 02:14:22,763
- Sarah, the Japs hit the mission first.
- No!

1573
02:14:22,835 --> 02:14:25,827
- No! I don't believe you! I don't believe it!
- Sarah, look at me.

1574
02:14:25,905 --> 02:14:27,896
No one can get out there.

1575
02:14:32,178 --> 02:14:35,841
No one.

1576
02:14:37,016 --> 02:14:38,950
<i>I need help to get to the island.</i>

1577
02:14:39,018 --> 02:14:41,987
- Half the Jap navy's out there, you stupid bastard.
- I have the Lord on my side.

1578
02:14:42,055 --> 02:14:44,615
I don't give a damn who's on your side!

1579
02:14:46,726 --> 02:14:49,388
God works in mysterious ways, Brother.
Go, go, go!

1580
02:14:49,462 --> 02:14:51,123
<i>Magarri, secure the boat.</i>

1581
02:14:51,197 --> 02:14:53,563
- <i>Thank you, Lord. Thank you.</i>
- Thank you, Bull.

1582
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:04,573
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1583
02:15:09,215 --> 02:15:12,707
Sarah, we leave at first light.

1584
02:15:32,905 --> 02:15:34,702
Ivan.

1585
02:15:34,774 --> 02:15:38,107
- Check the second dormitory.
- Okay.

1586
02:16:15,648 --> 02:16:17,582
Nullah.

1587
02:16:21,954 --> 02:16:23,888
Oh.

1588
02:16:49,682 --> 02:16:51,912
Come on. It's all right.

1589
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:55,953
- Shh.
- Where are the other-Are there other boys?

1590
02:16:56,022 --> 02:16:58,013
- I don't know.
- <i>Are there any other boys?</i>

1591
02:16:58,091 --> 02:17:00,582
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- Okay.

1592
02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:02,651
Drover?

1593
02:17:04,664 --> 02:17:07,599
- Nullah.
- Drover!

1594
02:17:09,735 --> 02:17:12,602
<i>Drover!</i>

1595
02:17:12,672 --> 02:17:15,140
I knew you'd come.
I sing you to me.

1596
02:17:15,208 --> 02:17:17,142
Oh.

1597
02:17:20,246 --> 02:17:22,806
- Magarri!
- Hey, little fella.

1598
02:17:29,455 --> 02:17:31,821
Mrs. Boss come too?

1599
02:17:31,891 --> 02:17:34,121
Where's Mrs. Boss?

1600
02:17:34,193 --> 02:17:36,184
We, uh-

1601
02:17:36,262 --> 02:17:39,527
We can't say her name anymore,
little mate.

1602
02:17:42,869 --> 02:17:45,030
All right?

1603
02:17:45,104 --> 02:17:48,198
Hey. Now you listen to me.
I need your help.

1604
02:17:48,274 --> 02:17:50,333
I'm gonna get these fellas
off the island.

1605
02:17:50,409 --> 02:17:52,741
You're gonna have to be strong.
Can you do that?

1606
02:17:52,812 --> 02:17:54,803
- Mm-hmm.
- Good boy.

1607
02:17:56,082 --> 02:17:59,142
All right. Go and get
your little mates down there.

1608
02:17:59,218 --> 02:18:01,982
- Come over here. Let's go.
- Come with me. It's okay.

1609
02:18:02,054 --> 02:18:05,512
- <i>Come on.</i>
- We're gonna get you all off this island, all right?

1610
02:18:05,591 --> 02:18:07,889
All right.
Boys, we're gonna have to swim.

1611
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:11,726
We have to be quiet, like a turtle.
Okay?

1612
02:18:11,797 --> 02:18:15,062
<i>Now, I'm gonna take you home on a ship.</i>
<i>It's over there. You see it?</i>

1613
02:18:25,411 --> 02:18:27,709
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

1614
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:29,714
Quick, quick, quick!

1615
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:32,684
Ivan.

1616
02:18:33,986 --> 02:18:36,477
- Ivan. Swim the big boys down to the sloop.
- Right.

1617
02:18:36,556 --> 02:18:39,889
Use the current and drift it
down to the end of the wharf. Go.

1618
02:18:39,959 --> 02:18:42,792
Come on, boys. Quick.

1619
02:18:42,862 --> 02:18:45,057
Run! Run!

1620
02:18:45,131 --> 02:18:47,565
Quick, quick!

1621
02:18:47,633 --> 02:18:49,567
<i>Let's go.</i>

1622
02:19:01,214 --> 02:19:03,774
Ah, crikey.

1623
02:19:09,488 --> 02:19:12,548
Hey.

1624
02:19:14,727 --> 02:19:17,287
- I take this mob walkabout.
- You'll never make it.

1625
02:19:17,363 --> 02:19:19,331
Well, you gotta make it!

1626
02:19:19,398 --> 02:19:22,094
You got family now.

1627
02:19:22,168 --> 02:19:24,398
You gotta drove this mob home, Drover.

1628
02:19:30,009 --> 02:19:32,569
Good luck, brother.

1629
02:19:35,348 --> 02:19:37,248
- Go, go.
- That's it. Good boy.

1630
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:18,679
Magarri.

1631
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:26,794
<i>Up the ladder, boys. Quick. Hurry now.</i>

1632
02:20:34,573 --> 02:20:36,200
Come on.

1633
02:21:19,719 --> 02:21:21,710
Drove 'em home, Drover.

1634
02:22:08,567 --> 02:22:10,501
Sergeant, get the men on the trucks.

1635
02:22:10,569 --> 02:22:13,470
<i>We're evacuating within 15 minutes.</i>

1636
02:22:13,539 --> 02:22:17,805
<i>We rendezvous with the main convoy</i>
<i>at 0800 hours at Adelaide.</i>

1637
02:22:18,811 --> 02:22:20,904
<i>Start the truck, Sergeant Lapin.</i>

1638
02:22:22,181 --> 02:22:25,275
<i>If anyone is lagging,</i>
<i>use whatever force is necessary.</i>

1639
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:27,876
Every single man, Lapin.
And don't take no for an answer.

1640
02:22:27,953 --> 02:22:32,981
- <i>You won't have to wait for us, Captain.</i>
- Move! Come on! Move!

1641
02:22:33,058 --> 02:22:36,186
Thanks for coming down, Mr. Fletcher.

1642
02:22:36,262 --> 02:22:38,321
It's my awful duty to inform you...

1643
02:22:38,397 --> 02:22:40,558
<i>that your wife, Catherine-</i>

1644
02:22:42,935 --> 02:22:45,267
My wife is dead?

1645
02:22:45,337 --> 02:22:49,364
<i>It's a funny old world, isn't it?</i>

1646
02:22:49,442 --> 02:22:51,433
Generous to a fault.

1647
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:55,844
<i>Did you know that Lady Ashley insisted...</i>

1648
02:22:55,915 --> 02:22:57,906
that my wife work her shift...

1649
02:23:00,419 --> 02:23:06,221
so that she could see
some... half-caste kid on the mission?

1650
02:23:06,292 --> 02:23:08,453
<i>Now my wife's dead.</i>

1651
02:23:10,396 --> 02:23:12,660
Now I've lost everything.

1652
02:23:24,143 --> 02:23:26,202
<i>We have to go, Sarah.</i>

1653
02:23:39,992 --> 02:23:43,587
Come on! Come on, boys!

1654
02:23:45,998 --> 02:23:48,592
They'll be flying in here
and blowing us up any minute!

1655
02:23:48,667 --> 02:23:50,726
<i>Get on the bloody trucks!</i>

1656
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:12,254
<i>Sarah, please. We have to go now.</i>

1657
02:24:19,131 --> 02:24:21,622
<i>My magic not good.</i>

1658
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:23,634
<i>All the smoke.</i>

1659
02:24:25,538 --> 02:24:27,802
<i>But then he speak to me.</i>

1660
02:24:27,873 --> 02:24:32,537
<i>Grandfather.</i>

1661
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:56,960
Come on, love. Don't muck about.

1662
02:25:05,911 --> 02:25:07,845
Can you hear that?

1663
02:25:09,281 --> 02:25:11,249
<i>Music. Can you hear it?</i>

1664
02:25:11,317 --> 02:25:13,581
Come on, boys.

1665
02:25:20,726 --> 02:25:22,751
Sing.

1666
02:25:26,532 --> 02:25:28,523
- <i>Sarah, please.</i>
- Can't you hear it?

1667
02:25:38,277 --> 02:25:40,507
It's children singing.

1668
02:26:03,168 --> 02:26:06,797
- <i>Sarah! What's going on?</i>
- Just give her another minute.

1669
02:26:33,465 --> 02:26:35,933
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1670
02:26:37,770 --> 02:26:40,739
Mrs. Boss!

1671
02:26:42,941 --> 02:26:45,842
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1672
02:26:49,148 --> 02:26:51,412
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1673
02:26:57,022 --> 02:26:58,887
Nullah!

1674
02:26:58,957 --> 02:27:01,448
- Mrs. Boss!
- Ah!

1675
02:27:01,527 --> 02:27:04,963
- I can say your name!
- Oh!

1676
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:09,091
Mrs. Boss. I sing you to me
like the first night I see you.

1677
02:27:09,168 --> 02:27:12,399
Them Japs nearly got us.
We had to swim'em.

1678
02:27:12,471 --> 02:27:16,134
Some of them little fellas
from the desert can't swim'em.

1679
02:27:16,208 --> 02:27:20,144
But the Drover take 'em
on his back like a turtle.

1680
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:24,613
What did you say? What?

1681
02:27:24,683 --> 02:27:26,617
Drover.

1682
02:27:54,213 --> 02:27:56,977
You're alive! Oh, God!

1683
02:28:26,078 --> 02:28:28,638
Sarah, what's going on?
I can't hold the sergeant any longer!

1684
02:28:32,618 --> 02:28:35,712
Come on, boys!

1685
02:28:35,788 --> 02:28:38,780
Oh, my God.
It's the children from the mission.

1686
02:28:38,857 --> 02:28:40,987
The last convoy leaves Darwin
in a matter of minutes.

1687
02:28:40,988 --> 02:28:41,382
Come on!

1688
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:43,394
- In the truck!
- Come on, boys!

1689
02:28:43,462 --> 02:28:45,487
- To the truck. Follow Brother Frank.
- Truck's waiting. Let's go.

1690
02:28:45,564 --> 02:28:47,293
Follow Brother Frank.
Follow Brother Frank.

1691
02:28:47,366 --> 02:28:49,300
- <i>That's it. That's it.</i>
- Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

1692
02:28:49,368 --> 02:28:51,632
- Let's go.
- <i>Come on, boys.</i>

1693
02:28:51,703 --> 02:28:55,070
<i> Quick as you can to the end of</i>
<i>the wharf, and then straight on the truck.</i>

1694
02:28:55,140 --> 02:28:58,075
- <i>Sarah.</i>
- Ivan!

1695
02:28:58,143 --> 02:29:00,373
Thank you!

1696
02:29:03,882 --> 02:29:06,316
Thank you.

1697
02:29:06,385 --> 02:29:08,785
I shall prepare your bill.

1698
02:29:13,826 --> 02:29:15,851
Where'd you come from?

1699
02:29:15,928 --> 02:29:19,386
The good Lord has delivered us,
but we could do with a ride, Sergeant.

1700
02:29:19,464 --> 02:29:21,830
I'm not Jesus Christ,
but I'll give it my best shot.

1701
02:29:21,900 --> 02:29:23,993
Come on, kids.
Come on. On the trucks.

1702
02:29:24,069 --> 02:29:26,765
<i>I want a third in the front,</i>
<i>a third at the back.</i>

1703
02:29:26,839 --> 02:29:29,740
<i>Come on. Leg 'em up.</i>
<i>They're little fellas. Come on.</i>

1704
02:29:29,808 --> 02:29:32,743
<i>Bring those little fellas up to the front.</i>

1705
02:29:32,811 --> 02:29:35,780
<i>You cursed me, you little creamy.</i>

1706
02:29:35,848 --> 02:29:38,942
Oh. Oh.

1707
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:44,016
When I said that no one
could get out there...

1708
02:29:44,089 --> 02:29:46,080
<i>I'd forgotten about you, Drover.</i>

1709
02:29:46,158 --> 02:29:50,094
<i>That no matter.</i>
<i>We gonna go back Faraway Downs.</i>

1710
02:29:51,797 --> 02:29:55,062
Yes, he's right. With the water up,
it's the safest place in the north.

1711
02:29:56,134 --> 02:29:58,295
<i>These are, after all-</i>

1712
02:29:58,370 --> 02:30:01,703
Extraordinary circumstances.

1713
02:30:03,275 --> 02:30:06,142
Extraordinary circumstances.

1714
02:30:06,211 --> 02:30:08,805
Thank you, Emmett.

1715
02:30:14,753 --> 02:30:17,221
I'll see you mob in Faraway Downs.

1716
02:30:26,064 --> 02:30:29,932
Here, fellas, make some room
for the kids, will ya?

1717
02:30:30,002 --> 02:30:32,266
- Can you help me, please?
- In you go.

1718
02:30:33,605 --> 02:30:35,766
Right-o! That's it. They're all on.

1719
02:30:35,841 --> 02:30:38,605
Let's get out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

1720
02:30:40,145 --> 02:30:42,636
All right, kids, hold on.

1721
02:30:47,586 --> 02:30:49,781
Mr. Fletcher!

1722
02:30:51,189 --> 02:30:53,180
Mr. Fletcher.

1723
02:30:53,258 --> 02:30:55,419
Neil.

1724
02:30:55,494 --> 02:30:57,325
<i>We gotta go.</i>

1725
02:31:00,332 --> 02:31:03,267
Go and tell Callahan
there's looters everywhere.

1726
02:31:05,003 --> 02:31:08,131
Go and tell Callahan!

1727
02:31:13,912 --> 02:31:17,006
- I've got the keys to the car upstairs.
- Right-o.

1728
02:31:21,186 --> 02:31:23,017
Come on, Mrs. Boss. Hurry up.

1729
02:31:36,134 --> 02:31:37,499
Nullah!

1730
02:31:41,907 --> 02:31:45,536
<i>I got</i> gulapa <i>magic.</i>
<i>No one can hurt me.</i>

1731
02:31:45,610 --> 02:31:47,874
- <i> Nullah! No!</i>
- No!

1732
02:31:55,487 --> 02:31:58,388
<i>No! No!</i>

1733
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:12,270
Nullah!

1734
02:32:12,337 --> 02:32:15,864
Nullah, you all right, little man?
Nullah, please. Come on. Please.

1735
02:32:17,609 --> 02:32:19,543
Come on.

1736
02:32:21,913 --> 02:32:23,904
There. That's it.

1737
02:32:26,518 --> 02:32:29,214
No bullet. Me <i>gulapa.</i>

1738
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:06,724
<i>King George teach me...</i>

1739
02:33:06,792 --> 02:33:10,922
<i>the rain will fall,</i>
<i>the grass grow green...</i>

1740
02:33:10,996 --> 02:33:14,659
<i>and life, it begin again.</i>

1741
02:33:20,405 --> 02:33:22,873
Let's go home.

1742
02:33:22,941 --> 02:33:25,000
There's no place like it.

1743
02:34:08,019 --> 02:34:10,715
<i>One thing I know.</i>

1744
02:34:10,789 --> 02:34:14,054
Why <i>we tell story</i>
<i>is the most important of all.</i>

1745
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:18,627
<i>That's how you keep them people</i>
<i>belong you...</i>

1746
02:34:18,697 --> 02:34:21,257
<i>always.</i>

1747
02:35:10,615 --> 02:35:12,549
Oh.

1748
02:35:27,666 --> 02:35:31,466
Mrs. Boss, I sing you to me.

1749
02:35:58,530 --> 02:36:00,464
Here.

1750
02:36:57,722 --> 02:37:00,316
And I will hear you.

1751
02:38:06,591 --> 02:38:10,459
<i># Sing and I will hear you #

1752
02:38:10,528 --> 02:38:13,554
<i># No matter where you are #

1753
02:38:14,699 --> 02:38:18,635
<i># A song to light the darkest night #

1754
02:38:18,703 --> 02:38:22,605
<i># And guide me from afar#</i>

1755
02:38:22,674 --> 02:38:25,905
<i># And I will never#</i>

1756
02:38:25,977 --> 02:38:29,310
<i># Be afraid #

1757
02:38:29,381 --> 02:38:33,181
<i># Now I know you're somewhere #

1758
02:38:33,251 --> 02:38:36,652
<i># You're everywhere to me #

1759
02:38:39,457 --> 02:38:42,085
<i># The warming of the sun #

1760
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:47,097
<i># Upon the earth beneath my feet #

1761
02:38:47,165 --> 02:38:50,760
<i># And when the rain falls down #

1762
02:38:50,835 --> 02:38:54,828
<i># You tell the story #

1763
02:38:54,906 --> 02:38:59,275
<i># And I will hear you #

1764
02:38:59,344 --> 02:39:02,472
<i># Always near you #

1765
02:39:02,547 --> 02:39:06,039
<i># By the Boab tree ##</i>

1766
02:39:28,740 --> 02:39:33,302
<i> # From the sunburnt plains</i>
<i>of far-off north Australia #

1767
02:39:34,646 --> 02:39:38,946
<i># Came a fella born to ride</i>
<i>the wide, brown land #

1768
02:39:40,452 --> 02:39:43,250
<i># Oh, he grew up running wild #

1769
02:39:43,321 --> 02:39:46,154
<i># But soon by all was styled #

1770
02:39:46,224 --> 02:39:50,490
<i># As the country's greatest</i>
<i>ever-drovin' man #

1771
02:39:52,096 --> 02:39:56,430
<i># Though his legend rode the winds</i>
<i>from Broome to Darwin #

1772
02:39:57,802 --> 02:40:03,172
<i># They loved and loathed him</i>
<i>right from end to end #

1773
02:40:03,241 --> 02:40:06,074
<i># For when the Drover gave his heart #

1774
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:08,874
<i># To a girl whose skin was dark #

1775
02:40:08,947 --> 02:40:14,613
<i># From that day on</i>
<i>he was no white man's friend #

1776
02:40:14,686 --> 02:40:17,416
<i># So goes the Drover's story #

1777
02:40:17,489 --> 02:40:20,049
<i># You will hear it near and far #</i>

1778

<i># And in the end</i>

<i># Makes the blanket</i>

1782
02:41:09,774 --> 02:41:15,610
<i># But the Drover is a man</i>
<i>of constant shadows #

1783
02:41:15,680 --> 02:41:20,811
<i># Haunted by his pain</i>

<i># For every mile he rides #

1785
02:41:24,022 --> 02:41:26,388
<i># What he cannot hide #

1786
02:41:26,457 --> 02:41:28,721
<i># Is the longing in his heart #

1787

<i># To love again #

1788
