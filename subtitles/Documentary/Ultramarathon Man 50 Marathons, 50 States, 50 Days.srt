1
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,035
So tell me. How was Hawaii?

2
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,572
- It was unbelievable.
- Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,541
- Well, what happened?
- I met this guy.

4
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:03,112
It was the best week of my life.

5
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,388
It was just a little
vacation romance.

6
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,389
But he was so sweet.

7
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,858
He took me to all these
cool local places.

8
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,327
We went scuba diving...

9
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,897
- Snorkeling.
- Mountain climbing.

10
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:18,485
We went cliff diving.

11
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,888
Well, we got a little drunk.

12
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,356
- He gave me...
- A back rub.

13
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,790
We slow danced...

14
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:28,394
...in the rain.

15
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,589
But it wasn't just about the sex.

16
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:34,025
He pounded me like a mallard duck.

17
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:36,937
It ended kind of weird, though.

18
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,269
When I asked for his number,
he said he's...

19
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:40,769
- Married.
- Gay.

20
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,671
- Entering the priesthood.
- He doesn't believe in phones.

21
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:47,413
He just kind of ran away.

22
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:50,006
You know, it was just
a little fling, but...

23
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:51,508
I won't forget my week...

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,419
...with Henry Roth.

25
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,217
- Henry Roth.
- Harry.

26
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:58,992
Harry Paratesticles.

27
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:01,125
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,224
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

29
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:06,762
Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me
you were a secret agent?

30
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:11,699
I prefer intelligence operative,
and I couldn't tell you until I knew you.

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,008
Well, can I call you when I land?

32
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:17,773
You can call me, but I'll be in Peru.
I said that a little loud.

33
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:21,504
Come on, that's a 187, code blue.
We got the wolf sleeping at night.

34
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,384
He's slipping his arm in the drawer
and out comes the cookie jar. All clear.

35
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:28,317
Got it?

36
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:31,491
Well, maybe when you
get back from Peru.

37
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,086
- I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
- Linda.

38
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:38,930
I know. I changed your name
for your protection.

39
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:42,901
We have to go our separate ways now.

40
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,562
Well, goodbye.

41
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:47,404
Got it! Moving out!

42
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:55,515
- What the hell is your problem?
- Just keep going, I'll give you $20.

43
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,781
- You got it. How's your balls?
- Killing me. Hit it.

44
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:16,832
Easy, Honah Lee.

45
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:20,199
Hey, I'm a person, not a seal.

46
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:26,103
Well, I am a vet, not a doctor. So just
hold still, or I won't give you a treat.

47
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:27,979
I know, it's okay.
You see that, kids?

48
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:31,142
You see what happens
when you play with sharks?

49
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:35,111
Now, why you gotta spread those lies?
Sharks are like dogs.

50
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:37,751
They only bite when you
touch their private parts.

51
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,118
That's a good title
for my documentary.

52
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,190
Sharks: They Only Bite When
You Touch Their Private Parts.

53
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:49,228
Or you could call it,
Sharks: They Tried to Eat My Kidney.

54
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,504
All right, enough already.
You too, Willie.

55
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:56,701
All of you.

56
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:58,635
He just cast a spell on us.

57
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:03,049
All right. Put this on four times
a day for two weeks.

58
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:06,052
- You can handle that.
- What's wrong with that turtle?

59
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:08,952
Lung problems because
he smoked too much turtle weed...

60
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,216
...which is bad for you. Right, Ula?

61
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,093
What? I don't smoke weed.

62
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:19,065
Hey, Honah Lee? How's that hot
wahine nympho from Ohio?

63
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,863
Great. I dropped her off
at the airport this morning.

64
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,636
Come on, I need some details.

65
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:26,834
You get some booby, some assy,
a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.

66
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:28,836
Daddy, what's a nympho?

67
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:33,306
Oh. The nympho
is the state bird of Ohio.

68
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,344
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.

69
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:40,984
Here you go. Bite the fish,
chew the fish, love the fish. Enjoy.

70
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,987
- You crack me up, kamaaina.
- Oh, yeah?

71
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,090
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

72
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:48,491
...you'll show one of those
tourists such a good time...

73
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:50,163
...she'll wanna stay on the island.

74
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:52,132
Why do you say
mean things like that...

75
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,191
...and why is your foot
on my pillow?

76
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:59,332
I don't want your ass on it, either.
Get up! Get up!

77
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,174
It could happen.

78
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:04,076
Then you won't be able to go
on your boat trip to Alaska.

79
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:11,015
You'll be stuck here, waking up next to
the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula.

80
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:18,522
- Just kidding, guys.
- About the old part or the ugly part?

81
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,823
Henry, come quickly!
It's Jocko!

82
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,002
Jocko! What's going on
with you, buddy?

83
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:36,108
Don't be scared.
Everything's gonna be fine.

84
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:38,610
Just stay calm. All right.

85
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:42,842
Willie, I don't need you to see this.
Get out of here, now!

86
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,776
Okay, check the temperature
of the pool. Go! Hurry!

87
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:50,816
What are you doing?
I meant check the thermometer!

88
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,817
Give me a hand. Let's go!

89
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,525
Get me two fish
from the barrel. Now.

90
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:57,094
- Okay.
- Just hang in there.

91
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:59,199
- Here.
- It's gonna be all right.

92
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:02,327
That's a little warm.
Go to the bottom of the barrel, please.

93
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:11,472
Okay, there. That's good. Thank you.

94
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,246
Come on, buddy, take it. Take it.

95
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,272
- He's not responding!
- I know, Alexa!

96
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,769
Sorry, I smacked you. You needed
the fish-slap to calm down.

97
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,755
- Do you understand? Are you calm?
- Yes. Fish-slap calm me.

98
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,189
I'm gonna try to get him
breathing manually...

99
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,989
...so I need your face next
to his mouth to see if it's working.

100
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,228
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

101
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:32,163
- One, two, three!
- Nothing, nothing!

102
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,737
All right! Try it again. If it doesn't
work we'll perform a tracheotomy.

103
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:40,001
We don't wanna do that, so let's
pray this works. One more time.

104
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,333
One, two...

105
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,786
That's a lot of vomit.

106
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:57,154
This is why I got into
this business.

107
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,418
To save sea animals.

108
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,761
You should go
wash yourself off, okay?

109
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,322
Maybe try some turpentine.
That might take the stink away.

110
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:09,303
Yeah, high-five is right, buddy.

111
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:13,637
I knew you were gonna burp,
but the vomit thing was awesome!

112
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:17,038
That's what she gets for eating
my roast beef sandwich.

113
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,607
Willie, did you see that?

114
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:42,598
Captain's log:
November 5th, 6: 45 a. m.

115
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,169
I've taken the Sea Serpent for
a trip around the island of Oahu.

116
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:49,275
It is by far the longest voyage
she has yet undertaken...

117
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,039
...and its completion will signal
that she's ready...

118
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,347
...for our great journey
to Bristol Bay...

119
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:57,874
...whose unspoiled walrus habitat
will yield an abundance of...

120
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:07,884
Damn it!

121
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,023
Are you kidding me?

122
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,715
Aloha, honey.
What can I get for you?

123
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,410
I guess I'll take a cup of coffee.

124
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:37,390
- You guess?
- Yeah, I already ate breakfast.

125
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:41,122
I need to kill some time before the
Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.

126
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,691
What did you eat?

127
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,593
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
and some Gatorade.

128
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,960
They're not breakfast.
I get you Spam and eggs.

129
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,303
Nick, I need Spam and eggs.

130
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,567
Hey.

131
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:58,207
- You like the peanut butter cups?
- Yes.

132
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:00,812
Want me to put peanut butter cups
in your eggs?

133
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,280
No, that's okay.

134
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,147
Peanut butter cups.

135
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,270
- Hey, Sue, nice haircut.
- Mahalo, Lucy.

136
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:00,973
Are you staring at me or her?

137
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,999
Because you're starting
to freak me out.

138
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:07,412
Settle down and eat your pancakes.

139
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,283
I think she's a local girl.
I wanted to go up to her...

140
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:17,787
...but I was kind of off my game.
But, man, was she cute, though.

141
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:20,050
I thought you liked your bitches
from out of state.

142
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:24,294
Yeah, that's usually my policy.
Make sure I don't get tied down.

143
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:26,932
Freeze that image right there.

144
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:31,335
There's the little fella.
Congratulations, Mommy.

145
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:35,771
Sounds to me like someone
is afraid of commitment.

146
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:37,510
Let me guess.

147
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:40,013
Your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party...

148
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:43,175
...then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team.

149
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:46,748
Close. Actually, it was my
college girlfriend Tracy.

150
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:50,022
And it wasn't a wrestling team.
It was her academic advisor.

151
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:54,084
- Oh, she liked the older man.
- Older women. About 50 years older.

152
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,222
I hope you shot the stupid tramp.

153
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,930
What's with the "tramp"
and the "bitches" talk?

154
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:02,661
- Are you drunk or something?
- I apologize for nasty talk.

155
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,437
I am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy.

156
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:10,441
Shut up, because here comes
one-time-only opportunity.

157
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:14,446
What I will do now is go into
your office and become naked.

158
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,211
Next move is up to you.

159
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:21,486
I may not be as limber
as I once was...

160
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:27,084
...but I make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment.

161
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:31,531
I don't know if you realize,
I'm not into guys.

162
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,085
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.

163
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,748
Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-in-One-Punch.
How you doing?

164
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,785
- You're back.
- Couldn't get enough of that Spam.

165
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,719
Fry some up and throw
some eggs on it.

166
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:02,686
- You got it.
- All right, mahalo.

167
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,428
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Nick.

168
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:22,115
You know, why don't you try this?

169
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:27,746
It's kind of a hinge.

170
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:33,854
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Well, you're too close to the project.

171
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,492
Don't be hard on yourself.

172
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:38,427
Right. Sometimes you need
an outsider's perspective.

173
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,395
Fresh eye never hurts.

174
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,932
I'm Lucy.

175
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,604
Yes. I'm Henry Roth.

176
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:47,504
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:50,735
It's pretty. Keep up the good work.

178
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,979
Wait. I see you're sitting there alone.
Do you wanna come and sit down?

179
00:12:56,684 --> 00:13:00,950
- Sure, that'd be great, if that's all right.
- Okay.

180
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:08,059
- So are you an architect?
- I am not. I'm in fish.

181
00:13:08,195 --> 00:13:10,162
Oh, that's where the smell
is coming from.

182
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:12,859
Yeah, yeah, I was feeding
a walrus this morning...

183
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,034
...and I thought I got most of it
off of me, but guess I didn't.

184
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:20,139
- I love that smell.
- No, you don't.

185
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:23,540
- Fish don't even like that smell.
- No, I do. My dad's a fisherman.

186
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:27,647
He and my brother Doug, they go
out to sea for months at a time.

187
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:31,742
And I miss them so much while they're
gone that when they come back...

188
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,587
...I just hold on to them
for five minutes each.

189
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:43,492
And they smell just like your hands.
It's the best smell in the world.

190
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,028
Well, my fingers are available...

191
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,963
...for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them.

192
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,705
- Wanna?
- Okay.

193
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:04,650
Sea lions are known
for their athleticism...

194
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:07,186
...and dolphins are known
for their intelligence.

195
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:11,724
- Walruses are known for their...
- Tusks?

196
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,698
Their tusks. Also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic.

197
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:22,429
Yeah, yeah, it's the second biggest
out of all the mammals.

198
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,728
- What's the first?
- I think Tattoo-Face.

199
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:32,439
I like your laugh.

200
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,747
I like you making me laugh.

201
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:37,649
I hate to break this up,
but we're setting up for lunch.

202
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,913
Oh, okay. Sorry, Sue.

203
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:45,156
And the real cool thing about walruses
is they're very mysterious.

204
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,522
- Mysterious?
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:50,262
We don't really know what
they're like in the wild.

206
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:53,528
Don't they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

207
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:56,668
All we really see is what they do
outside of the water...

208
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,329
...but who knows what
they do under the ice...

209
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:02,105
...where they spend
two-thirds of their lives.

210
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:07,008
Well, maybe they're intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies.

211
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,975
That is one theory.

212
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:12,649
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

213
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,517
It's my dad's birthday, and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple.

214
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:20,590
- It's a tradition.
- That sounds nice. Okay, well...

215
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,318
...I had a great time.

216
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:24,422
- Me too.
- Okay.

217
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:29,132
Would you like to have breakfast
again tomorrow morning, same time?

218
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,736
- Because I teach an art class at 10.
- Really?

219
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,431
- Yeah.
- I wish I could make it...

220
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,365
...but, yes, I will be there.

221
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:39,005
- Take care.
- Okay.

222
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:42,509
- One for the road. It is fishy.
- Got you good.

223
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:43,748
- Aloha.
- Aloha!

224
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,785
See you tomorrow.

225
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,515
Oh, my God.

226
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,950
Oh, my goodness.

227
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,495
Shit.

228
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,999
I had a bee on me.

229
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,706
- All right.
- He was a big one.

230
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,475
Which means
"look at those two shitheads. "

231
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:26,689
That was the stupidest-looking
swing I've ever seen.

232
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:29,226
I'm gonna take a Molokai
on that one.

233
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:31,864
No throwing. Come on.

234
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,061
Stop laughing, you hyenas.
Let's see what you get.

235
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:37,234
Okay, you heard me. Go! Go!

236
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:38,996
Show papa what you got.

237
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:53,978
- You suck, you're good at everything.
- Father of the Year strikes again.

238
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:59,552
By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blond
tax attorney at Starbucks today.

239
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:03,692
I told her you the kahuna
she wanna have fun on this island.

240
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:05,694
You want her number?

241
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,662
You pimping tourists for me again?

242
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,597
Yes! I live vicariously
through you, remember?

243
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:11,904
My life sucks.

244
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,170
Now, come on. Give her the Waikikiki
sneaky between the cheeky.

245
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:20,880
Ula needs it. I imagine I did it and then
I can get through another weekend.

246
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:23,212
I'm staying in. Sorry.
Thank you, though.

247
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,179
- What?
- Hey, Dad!

248
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,443
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.

249
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:29,012
But your stitches are bleeding.

250
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,221
It must've been my huge back-swing.

251
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,588
You think you can stitch me up
after I get back from surfing?

252
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:40,491
- Yeah, looking forward to it.
- I wouldn't surf with a wound like that.

253
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,832
You might attract a shark.

254
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:44,665
What's wrong with that?
Sharks are naturally peaceful.

255
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:47,964
Is that right?
How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?

256
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,442
A shark bit me.

257
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,443
Nice.

258
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:53,503
Go smoke another one, bro.

259
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:56,176
That shark theory's
starting to catch on.

260
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:57,746
Now, will everybody keep it down...

261
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:00,977
...while I whack the crap
out of this thing?

262
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:08,586
Sit! Stay! Shit! No!

263
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,526
Where the hell is it?

264
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:18,971
Looking for something?

265
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:28,504
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

266
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,678
The same thing you are.
Looking for my ball.

267
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,387
This is weird. I've been thinking
about you all morning, all day.

268
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:38,718
Can't wait to have breakfast
with you again.

269
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:41,995
I know. And I just wanna eat you up.

270
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:45,465
- Really?
- Yeah. Tomorrow and the next day...

271
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:48,433
- ... and the next day and the next day.
- All right. Okay.

272
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,003
Oh, my.

273
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,303
Oh, Lucy, that feels so good.

274
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,944
No, my nipples are too sensitive.
Stop that.

275
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,075
- What happened?
- Your ball hooked into that cart...

276
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:09,920
...bounced back and hit you in
the head. It was freaking hilarious.

277
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:12,047
- What?
- Who's Lucy?

278
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,823
And what's up with your nipples?

279
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:20,431
I can't be falling for a local.
I ain't ever going back to that diner.

280
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:23,331
- This where you got hit?
- Yes!

281
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:33,034
You're so lucky you're a professional
cliff diver in Hawaii.

282
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,571
- Yeah, well, it's a living.
- I'm a tax attorney.

283
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:38,278
- We never get to have any fun.
- Is that right?

284
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:43,921
I'd like to do something
extra fun tonight.

285
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,466
Taking it deep, aren't you?

286
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:03,058
How about another
fishbowl for the lady?

287
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,510
- Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
- Okay.

288
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,081
I think I'm getting kind of drunk.

289
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,812
- Are you getting drunk?
- Getting there.

290
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,384
So, what are you thinking?

291
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:21,218
What am I thinking?

292
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:27,464
Actually, I'm not drunk at all,
Noreen, and neither are you...

293
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,967
...because there's no alcohol
in these drinks.

294
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:34,129
Sadly, I've used this technique
many times.

295
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:36,405
It helps lovely tourists,
such as yourself...

296
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:39,771
...loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake...

297
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:43,173
...and have guilt-free,
vigorous sex with me.

298
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:45,709
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

299
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:49,884
I'm not a cliff diver, either.
I'm afraid of heights.

300
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,648
Well, since it's my last night in town...

301
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,462
...can I pretend you didn't just say that
and still have sex with you anyway?

302
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,794
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

303
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,935
Well, can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can?

304
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:09,198
That guy over there
could help you out.

305
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,739
- Isn't that a woman?
- Jeez, I'm not really sure.

306
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,382
But you're too drunk to notice,
remember? Take care.

307
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:33,188
- Hey, you. Aloha.
- Aloha.

308
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,398
Not aloha, "hello," aloha, "goodbye. "
We're closed today. Go away.

309
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,934
- What are you talking about?
- Order up!

310
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:43,039
- Don't move. I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

311
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:45,872
- Hey! Tattoo-Face!
- Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!

312
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:59,021
Hi.

313
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:00,954
Hi.

314
00:22:01,228 --> 00:22:04,527
My fingers are extra fishy today,
if you care to take a whiff.

315
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:06,994
What was that?

316
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:10,829
I was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time.

317
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,037
Okay, pervert.
I think that you should leave.

318
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:18,439
What? I was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday.

319
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:20,713
Yesterday?

320
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:23,715
I've never even met you.

321
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,345
- Nick! I need help!
- Coming, Lucy.

322
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:29,619
Nick, put that down.
I'll handle it.

323
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:33,055
- You, follow me.
- Wait a... What's going on?

324
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,455
I was kidding around with you!

325
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:39,731
What's happening here?
Is she crazy or something?

326
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:44,635
Lucy is a very special person.
Very different from other people.

327
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:46,738
Okay.

328
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:50,766
About a year ago, Lucy was
in a terrible car accident.

329
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:54,805
She and her father went up
North Shore to get a pineapple.

330
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:36,482
Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy
suffered a serious head injury.

331
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:38,917
She lost her short-term memory.

332
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,521
So she can't remember anything?

333
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:44,490
No, no, no, she has all of her
long-term memory.

334
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,162
That's a different part
of the brain.

335
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,497
Her whole life, up to the night before
the accident, she remembers.

336
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:53,601
She just can't retain
any new information.

337
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,504
It's like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps.

338
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:02,144
Hold on. This sounds like something
I would tell a psycho girl...

339
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,442
...so she'd stop calling me.
Am I the psycho girl?

340
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,751
I wish I was making this up!

341
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:09,617
She has no memory
that she ever met you.

342
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:11,823
What about the
pineapple-picking thing?

343
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:14,258
She says that every day,
because each morning...

344
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:18,160
...she wakes up thinking it's
October 13th of last year.

345
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:21,664
She comes for breakfast because
that's what she did on Sundays...

346
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:23,598
...and October 13th
was a Sunday.

347
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,499
She has no idea
it's more than a year later.

348
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:29,341
She reads the newspaper.

349
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:32,311
It's a special paper her father
puts on their porch.

350
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:35,780
It's from the day of her accident.
He got hundreds of them printed.

351
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:40,979
Lucy does the same thing every day.

352
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,812
- Hello!
- Back here.

353
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,282
- Hi, Dad!
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

354
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,580
You got one without me.

355
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,914
The lady at the farmers' market
gave it to me as a birthday present.

356
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,587
I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

357
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,261
I think she likes you.

358
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,924
- Yeah, what's not to like?
- What about our tradition?

359
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,497
Well, I have another idea.
I painted my workshop yesterday.

360
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,771
White.

361
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,843
Now it's too white.
Gives me a headache.

362
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,539
Oh, yeah, you definitely
need some color in here.

363
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,474
Well, you know,
that's what I was thinking.

364
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,919
- Really?
- Yeah. Go nuts.

365
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,388
- Paint me something for my birthday.
- I will.

366
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,358
And promise that we can pick
a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?

367
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,589
- Sounds great.
- Okay, good.

368
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,331
Hey, you should watch the Vikings
game while I'm painting.

369
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,833
Good idea.

370
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,967
- Yeah, baby. Isolate.
- What are we eating tonight, Doug?

371
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,004
- Spaghetti, Pop.
- Try not to sweat in the sauce.

372
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,949
Sorry, Pop.

373
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,514
Go Vikings.

374
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,826
Seven hundred and five.
Seven hundred and six.

375
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,328
- Seven hundred and seven.
- Hey, you guys.

376
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,626
Hey, sweetie.
How's the painting coming?

377
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,400
- You'll see.
- Cool.

378
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,734
- Oh. What's the score?
- The Vikings are on the two-yard line.

379
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,976
- If they score, they bring it to 14-10.
- Maybe they'll win for your birthday.

380
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,377
And I'll bet Culpepper runs it in.

381
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,814
I'll bet he fakes a handoff to Williams,
throws to Kleinsasser in the end zone.

382
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,782
- Loser does the dishes?
- You're on.

383
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:40,489
...keep the offense on the field.

384
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,525
Culpepper fakes a handoff
to Williams. He will throw.

385
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,529
He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
Touchdown, Minnesota.

386
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,462
Doug, you're good.

387
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,329
Maybe you should be a coach.

388
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,802
- Dad.
- Moron!

389
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,735
That hurt.

390
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,750
And you don't look a day over 25.

391
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,356
Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles
aren't pharmaceutically enhanced.

392
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:19,755
What? I use an herb supplement...

393
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,429
...that can be purchased at any
health-food store. Check this out.

394
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,398
Check out these glutes.
Rock-hard, baby.

395
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,831
Pretty sweet, huh?

396
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,868
Stop it! You're gonna make me
throw up on the cake.

397
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,574
Okay, just open your present.

398
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,476
Okay. Let's see what we've got here.

399
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,342
The Sixth Sense.

400
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,642
Hey! When I'm done doing the dishes,
do you guys wanna watch it?

401
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,518
- Sure.
- Sure.

402
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,817
Ben Friedkin?

403
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,457
Some people, they call me freak.

404
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:57,532
- Ronald Sumner?
- I am. I am a freak. Look at me.

405
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,000
Just give me a chance...

406
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,202
I can't believe it.
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

407
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:10,339
I'm shocked.
Did you see that coming?

408
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,613
- No.
- Not a clue.

409
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,811
- Shocked as hell.
- Anyway, it was awesome.

410
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,085
- Happy birthday.
- Love you, Sis.

411
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,953
Your muscles are getting so big, I can
barely wrap my arms around you.

412
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,920
You like that?
Check this out.

413
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,998
Okay, okay! Enough with the titty
dance! Let your sister go to sleep.

414
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,033
- I like it.
- Sweet dreams, Lucy.

415
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,229
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,951
Hey, Tracy, how you doing?

417
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,190
Yeah?

418
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,217
Well, things changed a little bit
since high school.

419
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,591
And this is what happens
every single day.

420
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,286
How long it gonna take for
her memory to come back?

421
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,096
Her doctors say it may
never come back.

422
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,394
So, basically,
what you're saying is...

423
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,568
- ... she's perfect for you.
- What do you mean?

424
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,469
You can hang out all day with
no attachment, because...

425
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,711
Her plane leaves every night?
There's a problem with that.

426
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,440
- What is?
- It's evil.

427
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:25,508
No, it isn't.

428
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,149
You meet her, hang out, flirt,
no commitment, nobody gets hurt.

429
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:33,244
- She's got brain damage, you psycho.
- Okay, I'll give you that one.

430
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,621
But I think it'd be healthy for you.

431
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,784
You haven't allowed yourself
to connect with a girl.

432
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,286
I appreciate your interest,
but leave me alone.

433
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,788
Hey, you'd be doing exactly
what her father does:

434
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,131
Giving her a wonderful day.

435
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:50,398
When it's time for you to go on your
big boat trip, poof, you just leave.

436
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,570
She'll never even know you're gone.

437
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,176
I'm not sure about the "poofing" part,
because I'm not a good poofer.

438
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,779
Demonstrate a good poof for me?

439
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,476
Quit busting my coconuts
for five seconds.

440
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,218
All right. Would you stop poofing
on that joint and do some work?

441
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,621
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready.

442
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,726
Then we're gonna take her
out for a spin.

443
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,298
Captain's log: November 7th.
Nearly midnight.

444
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,029
The Sea Serpent is fully
recovered from her mishap...

445
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,396
...and ready to once again
brave the open ocean.

446
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,606
I think my stitches
opened up again, cuz.

447
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,076
You got a cat?
Because I feel something licking me.

448
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,826
How is it?

449
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,556
Peanut Butter Cups.
What are you doing here?

450
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:49,729
I just wanted to say hi to Lucy.

451
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,166
I promise you I'm not gonna
do anything wrong.

452
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,598
What did Sue say?

453
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,399
She said that if I talk to Lucy,
you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.

454
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:02,367
She's the boss, cuz.
But don't worry.

455
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,812
Lucy probably didn't wanna
talk to you anyway.

456
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,850
- What does that mean?
- This ain't a disco.

457
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,820
She doesn't want guys hitting on her
during her breakfast.

458
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,855
She does if it's Henry Roth.

459
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,585
- Who that?
- Who that? Me that.

460
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,851
I bet you 20 bucks I can get her
to have breakfast with me again.

461
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,866
- You're on.
- I love it.

462
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,804
- How you doing, honey?
- Hey, Sue. Nice haircut.

463
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,807
Oh, mahalo.
See you in a bit.

464
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,970
Nick and I have an arrangement.
You can trust me.

465
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,313
Don't worry.

466
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,871
You should try this out.
Put it in there.

467
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,101
Swivelly door.

468
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,842
Waffleonians can
come in and out now.

469
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,143
Are you from a country where it's
okay to stick your fingers...

470
00:33:13,178 --> 00:33:14,541
...all over someone else's food?

471
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,182
No, I'm from this country.

472
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,854
Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.

473
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,221
All right, well, have a good meal.

474
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,659
- Yeah.
- That was pathetic.

475
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,026
Yeah? Why don't you choke
on your Spam?

476
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,403
Double or nothing tomorrow.

477
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,277
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...

478
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,348
...but you look like a person
who appreciates fine art...

479
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,213
...so I wanted your opinion.

480
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:56,948
I drew this. It's a picture of a father
and son fishing off a fishing boat.

481
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,654
There's a walrus right there...

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,026
Oh, you don't speak English. Okay.

483
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,531
Doesn't look Chinese.

484
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:14,635
Forty.

485
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,877
Can I have that?

486
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,847
I need something
to wipe my ass with.

487
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,348
Shut up.

488
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,477
I wonder what's the matter with him.

489
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,571
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

490
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,149
Excuse me. Okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.

491
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,083
- No, that's all right. I...
- Are you okay?

492
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,358
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm having
a problem with something...

493
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,428
Something that I could help you with?

494
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,362
No, no, no. I just...

495
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,502
...can't read.

496
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,538
You gotta be kidding me.

497
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,598
- I can read that for you.
- No. Thank you.

498
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,839
I can do this on my own.

499
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,045
Appreciate the sentiment.

500
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,674
I'm gonna get an order of the...

501
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,719
Pan...

502
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,756
Pan...

503
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,412
Panku...

504
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:45,726
Ca...

505
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,660
Panclocks.

506
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,766
- Pancakes.
- Okay, I'll have pancake.

507
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,473
- Pancakes.
- Pancah... Pancakes! Pancakes!

508
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,208
- I'm so stupid!
- Oh, don't cry.

509
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,808
- Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- Don't cry.

510
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,879
- I don't know anything!
- What a loser.

511
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,919
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you sit with me?

512
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,651
You can have some breakfast and
I'll help teach you some of the words.

513
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,925
- Okay.
- All right.

514
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,030
- That sounds nice.
- Come on over.

515
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,157
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

516
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,473
So I comes before the E?

517
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,941
- Except after C?
- Yes.

518
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,944
Okay, and C is that little
half a squiggly one, right?

519
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,276
- Yes.
- I think I'm getting it.

520
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:39,143
- How'd you get so good at teaching?
- I'm a teacher. I do it all the time.

521
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,953
I'm an art teacher at
the Haluki-liki Junior High.

522
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:46,219
Well, you Haluki-liki the kind of
teacher all the kids have crushes on.

523
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,153
I know I would if I was in your class.

524
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,499
Okay.

525
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,298
Oh, boy, do my...
My fingers smell like fish.

526
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,504
That doesn't gross you out, does it?

527
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,438
No, not at all.

528
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,508
Really?

529
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,208
If Lucy gets hurt, I'm gonna chop you
with the meat cleaver.

530
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,777
Okay, okay.

531
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,315
So I had a nice time.

532
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,806
- Yeah, me too.
- Thank you very much.

533
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:18,922
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,753
Sure.

535
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,994
Okay.

536
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:34,699
I just want to eat you up, tomorrow
and the next day, next day, next day...

537
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,146
I'll see you around.

538
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,909
Okay.

539
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,152
Really? That's it?

540
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,952
- That's what?
- All that flirting...

541
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,683
...and phony "I can't read" stuff,
and you're not gonna ask me out...

542
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,059
...or for my phone number?

543
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,528
- I can't read.
- Oh, shut up.

544
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,065
That was one of the goofiest things
I've ever seen, but I thought:

545
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,069
"Hey, if this guy is so desperate
to meet me...

546
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,605
...he might be worth talking to. "

547
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,538
But then I get stiffed.

548
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,904
No, no, no,
this is what happened. I...

549
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,078
Mahalo for the ego boost.

550
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,343
- You're right. You're right. I feel like...
- No worries.

551
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,777
I gotta...
I can read a little!

552
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,713
I didn't know I came before E!
That one I didn't know, I swear.

553
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,589
Oh, you idiot.

554
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,921
I hope you're happy, Shamu.

555
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,791
Marlin. It's Sue.

556
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:49,445
- Oh, aloha, sir. My name's Henry...
- I know who you are.

557
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,256
- I want to apologize to your daughter.
- Not gonna happen.

558
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,781
She's inside.
We're gonna straighten things out.

559
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:00,091
Dad, the damn mongoose
got in the garbage again!

560
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,289
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

561
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,064
Mr. Roth, I have one simple request:

562
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,930
Stay away from my daughter.

563
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,866
Absolutely. I hurt her feelings
and don't want it to end like that.

564
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:14,105
It's gonna end like this.

565
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,801
Calm down, little fellow.

566
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,544
I'm gonna kill you! You're a dead man.
Okay, I'm calm.

567
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,408
I'm calm.

568
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,150
- Let me help you up.
- I got it! I got it.

569
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,815
It's just Dad and I work too hard
to protect Lucy to let some idiot ruin it.

570
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,293
I know what you guys do
and I totally respect that.

571
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,059
If you know her condition, you know
she can't have a normal relationship.

572
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,459
The next morning,
she won't know who he is.

573
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,927
And any guy who's okay with that...

574
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,326
...ain't okay with me.

575
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,797
- I'm not looking for a one-night stand.
- Anything with Lucy is, numb-nuts.

576
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,505
Give us a break.
Just stay away from the Hukilau Cafe.

577
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,315
My daughter's been through enough.

578
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,511
Okay. I'm sorry.

579
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,554
I could have whooped his ass,
but this gravel, I slipped on it...

580
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,761
Yeah, well, maybe you need to do
a few more butt flexes.

581
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,831
Cheap shot, Dad.

582
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,333
So fresh and so clean.

583
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,462
Hey, Alexa, did you hook up
with that girl from the bar?

584
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,838
- I chickened out.
- Really?

585
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,865
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I prefer sausage to taco.

586
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,062
- What?
- Yeah. No, I agree, buddy.

587
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:27,747
Get out of here.
Run for the hills.

588
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,681
Let me ask you something, Alexa.

589
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,878
If you promised a girl's dad
that you wouldn't see her...

590
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,187
...would you consider that
a binding promise?

591
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,858
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

592
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,589
Then again, there are always ways
around such things.

593
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,659
- Like?
- For example...

594
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:47,164
...if I promised a woman's father
I would not see her...

595
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,271
...I would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood.

596
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,502
That's actually a cool way to look at it.

597
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,208
And a very gross way.

598
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,364
He asked me not to go to the Hukilau.
I'm not going there.

599
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,490
I'm not doing anything wrong.

600
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,636
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind of stuck here.

601
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,913
- Car trouble?
- Yeah. You mind giving me a jump?

602
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,881
Okay.

603
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,610
Appreciate your time.

604
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,646
Not everybody would have stopped.

605
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,978
- You're real sweet.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

606
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,452
I can't believe you fell for that.

607
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,559
Well, my grandfather died
trying to jump-start a car.

608
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,964
I'm sorry.
I was just joking around.

609
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,376
I can't believe you fell for that!

610
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,174
Oh, my God.

611
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,947
That was very good.

612
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,143
- My name's Henry.
- I'm Lucy.

613
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,612
Nice to meet you.
You look like a nice...

614
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,826
Hi. Sorry for the delay.
Should be a few minutes.

615
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,464
- No problem. No worries.
- Where you coming from?

616
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,626
Breakfast?

617
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,434
- Yeah.
- How was it?

618
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,300
I had waffles. They were delicious.

619
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,871
I like making little houses
out of waffles.

620
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,342
- You do?
- That's my thing.

621
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,879
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

622
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,346
Hi, I'm Henry.

623
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,509
Okay, pal. When she stops,
just let her pet you. Look cute.

624
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,183
Go to the middle of the road.
Thank you. Right there. Perfect.

625
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,397
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes. Smile.

626
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,060
Where is she?

627
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,406
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

628
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,410
Okay. That didn't work.

629
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,414
Shit your pants? So did I.

630
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,023
Okay, this is her.
Start beating me up.

631
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,718
Make it look good.

632
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,689
Give me your wallet!

633
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,158
Okay, haole, what do you think?
You can come to this island...

634
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,469
- ... eat our pineapple...
- Help me! Not so hard.

635
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,704
- Take it easy.
- Try to bang our women.

636
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:39,837
Making my sister
clean your hotel room.

637
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,373
Okay. What's that have to do
with this? Relax.

638
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,069
- Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
- Stupid haole!

639
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,278
Yeah, that's right. Take that!
And that! And that!

640
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,052
And that! And that!

641
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,350
You got him. You got him.
Enough. Enough.

642
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,886
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes...

643
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,580
Okay, I'll be back.
Come here!

644
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,719
No, no! I think he's had enough.

645
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,153
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,327
My eye!

647
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,831
- You got him!
- Not good enough!

648
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,069
Oh, Kamehameha!

649
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,163
He learned his lesson!

650
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,666
- What's your name?
- My name's Henry.

651
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,940
- You did good.
- Hi. Sorry.

652
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,840
I'm in a community-watch program...

653
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,995
Oh, you crazy bitch!

654
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,878
Yeah, keep running!

655
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,517
Okay, okay, he's... He's gone now.

656
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,957
Not her. False alarm.

657
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,226
Don't worry, I called the cops already.
I'm all set.

658
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,729
Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?

659
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,575
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

660
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,170
When you're finished playing your
kidnap-victim crap on my daughter...

661
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:52,374
...come by the house.

662
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,741
Okay.

663
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,182
Oh, boy.

664
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,430
There's something I wanna show you.

665
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,773
We figured it out. She only sings
on days she meets you.

666
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,150
You're kidding me. That song?

667
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,617
That's Mom and Dad's song.

668
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,712
When her mom was alive,
Lucy would have me take that tape...

669
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,606
- ... on every fishing trip I went on.
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:45:36,641 --> 00:45:39,024
Yeah, she knew it would make me
miss her mom...

671
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,957
...and want to come home sooner.

672
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:45,360
I'm seeing a new side to you, sir.
I gotta tell you, it's grossing me out.

673
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,533
Let me ask you something.

674
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,935
What's in it for you?
What do you get out of this?

675
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,040
I don't know.

676
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,740
Wouldn't you want to spend
an hour a day with that?

677
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:05,551
Actually, no. She sings like shit.

678
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,689
- What?
- Can I ask you guys something?

679
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,557
What'll happen down the line?
Someday she'll wake up...

680
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,924
...look in the mirror and notice
she aged 10 years overnight.

681
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,197
You know something, Henry?

682
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,030
I worry about that
every damn day of my life.

683
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,730
Pardon me.

684
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,836
Sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we
were both eating alone...

685
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,703
...and I thought I could sit with you,
maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi...

686
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,980
- ... for your waffle house?
- Oh, that would be nice...

687
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,550
...but I have a boyfriend.

688
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,780
So I'm sorry.

689
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,125
You're making up a boyfriend
to get rid of me?

690
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,660
No, I'm not.

691
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,856
What's his name, then?

692
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,027
Ringo.

693
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,325
Is his last name Starr?

694
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,761
- No. McCartney.
- McCartney, okay.

695
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,103
- Oh, no.
- All right. I'm sorry.

696
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,674
No! This cop is writing me a ticket!

697
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,268
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go out there.

698
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,678
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Go on!

699
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,146
I'm coming.

700
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,273
The tags don't expire
for seven months.

701
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,082
- They expired May of this year.
- No! No, no!

702
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,754
They expire May of next year.

703
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,280
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

704
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,020
- I don't.
- This is ridiculous.

705
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,523
I'm not paying for this!
It's October!

706
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,264
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Look, October!

707
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,163
Lucy, let's go back inside.

708
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,030
What?

709
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,303
What?

710
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,948
Having a bad day, Doug!

711
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,127
Sweetheart...

712
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,630
...these are from the accident.

713
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,616
Oh, no!

714
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,296
I can feel it.

715
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,927
You were in the hospital
for three months, sweetheart.

716
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:26,115
I have to talk to this doctor.
I need to hear it from him.

717
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,412
You have heard it, sweetie.
Many times.

718
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,824
I have?

719
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,986
I'll take her.

720
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,093
I have to hear for myself too.

721
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,140
Doug, just take this, okay?
I can't...

722
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:54,609
I can't look at it anymore.

723
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,079
- It's gonna be all right, Luce.
- Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.

724
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,684
Sweetie, you're sort of dating him.

725
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,324
Sorry I'm not better-looking.

726
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,090
What else happened
since last October?

727
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:14,265
- What about my students?
- Miss Campbell took over your class.

728
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,907
- Did Alicia marry that guy?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,341
Doug, did you win
the Mr. Hawaii contest?

730
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,775
I didn't know there was gonna be
a urine test.

731
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,708
Wow.

732
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,348
Do we have sex?

733
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,854
No, we don't.
Just so everybody knows that.

734
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,219
We want to.

735
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,188
Just kidding.

736
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,696
So you guys have to just lie
to me every day.

737
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,643
Hey, Lucy.
Good to see you again.

738
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,614
What the hell's her problem?

739
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,549
She doesn't remember
who you are, brah.

740
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:13,391
Oh, yeah.

741
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,292
I suck at this job.

742
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,967
Lucy, these are your
brain scans here.

743
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,281
I'm afraid they show
no improvement.

744
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:24,528
The temporal lobe
was severely damaged.

745
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,008
What we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability...

746
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,706
...to convert short-term memory into
long-term memory while you sleep.

747
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,811
The condition's come to be known
as Goldfield Syndrome.

748
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,247
- Who's Goldfield?
- A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.

749
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,520
He himself suffered
temporal-lobe damage.

750
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,648
Took him four years
to publish his findings...

751
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,720
...because he had to keep
starting over from scratch.

752
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,428
Obviously, your sense of humor
is still intact, and that's here.

753
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,327
Magnificent amygdala as well.

754
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,467
- Doctor, I have a question.
- I'd be happy to answer it...

755
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,972
...but as I've told you before, this is a
hygienic facility. Shirts are required.

756
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,507
- Oh, okay.
- Nice move.

757
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,272
Listen, doctor, this...

758
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:08,208
...friend of mine's been experimenting
a little with steroids.

759
00:52:08,243 --> 00:52:09,948
He's been having a lot
of wet dreams.

760
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,610
Could there be a connection
between them?

761
00:52:12,645 --> 00:52:14,418
Douglas, get off the juice.

762
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,615
As for the nocturnal emissions,
why don't you take a swim...

763
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,961
...buy a shirt with no holes,
find a wahine and take her to dinner.

764
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,292
I'll tell my friend you said so.

765
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,830
In any case, Lucy,
your condition is stable...

766
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,695
...but most likely permanent.

767
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,039
I'm so sorry, dear.

768
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,802
But it could be worse.

769
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,975
Yeah? How?

770
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,945
I think you should meet
Ten Second Tom.

771
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,762
Callahan Institute is the leading
brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.

772
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,384
We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio
by T.B. Callahan...

773
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,887
...the automotive-components tycoon
and philanthropist.

774
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,155
And now, I would like
to introduce to you...

775
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,466
...our most distinguished
clinical subject...

776
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,035
...Tom.

777
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,730
- Hi. I'm Tom.
- Henry.

778
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:05,867
- Marlin.
- Doug.

779
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,369
- Lucy.
- Hi.

780
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,803
Cool flip-flops.
Where'd you get them?

781
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,171
You like those? It's interesting.
I was on the North Shore...

782
00:53:13,206 --> 00:53:14,376
Hi, I'm Tom.

783
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,118
- Henry.
- Hi.

784
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,143
- Marlin.
- Tom lost part of his brain...

785
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,350
...in a hunting accident.
His memory lasts 10 seconds.

786
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,124
I was in an accident? That's terrible.

787
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,286
Don't worry.
You'll get over it in seconds.

788
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,119
Get over it? I mean, what happened?
Did I get shot in the brain...?

789
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,395
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

790
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,929
- Hi.
- Doug.

791
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,397
- Hey.
- Marlin.

792
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,195
Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?

793
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,735
Don't you think you're a little old
to still have wet dreams?

794
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,015
- They liked that.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

795
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,517
- Yeah, watch yourself, Tom.
- Easy.

796
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,101
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- All right. Good night.

797
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,798
Good night, you guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

798
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,302
- And I guess I'll see you too?
- Oh, yeah.

799
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,770
You had a rough day today.
I'm sorry.

800
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:20,908
I hope you get some rest tonight.

801
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,183
Okay.

802
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,685
Good night.

803
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,482
So how you getting home?

804
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,814
- You gonna take the Likelike or...
- Hey.

805
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,956
Thank you for being
so nice to me today.

806
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,789
- Sure.
- I don't want you to...

807
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:38,426
...strike out tomorrow.

808
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,598
So maybe you could talk
to me about...

809
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,498
...lilies.

810
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,965
Lilies?

811
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,968
I'm a sucker for lilies.

812
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,868
Thanks for the tip.

813
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,075
Good night.

814
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,713
My, oh, my.

815
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,739
- Lover-boy.
- Yes, sir.

816
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,446
You don't have to rush off.
Stick around.

817
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,221
You've earned yourself
a couple beers.

818
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,884
So what'll you do when
you finish the boat?

819
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:06,624
Actually, I'm going on a trip soon...

820
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,161
...to study undersea
Pacific walrus behaviors.

821
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,595
Sounds kind of fruity.

822
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,995
- Thank you.
- How long is it gonna take?

823
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,496
About a year.

824
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,600
Guess you won't miss days like this.

825
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,968
Well, maybe days like this
don't have to be so bad.

826
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,106
What are you trying to say?

827
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,643
When you guys tell her...

828
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,697
...she's not just finding out
about the accident.

829
00:55:27,732 --> 00:55:30,615
She's finding out that her life
is basically a setup.

830
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,753
I think that freaks her out the most.

831
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,186
- You're an expert now?
- No.

832
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,223
I'm saying I wish there was
another way besides:

833
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,989
"Sorry we couldn't trick you today.
Here's pictures of your broken head. "

834
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,662
- You want a broken head?
- You'll give him one?

835
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,959
No, Daddy, I thought
you was gonna do it.

836
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,065
Nobody's gotta break my head.
I'm gonna split anyways.

837
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,771
Oh, don't go just because
my son is psychotic.

838
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:55,105
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Keep them dry there, Doug.

839
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,607
Very funny.

840
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,495
- Excuse me. Lucy Whitmore?
- Yes?

841
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,736
I have a delivery for you.

842
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,500
- A delivery for me?
- Yes.

843
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,141
Oh, they're beautiful.

844
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,246
- Who are they from?
- That I can't tell you.

845
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,978
It's a secret admirer.
He also wants you to have this.

846
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,686
- Who's your friend, Lucy?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

847
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,154
We just met, but look.

848
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,190
I have a secret admirer.

849
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,989
Oh, really? What's this?

850
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,854
It's a videotape.

851
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,833
A videotape of what?

852
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,028
I have no idea.

853
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,167
But I have to find out.

854
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,863
Happy birthday, Daddy.

855
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,900
- Thank you, sweetie.
- That's right. Happy birthday, sir.

856
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:04,811
- What are you, 200 today?
- That's cute.

857
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,406
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to try something different.

858
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:10,817
If it doesn't work,
we've only wasted one day.

859
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,168
Martha Stewart faced charges...

860
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,308
Oh, God!

861
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,646
Okay, I think it's on. Go. Go.

862
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,114
Aloha! I'm Henry Roth.

863
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:27,452
We met here at the Hukilau Cafe
about a year after your accident.

864
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,488
I like you and you like me, most days.

865
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:34,230
Every day is different, but basically
this is what happens, Lucy.

866
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,902
Kikikoloko, take the camera.

867
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,232
- I got it.
- Don't drop it.

868
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,497
Okay, all right.
Here we are, right here.

869
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,306
The part of you in this reenactment...

870
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:44,638
...will be played
by my good friend, Ula.

871
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,040
Aloha. Sorry about your brain.

872
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,382
I had a accident too.

873
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,386
Believe it or not, this my good eye.

874
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,216
- We ready?
- Yeah.

875
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,187
Hi. I like that waffle teepee
that you have built.

876
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:03,396
Oh! So nice of you to notice.
Please, sit down.

877
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,466
I would love to.

878
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,162
My name is Henry, by the way.

879
00:59:08,197 --> 00:59:09,902
My name is Lucy.

880
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,029
Smell my fingers?

881
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,066
Fish. Right on.

882
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,502
So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium.

883
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,481
Aquariums make me super horny.

884
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,178
That's not funny.
Don't rub those.

885
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,510
Sorry, Mr. Whitmore,
if you're watching.

886
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,580
It's very late,
and my friend's unstable.

887
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,719
Come on, stop with the licking!
You're making me sick.

888
00:59:31,754 --> 00:59:33,050
Lucy, I'm sorry.

889
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:38,056
Anyways, I know you wish I was
making all this stuff up.

890
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:40,193
I wish I was too.

891
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,002
But the good news is...

892
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,198
...so many people out there
care about you:

893
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,203
Your dad and Doug and a couple
of your friends here at the Hukilau...

894
00:59:49,238 --> 00:59:50,704
...who have a message for you.

895
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:54,981
Lucy, as you know,
your mother and I were best friends.

896
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:00,111
That's why I promised her that
I would always help look after you.

897
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:05,025
Sometimes life isn't very fair...

898
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,584
...but we still have you.

899
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,966
Oh, and if you're wondering about
this guy who's making this tape...

900
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,197
...he's okay.

901
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,235
Hey, Lucy. Just so you know,
since you lost your memory...

902
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,272
...I became governor of Hawaii.

903
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,945
No, just kidding. I'm too smart.

904
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:33,019
Kualaliku! Get your brother
off the dishwasher!

905
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,114
So whenever you're ready,
we'd all love to talk to you...

906
01:00:37,149 --> 01:00:39,025
...and answer any questions
you have...

907
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,926
...and you're the best, Lucy. Aloha.

908
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,636
How many times
have I watched this?

909
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,581
This is the first time.

910
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,454
Okay, she cried for about an hour.
That's not too bad.

911
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:13,219
I bet in another hour she'll be ready
to see her friends, have lunch...

912
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,856
...get her life back.

913
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,063
We could do this every day.

914
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,329
We'll leave it up to her.

915
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,160
All right.

916
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,836
So how's the cow?

917
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:32,374
Same as you. Every day they
have to convince her she's a cow.

918
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,847
Wow, look. The bark is healing.

919
01:01:39,882 --> 01:01:41,713
You're gonna get there.

920
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,818
I never hung out with you
in the afternoon like this.

921
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,627
In this lighting, man, oh, man,
you look...

922
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,789
...disgusting.

923
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,825
Yeah.

924
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:57,001
I don't know how you get me to fall for
that egg-shaped head every morning.

925
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,106
All I have to do is slide on
my designer jeans...

926
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,701
...and just kind of wiggle
in front of you. You go nuts.

927
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,842
Why couldn't I have met you one day
before the accident?

928
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:12,812
Don't worry, because if you hung out
with me for more than one day...

929
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,154
...you'd realize I'm a bore.

930
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,384
- Oh, well, I have news for you.
- Yes?

931
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,626
It takes less than one day.

932
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,685
You know something?
That hurt.

933
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,597
Your damaged temporal lobe
is causing me pain...

934
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,030
...and I'm gonna get you for that.

935
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,136
Now you're dead!

936
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,886
- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- I know.

937
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:55,252
- And I got her on the first try.
- Yeah. Easy.

938
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:57,026
And, Tammy, you are so thin.

939
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,562
Thanks, Luce.

940
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,530
And I'm so glad you finally got...

941
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,932
...that gender-reassignment surgery,
Jennifer. I mean, Jonathan.

942
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,899
Mahalo.

943
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,265
- Here you go, Lucy.
- Thank you.

944
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,710
- You're welcome.
- You must be Lucy's friend.

945
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:14,237
- The one who made the tape.
- I think he's more than my friend.

946
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,716
- You're my boyfriend, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

947
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,447
So every day you help her
to realize what happened...

948
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,518
...and you wait patiently for her
to be okay with it...

949
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,816
...then get her to fall in love
with you again?

950
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,521
Yes, ma'am.

951
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,990
You asshole!

952
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:32,323
You don't even open the fricking car
door for me anymore.

953
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,632
You're in trouble.

954
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,397
I gotta go tinkle.

955
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:45,268
Okay, so tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

956
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,338
Okay. Well, I've...

957
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,979
...won over seven all-you-can-eat
chicken-wing contests.

958
01:03:51,014 --> 01:03:52,912
- Really?
- Yes.

959
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,313
And I'm a ballet dancer,
but only in my bathroom.

960
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,225
No, what do you want to know?

961
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,353
Do you love me?

962
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,665
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

963
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,566
I was just asking more for
informational purposes.

964
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,137
It's to keep the video as up-to-date
as possible.

965
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,968
Sure.

966
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:19,746
Well, love is a very loaded word.

967
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,307
Let's see. I...

968
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:30,121
I go to this restaurant every morning,
and I see you there, reading.

969
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,690
And...

970
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,354
I love you very much.

971
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,960
Probably more than anybody could
love another person.

972
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,467
And how do I feel about you?

973
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,810
You're excited about
the chicken-wing thing.

974
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,142
And...

975
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,544
...you've been dying to make out
with me for some time now.

976
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,852
Feeling better now?

977
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,697
Nothing beats a first kiss.

978
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:23,502
There's nothing like a first kiss.

979
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,027
Nothing beats a first kiss.

980
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,563
That's what I've heard.

981
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,536
Nothing beats a first...

982
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,185
What are you doing?

983
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,915
Nothing. I was just getting
some lint off for you.

984
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,895
You were going for a feelski!

985
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:19,832
All right, I'm sorry, but this is like the
23rd time we've made out already...

986
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,924
...and they're getting blue.

987
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,904
I know. I know.

988
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,840
I mean, I really don't know.

989
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,877
For me, it still feels like the first time.

990
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,640
Okay, let's average it out then.

991
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,882
It's the 23rd time for me
and the first time for you.

992
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,282
- That's about our 12th time.
- Yeah?

993
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:41,421
Now, Hawaiian law clearly states
after the 12th date...

994
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,187
...I'm entitled to unlimited
boob access.

995
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,260
Why didn't I meet you one day
before the accident?

996
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:53,831
You say that all the time.

997
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,936
You want to meet a friend of mine?

998
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,532
All right.

999
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:06,207
Jocko, this is Lucy.
Lucy, this is Jocko.

1000
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,007
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1001
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,510
He is awesome! He is so smart.

1002
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:18,220
Check this out. Jocko, what does
the teapot do when the water's ready?

1003
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,395
- Very good.
- Can I ask him a question?

1004
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:25,055
Go ahead.

1005
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,160
Jocko...

1006
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:31,198
...do you think that Henry and I
are ready to take our relationship...

1007
01:07:31,233 --> 01:07:32,802
...to the next level?

1008
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:36,271
You sure about that?

1009
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,741
Do you think I should bring him
into the other room...

1010
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,448
...and take advantage of him?

1011
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:50,319
I saw that hand gesture.

1012
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:52,492
- And I'm glad you did it.
- Really?

1013
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,007
- Use that.
- Oh, wow. Look!

1014
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,269
- Yeah.
- They're...

1015
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,976
They're nodding in approval, I hope.

1016
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,411
They like you. Let me get them
out of there.

1017
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:16,664
Mary-Kate, Ashley, get a life.
Thank you. Sorry.

1018
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:19,781
- Oh, they're very nice, though.
- Yeah, so are you.

1019
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,181
Let me get you down slow.

1020
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,990
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1021
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:51,017
All right, I just wrote this,
so go easy on me.

1022
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,715
The Hukilau was the place

1023
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,525
Where I first saw your face

1024
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,223
We liked each other right away

1025
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,230
But you didn't remember me
The very next day

1026
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:15,074
Forgetful Lucy

1027
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,670
Has got a nice caboose-y

1028
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:24,312
I used to trick you into pulling
Your car over so we could chat

1029
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:28,987
But my favorite time was when you
Beat the shit out of Ula with a bat

1030
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:33,059
And we drove up to see Dr. Keats

1031
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,994
And found out why Doug always
Has to change his sheets

1032
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:42,601
Forgetful Lucy

1033
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:47,130
Cracked her head like Gary Busey

1034
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:50,405
But I still love her so

1035
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:54,910
And I'll never let her go

1036
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,916
Even if while I'm singing this song

1037
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,953
She's wishing I had
Jocko the Walrus' schlong

1038
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:10,062
Forgetful Lucy

1039
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:14,964
Her lips are so damn juicy

1040
01:10:14,999 --> 01:10:19,264
How about another first kiss

1041
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,810
Can't fall asleep.

1042
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,154
I'm not sleeping.

1043
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,986
I'm just closing my eyes.

1044
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,421
Well, I'm gonna go downstairs then.

1045
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:43,891
No, no. I'm just resting.

1046
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:47,291
Lucy.

1047
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:49,168
Yeah.

1048
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,194
Will you marry me?

1049
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:02,079
- Of course.
- Good.

1050
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:05,310
Don't forget about me.

1051
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,085
Never.

1052
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,672
Good morning.

1053
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,475
Oh, shit!

1054
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:36,909
- Help! Help!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lucy.

1055
01:11:36,944 --> 01:11:39,583
Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey.

1056
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,983
I know this is hard for you
to understand...

1057
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,588
...but we are actually
seeing each other.

1058
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,589
We have been for a while now.

1059
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:47,988
Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

1060
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,423
If I was lying,
how would I know this?

1061
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:53,927
You're an art teacher and you go
to the Hukilau every Sunday...

1062
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,829
...and you make waffle houses
and you like Casablanca lilies.

1063
01:11:57,864 --> 01:12:01,138
- Stalker!
- No, don't you remember me a little?

1064
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:11,012
I may not be able to kick your ass,
but my sister can.

1065
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,547
Thanks, buddy.

1066
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,550
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up,
but she'll be okay.

1067
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:17,620
She's watching the tape as we speak.

1068
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,758
How's my temporal lobe
looking there, doc?

1069
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:23,194
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer
any short-term memory loss.

1070
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,732
But was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you?

1071
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,133
Don't make fun of Henry.
It's not his fault it's shaped like that.

1072
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:33,671
Note the intense overreaction.
That's the "roids" talking.

1073
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:37,504
- Doug, once again, off the juice.
- It's not juice.

1074
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,642
It's a protein shake.

1075
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:43,647
Henry, the boys tell me you're setting
sail for Alaska to study walruses.

1076
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:46,615
- When does that adventure begin?
- That actually began...

1077
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,847
...ten years ago. That's when I started
planning and building my boat.

1078
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:55,455
All I know is, out of all mammals,
they have the second-largest penis.

1079
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,388
I have the first.

1080
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,665
That's my joke.

1081
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,632
Did you tell Lucy about this trip?

1082
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,805
Well...

1083
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:09,707
...actually, there's nothing to tell
because I decided not to go.

1084
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,640
I mean, Lucy needs me here.

1085
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:15,042
I'm just worried about
going away for a year...

1086
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,647
...and ruining all the progress
she's made.

1087
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,341
I know you think I'm crazy...

1088
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,116
...but I think deep down inside...

1089
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:24,847
- ... she's starting to remember me.
- No, Henry.

1090
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:28,419
That's what you want to believe.
It's what we all want to believe.

1091
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,830
But it's never gonna happen.

1092
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,995
Okay. I gotta go to work.

1093
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:40,755
Will you tell her I'll be back later
to pick her up?

1094
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:43,639
See you, guys. Don't tell anyone
your sister beat me up.

1095
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:48,109
He could go to the moon and back and
Lucy would never even know he left.

1096
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,545
Sometimes I wish my wife
had Goldfield Syndrome.

1097
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,854
That way she wouldn't remember
when I called her mother...

1098
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:59,689
...a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face
like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.

1099
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:05,023
All right. There's your medicine,
little fellow.

1100
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,095
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool!

1101
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:12,532
If that's one of your special brownies,
don't let any of the dolphins eat that.

1102
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:16,342
How do you think I get them to
double flip and play with white kids?

1103
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,244
Okay, Willie, that's it.

1104
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,009
This time try to stay clean
for more than a day.

1105
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,613
I made you a nice anchovy sundae.

1106
01:14:26,648 --> 01:14:28,285
Okay, enjoy that.

1107
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:30,389
Henry?

1108
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:33,154
- Hey!
- How's your head?

1109
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:36,590
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

1110
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,955
What brings your royal cuteness
out here?

1111
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,331
I needed to see you.

1112
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:42,424
Okay. What you got there?

1113
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:45,598
It's my journal. I write in it every night.

1114
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,703
- Oh, you don't like the video?
- No, I love it.

1115
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:53,311
It's just sometimes when I watch it,
I feel like I'm being told about my life...

1116
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,915
...from someone else.
And when I read this...

1117
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,679
...it's like I'm telling myself.

1118
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:00,476
When did you start this up?

1119
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,888
Right after you gave me the video.

1120
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:05,288
- Really?
- I was so nervous to come here...

1121
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,792
...and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day.

1122
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,523
Well, you probably thought
I couldn't live up to the hype.

1123
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:16,163
No. I was nervous because...

1124
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:20,736
Because I came here
to break up with you.

1125
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:25,944
You had plans and a life...

1126
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,709
...before you met me
and now all you have time for...

1127
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:31,280
...is to make me fall in love with you.

1128
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:34,420
That's not all I do.
I gave a penguin a bath today.

1129
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,425
Which I'll have to do again tomorrow.

1130
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:44,123
I look at my dad and my brother's
lives and I won't do that to you.

1131
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:48,867
What do you want me to do? Be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go?

1132
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,469
No.

1133
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:57,933
My plan is to erase you completely,
so it's as if you never existed.

1134
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:02,140
Why are you doing this?

1135
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:07,282
Because you have to understand
that there is no future with me.

1136
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:12,618
Don't you want to have a career
and marriage and children?

1137
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:15,221
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.

1138
01:16:15,256 --> 01:16:16,859
Kids? Yeah, I'd love to do it.

1139
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:20,898
But how is that going to work?

1140
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:25,300
I'm gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory...

1141
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:26,836
...of how it happened?

1142
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,943
I have to make a new journal
that doesn't have you in it.

1143
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,842
But before I do...

1144
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:36,777
...I really want you to read
what I wrote about you.

1145
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,915
I will read about it tomorrow...

1146
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:42,146
...when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff, okay?

1147
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:45,957
I'm not going to forget it.
I wrote it down. I won't let myself.

1148
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:49,028
And I'm gonna do it whether
you want me to or not.

1149
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,861
I'll be at my house.

1150
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,268
Okay, type this one in there.

1151
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,339
Saturday, November 25th.

1152
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:09,379
I drove out to Callahan Institute today
and had a talk with Dr. Keats.

1153
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,880
There's one about me.

1154
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:16,283
Reminder: He makes funny noises
when I kiss his neck.

1155
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,057
I'm gonna miss that.

1156
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,287
You sure you don't want me
to put that in?

1157
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:32,070
- We can skip that one.
- No, let me read it.

1158
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:36,371
We made love tonight! It didn't
last long, but it was incredible.

1159
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:43,515
It's not all about how long you go. It's...
There was a connection, I thought.

1160
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,847
Actually, let's just rip that out.

1161
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,009
Well, that's that.

1162
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,678
Henry, wait!

1163
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:30,653
Could I have one last first kiss?

1164
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:46,263
- I ain't gonna do this, Marlin.
- You have to, Henry.

1165
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,867
I'm gonna miss you, but I gotta
get the hell off this island.

1166
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,300
I'm sorry I can't take you...

1167
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:28,805
...but you've lived here so long you're
too big of a pansy to defend yourself.

1168
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:33,980
I don't feel bad for you. I know you
got a thing going on with Candace.

1169
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,258
Candace and Bernice?

1170
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,660
Candace, Bernice and Rose?

1171
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:49,428
Yeah. I fell for one chick and I'm losing
my mind. Good luck with that.

1172
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,202
Okay, baby.

1173
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,965
I love you.

1174
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,774
Thanks, buddy.
Remember to use a condom.

1175
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:58,300
Or in your case, a Hefty bag.

1176
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,255
Well...

1177
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:13,417
Okay, you guys. Thanks for coming
to say goodbye.

1178
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,522
Be careful.

1179
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:18,764
You make sure your father doesn't
get eaten by a shark.

1180
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:28,273
Thank you, buddy.
What does that mean again?

1181
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,639
Bring me back a T-shirt.

1182
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,176
Oh, okay. You got it.

1183
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,042
Come here. All right. Love you guys.

1184
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,785
My shirt size is medium husky.

1185
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,153
Hey! Kikikuloa!

1186
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:47,155
No flippies off the dock!
You could get hurt!

1187
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:54,732
No! All right. Let the master
show you how to get it done.

1188
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:06,505
Now you kids go down there
and find my nuts.

1189
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,711
Sure you don't want to take Doug?

1190
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,511
Hey! What the heck
are you guys doing here?

1191
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:17,448
I spoke to the harbormaster and he
said you were setting sail today...

1192
01:22:17,483 --> 01:22:19,620
...so we thought we'd wish
you bon voyage.

1193
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,885
This is from Nick and Sue.
They send their best wishes.

1194
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:27,230
That's very nice.
Spam and Reese's. All right.

1195
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,800
I love Spam and Reese's.
Can I have it?

1196
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,495
I guess.

1197
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:34,498
- Doug!
- That's all right.

1198
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:37,433
- I'm sorry.
- So...

1199
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:39,673
...how's Lucy?

1200
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:43,143
Actually, she's living at the institute.

1201
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:47,284
- When did that happen?
- Three weeks ago.

1202
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:51,652
Said she didn't want to be a burden to
me and Doug anymore. I don't know.

1203
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,393
I couldn't talk her out of it.
You know what?

1204
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,622
She's doing really great up there.

1205
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,990
She's teaching an art class
and she gets to paint every day.

1206
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:02,264
In fact, she's even singing again.

1207
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:04,630
Hey, look, I got a little gift
for you too.

1208
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:08,738
It's just a little something
from one sailor to another one.

1209
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:12,377
You take care of yourself out there.

1210
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:15,380
- I will.
- Okay.

1211
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,891
Henry did not tell me about you.

1212
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:28,553
Your fisherman muscles.

1213
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,724
Can I touch?

1214
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,795
Sure.

1215
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,405
Yes.

1216
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,278
The Beach Boys?

1217
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:52,349
How nice of him to give me a CD
that will remind me...

1218
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:56,444
...of all the wonderful times
I shared with his daughter.

1219
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,889
What an asshole!

1220
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,535
Oh, why?

1221
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:22,345
Why would you do this to me?

1222
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:25,040
You sick bastard!

1223
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:31,080
Oh, my God.

1224
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:33,959
Is he trying to tell me something?

1225
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:40,965
She only sings on days
she meets you.

1226
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:45,004
She remembers me?

1227
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:47,130
Holy shit!

1228
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:51,305
She remembers me!

1229
01:24:56,549 --> 01:24:58,466
Julia, that looks great.

1230
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:00,383
Excuse me. What am I doing?

1231
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:04,319
You're painting a picture.
And you're doing an excellent job.

1232
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:06,184
Oh.

1233
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,586
Holy crap! I suck.

1234
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,767
Hey, hey, hey.

1235
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,907
- Can we help you, sir?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

1236
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,511
- What's your name?
- My name?

1237
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,279
Dude, he forgot his name.
I feel bad for him.

1238
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:35,486
Just go on up. And good luck
with that memory problem.

1239
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:37,579
Yeah. Thank you.

1240
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:40,889
What?

1241
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:43,687
Lucy!

1242
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,792
Lucy!

1243
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,749
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hey, I met you before. I'm Henry.

1244
01:25:48,784 --> 01:25:51,399
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Lucy Whitmore.

1245
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:53,128
Any idea where I can find her?

1246
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:54,572
Hi, I'm Tom.

1247
01:25:54,607 --> 01:25:57,576
Oh. Thanks anyways.

1248
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:00,476
Lucy!

1249
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,581
Lucy!

1250
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:08,382
Lucy Whitmore...

1251
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,487
...can I ask you a question?

1252
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:16,822
Do you have any idea who I am?

1253
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:26,299
- No.
- No?

1254
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,665
That sucks.

1255
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:34,136
- What's your name?
- I'm Henry.

1256
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:36,410
Henry.

1257
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:40,517
I want to show you something.
Will you come with me?

1258
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:42,553
Well, yeah.

1259
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:46,091
Hey. Do you know who that guy is?

1260
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,320
Dude, I don't even know who I am.

1261
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:50,925
Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso.

1262
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:54,861
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1263
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,833
This is my studio.

1264
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,855
I don't know who you are, Henry...

1265
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:28,633
...but I dream about you
almost every night.

1266
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,728
Why?

1267
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:37,267
What would you say if I told you
that notebook you read every day...

1268
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,736
...used to have a lot of stuff
about me in it?

1269
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:44,809
I would say that that
makes a lot of sense.

1270
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,015
You erased me
from your memories...

1271
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,383
...because you thought you were
holding me back from having...

1272
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:52,452
...a full and happy life.

1273
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:55,216
But you made a mistake.

1274
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:59,357
Being with you is the only way
I could have a full and happy life.

1275
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,497
You're the girl of my dreams...

1276
01:28:02,735 --> 01:28:06,501
...and apparently I'm the man of yours.

1277
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:13,007
Henry.

1278
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,645
It's nice to meet you.

1279
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:18,240
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.

1280
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:24,723
Hi, I'm Tom.

1281
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,918
Henry, Lucy. Nice to meet you, Tom.

1282
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,889
Now why don't you come back in
ten seconds so we can meet again?

1283
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:19,904
Do you, Honah Lee, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

1284
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:22,178
...to have and to hold
from this day forth...

1285
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:24,908
...as long as you both shall live?

1286
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,785
- I do.
- Really?

1287
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,515
Even though in, like, 10, 15 years...

1288
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:32,518
...she could possibly let herself
go and then, like...

1289
01:29:32,553 --> 01:29:34,691
...sex could be, like,
nauseating for you?

1290
01:29:34,827 --> 01:29:37,523
What are you, nuts?
Your wife's right over there.

1291
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:41,561
I'm just kidding, Muumuu!

1292
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:44,701
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1293
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:52,310
Mazel tov!

1294
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,439
It's very cold, so when you're ready...

1295
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:59,477
...put on a jacket and come have
breakfast with me. Love you.

1296
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:36,481
Hey, hey! Good morning, Mrs. Roth.
Would you like to meet your daughter?

1297
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:38,151
Go say hello to Mommy.

1298
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:41,553
Hi, Mommy.

1299
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,887
That's right.

1300
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,027
Good morning.

1301
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:53,064
Oh, my goodness!

1302
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:56,238
- Grandpa's here.
- Hi, Dad.
