1
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,639
(whirring)

2
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,675
(metallic screeching)

3
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,379
(cheering)

4
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,256
(indistinct chatter)

5
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,258
(groaning)

6
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:48,040
Good morning, little fuzz ball.

7
00:01:54,982 --> 00:02:02,488
We're, uh, we're back in,
in Los Angeles.

8
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,758
Twenty days later,
it's all over.

9
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,300
(yawning)

10
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:21,807
On January 9, 2013,
I and my intrepid friends

11
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,144
loaded into a tour bus
and went across the country.

12
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,580
In each city I got drunk
and talked into a microphone

13
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:32,151
for anywhere from 50
to 350 people

14
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,418
who had all shown up
because they liked

15
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,287
my podcast Harmontown.

16
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,192
I crowd surfed,
I crowd surfed pants less,

17
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,828
and signed peoples clothes
while they were wearing them,

18
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,331
drank moonshine, blacked out,
I just remember collapsing

19
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,300
onto a table full
of hot wings.

20
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,773
Seeing so much art drawn
by people who are so good

21
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,642
at things that
I'm not good at,

22
00:02:56,644 --> 00:03:00,946
celebrating the things
that I do.

23
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:04,216
I made my girlfriend cry,
babbled incoherently,

24
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,752
performed topless,
I've hugged people

25
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:10,189
whose bodies were shaking
because they were

26
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,992
so excited to be hugged, um.

27
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,130
Um.

28
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,733
What did I learn?

29
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,832
Ah, were you here all night?

30
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,934
Er... er, that's great,
'cause you're making

31
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,470
a documentary about me,
and now you have a shot

32
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,973
of me getting into my car
as if there's no camera in it.

33
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:01,840
(laughing)

34
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,308
(coughing)

35
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,211
Is this gonna be the beginning
of the movie or are you gonna

36
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,647
start it with, um,
all of my friends saying

37
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,849
bad things about me?

38
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,122
Who's Dan Harmon, uh...

39
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,191
Dan Harmon is, uh...

40
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,594
Dan Harmon is a very
complex individual, um...

41
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,264
I don't, I don't know,
I-I... have other people been able

42
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:29,835
to describe Dan, have you gotten
a concise, accurate description?

43
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,804
I definitely think you're gonna
get a lot of different answers

44
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:36,241
to "Who is Dan Harmon?"
depending on who you ask.

45
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,044
Dan Harmon is a, uh, creator.

46
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:39,945
A comedian.

47
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,946
Producer.

48
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,047
Kind of a genius.

49
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,548
Straight up nerd.

50
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,421
A gregarious, garrulous,
gastronomical...

51
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,125
(laughing)

52
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,259
Dan...

53
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,528
I don't know, pass.

54
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,163
I think Dan Harmon would
describe himself

55
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,564
as indescribable.

56
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,000
He's a little narcissistic,
he got a bit of an ego.

57
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,702
He'd probably say, "Smelly."

58
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:04,903
Definitely a fat ass.

59
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,071
A troublemaker.

60
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,172
A podcaster.

61
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,041
An alcoholic.

62
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,943
He's probably the first person
to say he's self-destructive.

63
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,846
I think Dan would describe
himself as a human hand grenade

64
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,416
who has a predilection
for pulling his own pin out.

65
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:20,519
I think he'd say he's a writer,
I think he'd say that,

66
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,421
I think he'd be very simple
about it.

67
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,957
Writing, writing, Dave,
send the actors down

68
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,859
for their season one
evaluations.

69
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,830
Hi, I'm Dan Harmon,
I created NBC's Community.

70
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,238
Community is, uh, an exploration
of people who are sort of

71
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,508
on the outskirts of society,
uh, who have been given

72
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,410
a second chance.

73
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,812
So, you guys suddenly
just wanted to play

74
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,013
Dungeons and Dragons?

75
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,416
Yeah, why wouldn't we?

76
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,051
There's a running theme
in his work

77
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,654
that he reaches out
to people that aren't used

78
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,489
to being reached out to.

79
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,658
And you kinda feel like
you're in a secret club

80
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,027
if you watch Community
because a lot of the world

81
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,029
doesn't even know
it's a TV show.

82
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,465
Community's had its ups
and downs this year.

83
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,067
It's ups were the nights
we followed The Office

84
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,636
and people left their TVs
on by accident.

85
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,472
Its downs were the rest
of the season.

86
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,540
The show's his baby,
you know, so like,

87
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,210
he wants the show to be perfect.

88
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,513
Dan wears his heart
on his chest,

89
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,751
and he speaks his mind,
and it has gotten him

90
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,552
into trouble.

91
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,922
He's always striving
for perfection

92
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,960
and I think he's harder
on himself than anybody else.

93
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,496
You could see that at the end
of the third season,

94
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,898
that he was really worn down.

95
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,901
So, I just wanted
to let you know,

96
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,970
uh, that Community
is moving to eight.

97
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,838
What do you mean we're moving
to eight.

98
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,807
- Seven central.
- What the fuck is central?

99
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,343
It's the center of the country,
you fuckin' idiot!

100
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,779
Oh, fuck you!

101
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,681
Didn't wanna go to therapy,
and he needed an avenue

102
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,550
through which to vent,
so he started doing

103
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:03,121
Harmontown the podcast
at Meltdown Comics.

104
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:07,192
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown
is once again in session.

105
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,195
(crowd cheering)

106
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,101
Well, Harmontown is a podcast
that they do every week

107
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,071
where Dan, Jeff, they kinda
just... they'll talk for a while.

108
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,641
It's different, it's not
just an interview thing.

109
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,479
Uh, this is it.

110
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,182
We don't, yeah,
we don't prepare.

111
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:34,619
Dan spent the last three years
writing for a big network show.

112
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,122
There are all these filters
that his work has to go through,

113
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,624
like this is the polar opposite
of that.

114
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,026
When you walked into
my apartment,

115
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,628
you would be knee high
in pizza boxes.

116
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,731
There was mannequin legs
with pantyhose on them,

117
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,134
I wa... I was wiping my ass
with tee-shirts

118
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,103
because I wouldn't go
buy toilet paper

119
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,739
because I didn't want people
at Albertsons to know

120
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,843
that Heat Vision and Jack hadn't
been picked up for series.

121
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,077
He's got a lot on his mind.

122
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,779
(laughing)

123
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:04,549
And when he talks about it,
it's like... you do kinda want

124
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,851
a front row seat for that.

125
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,886
(clearing throat)

126
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,054
Uh-oh.

127
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,355
Nah, I just do that
to hope that I come up

128
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,156
with something else to say.

129
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,090
(crowd laughing)

130
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,558
(clearing throat)

131
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,895
This show is very unique
in that it's very interactive.

132
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,264
The audience is very much
a part of the show.

133
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,400
All right, well, I guess
let's have a hand for the...

134
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:26,905
for the Fellowship of Looking
Forward to the Hobbit.

135
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,874
None of us were the cool kids
in high school,

136
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:32,110
nobody's like, the prom king
in that audience,

137
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,713
unless they went to like,
an anime school or somethin'.

138
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,282
Let's introduce our Dungeon
Master, Spencer, everyone.

139
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,017
(crowd cheering)

140
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,887
I don't think a lot
of people can sit through

141
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:47,325
a staged Dungeons and Dragons
ep... tha-that's crazy.

142
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,994
There's really nothing
that's embarrassing in here

143
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:52,831
'cause we're all, admittedly,
fetishists and nerds

144
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,466
and weirdoes
and lonely and...

145
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,434
I'm kind of hesitant
to call this a kink,

146
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,970
it's not really a kink,
it's not really a fetish.

147
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,438
(crowd laughing)

148
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,606
'Cause I don't
get off on it,

149
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,075
that's the thing,
but, um...

150
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,210
But I may.

151
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,779
(crowd laughing)

152
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,381
I can't believe you don't
come here every week.

153
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,483
(laughing)

154
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,986
The only boss that Dan respects
is the audience

155
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:18,423
because he just wants
to entertain like, the people,

156
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:22,060
like, the 20, 30 people
that are in front of him.

157
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,296
Well, turn... everybody be cool.

158
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,231
So, one night in the show,
Dan played

159
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,933
a voicemail from Chevy Chase.

160
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,641
You're gonna live to be
about 57 if you're lucky,

161
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,976
the way you eat.

162
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,644
And your writing
is getting worse and worse,

163
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,347
so suck my (bleep).

164
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,749
You're not funny, you're okay.

165
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,518
After a fan fight
to keep it on the air

166
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,387
and those now infamous
Chevy Chase voicemails,

167
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,489
Community is in the headlines
again.

168
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,491
It's long been reported
that Harmon has clashed

169
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,328
with the network, crew,
and even some of the actors,

170
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,700
but now he has been fired
from the show he created.

171
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,402
Chevy, how you feelin'
about the Dan Harmon stuff?

172
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,370
The what?

173
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,505
- Dan Harmon.
- Who's that?

174
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,447
For three years I was told
get higher ratings, you know,

175
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,882
and I figured out how.

176
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,351
(audience laughing)

177
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,419
I'm gonna go to the networks
that have higher ratings

178
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,253
and, uh...

179
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:22,954
(audience laughing)

180
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,023
...uh...

181
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,025
(bicycle bell ringing)

182
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,774
On the sixth day,
God created writers,

183
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,377
but on the seventh day
the devil, uh,

184
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:50,215
filled the internet with porn,
and blogs about blue whales,

185
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,952
and all kinds of other things
to keep you from writing.

186
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,823
(keyboard clicking)

187
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,727
(ice cubes rattling)

188
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,997
Takes a lot out of a guy.

189
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,935
Being a vessel for God.

190
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,215
You know what, my job isn't
to write right now.

191
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,184
My job is to take a bubble bath.

192
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,091
(water rushing)

193
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,327
My favorite thing in the world
is my moment to feel

194
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,830
like a little baby.

195
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,967
It also has little jets in it
that you can use to relax

196
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,402
and massage yourself.

197
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,772
Rumor has it, sometimes
you can use to maybe tickle,

198
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:51,543
uh, your butt hole while
you're jerkin' off in it, um,

199
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,345
but I... I... that's just
something I heard from...

200
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,780
on a forum.

201
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,195
(clapping)

202
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,629
I wanna ask you a question,
j... just while we have

203
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,999
the opportunity, we're going out
on this big tour which is, uh,

204
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,069
very ambitious, it's a very
long, grueling schedule,

205
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,838
what do you hope to accomplish
by this, like, is there,

206
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,272
is there a goal for you?

207
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,809
Well, Jeff, the thing about
writing is you can see online

208
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,312
or through Nielsen numbers
that people are watching,

209
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,582
but what I'd like to do,
now that I'm between jobs,

210
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,351
I thought we could go out there
and look into their eyes,

211
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,854
and see if any of these people
are real.

212
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,389
Did I have... was there
an impact there?

213
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,059
I th... but this is a whole track
of conversation I wanted to talk

214
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,628
to everybody about tonight,
but I don't wanna delay

215
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,463
our-our next guest, I think
we should bring him up,

216
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,999
and talk to him about touring.

217
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,102
Uh, please welcome to the stage
Patton Oswalt.

218
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,671
(cheering)

219
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,273
Describe to me the tour,
what're you doin'?

220
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,674
Help me, help you.

221
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,977
We're start... we're leaving
on the tenth,

222
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,745
heading from Los Angeles
to Phoenix...

223
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,014
You're gonna, I'm sorry,
you're starting the tour,

224
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,749
your first show's gonna be
in Phoenix?

225
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,950
(crowd laughing)

226
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,352
Patton, I don't know
if you know this but

227
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,220
we're traveling
with our Dungeon Master, so...

228
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,989
Oh, yeah, definitely go
to Phoenix then, yeah,

229
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,491
that's... your... you guys are
like... that's...

230
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,060
you're like Freedom Riders
in the south in the '60s.

231
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,897
(laughing)

232
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,367
Sp... spencer,
you're in deep shit, man.

233
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,602
Also, it's almost every night
we're doing a show

234
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,805
and it's gonna be January.

235
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,273
What the f... really?

236
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,407
Yeah, it's, yeah.

237
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,909
(crowd laughing)

238
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,844
Well, you know, there's
a good chance that you're

239
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,146
gonna get to be one of those,
um, oh, what,

240
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,781
wha... what else would he
have done?

241
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,283
Yeah, who knows who would've
fired him.

242
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:39,417
Yeah, maybe.

243
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,286
(laughing)

244
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,655
(clapping)

245
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,024
All right, well, let's thank
Patton Oswalt for coming by.

246
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:49,027
(crowd cheering)

247
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,031
Thank you, everybody,
for coming.

248
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,834
You guys have been fantastic
for over a year

249
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,603
and now we're gonna go out
and see, uh...

250
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,674
...how bad it gets.

251
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,009
(cheering)

252
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,585
Do you remember when
this was all you had to do

253
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,787
to make people happy?

254
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,823
Remember when this
made you a good person?

255
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,459
That's it, that was
all you had to do,

256
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,761
you still had to do something,
it was still an accomplishment,

257
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,931
I put bubbles on my head,
I look like an old man,

258
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,100
even though I'm a little baby,
and everyone would just

259
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,969
applaud and laugh.

260
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,743
(bus engine whirring)

261
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,715
That's pretty exciting to me,
it's probably not exciting

262
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,517
to you 'cause it's an image
of a, uh, of a bus,

263
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,053
you could probably see
one of those on, uh,

264
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,222
on the internet by Googling
the word "bus,"

265
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,893
but that's a bus that I rented.

266
00:14:54,895 --> 00:15:00,398
Spencer, I'm keeping an, uh,
like a private YouTube V-log.

267
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,304
How much writing
do you have to do?

268
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,940
I have to do like,
about an eight-hour rewrite

269
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,243
on the CBS, uh, pilot,
they gave me some great notes,

270
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,179
and I just have to fly through
that script and address those.

271
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,883
The Fox thing I'm, I'm
further behind on, uh,

272
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,985
you know, I told them I would
give them something Monday,

273
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,554
it's Thursday right now.

274
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,824
And they sai... when Neil was
doing this to me he had it

275
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,826
to the right of my beard
because he said the beard was

276
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,696
like, giving it a lot of like,
scratch and stuff, I don't know.

277
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,899
Right now, tell me all the facts
that you know about Spencer.

278
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,301
(laughing)

279
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:39,971
I know that his beard holds
the souls that he eats,

280
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,073
and that he draws power
from them but...

281
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,408
I know he's a chocoholic.

282
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,576
(laughing)

283
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,378
I know he goes from zero
to bitch in 60 seconds.

284
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,846
He doesn't do Mondays.

285
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,316
Um, I know that it's not a...
it's not a pot belly,

286
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,518
it's a, it's a fuel tank
for a sex machine.

287
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,953
(laughing)

288
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,828
Should I talk differently
or the same?

289
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,967
I don't even know what that is.

290
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,402
I'm Spencer, and I'm
the Dungeon Master.

291
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,309
Is there anything
you don't want me to talk about?

292
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,179
Yeah, everything,
just don't talk about me.

293
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,414
(laughing)

294
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,882
I want to talk about
the day you were born

295
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,184
'cause it's hilarious.

296
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,554
Oh, yeah, when I was born
I had testicles that were larger

297
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,788
than they are now.

298
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,790
(laughing)

299
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,864
This is my room, it's where
I go to, you know,

300
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,601
go on the computer, and sleep,
and hide from the world.

301
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:47,572
This is, uh, my dice tube.

302
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,741
I used to have more dice
but I gave a lot of them

303
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,176
to people and my friends
and stuff.

304
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,911
I had broken up with
a girlfriend

305
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,681
and was trying to get my mind
off of things, so I turned

306
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,950
to the wonderful world
of podcasting,

307
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,818
and I had the random,
weird thought, I was like,

308
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,287
I might be able to play
Dungeons and Dragons

309
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,556
if I go to Harmontown.

310
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,592
The first time I went
to the podcast they were like,

311
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,728
"Well, we wanted to start
playing Dungeons and Dragons."

312
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,731
So, is anybody here th...
like, like, is somebody here

313
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,367
like a Dungeons and Dragons
kind of, aficionado?

314
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,537
And this one hand shot up,
and it was Spencer.

315
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,305
Can you... will you, are you
willing to come up here

316
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,607
for just a second?

317
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,609
(applause)

318
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,643
What is your name?

319
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,645
- Spencer.
- Spencer, everybody.

320
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,814
Spencer doesn't really like
being around people,

321
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,682
he doesn't like being
around strangers even more

322
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,684
than just being around people
he even knows.

323
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,521
And so to be going up
and doing this, it was amazing.

324
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,589
So, yeah, we've just been
playing Dungeons and Dragons

325
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,559
onstage ever since,
and it's been kinda crazy,

326
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,162
I've gained a lot of followers
on Twitter, so.

327
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:47,131
You do notice flames licking
the skins of the dwellings

328
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,333
of the knolls,
you can hear the sounds

329
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,701
of screaming and shouting.

330
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,336
Let's go in and help!

331
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,639
Th... these licking flames
remind me a lot of the belt

332
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,542
that used to lick my ass.

333
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,878
Wait... your dad licked your ass?

334
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,414
No, his belt did.

335
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,883
His belt, how do you know
it was his belt?

336
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,385
It's a magical belt.

337
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:12,757
Because it was hard
and held his pants up.

338
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,726
That's called his dick.

339
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,829
So, in Dungeons and Dragons,
most of the time,

340
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,566
you roll a 20-sided dice
and the higher you get,

341
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,869
the better you do, so,
if I rolled one for the tour

342
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,270
we'll see how good it turns out.

343
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,738
(dice rattling)

344
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,742
That's a three, so,
there you go, it's gonna suck.

345
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,279
It's our first time,
we made it.

346
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,247
We're rollin'.

347
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,549
The bus works, the bus works!

348
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,054
V-log entry, YouTubin' it.

349
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,122
YouTubin' it!

350
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,957
Here comes... this is
the wrecking crew.

351
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,258
YouTubin' it!

352
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,660
That's our van
that we just found out, uh,

353
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,563
has also been travelled in
by Slayer and Styx.

354
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,032
- And Styx.
- Carry on, my wayward son.

355
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,101
- Lady!
- That's Kansas.

356
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,636
But we're goin' to Kansas.

357
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,573
Dan, the slate,
ready?

358
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,408
One, two, three.

359
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,176
(clapping)

360
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,078
To luxury.

361
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,846
To no apologies.

362
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:13,384
Gentlemen, let's have
a perfect tour!

363
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,485
Perfect tour!

364
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,454
(laughing)

365
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,994
We, uh, just got
to the hotel in Phoenix,

366
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,097
and the venue is
a couple blocks away

367
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,366
I guess we're gonna walk there.

368
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,901
And, uh...

369
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,206
I'm a little nervous.

370
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,412
Do you get nervous in L.A.?

371
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:42,947
Yeah, a little bit,
differently though, I mean,

372
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,316
this is like, there's so many
more unknowns.

373
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,752
I love it, for me,
the more unknowns, the better.

374
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,527
Dermot Mulroney.

375
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,697
Dermot Mulroney.

376
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,466
I'm sorry you have to be
p-part of this.

377
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,302
Jeff's verbal exercises.

378
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:08,639
Chandelier, chandelier.

379
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,708
He doesn't know you can
hear him.

380
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,578
- Canoga Park!
- He's an actor.

381
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,448
Canoga Park!

382
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,752
Crib death, crib death.

383
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,356
The all-important lip stretcher,
crib death.

384
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,924
(laughing)

385
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:30,695
Pedophilia's an option
when you have the gumption.

386
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,697
(laughing)

387
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,836
I think I'm ready to go,
I'm loose, God, I'm loose.

388
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,471
Don't blow this.

389
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,544
Phoenix, first show.

390
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,547
(audience clapping)

391
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,019
I'm kidding.

392
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,821
Thanks for waiting, everybody,
how you doin'?

393
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,823
(crowd whooping)

394
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,494
Hope we can make
these people happy.

395
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,567
Won't you please help me welcome
in the mayor of Harmontown,

396
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,602
Mr. Dan Harmon?

397
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,605
(cheering)

398
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,442
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

399
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,545
Yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix,
yo Phoenix, yo Phoenix.

400
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:25,283
Best city
in the Goddamned world.

401
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,450
Phoenix.

402
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,588
Uh, so much to talk about,
you're our first stop,

403
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,722
by the way, I-I-I...

404
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,724
(cheering)

405
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,430
Holy shit, what a great city,
Phoenix is amazing!

406
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:46,504
So, you're already starting
to sense that I'm forcing that?

407
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:47,938
We have to get a couple
of things out of the way

408
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,741
just for the movie,
I'll take it off of your $22

409
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,076
if you see me after.

410
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:55,746
So, we need like, the slow
motion montage like, like,

411
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,550
like, of-of me killin' it
at every venue, and we def...

412
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:02,320
We definitely have to fake that,
like, like...

413
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,522
'cause i... it's not gonna happen.

414
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,257
Wait, so this sounds like
the most dishonest thing

415
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,025
in the world.

416
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,327
No, no...

417
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,095
Dan, Harmontown is about
being sincere and honest,

418
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,396
connections with people.

419
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,933
Well, it's basically
a real thing, but just...

420
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,968
just imagine that it's
the end of the show,

421
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,638
and like, I did really good,
and just like, kinda go,

422
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,274
kinda like, like, like,
slow mo, like, reach for me,

423
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,476
like you wish you could
touch me.

424
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,913
Like one, two, three, do it,
like, right, like, slow mo.

425
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,183
(laughing)

426
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,024
This is all a lie.

427
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,536
What kind of movie
do you think you're making?

428
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,238
A movie of lies.

429
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
(laughing)

430
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,444
I won't sign off on this, Dan.

431
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,680
(laughing)

432
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,316
All right, well, whatever.

433
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,251
All right, let's stop,
let's stop with the...

434
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,953
let's stop with the gimmicks.

435
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,388
You were nervous about tonight.

436
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,656
Well, yeah, 'cause clearly
you can tell from the photos

437
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:16,260
on the wall that the people
who normally perform here,

438
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:19,330
they have actual material,
you could...

439
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,866
they're doing it in the picture,
there's a picture

440
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,201
of a lady going like, "Gah!"

441
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:28,005
She's in the middle, she's just
finishing explaining like, like,

442
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,474
what Jack Nicholson would be
like in a drive through.

443
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,076
(laughing)

444
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,912
That's a bummer like, you-you
you've decided to do this tour

445
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,447
and you come out and stand there
with a microphone,

446
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:40,084
you feel this onus to live up
to Bobby Lee and, um,

447
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,854
the guy with, the guy
with the Hawaiian shirt.

448
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:44,822
Don Ho and...

449
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,824
Gallagher lady and...

450
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,293
Yeah.

451
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,395
Love you, Dan Harmon!

452
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,531
Yeah, I want people to relax
and have a good time,

453
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:56,767
I wanna be the reason they,
uh, the-they were entertained.

454
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,036
I think that's what drew me
out here is... it was like,

455
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,705
I want something, I wanna feel
like I, like, I, you know,

456
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:05,576
like, like I do something
for a living, and it is...

457
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,111
- Th... they deserve...
- Love you!

458
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,080
They deserve better...
stop saying you love me!

459
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:16,587
It's a surefire way to lose
my respect, I hate myself.

460
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,924
- You suck!
- Awesome, thank you, I suck.

461
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,759
Yes, I suck, thank you.

462
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,994
- But you rule!
- But I rule.

463
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,162
Shut up.

464
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,997
(laughing)

465
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,033
I never knew what I was doing
up there the whole time,

466
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,101
and I was not in the moment,
you know, I just felt

467
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,603
like I was drowning.

468
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,138
- How?
- Because they kept ge...

469
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,673
They were going like,
"You're off the hook,

470
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:39,210
you can do anything you want,"
and I didn't know what to do.

471
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,179
Do you think you understand,
honestly, like,

472
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:46,484
why people enjoy the show,
like do you understand...

473
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,451
What people get out of it?

474
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,786
What people get out of it?

475
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:49,954
I think Spencer
kinda understands

476
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,755
where I'm going with this.

477
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,892
Yeah, it's about the connection,
I feel like people see you,

478
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:57,995
and you're... you... you're talking
about stuff that they get,

479
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,098
and you're being funny,
but you're also really honest,

480
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,869
like, like, stupid honest,
like it's unimaginable.

481
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:08,138
And also I feel like everyone
that's involved is kinda trying

482
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,375
to like, create this sort
of almost Harmontown.

483
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,912
Yes, exactly, it's... it's this...
you've created this thing

484
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:18,182
unknowingly, and you know it,
but I don't think you get it,

485
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,084
I don't think you understand it.

486
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,325
I don't,
I don't have my A cam,

487
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,494
I'd like to go
al fresco tonight.

488
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:34,465
I wanna hopscotch away from,
from the way I started Phoenix

489
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:39,603
and I-I feel like I need
to train myself to-to

490
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,406
be a little more confident.

491
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,675
So, have you seen a difference
in audiences on the road so far?

492
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,110
I know you've just done Phoenix,
but...

493
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:49,580
It's our second city, uh, yeah,
so, I honestly like,

494
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:53,450
I-I-I, no I haven't.

495
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:56,420
So, to me, all of your work
is about connecting people

496
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,989
and turning a passive audience
into an active one,

497
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:02,359
be it from like, the amazing
passionate rallies and protests

498
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,828
from Community fans,
and even like, Spencer, like,

499
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,163
just somebody who was
in the audience,

500
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,799
now a part of the show,
was this always in your head

501
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,502
when you're doing these things
to like, get fans, like,

502
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:13,037
out of their chairs
and producing content?

503
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,472
It wasn't... it's never something
that you consciously think

504
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:19,410
it's just... it's a thing
that I've always found

505
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,011
makes me happy.

506
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:24,381
I definitely, like, like,
all I want on my deathbed

507
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,451
is to think that when I was 40
the people who were 20,

508
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,753
that there, that there was
a contact.

509
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,356
Thank you so much, I'm so,
so excited to see the show.

510
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,457
Jeff, it was really nice
to meet you.

511
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,725
Nice to meet you, man,
well done.

512
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,360
Yeah, well, see you guys
out there.

513
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,128
Bye guys, thanks.

514
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,302
Wow.

515
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,404
Uh, we had a great time
in Phoenix.

516
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,341
We learned some painful lessons
mostly about myself.

517
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:52,910
There were good people
in Phoenix, they loved me,

518
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,546
and I flung myself onto
the sharpened rocks

519
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,147
of my own self-hatred.

520
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,750
Dan actually started
heckling the audience as well.

521
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,753
It was terrible, I felt awful.

522
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,923
But, uh, y-you all listen
to the podcast, right?

523
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,891
(cheering)

524
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,362
I think that we found
last night, to our surprise,

525
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:13,464
and I think what we're gonna
find as we go is that

526
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,065
the people that come
to this show are gonna

527
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,667
resemble our hometown crowd.

528
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:20,037
Pretty much, I ju... I ju...
there's that misfit quality,

529
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,406
and then I-I think our eyes
meet across the room,

530
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,274
it happened with some guy,
I think his name was Jesse

531
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,709
or something, he was
the first guy who came in...

532
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,945
I came in and there was guy,
he was like, "Hey,"

533
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,580
kinda waved at me like
I worked with him,

534
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:33,317
and I was like, "Yeah, hey,"
and I... and I-I knew,

535
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,752
I don't work with you
but it's like,

536
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,253
the different patterns
of facial hair,

537
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,857
and the, uh, just l-lovely,
wonderful, wonderful,

538
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,126
an army, an army of nerds.

539
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,327
I love it.

540
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,329
(cheering)

541
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,001
Well, we've asked ourselves
what the point

542
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,704
of Harmontown was,
Dan's never really had

543
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,172
a good answer for it yet.

544
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,542
Uh, I think the message
is making itself really clear.

545
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:01,612
I think it's that idea
of-of trust, of freefall,

546
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:03,614
throw yourself out a window,
don't know what's going

547
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:05,849
to happen, don't look ahead.

548
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,951
In this, nothing can go wrong
because it's nothing

549
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,386
that we're doing.

550
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,421
Did you like the show?

551
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,022
- Yeah, it was awesome.
- Very cool.

552
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,358
It was great, awesome.

553
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,260
I'm gonna stay here,
we're not leavin' Austin.

554
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,330
Thank you, very much,
great show tonight.

555
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,298
Thank you.

556
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,400
- Great show.
- Drive safe, thank you.

557
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,702
- Hello!
- Hello.

558
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,203
Uh, I'm also from Milwaukee.

559
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,938
- Oh, no shit?
- Yeah.

560
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,743
Words might fail to circumscribe
the lesson I learned in Phoenix

561
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:36,447
but it's a little bit about
adapting to a new principle

562
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:38,682
which I think is,
I thought this was gonna be

563
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,285
about me getting better
and better at doing a show,

564
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,921
it's become about me dealing
with the fact

565
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,523
that I don't need to have one.

566
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,326
- Great show.
- Thank you.

567
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,095
Thank you, thank you.

568
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:12,149
You sleep okay?

569
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:16,887
Oh, yeah, a little too well,
I guess.

570
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,857
I was hoping to get some work
done before I got there.

571
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,727
I'm in big trouble right now,
I'm supposed to be working

572
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,029
on my CBS pilot,
and then I have a Fox pilot

573
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:29,600
I'm supposed to be writing
and, um, if they-if they saw

574
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,034
what I was doing right now
instead of writing it,

575
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,370
they'd be very upset with me.

576
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,139
I should've been done
with both of those things

577
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:36,774
far before this tour started.

578
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:40,778
I took work onto the bus with me
and it's, it's torturous.

579
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,046
It makes me feel like
a little boy that didn't clean

580
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,617
his room and it's awful,
but it's what I deserve.

581
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:56,226
All right, guys, here we go,
quiet please.

582
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,061
(bell ringing)

583
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:01,598
Let's roll, rolling.

584
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,333
And, action!

585
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:07,004
I know everything!

586
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:11,942
I met Dan back in, holy cow,
I think it was probably '91?

587
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,377
(clearing throat)

588
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,282
I'm coming.

589
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,150
We'd liked each other's comedy,
we would talk about pop culture,

590
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,287
talk about Star Wars, talk
about just dumb, stupid stuff,

591
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,690
and that was the beginning
of our writing relationship.

592
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,359
Ben Stiller called me
and said that he'd met

593
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,728
these amazing writers
and he wanted me to meet

594
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,464
with them to try to develop
a TV show, and I said yeah,

595
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,966
that sounds great.

596
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:40,003
And we were like, if we're gonna
do TV, let's write something

597
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,439
that only we would like.

598
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,908
And the next thing I knew,
they had written

599
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,477
this unbelievable masterpiece.

600
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,214
Hello, America, I'm Ben Stiller.

601
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,282
I've directed an incredible
new action series

602
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,284
called Heat Vision and Jack.

603
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,453
In it, we follow the adventures
of a super intelligent,

604
00:30:56,455 --> 00:31:00,224
renegade astronaut
and his talking motorcycle.

605
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:03,794
It had everything going for it,
but it was just too weird.

606
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,629
And expensive.

607
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,832
Unfortunately, it ended up being
the most expensive pilot

608
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,568
ever shot at 20th Century Fox.

609
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,970
Ben?

610
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,972
And, uh, the pilot was not
picked up.

611
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:18,008
After watching our program,
chances are you'll spend

612
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,010
some time tonight watching
one of your favorite

613
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,479
prime time shows,
but what happens

614
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:25,215
to all those TV contenders
that never make it?

615
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,384
The pilot was legendary
for a long time, I mean, like,

616
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,186
that was a tape
that you would try to hunt down

617
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:31,088
to see the pilot
for Heat Vision and Jack.

618
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,258
Yeah, it's got a cult following,
which, I guess is, you know,

619
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,627
kind of a nice
consolation prize.

620
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:39,596
But, uh, it could've been
so much more.

621
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,798
So long, Jack Austin.

622
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
So long, Sheriff.

623
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:46,837
It's emotionally devastating,
I was-I was wiped out.

624
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:50,107
We know we did
a good product.

625
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:53,343
And it would've worked
if it would've gotten a chance.

626
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:57,814
It was wildly original,
and inventive, and, you know,

627
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,817
two guys saying this is what
we think would be a cool show.

628
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,520
After Heat Vision and Jack
it got really dark

629
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,523
because it was the first time
Hollywood really, uh,

630
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,925
rejected us.

631
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:13,697
But we just decided
that our mantra would always be

632
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:16,433
make the shows you would
wanna see and I think that

633
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,403
really affected, uh,
Dan's work.

634
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:25,108
Knowledge is power, for real.

635
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,078
We only had 56 tickets sold
for the show tonight

636
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,149
and 172 open, which is,
which is a lot.

637
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,750
We are flyering.

638
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,686
In like, 25 degree weather.

639
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,287
And windy.

640
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,355
Take it, Rhode Island.

641
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:39,389
We're already flying.

642
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:42,092
Do you guys want flyers
for a comedy thing?

643
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,293
Nope.

644
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:47,030
Give you a flyer, thank you.

645
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,999
He'll be there.

646
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,168
- Your legs aren't cold?
- My legs are never cold.

647
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,136
I don't, I don't know why,
it's like they're made

648
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,638
of wood or something.

649
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,073
Did you bring pants?

650
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,342
I brought one pair of jeans.

651
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,911
Are they magic jeans, do they
on... do they have one use?

652
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:02,446
Are you saving them for
something?

653
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,549
Oh, yeah, they recharge
every couple of days, so I...

654
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,617
When I was a kid, people would
tell me take a shower,

655
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,220
you stink, you're a piece
of shit, and, uh,

656
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,990
like, one day I took a shower,
and combed my hair,

657
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,258
and got on the bus,
and all the eighth graders

658
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,162
were like, "Whoa, look at the...
dude, dude, give me skin, man,

659
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,799
give me five, fuckin' seriously,
man, good job, good job."

660
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,102
And I was like, never again,
motherfucker.

661
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,503
(laughing)

662
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,940
I-I-I-I am going to be
a millionaire and I am going

663
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:32,976
to smell like a butt.

664
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,112
You've done it, you've
accomplished your dreams.

665
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:35,946
Yeah.

666
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:37,948
(laughing)

667
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:40,517
I-I've known you
for a long time,

668
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,153
he's gone through
a series of fetishes, uh,

669
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,956
mannequin legs, nylons
on mannequin legs, uh,

670
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,058
videos about women
under the table

671
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,760
poppin' their shoe off
their heel.

672
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,595
Right.

673
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,263
Then you bought
the real-real doll,

674
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,232
we didn't see you
for a year.

675
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,100
(chuckling)

676
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:58,235
Um.

677
00:33:58,237 --> 00:33:59,603
(laughing)

678
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,271
You see
these ads for,

679
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,173
"Oh, buy a fake woman
made out of this stuff."

680
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,741
And you're like oh,
it's the perfect crime, like,

681
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,111
I'll take myself off the market,
I'll spare all these poor women,

682
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:10,480
I'll spare myself, like... like,
everyone'll win.

683
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,149
But then six months later,
it's like the head's

684
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,117
falling off them.

685
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,886
It's awful, yeah, 'cause
when do you throw away

686
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:19,189
your $6,000 rubber woman?

687
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,591
(laughter)

688
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,759
Awful.

689
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,428
Thank God I had an assistant
by that time.

690
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,931
(laughter)

691
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:28,765
What does this say?

692
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,101
"Silver staff of Silva?"

693
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,970
Yeah, Silva, do you you remember
that thing that you climbed up

694
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:34,838
out of the hatch with?

695
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,039
- Oh, right, right.
- Yeah.

696
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,642
So, it's a long pole, um,

697
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:40,444
you learn that if you
tap it against something

698
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,745
it gets longer,

699
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:45,248
and there's a button
that you can press on it.

700
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,183
Press the button.

701
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,050
Press that button.

702
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:48,552
I press the button...

703
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,020
It gets stuck.

704
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:51,822
- What do you mean it gets stuck?
- It gets stuck.

705
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,523
- Oh, the button does?
- Try to unstick it.

706
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,891
(crowd yelling)

707
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,027
- I tap the staff on the...
- It's stuck.

708
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:58,261
(laughter)

709
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,565
- I try to unstick it.
- You can't, it's stuck.

710
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,433
You just... you just said,
"Try to unstick it."

711
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,468
Yeah.

712
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,669
Is the button stuck
or the stick...

713
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,438
No, the stick is stuck,
the button's not stuck.

714
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,639
Unstick the stuck.

715
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,640
All right, so I push the button.

716
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,942
It becomes unstuck.

717
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,010
(laughter)

718
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:17,013
(cheering and clapping)

719
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,250
- Could you sign this real quick?
- Yeah.

720
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,018
- Spencer, do you have a marker?
- Yeah.

721
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,053
What's up?

722
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:24,154
She would like
to get an autograph.

723
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,722
An autograph?

724
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,791
- Sorry... I'm sorry.
- You're okay.

725
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,559
- I'm not okay.
- You're fine.

726
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,261
- Where do you want it?
- Anywhere.

727
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,662
Anywhere you want to sign it.

728
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,464
- Two Ss?
- Yup.

729
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,599
Is this your wife
I'm signing on?

730
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:36,500
It is.

731
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:37,701
(laughing)

732
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:38,535
You bet.

733
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,337
- Hello.
- Hi.

734
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,874
- Can I get a large blue?
- A large blue... and a what?

735
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:46,209
- A buff and a map.
- Yes.

736
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,911
- Can I get a picture with you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

737
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:51,882
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

738
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:06,096
One, two, two, one,
one, two, one, two.

739
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,164
- Hi.
- Hi.

740
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,603
(humming)

741
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,476
An actor prepares, you know.

742
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,845
(crowd noises)

743
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,313
Hi.

744
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,381
I love you.

745
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,684
I love you, too.

746
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:31,855
I know, it's weird.

747
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:35,325
- Very giddy.
- Yeah.

748
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,694
In an obnoxious way, right?

749
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,063
- Hi.
- Hi.

750
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:41,364
(laughter)

751
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,767
- Was that too much?
- No.

752
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,635
I'm gonna make the theme
of tonight hubris,

753
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,171
just because that's
what I'm feeling.

754
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:52,275
I got the 5-hour Energy in me,
and I'm feeling like an asshole.

755
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,310
Guess what, everybody?

756
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,078
What?

757
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,746
Harmontown is in session.

758
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,381
(cheering)

759
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,549
I gotta...
I gotta own it,

760
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,451
I gotta go out
and be fucking cocky.

761
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,919
(clapping)

762
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:03,987
Won't you welcome
to the stage,

763
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,523
the mayor of Harmontown,
Dan Harmon.

764
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:09,492
(cheering)

765
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,805
I... I haven't
asked this, Dan,

766
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,340
you got two new shows
in the works.

767
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:24,641
No, I don't.

768
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,776
Well, you have... you have
a CBS show and a FOX show.

769
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:29,012
I, I... I conned two
giant corporations

770
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,747
into giving me
a great deal of money.

771
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,183
(laughter)

772
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:34,718
Okay, thank you,
thank you for all...

773
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,253
Thank you for all the money,
guys, I'm...

774
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,520
Well, when are you going
to be done with the script?

775
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,056
Dude, I'm so fast,
I'm fucking crazy...

776
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,891
It only took me a week
to write a Community episode

777
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,193
because it had
to be done in a week,

778
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:45,762
and I had 20 people
helping me.

779
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,666
I... I... as far as I can remember,
I'm a really fast writer,

780
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,102
I can't remember past
two and a half years,

781
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,503
because I'm always high.

782
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:56,806
(laughter)

783
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,309
Let's see, just
unbutton my pants.

784
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,744
Put on the internet...

785
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,779
(yelling)

786
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,047
30 days later.

787
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,115
Almost finished.

788
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,483
(laughter)

789
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:13,356
Oh, oh, it burns, oh, oh, oh,
the creative process, it just...

790
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,357
Hey, it's CBS.

791
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,192
Guys, it's almost done,
what the fuck?

792
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,495
(groaning noises)

793
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,796
Like...

794
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,798
CBS, Dan just made
a jerk off motion,

795
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,400
if you're listening
on the Podcast.

796
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,268
He went...

797
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,103
...stuck his tongue out,
and made a jerk off thing.

798
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,872
(laughter)

799
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:32,542
Dan, it's Christmastime,
we agreed to spend this time

800
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,877
with Rob and Kate...

801
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,012
Do you understand
what it's like to be a genius?

802
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,247
(laughter)

803
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:40,350
Do you understand
how fucking creative I am?

804
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:44,354
Go have fun, I'm gonna be here,
trying to write this script.

805
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,356
Jesus Christ, you're gonna
fucking fade in

806
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:47,457
on me jerkin' off.

807
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,925
(groaning)

808
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,960
(laughter)

809
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,363
But we're Podcasting this show
every night.

810
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,332
Presumably, somebody at each
of those networks

811
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:58,034
is listening
to all of this, right?

812
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,636
You could get fired
before these shows

813
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,104
ever get picked up?

814
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,473
That could set a new record,
yes, is what you're saying.

815
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,476
Yes, I... I have to be
the Chuck Yeager

816
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:07,744
of something, Jeff.

817
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,479
(laughter)

818
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:12,048
No, it'll be fine,
I'm exaggerating.

819
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,284
And I'll edit all this out,
I went a little overboard

820
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:15,952
with the honesty tonight.

821
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,022
It's a little self-destructive.

822
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,357
(laughter)

823
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,993
(crowd noises)

824
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:24,861
So, that was...

825
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,366
(sighing)

826
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,369
(crowd noises)

827
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,682
Take these bad boys
for a spin.

828
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,517
What's it like to be able
to have this platform

829
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,453
to go out and interact
with your fans?

830
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:51,888
It's really interesting,
you know,

831
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,591
when you don't have an act,
as I certainly do not,

832
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,359
you have to get nervous
for a new reason,

833
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,862
every building
you go into.

834
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,063
You're never gonna
feel secure

835
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,631
because you don't
have an opener.

836
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,334
I'm not an improviser, I'm not
like one of your... your

837
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,835
little Whose Line friends,
you know,

838
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,937
your little... your
Whosey Doodles.

839
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,973
I... I... I have to look
at each room and go,

840
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:13,476
"Okay, what am I gonna say
to these people for 90 minutes?"

841
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,713
Yeah, I just realized I got
nothing to talk about here.

842
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,248
The only thing I can do
is self-destruct,

843
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,616
because of my own issues.

844
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,351
The audience has
not been unkind to us

845
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:24,287
in any of these cities
so far.

846
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,456
Can you talk a little bit
about your Dungeon Master

847
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:29,559
Spencer's evolution
from spectator to participant

848
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,727
in the show?

849
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:33,530
It's a mystery to me,
this... this Spencer thing

850
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,832
just kind of fell together
very, very magically.

851
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,167
I just wanted him up there,
sittin' there,

852
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:38,334
'cause I like
being able to go,

853
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,869
"What do you think
about that, Spencer?"

854
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,672
Oh, that.

855
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,441
It's been incredible,
he's sitting three feet from me,

856
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,975
so it's a little
bit uncomfortable.

857
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,710
I think it's really interesting,
like, did you anticipate

858
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:48,845
that level
of audience excitement

859
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,079
with the D&D?

860
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,981
Not at all, no, God, no.

861
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,517
All right, well, let's play
Dungeons & Dragons, right?

862
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,585
Let's do this.

863
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,220
All right.

864
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,756
They're absolutely
and really, unironically,

865
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:03,226
cheering for rolls
of the dice.

866
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,894
- It's a critical hit.
- Fuck yeah.

867
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:07,397
(cheering)

868
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:09,199
Cheering for spells
being cast,

869
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:12,202
they're cheering for people
pulling out certain weapons.

870
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:15,605
I swing my far sword
as hard as I can at the heart.

871
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:16,973
Your far sword
goes wide,

872
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,441
and rather than
hitting the heart,

873
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,344
it instead
strikes a tentacle.

874
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,512
Is... is that good?

875
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:23,980
It's better than
not hitting anything

876
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,582
or hitting yourself
in the foot.

877
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,151
(laughter and clapping)

878
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,955
It's all... the... it's... it's...
I'd never anticipated

879
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,923
any of that,
it's pretty cool.

880
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,763
All right, well,
it's not our fault.

881
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,866
Neil wants this awesome shot
of us not carrying

882
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,000
a bunch of shit.

883
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,102
I can't help it.

884
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:46,769
I don't...

885
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,171
(laughing)

886
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,906
- It's the shot that we need.
- I'm just freezing.

887
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,107
I gotta get outta
this fucking...

888
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,076
My hands are cold.

889
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,845
I'm not wearing a sexy,
multicoast parka right now.

890
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,449
Harmon.

891
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,851
She's caught... my girlfriend's
calling me, what do I do?

892
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,754
- Director?
- Go to her, go to her.

893
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,022
She needs you?

894
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:09,559
(traffic noises)

895
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:12,562
All right, lucky me,
that the shot doesn't involve...

896
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,130
That's why I don't need
your help over here.

897
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,932
Oh, what?

898
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,634
The movie's about you
being encumbered?

899
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:18,568
No.

900
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,669
It could be.

901
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,271
Is the movie about you
walking places?

902
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:24,607
In point of fact, yes...
...almost certainly.

903
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,076
I was just asking your help
to help move things.

904
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,846
I know, I understand,
and here I am.

905
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,081
I didn't know that you were
doing a big entrance shot.

906
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,150
You can redo it if you like.

907
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,718
You could put that
around my neck.

908
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,420
We could redo those,
so 900 people

909
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,855
could help you with those.

910
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,890
Well, who, that was nearby?

911
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,226
I want to get in there,
and I have to get set up.

912
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,962
(footsteps)

913
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,097
Yeah, I've been doing the merch
for the tour, and like,

914
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,032
setting it up.

915
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,633
It's a thankless job.

916
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:51,801
Goddamn it.

917
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,737
And one that no one
asked you to do.

918
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,740
(traffic noises)

919
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,512
It's awesome, and true.

920
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:04,781
In every sense.

921
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:09,519
(rattling)

922
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:13,723
Bye, baby, it's like... it's like
in that Tom Hanks-produced movie

923
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:17,560
about those Beatle-type guys...
being separated...

924
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,162
But do you love me?

925
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:23,866
I'm waiting for the camera.

926
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,403
You have your moments.

927
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:31,474
(traffic noises)

928
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:35,545
Yes... it was a bit... oh, no.

929
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:36,813
No.

930
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:40,783
(inaudible)

931
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,185
I would make a joke
about how she got hit

932
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:45,288
by a car, but, then there
was that guy who brought me

933
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,959
a handwritten letter
on bar napkins

934
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,161
about how his fiancé
three years ago

935
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:54,430
got killed by
a drunk driver,

936
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:58,067
and how Community
helped him

937
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,637
repair himself emotionally,
a little bit,

938
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,904
and he just wanted
to thank me,

939
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:03,339
but he couldn't get
a ticket to the show

940
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,109
because
it sold out so fast.

941
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:11,948
And I said, "Buddy, sorry
for your loss,

942
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,617
but sold out means sold out."

943
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,087
Just kidding.

944
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,254
Squeezin' him in there,
because I'm the Oprah

945
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,090
of ineffectual white people.

946
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,292
(knocking)

947
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:24,661
Hogwarts reference.

948
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:26,062
(groaning)

949
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:27,263
Let's do an experiment.

950
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,998
Let's get Spencer
out here immediately.

951
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,566
All right... oh, shit.

952
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:31,701
We've never done it.

953
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,970
Dan, we've never... it's...

954
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,171
Hang on, Spencer.

955
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,806
(yelling)

956
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,608
Spencer.

957
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,177
So, Spencer, I heard you did
some hash brownie today, man.

958
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,845
- Is that true?
- How you doing?

959
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:43,646
Nobody text Spencer's parents...

960
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:44,781
I'm doing great!

961
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,282
...and tell them he gets high.

962
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,650
(laughter)

963
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,319
Don't, don't call them, either.

964
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:51,788
(laughter)

965
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,589
Oh, Spencer.

966
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:57,493
He had... he had an accident
with an edible.

967
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,195
It was... it was on purpose.

968
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,097
(laughter)

969
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,132
But that was... that was
at nine A.M. today, right?

970
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:06,069
No, I'm fine, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

971
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:07,403
Great.

972
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,672
He's a one man burning man.

973
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,541
(laughter)

974
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,910
Spencer seems to have
eaten an edible.

975
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,813
You have partaken
of a potion that seems

976
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:19,482
to be having a magical effect
on you.

977
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,884
Gripped by haziness
and lethargy,

978
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,820
you reach for the Cheetos.

979
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:28,458
(laughter)

980
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,893
See, I'm fine.

981
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,329
Oh, yeah, oh,
he's still got it.

982
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,765
One of the guys
making the documentary,

983
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,066
we were at this
Thai food restaurant,

984
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,368
and one of 'em said,
"Are you all right?"

985
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,970
And he's like,
"Yeah, I'm fine."

986
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:41,938
And they said,
"Are you gonna be able

987
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,272
to Dungeon Master tonight?"

988
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:49,011
And he said, "Yeah, give me
the name of a monster."

989
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,847
Can we try that out right now?

990
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:52,181
- Let's try a couple here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:55,451
All right, so, Spencer...
anyone from the audience,

992
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:58,087
do you have a... think of a,
not a real monster,

993
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,056
make up a new monster.

994
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:03,860
The tooth beast... Spencer,
the tooth beast.

995
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:06,028
You hear the gnashing
and grinding of ivory

996
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,029
against ivory.

997
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:08,831
(laughter)

998
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,133
I'm gonna fucking die.

999
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,201
I am gonna die.

1000
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:14,604
Should I even go on
at that point or are we...

1001
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,639
No, you shouldn't... I mean,
you could or you couldn't,

1002
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,040
it doesn't matter.

1003
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,976
I am gonna die.

1004
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,477
I'm gonna die of happiness.

1005
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:24,714
(laughter)

1006
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:28,151
Spencer, disaffected
emotional parent monster.

1007
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:31,921
Trying to get
her attention,

1008
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:35,992
her mother looks over with
a lazy, glazed-over look.

1009
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:38,694
She seems exhausted, as if
the weight of the world

1010
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:41,197
rests upon her shoulders.

1011
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,665
You think that
this might not be

1012
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,534
the best time
to ask for ice cream.

1013
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:48,204
(laughter)

1014
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:49,705
He's a... he's a
national treasure.

1015
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:51,474
He's... he's
a national treasure,

1016
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,477
whose parents dropped
him off at the bus.

1017
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,480
(laughter)

1018
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,953
I haven't seen the hair down,
look at this shit.

1019
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:06,055
He looks like
a very successful bass player.

1020
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:16,065
God loves Spencer, amazing.

1021
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,433
How is becoming
a national treasure

1022
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:18,901
working out for you?

1023
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:23,439
Well, I'm not entirely sure
I'm a national treasure.

1024
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:24,807
We're certain.

1025
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:28,778
Well, I appreciate it, but,
how does it feel, though?

1026
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,849
It feels very combative,
because people tell me that,

1027
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,518
and then I tell them no,
and then they insist.

1028
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,119
Yeah, and then they insist.

1029
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:39,188
- What's up, you guys?
- What's going on?

1030
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,191
(murmuring)

1031
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,276
This was the drop-deadline
to turn in the final draft

1032
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:01,944
of my CBS pilot.

1033
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,779
They're... they're really
starting to make decisions

1034
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,915
about what stuff to pick up, so.

1035
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,383
Can you bring the top end
down more?

1036
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,586
And maybe... maybe bring up
some of the mid or low?

1037
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:11,387
Maybe the mid.

1038
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,256
One, two, one.

1039
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:14,991
One, two, two.

1040
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,960
(murmuring)

1041
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,165
- Did you finish that yet?
- Yeah.

1042
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,000
- You did?
- Yeah.

1043
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:26,302
- Just now?
- Yeah.

1044
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,437
I think it's pretty good.

1045
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:30,206
It's cute.

1046
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,174
- Is it CBS or FOX?
- It's CBS.

1047
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:33,476
You haven't done the FOX one
yet, have you?

1048
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:41,651
But... I can get that done
by midday tomorrow.

1049
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:42,618
Something like that.

1050
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,986
(laughing)

1051
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:46,522
God, it's like being in college,
and like, having like,

1052
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:50,426
an essay to turn in as like a...
I'm stressed for you.

1053
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,427
Yup.

1054
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,662
Oh, I was gonna say
about Spencer,

1055
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:56,198
we were in town, and,
he texted me.

1056
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,301
I... I broke off
from the group and he said...

1057
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:04,507
After the fallout
of Heat Vision and Jack,

1058
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:07,777
we were, you know, struggling,
as writers, like everybody else,

1059
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:10,546
trying to make something work,
and then, like, I guess

1060
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:13,316
we were on this, like,
list of writers

1061
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,985
that Comedy Central gave
to Sarah Silverman.

1062
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,654
I was dazzled by
all the ideas Dan sent me,

1063
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,690
and we ended up writing
this pilot together,

1064
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:23,192
the three of us,
and it was really fun.

1065
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,894
That was super fun.

1066
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:28,030
You know, Rob and Dan
and Sarah all have

1067
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:31,434
a very, kind of a very twisted,
dark sense of humor,

1068
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:33,269
which really showed up
in the series.

1069
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,537
(brakes squealing)

1070
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:35,705
Hey, same car.

1071
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:37,306
Hey, same car.

1072
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,909
(babbling noises)

1073
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:42,111
We got picked up,
we started working,

1074
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:50,619
and then the fun Dan...
...was less fun.

1075
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:53,756
But I think Dan,
when he's writing a show,

1076
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,858
he wants it to be great,
so he can be

1077
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,660
a little controlling.

1078
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:01,831
Dan doesn't respect authority,
just because it's authority.

1079
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,766
He's a fucking genius
when it comes what he...

1080
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,501
his vision is,
and what he wants done,

1081
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,470
and if it doesn't get done
the way he wants it,

1082
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:09,472
he... he explodes.

1083
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:11,340
I felt like I was walking
on eggshells every time

1084
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,042
I walked in the office.

1085
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:17,380
He said stuff that like,
made me feel bad inside.

1086
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:21,350
So, I just was like,
honestly, it's like him or me,

1087
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,220
'cause I don't wanna feel
this way.

1088
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,988
Sarah let Dan go.

1089
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,690
"Let him go."

1090
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,125
He got fired.

1091
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:30,860
Sarah fired him.

1092
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,362
It seems that Dan really thought
he'd be Larry David

1093
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:36,032
to her Seinfeld, but it didn't
work out that way.

1094
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,067
Yeah, we both had visions
for the show, I mean,

1095
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:42,304
the truth is, every single thing
he wrote was amazing,

1096
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,440
and that's how bad
it had to be,

1097
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,442
that I was willing
to give that up.

1098
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:50,379
I'm his biggest fan,
and I fired him.

1099
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:54,050
Then... then she said,
"You know, you have

1100
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:58,354
to make a decision,
but I want you to stay."

1101
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:02,625
And... that was... that was
a hard time,

1102
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:05,861
'cause when he got fired,
I stayed.

1103
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:10,132
(traffic noises)

1104
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:12,701
 Come on down
to Harmontown

1105
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:15,738
 Turn your frown upside down

1106
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,074
 Pee is yellow,
poop is brown

1107
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:20,276
 Come on down to Harmontown

1108
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:25,081
Yeah, it's gonna be a goody.

1109
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,216
I like tonight,
I got a good feeling.

1110
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:29,685
I got a... a good feeling,
and it makes me feel terrified.

1111
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,955
'Cause I feel very... very
comfortable, so it...

1112
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,291
it starts to fill me
with a Phoenician sense

1113
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:36,959
of obligation.

1114
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:38,260
Yeah, tight's good.

1115
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,162
It's good.

1116
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,130
It's great.

1117
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:43,265
(laughing)

1118
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,000
I like the idea of making
a big deal out of it,

1119
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:47,069
like it's some kind of stunt.

1120
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,304
Like I'm Jacques Cousteau.

1121
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,773
(laughter)

1122
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,374
We should put a headlamp
on his head.

1123
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,051
Music city.

1124
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:03,552
Cheers.

1125
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,788
According to Joseph Campbell,
it's either tonight

1126
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:11,093
or the next stop,
where we cross a threshold, so,

1127
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,162
we don't know what that means.

1128
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,631
It could be anything.

1129
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,100
So, the big question is,
what has been being shouted

1130
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:21,737
at us by God
that we've been ignoring?

1131
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,172
I'll tell you
one threshold

1132
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,474
we're definitely crossing
tonight, I love doing this,

1133
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,077
I wish I did not have
writing work to do,

1134
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,812
I wish I wasn't a writer,
I wish...

1135
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,515
I wish this is what
I really did.

1136
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:36,418
I... I would love another drink.

1137
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,287
- Hey, Jeff.
- Yes, Dan?

1138
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,690
I talked to a guy,
he brought moonshine with him,

1139
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,993
and I thought he could come up
and give me a taste

1140
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,561
of moonshine on stage.

1141
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:48,030
That sounds awesomely illegal,
let's bring him up.

1142
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:50,599
Comes in a jar, you have
to drink it out of a jar.

1143
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,034
(cheering)

1144
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:53,469
Do I... do I drink the whole jar?

1145
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:54,236
Is that...

1146
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:55,404
No, no, no, no.

1147
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:57,106
(yelling)

1148
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:59,074
That would be
a very different Harmontown.

1149
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:00,543
Be careful.

1150
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,213
Be careful, stop it.

1151
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,217
(laughter)

1152
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:13,055
(cheering)

1153
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:16,091
 Well, I'm proud
to be from Nashville

1154
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:18,928
 In the birth
of the music scene

1155
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,830
 I'm drinking white
like the thunder

1156
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:24,633
 And you know my mother
knows what you mean

1157
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:29,672
 I got Elvis on my left side,
got some Beatles on the right

1158
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,840
Yeah, I gasped a little bit,
'cause you... have you ever

1159
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:32,975
drank moonshine before?

1160
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,877
No, no.

1161
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,278
"It's good."

1162
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,681
The second sip tastes better
than the third.

1163
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:39,848
Wait, I mean, oh, wait.

1164
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,350
(laughter)

1165
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:42,651
No, it's like, you know,
you know what it tastes like,

1166
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:43,819
and I don't mean to...
I gotta tell you,

1167
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:45,487
it tastes like a fight
with my girlfriend.

1168
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,423
(laughter)

1169
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:49,558
It tastes like...
it tastes like tonight,

1170
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,260
Erin and I are
gonna have a fight.

1171
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:52,962
"You could probably
run your car on this."

1172
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:55,297
So, they're offstage,
D&D begins.

1173
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:56,665
"Time to bring up
our Dungeon Master,

1174
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,734
Spencer Crittenden,
bring him up.

1175
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,604
You got the dance girlfriend,
Maureen Saldana."

1176
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:03,472
Do you remember D&D though?

1177
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:05,174
Can you fly?

1178
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:07,109
You're a wizard, right?

1179
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,544
- A lizard?
- A... a...

1180
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:09,345
(laughter)

1181
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,479
A wizard.

1182
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,147
I'm sorry, Dad,
I've had a lot to drink.

1183
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:13,616
(laughter)

1184
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,284
- Well, you...
- Can I have your moonshine?

1185
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:16,819
Can I take your moonshine?

1186
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:19,588
Oh, God, oh, God.

1187
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,390
All right, dude,
this is where we left off.

1188
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:22,424
"Dan, are you okay?"

1189
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,993
"Yeah, yeah, sure..."

1190
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:26,228
I just remembered
that this happened.

1191
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,097
I'm so embarrassed.

1192
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,399
Like, what... do we lift it
for the Podcast listeners?

1193
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:31,734
Or what?

1194
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,002
"Let me keep
workin' the crowd, I'm sorry."

1195
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:34,270
(laughter)

1196
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:35,771
- What's your name?
- Hailey.

1197
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,174
Hailey, how do you know
you're finished?

1198
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:40,643
Yeah...

1199
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:42,678
Dan it seems like you're afraid
of human connection right now.

1200
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,812
Yeah, yeah.

1201
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:45,447
- What's your name?
- Matt.

1202
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,117
- Matt, I don't think so.
- I just feel like you're...

1203
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,319
Workin' the crowd,
workin' the crowd.

1204
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:52,154
(cheering)

1205
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:54,290
You're glossing over
real humanity out there, Dan.

1206
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,658
- What's your name?
- Jonathan.

1207
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,026
These poor people
in Nashville,

1208
00:54:57,028 --> 00:55:00,362
just watched a guy, like,
drink himself into oblivion.

1209
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,697
It's not fair.

1210
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:04,833
"Holy shit, that moonshine
fucked me up bad."

1211
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:07,469
I apologize
to everybody, honestly.

1212
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:10,406
All your money will be sitting
in a pile, you can just take

1213
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:12,808
whatever you thought
tonight cost you.

1214
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,443
(laughter)

1215
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:16,211
I mean, either my job
is to get that drunk

1216
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:19,014
and be really entertaining,
like either I'm John Belushi,

1217
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:22,584
or, like, I'm unprofessional,
you know, I don't think

1218
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,054
I have it in me
to be John Belushi.

1219
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:28,857
 Self ridicule
at the end of the station

1220
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:31,327
 I can't take it no more

1221
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:35,331
 I feel like a bad person

1222
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,399
 Terrible, watching
this happen

1223
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:40,569
 Come on down to Harmontown

1224
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,238
 Turn your frown upside down

1225
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,506
 Bitch

1226
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:48,477
(mumbling)

1227
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,679
Just revising history.

1228
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,348
If you were
in the Nashville audience,

1229
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:57,653
you... you know a secret.

1230
00:55:57,655 --> 00:56:00,789
You know that man can fail.

1231
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:09,765
I'll allow myself
to stay deluded,

1232
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:12,301
and think that people
that were at the show

1233
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:14,703
had a good time,
but it felt like...

1234
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,873
a warning shot
over my personal shoulder,

1235
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,477
I don't... I don't wanna be guilty
of doing that again.

1236
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:24,646
I think you owe... you owe people
who make a five hour drive,

1237
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,549
a certain... a certain something.

1238
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:31,153
Something personalized,
something real.

1239
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:33,655
Last night in Nashville,
the episode is only

1240
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:35,324
just being uploaded.

1241
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:37,126
I almost hope none of you
heard it.

1242
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:39,294
(laughter)

1243
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:42,798
Control was lost,
things broke down.

1244
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,168
My drinking was unforgivable,
and I want to start

1245
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,771
with this confession to you,
as an editor of Harmontown,

1246
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:51,039
I've never made more
shame-based edits...

1247
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,041
(laughter)

1248
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,877
I was editing things
because I was like, I, I,

1249
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:58,414
I sound like a monster,
and I don't want anyone

1250
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,982
or their mother to hear it.

1251
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:09,691
All right, maybe we could
solicit somebody's help, like,

1252
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,560
I need to form a relationship
with the audience

1253
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:15,631
everywhere I go, so, I want
somebody to tell me, like,

1254
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,534
I'm gonna close my eyes, who...

1255
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,002
Let's all... let's all leave.

1256
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,470
(laughter)

1257
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:22,704
I would notice.

1258
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:24,440
(laughter)

1259
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:27,109
All right, who... who is
in the most pain tonight?

1260
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:29,578
Like, the most devastating,
maybe not physical,

1261
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,712
maybe emotional...

1262
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:32,815
A... a hand went back up there.

1263
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,316
Would you be willing to come up
and talk to us?

1264
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:36,251
We never bully anybody,
are you... are you... would you...

1265
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,319
It's okay to say no.

1266
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:38,554
(cheering)

1267
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,189
I have a situation
called alcoholism.

1268
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:41,690
All right, me, too.

1269
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,959
And I was just really hoping
that Dan Harmon

1270
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,093
would make me a drink.

1271
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,228
(laughter)

1272
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,596
That's not the cure
for alcoholism.

1273
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,498
(laughter)

1274
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,968
Eddie... Eddie, what are you
most afraid of?

1275
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,737
Being a failure.

1276
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,172
I would have said spiders.

1277
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,740
(laughter)

1278
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:01,643
You just... spiders... you're just
a badass with spiders?

1279
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,679
I'm okay with spiders,
I hate snakes, though.

1280
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,614
Okay, snakes
and being a failure.

1281
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,015
Megan, what's up with you?

1282
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:10,352
I work in an office,
and I don't get along

1283
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:11,687
with anybody there.

1284
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,355
What's keeping you
from connecting with people?

1285
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:14,456
That's good.

1286
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,291
I'm not a very nice person.

1287
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:20,362
My parents got divorced
like four years ago,

1288
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,364
which, you know, I was surprised
by it, like, it usually

1289
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,867
doesn't happen that much later
in a person's life.

1290
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,502
I remember my Dad trying
to talk to me

1291
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:29,705
about our parents' separation,
and me getting so embarrassed.

1292
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:31,940
My Dad doesn't even talk
about that sort of stuff,

1293
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:34,276
or anything real,
for that matter.

1294
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:37,145
All right, Maya, what's your
biggest ambition,

1295
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,180
what's your biggest dream?

1296
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,583
Well, that puts you
on the spot, doesn't it?

1297
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,085
It happened.

1298
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,621
Oh, really... you're like me,
you've lived your dreams?

1299
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:47,322
Like, I had a TV show,
I got fired from it,

1300
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:48,390
they finally caught up...

1301
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:49,525
no, I wasn't
fishing for that,

1302
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,158
I wasn't fishing for that!

1303
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,993
Stop it.

1304
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:52,127
(laughter)

1305
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,195
It's not what I...

1306
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:00,702
Mommy, why did NBC fire me?

1307
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:04,039
(laughter)

1308
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:04,873
Snakes.

1309
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,742
- Snakes.
- Snakes.

1310
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,177
No!

1311
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:10,712
(clapping)

1312
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,214
Wow, well that
explains everything.

1313
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:13,749
(cheering)

1314
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,250
We're not so different,
Eddie Geller.

1315
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,185
(laughter)

1316
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:24,560
These Harmonians,
they've all been around

1317
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:27,362
for a great, long time,
feeling pent up,

1318
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:30,632
and ashamed, and disconnected.

1319
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:32,434
They're just a bunch of people
that really want

1320
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:35,470
to like each other, because
they sense that kindred spirit.

1321
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,841
We know what
a Harmania is now,

1322
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:42,611
we know that no matter
what city you go to,

1323
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:45,113
no matter what job
they occupy,

1324
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:48,317
we know that
a Harmanian is a...

1325
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,154
a nerd full of love.

1326
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:55,290
And so... what do you
do with that?

1327
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,783
(crowd noises)

1328
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:28,523
(cheering)

1329
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:30,859
Best fuckin' group
in the world.

1330
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,828
(cheering)

1331
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:38,000
(applause)

1332
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:39,434
Hello.

1333
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:40,702
(clapping)

1334
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:43,271
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jason Sudeikis is here.

1335
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:46,274
(enthusiastic screaming)

1336
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,452
So when a new political figure
comes on the scene,

1337
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:59,087
and you kind of look
like that person,

1338
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,789
is it like the greatest day
of your life?

1339
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:03,291
Where you're like...
oh, I fucking got Biden.

1340
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:05,394
It's a long way from, you know,
just Chevy Chase just going

1341
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:08,163
out there and falling down,
or like...

1342
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,398
Well, we'll never
get back there again.

1343
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,365
Jimmy Kurt.

1344
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:11,633
(laughter)

1345
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:13,368
- By the way, can I...
- Oh, that's right, you know him.

1346
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,071
(laughter)

1347
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,473
I... I texted him,
"I'm doing my show

1348
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:21,309
in Brooklyn tomorrow night,
are you in New York?"

1349
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:25,213
And three hours later, he texted
back the word, "Country."

1350
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:28,283
(laughter)

1351
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:31,887
- It's...
- How'd he spell it?

1352
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,221
(shushing)

1353
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:36,224
(phone ringing)

1354
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:42,631
He does have a voicemail, right?

1355
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:45,801
"Hi, this is the stand in
for Chevy Chase."

1356
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:47,402
(laughter)

1357
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,404
"At the tone,
please record your message."

1358
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:51,707
Joe Biden, Joe Biden
leaves a message.

1359
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:54,509
Joe Biden message.

1360
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:57,012
Hey, Chevy, it's Joe Biden,
Vice President.

1361
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:59,347
I just want to say, we thank you
for being a great patriot

1362
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:03,985
and, have fun in the country,
we... we hope you're...

1363
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:05,320
the country you always want
to go back to, though,

1364
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:06,321
is America.

1365
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:07,556
All right, there we go.

1366
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:10,859
(cheering)

1367
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:13,328
It's a pretty low-stakes prank.

1368
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,963
We're not exactly
The Jerky Boys.

1369
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:16,164
(laughter)

1370
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:19,468
Also, he has your phone number
in his phone.

1371
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,703
That's true also, I forgot.

1372
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:23,071
It's not gonna say Joe Biden.

1373
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,639
It's not exactly
the perfect crime.

1374
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,475
It's gonna say, "Fat,
alcoholic asshole,"

1375
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:28,910
or whatever he has me
in his phone as.

1376
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,312
Should we bring out Spencer
at this point, Dan?

1377
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:31,379
Yeah, yeah, let's
bring Spencer out.

1378
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:34,750
(cheering)

1379
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:37,853
Jason has no... he's never heard
the show, he doesn't know.

1380
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:42,057
(enthusiastic cheering)

1381
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:45,160
Standing ovation for Spencer.

1382
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:47,829
I wasn't asking for it,
I was recording it.

1383
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:50,031
Spencer is our Dungeon Master,
he plays Dungeons & Dragons.

1384
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,701
Oh, great, great.

1385
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:55,237
After facing down
a nigh-naked foe,

1386
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,706
with a wicked whip,
the party gained access

1387
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,775
to a room full of lockers.

1388
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,210
They found treasure
from a lute of charming,

1389
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:05,647
to some beads of force,
to some magic arrows.

1390
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:08,483
Using a magical staff
they found, the party

1391
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,787
ascended through some sort
of hatch in the floor.

1392
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:15,624
(laughter)

1393
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:18,627
(cheering)

1394
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:25,967
I fire a single arrow,
I use all of my focus,

1395
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:30,005
and also, I'm really beautiful
while I'm doing it.

1396
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:32,474
At this point, you've accrued
many magical arrows,

1397
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,442
so which one, you've got
non-lethal arrows,

1398
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:36,411
good-lined arrows,
sleep arrows...

1399
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,612
You have
this memorized,

1400
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:38,814
I don't understand
what's happening.

1401
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,516
I'm a Dungeon Master.

1402
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:43,952
Amazing... that's amazing.

1403
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,253
(cheering)

1404
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:48,490
Oh, shit.

1405
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:52,194
I'm takin' high fives,
I'm takin' all these high fives.

1406
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:53,795
Yeah.

1407
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:55,330
Yeah.

1408
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,767
Give him half... give him half
of the high fives.

1409
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:00,135
Here, those are
from those guys.

1410
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:01,636
There you go, yeah.

1411
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,638
Yeah!

1412
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,874
(cheering)

1413
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:07,676
He had your guy's weapons,
and names memorized...

1414
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:10,245
But also... and he remembers it
all, and he writes it all down.

1415
01:04:10,247 --> 01:04:12,447
It's amazing... I
did not know this.

1416
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,549
A friend of us said that,
"You know, the day he came,

1417
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,051
he'd been listening
to your Podcast, and he said,

1418
01:04:16,053 --> 01:04:17,452
'You know, I wanna go
see Harmontown, because

1419
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,321
I really feel like
I should play

1420
01:04:19,323 --> 01:04:21,556
Dungeons & Dragons
with Dan Harmon.'"

1421
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,625
He came to the show
with the intent

1422
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:26,528
of meeting him and being...
and doing D&D with him.

1423
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,929
That's incredible.

1424
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:30,432
 Gonna do a low stakes,
gentle stage dive

1425
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:33,702
 Just gonna go up to the edge
and make it come alive

1426
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,937
 Gonna crawl like a
little dog paddle

1427
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:39,074
 Gonna just go out there and
it's gonna be like a raffle

1428
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:41,176
 Like very, very careful

1429
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:42,711
 Very careful

1430
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,212
 Everyone's gonna be fine

1431
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,314
 Everything's gonna be fine

1432
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:49,217
 Come on down to Harmontown

1433
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,620
 Turn that frown upside down

1434
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:52,787
Wait, I gotta go backwards.

1435
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:55,056
 Pee is yellow,
poop is brown

1436
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,792
 Come on down to Harmontown

1437
01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:00,795
 Space, cosmos,
sea of humanity

1438
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:03,798
 Rockin' through,
I want to do reality

1439
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,701
 Fuck your momma,
fuck your daddy, fuck your dad

1440
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:09,771
 Holy shit, I feel like
shit down in Baghdad

1441
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:11,473
 Worship with me,
worship my ass

1442
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:13,441
Dan had never floated before
on a crowd.

1443
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:15,410
It's a really
exhilarating feeling.

1444
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,279
And it's a perfect metaphor
for what this is.

1445
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:21,182
It's just... he's a giant,
rich, hairy, toddler.

1446
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:24,119
He smells, he's got B.O.
from the bus.

1447
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:28,390
Just going, "Can you guys
paid $23, could you just

1448
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:31,660
carry me around the room
with your love?"

1449
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:33,395
That's insane.

1450
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,663
He could do no wrong.

1451
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:41,169
That's a transformative feeling,
like, like, it's like

1452
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:43,104
a trust exercise, it's like
it was fucking people

1453
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,873
holding you up, and they're
all nerds, you know,

1454
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,441
they all failed gym.

1455
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,642
Holy shit.

1456
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:48,610
Amazing.

1457
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:56,718
Dan has been on such a...
such an immense high.

1458
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,920
There's so many people
who came out, who were

1459
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:03,525
so kind and so responsive
and so loving, and...

1460
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:06,928
And, I love you, and thank you
so much, 'cause...

1461
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:09,564
He has given hope
to all of us

1462
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:12,133
who are self-destructive
and who are depressed,

1463
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,735
and who are anxious,
and who don't fit

1464
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:17,439
into normal society,
and makes us not feel alone.

1465
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,741
See you at the bar.

1466
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:22,410
I just really want to thank you
for, especially, Abed,

1467
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:25,146
I... I was diagnosed
with Asperger's

1468
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,982
like, about a year
before the show came out.

1469
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,651
Oh, I'm so jealous, I mean...

1470
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,052
I just need
to hug you for that.

1471
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:34,789
It's not... it's not
an easy diagnosis to score.

1472
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,758
You helped me stand up
for myself, and I never

1473
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,693
wanted to say that
to you directly,

1474
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,128
because I'm a chickenshit.

1475
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,698
(laughing)

1476
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48,336
(crowd noises)

1477
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:53,174
Every hero gets
what they want,

1478
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,378
but the big question is,
what do you do with it?

1479
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,649
You got where you thought
you've wanted to go,

1480
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:05,286
but, so what?

1481
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:08,523
(yelling and cheering)

1482
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:11,159
Dreams come true.

1483
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:14,095
Dreams come true in Brooklyn.

1484
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:17,632
Community's a wonderful show,
he's a tortured genius,

1485
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:23,471
and a wonderful eye for talent,
for DMs, like...

1486
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:25,573
Take care.

1487
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,275
Spencer signed my D20.

1488
01:07:30,113 --> 01:07:31,279
Can you take a picture
of us and Spencer?

1489
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:32,013
Yeah.

1490
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:33,014
Radical.

1491
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:34,282
You want me
in the middle, or...

1492
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:35,750
In the middle, Spencer,
I love you,

1493
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:36,518
you're the greatest.

1494
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,054
Thanks.

1495
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,722
All right.

1496
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:41,956
- What's your name?
- Chris.

1497
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,625
Chris, nice to meet you.

1498
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,360
I love your DM style,
it's fantastic.

1499
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:46,661
We just love you.

1500
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:49,664
(crowd noises)

1501
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:56,838
You wrote a Tumblr post
a few days ago

1502
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,440
that got a lot
of attention.

1503
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,274
Oh, yeah.

1504
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,341
And in it
you kind of

1505
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:02,444
identified yourself
as an introvert.

1506
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:05,680
Do you think that this tour
has helped you socially

1507
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,715
or has it hindered you,
has it hurt you?

1508
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:09,484
I think most
of the essence of it

1509
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,586
is that I don't make
small talk very well,

1510
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,821
but I've kind of had to

1511
01:08:12,823 --> 01:08:14,856
because people
just stand near you.

1512
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,758
There's a picture that
you painted in that post

1513
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,493
of what it's like
after the shows.

1514
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:19,828
It's not something
that I was like,

1515
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,496
"Oh, sign me up, I'd love
to do that," you know?

1516
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:22,764
Yeah.

1517
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:31,773
I'm not someone
who smiles very often,

1518
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:32,807
like, at all.

1519
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:33,875
It doesn't mean
I'm not happy.

1520
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:35,877
I just don't smile.

1521
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,879
Initially, every time
people would ask me

1522
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:40,882
for signatures and stuff,
and for pictures,

1523
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:42,884
it would make me really happy,
and so it would be genuine.

1524
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:45,753
But at some point,
I noticed that when people

1525
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,422
would approach me
and say hi to me,

1526
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:49,691
I'd just, like,
put on a smile.

1527
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:52,594
I wasn't compelled to smile,
but did it anyway

1528
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:56,998
because it seemed like the right
thing to do in the context.

1529
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,601
And, um, this whole trip
is trying

1530
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:01,636
for everyone
on some level,

1531
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,839
and it's also
a very public situation.

1532
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:07,509
So it just kinda amplifies
all of that energy.

1533
01:09:15,552 --> 01:09:17,452
(cell phone ringing)

1534
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:18,786
Hello.

1535
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:21,055
Hey, Dan, I have
the studio and network ready

1536
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:23,591
for the Notes call,
if you're ready.

1537
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:25,360
I'm all set, thanks.

1538
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:26,628
Hello?

1539
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,695
Hello, hey guys.

1540
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:28,429
How are ya?

1541
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:29,697
I'm good, thank you.

1542
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:30,765
Good.

1543
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:31,966
Well, we really
enjoyed the script.

1544
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:33,368
Oh great,
it's great to hear.

1545
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,236
But, of course,
we have comments.

1546
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:37,472
So we'll share them.

1547
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:40,141
The first thing
is super small, on page 2.

1548
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:42,677
We just wanted some short
description of Tammy.

1549
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,213
And when Spencer is, sort of,
trying to tell him, you know,

1550
01:09:45,215 --> 01:09:46,447
"Oh, okay, I did it
with your mom,"

1551
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:48,750
it just seems
like, I don't know.

1552
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:49,617
It seems just weird.

1553
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:51,052
Okay.

1554
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:55,056
On 43, we didn't know what urban
zing was; Is that a thing?

1555
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:58,760
Jack wasn't actually trying
to say anything about her mom.

1556
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:00,929
Oh, it was sort of like
a "your mother" kinda thing?

1557
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,197
Yeah.

1558
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:03,264
We didn't get that.

1559
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:06,768
On 45... on 48...
small thing on 52... 54.

1560
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,169
It's just the tiniest note ever.

1561
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:09,504
Got it, got it.

1562
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,673
And the last thing, when he
starts singing the song,

1563
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:15,810
we just didn't get why this act
on his part would turn her.

1564
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:18,446
Like, why would that show
her why she should stay?

1565
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:20,181
Right, got it.

1566
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,583
So that's all we got.

1567
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:22,650
Okay, great.

1568
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,285
Um, hurry up.

1569
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:25,787
When do you need this, guys?

1570
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:27,522
Can you do it now?

1571
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:30,792
Stay up all night if you have to
and get us something tomorrow.

1572
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:32,961
Yeah, I... I... I get the message.

1573
01:10:32,963 --> 01:10:33,928
Thank you, sir.

1574
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,562
Okay, bye bye.

1575
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,630
Thanks, Dan, bye!

1576
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:44,138
Uh, yes I'll get
started immediately.

1577
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:51,446
Right after I go do a show.

1578
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:53,748
Yeah, any time
you're ready, Hosni.

1579
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,617
All right, all right, all right.

1580
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:57,085
Chevy's barely in this one.

1581
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,420
Hurray!

1582
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,688
We're not that at all.

1583
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,123
We thought you were talking
about index finger.

1584
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,525
All right, cold open, fade in,
anthropology classroom.

1585
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:06,261
The classroom is in full...

1586
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:07,629
Dan and I went
through a valley

1587
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:10,765
where we weren't talking
to each other for a year.

1588
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:15,203
But I knew he was doing
something with Sony and NBC,

1589
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:17,972
and more often than not,
these things never go anywhere.

1590
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:20,341
I went through a lot of ups
and downs and things,

1591
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:23,011
and I just
kept writing pilots

1592
01:11:23,013 --> 01:11:26,781
and eventually one stuck
and that was<i> Community.</i>

1593
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,083
You're lucky, Jeff,
it's not too late for you.

1594
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:30,518
Have a family.

1595
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,186
Share your life.

1596
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:33,788
Pierce, who did
you call last week

1597
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,423
after you farted on Vaughn?

1598
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:36,924
You.

1599
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:39,527
And who Abed call up when that
squirrel stole his hot dog?

1600
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:40,395
Me.

1601
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:42,030
That's sharing your life.

1602
01:11:42,032 --> 01:11:44,666
If you have friends,
you have family.

1603
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:48,503
If you look at<i> Community,</i>
it is full of hope

1604
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:51,105
and it is full of people,
like in real life,

1605
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:54,208
who are broken,
who are trying to do better.

1606
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,277
And I think that speaks
to a lot of people

1607
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:59,714
who sometimes feel
overlooked, or lost,

1608
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:04,152
that you can really create
some kind of community.

1609
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:07,322
Probably most favorite person,
Dan Harmon.

1610
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:09,324
(cheering)

1611
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:15,196
When I pitched the show,
I was pitching the story

1612
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:18,666
of a guy who, like me,
had gone to community college.

1613
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,902
I was pitching
a very meta story

1614
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:24,005
about an asshole

1615
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:26,607
that learned
to love strangers.

1616
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:30,078
There has been this dialogue
in this love letter

1617
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,280
between our fans and our show
because they're the ones

1618
01:12:32,282 --> 01:12:36,017
who have kept us afloat
for many seasons.

1619
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:39,520
Season three was a bit of
a heartbreak for a lot of us

1620
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,823
that worked on Community
because it was the first time

1621
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:44,058
that we were
snatched off the air.

1622
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:47,962
What was the period
like, sort of,

1623
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,164
when you didn't know when these
episodes were gonna come on?

1624
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:53,101
It's... it's inconceivable
to say this and believe it,

1625
01:12:53,103 --> 01:12:54,936
but I started drinking more.

1626
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,104
- What?
- You did?

1627
01:12:56,106 --> 01:12:58,573
The show's always
been pretty chaotic,

1628
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,876
and, you know, the end of season
three was not the first time,

1629
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,078
on the show, that we
didn't have a script.

1630
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,047
He's working for a business
at the end of the day,

1631
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,882
like, it's a business.

1632
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,651
I think it's... to people
who work above me,

1633
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:13,388
I am a... I am
a liability that...

1634
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,456
that isn't worth
the benefit.

1635
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,824
What does that mean?

1636
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:19,327
Low rated show that's not
generating much revenue.

1637
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:22,096
Well, let me ask you, did
you... did you see it coming?

1638
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:24,365
That you were gonna
be, like, fired?

1639
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,833
I always joked about it.

1640
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:27,602
Maybe I... maybe they
got the idea from me.

1641
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,441
It was stressful,
and when everything happened,

1642
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:36,644
it, um, it was hard.

1643
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:40,114
It was very hard
for everyone.

1644
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,583
I could imagine that
creating these characters

1645
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,620
and then not being able
to see them on their way

1646
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:48,389
would probably
be devastating.

1647
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,958
And he might've felt
like he had let himself

1648
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,627
and everybody else down.

1649
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:54,562
Why do you do
this to people?

1650
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:55,863
Why do you hurt them?

1651
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:59,867
Why do you let them count
on you and let them down?

1652
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,669
Ah.

1653
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,037
I can't stay mad at you.

1654
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,811
So, Alex, Dan and Erin
were about to talk about

1655
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:12,346
a little spat they had today,
which I know nothing about.

1656
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:14,282
Maybe you could counsel them
right now through this.

1657
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,784
Maybe you could mediate
through... through this crisis.

1658
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,719
Yeah, I'd like
to hear about it.

1659
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:23,324
So, I was talking to two fans
about glassblowing,

1660
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:26,360
foregoing the opportunity
to write a TV show,

1661
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,029
being a hero, really.

1662
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:29,730
Right, of course.

1663
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:33,434
My girlfriend comes up to me
and she says, "Uh, I don't know,

1664
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:36,170
uh, if you wanted to go
or if you don't want to go,

1665
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:37,505
but the van's leaving."

1666
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,807
I was also listening
to them about glass

1667
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,810
and the lightning striking
the sand and that making,

1668
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,313
like, these big branches
of glass and things.

1669
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,347
It was cool.

1670
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:49,450
And I was tired,
so I was like,

1671
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:52,587
"Oh, I'm gonna let Dan
know that I'm gonna go.

1672
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:53,855
Maybe he'll wanna go too.

1673
01:14:53,857 --> 01:14:55,189
I love him,
love him dearly."

1674
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:57,291
There's another van...
van, van, van, van, van.

1675
01:14:57,293 --> 01:14:58,493
And I don't care.

1676
01:14:58,495 --> 01:14:59,727
I'm talking to guys
about glassblowing.

1677
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:01,095
And you love glassblowing?

1678
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:02,430
Well, I did that night.

1679
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:03,397
Like, really think about it.

1680
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:04,699
Like, my first question was,

1681
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:06,501
"Do you just take a bunch
of sand and heat it up?

1682
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:07,502
Does it turn to glass?"

1683
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:10,471
The answer's no, Jeff.

1684
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:12,740
Dan's big thing is
don't tell me what to do.

1685
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:13,808
You can't
tell Dan what to do.

1686
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,443
You can't tell
Dan what to do.

1687
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:17,044
Like, I mean, you can,

1688
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,146
but it can get pretty
fucking uncomfortable.

1689
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:20,348
So then what happ...

1690
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,283
the thing that really
causes the fight is...

1691
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:24,519
is the tour manager
comes up to me

1692
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:28,122
and says, "Hey, Dan,
so there's a van leaving now

1693
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:29,390
and there's a van
leaving in 15 minutes.

1694
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:30,625
Which one do you
want to be on?"

1695
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:31,959
And when I see him
telling it to Erin,

1696
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:34,428
I was like, "Huh.

1697
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,963
You hear how easy that is?"

1698
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:36,797
It's rude.

1699
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:39,300
Yeah, well, fuck you guys.

1700
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:40,701
And then I went
back to the hotel room

1701
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,203
and I was crying
in the bathroom.

1702
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,572
I would've been... I would've
been up here tonight

1703
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:48,309
teaching motherfuckers how
to blow a bottle outta dirt.

1704
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:52,580
He has the ability to,
like, really perfectly

1705
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:56,684
succinctly word things that
cut right through you.

1706
01:15:56,686 --> 01:16:00,154
It escalated
from there and Dan, uh,

1707
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:02,890
Dan tore me a real good one.

1708
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:06,327
He said a lot of mean things
to me, including the C word.

1709
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:08,729
(booing)

1710
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:12,099
And made me feel
pretty worthless.

1711
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:13,834
So, in a roundabout way...

1712
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:15,670
So, by applause, should they
break up or stay together?

1713
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:17,004
We're staying together
no matter what.

1714
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,906
That's the problem.

1715
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,409
I'm never gonna leave her and if
she leaves me, I'll kill myself.

1716
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:24,579
Before you did the tour,

1717
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:26,747
were you considering
the implications

1718
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,717
that even just the stress
of being on the road

1719
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:31,619
might have
on your relationship?

1720
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:33,554
Um, I mean,
it makes total sense.

1721
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:37,091
Like, my dad who's a preacher,
when we were growing up,

1722
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,327
he would not be
around sometimes

1723
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:42,029
because he would be at someone's
house praying with them

1724
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,831
or he would be
staying after church

1725
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,833
and I remember, like, feeling
really jealous.

1726
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,568
Because I was like,
"Gosh, if I was a stranger,

1727
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:50,237
I feel like he would give me
more attention right now."

1728
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,873
 I fucked your mama
till she had no body

1729
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:56,344
This tour is Harmontown.

1730
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:58,579
So it's about him.

1731
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:00,214
Everyone's focus is on him,

1732
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:03,618
so he is also just
totally focused on him.

1733
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,252
So if I'm upset
about something,

1734
01:17:05,254 --> 01:17:08,756
like, it really
is just my problem.

1735
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,726
 I'm a God

1736
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:12,627
 I'm a God

1737
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,528
 This is<i> Harmontown</i>

1738
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:17,031
(cheering)

1739
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:19,467
Let's hear it one more time
for the mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

1740
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:21,469
(cheering)

1741
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:29,644
Again, if you bought
anything, I will sign it.

1742
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:32,413
I won't leave until
every last fucking scrap

1743
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:34,281
of your shit is signed.

1744
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:36,217
That's... that's my curse
and my gift.

1745
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:36,951
I love you all.

1746
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:37,985
Thank you, Arlington.

1747
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,253
And, uh...

1748
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,560
I told 300 people
that you called me a cunt

1749
01:17:46,562 --> 01:17:47,895
and now thousands.

1750
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:49,430
Yeah, that was
the best you could do.

1751
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:52,400
That... that... that hot button
makes 'em go, "Ahh".

1752
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:53,634
That was not
the best I could do.

1753
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:55,736
I could've said more.

1754
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:57,138
I didn't say everything.

1755
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,807
- Well bring it.
- No.

1756
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:00,941
- Tell 'em.
- There's no point.

1757
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:02,209
No, there's no point.

1758
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:03,644
Well what did I say
that was so bad?

1759
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:04,645
It's not what you said.

1760
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:05,479
It was some things
that you did.

1761
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,881
Yeah.

1762
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:09,083
No, you would... yeah.

1763
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:12,753
Not necessary.

1764
01:18:12,755 --> 01:18:15,022
It's more, uh, nuanced.

1765
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:28,402
I definitely tend to relive
the same relationship cycle

1766
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:31,906
over and over again.

1767
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:35,643
I think my mom probably
formed my opinions about women.

1768
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:38,045
Everyone's mom is
the first woman they meet,

1769
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,647
and their dad
is the first man.

1770
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:42,817
So, you're like, "Okay, here's
how men and women interact."

1771
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:49,557
My dad would hit us with a belt
if we had a felony offense.

1772
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:53,027
My mom handled the misdemeanor
offenses with more,

1773
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:57,531
just, kind of, spontaneous
slaps across the face.

1774
01:18:57,533 --> 01:19:00,000
My only recourse
in that household

1775
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,970
were some of the craziest
people there were.

1776
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,805
And I catch myself
being incredibly,

1777
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:07,675
like, abusive to Erin,
like verbally and emotionally.

1778
01:19:07,677 --> 01:19:11,145
Like, when she starts
to remind me of my mom,

1779
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:14,181
like, the idea of, "Now she's
got notes on my behavior.

1780
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:15,983
There's always
a new way for me

1781
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:17,685
to improve the way
I deal with her."

1782
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:19,220
And I turn
into this,

1783
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:20,821
if I've had
enough drinks in me,

1784
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:26,427
I can turn into a...
like, bone-chillingly,

1785
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:31,031
dispassionate Hannibal Lecter,
Kevin Spacey in Seven.

1786
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:35,102
I shift into this persona
that is sociopathically,

1787
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,438
kind of, gleeful
at the, kind of like,

1788
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,041
disconnection that I feel...
you know what I mean?

1789
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:45,780
Yeah.

1790
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:54,021
Yeah.

1791
01:19:54,023 --> 01:19:56,891
'Cause you can feel the...
when I'm looking at someone

1792
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:59,794
like they're an insect,
you know?

1793
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,462
Like, I turn everything off.

1794
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:04,064
There's no conscientiousness,
like, standing between me

1795
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:06,567
and saying something
with the direct intent

1796
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:09,503
of, like, humbling someone.

1797
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,438
The abuse is
in the behavior.

1798
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,340
It's the... it's the glare

1799
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:17,178
and the, like,
the just flaunting,

1800
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,380
like, the fact that
I don't feel anything.

1801
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,781
You said backstage
something about the idea,

1802
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,850
like, that you
like the tears.

1803
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:24,585
There's a part
when you're in that mode.

1804
01:20:24,587 --> 01:20:26,353
When I'm way overboard, yeah.

1805
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:28,656
When she finally
starts to cry,

1806
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:31,458
and then I... I feel
something inside me goes,

1807
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,228
"Uh, delicious tears.

1808
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:35,863
Jackpot."

1809
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:37,698
Put them on a cupcake.

1810
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,466
Cry until you can't anymore.

1811
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:41,335
Then...

1812
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,438
"Sorry, I probably went
a little overboard, honey.

1813
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,807
Let's think twice before
we give me an adjustment."

1814
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:49,410
You... you actually enjoy it,
or like, do you actually feel...

1815
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:50,377
No, no, no.

1816
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:51,879
It's all about defensiveness.

1817
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:53,514
It's about being threatened.

1818
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:55,482
You become... I...
I... if I'm a child

1819
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:59,787
and I feel like my mommy
is trying to get away

1820
01:20:59,789 --> 01:21:02,857
with something coming at me,
like, I need to win.

1821
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,258
I need to defeat.

1822
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:08,229
I need to defend myself.

1823
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:09,663
I don't want... I don't
want anyone to have to deal

1824
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:14,134
with the fact that I sometimes
can be incredibly cruel.

1825
01:21:14,136 --> 01:21:17,905
Over the last 20 years
I've begged and pleaded,

1826
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:19,607
every expert I can find,

1827
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:21,976
to flip the switch
and make me never ever do that

1828
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:25,512
to another
human being again.

1829
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:28,482
I want to be the activated
healthy version of myself.

1830
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:31,185
I want my cathexis
to be stripped away.

1831
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:32,620
I want what remains to be

1832
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:35,723
someone capable
of changing the world.

1833
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:40,494
And, uh, more importantly,
I want to remove this part of me

1834
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,897
that can do so much damage

1835
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:47,067
to the most important people
in my life.

1836
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,069
(cheering)

1837
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:08,122
Yeah, go ahead.

1838
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:09,823
I'm gonna hit
the merch table.

1839
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,266
(sighing)

1840
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:31,912
Well, that was... that
was weightless, right?

1841
01:22:31,914 --> 01:22:33,814
They got their
money's worth.

1842
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:41,388
I... I don't...
I can't think of anything

1843
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:44,091
that I have left
that I have to hide

1844
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:48,862
uh, from people
that I'm doing a show for.

1845
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:28,135
All of this honesty,
all of this talking

1846
01:23:28,137 --> 01:23:30,504
about turn-ons
and turn-offs,

1847
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,439
and pet peeves,
and kinks.

1848
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:36,877
What is that...
why is that important?

1849
01:23:36,879 --> 01:23:40,447
What's the best
you could hope for...

1850
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:43,484
when you're doing that?

1851
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:46,553
Knowing that you're a dick
doesn't make it okay.

1852
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:48,122
Wonderful... it's
a beautiful thing

1853
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:50,657
to see a dick
admit he's a dick.

1854
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:54,528
It's fantastic
'cause it's usually followed

1855
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:59,099
by someone...

1856
01:23:59,101 --> 01:24:02,002
someone not
being a dick anymore.

1857
01:24:02,004 --> 01:24:05,439
Growing up.

1858
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:10,044
So now we have this new thing
in our society with ear cameras,

1859
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:13,480
and blogs, and Tweets,

1860
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:16,850
and reality shows,
and no wars.

1861
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:25,826
We have, uh,
250 million manchildren...

1862
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:28,996
figuring out what makes them
a dick and celebrating it

1863
01:24:28,998 --> 01:24:31,999
and nobody growing up
and not being a dick anymore.

1864
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:46,013
I don't get to be
a hero anymore.

1865
01:24:46,015 --> 01:24:47,314
I have to deal
with the fact that

1866
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:49,850
I've gotten everything
that I want.

1867
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:54,721
I have to grow up.

1868
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:56,723
I have to be a grown up.

1869
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:15,909
I need to jump onto this pilot
and complete it in time to...

1870
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:17,644
I mean, I'm already
kinda fucked,

1871
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,179
but if I can
get them something,

1872
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:22,382
I might still have a chance
of being one of the candidates.

1873
01:25:24,487 --> 01:25:27,454
This is something that I can
probably get Erin's help with,

1874
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,556
and it'll help me
to talk to somebody else.

1875
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:32,226
And she might enjoy that.

1876
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:36,063
Next note is, "It's when
he kinda lays into her

1877
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:39,766
in this final big monologue,
and he says, 'Bad news.

1878
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:41,768
You well-organized
judgmental cyborg types

1879
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,570
that manipulate people
to get everything they want,

1880
01:25:43,572 --> 01:25:45,806
you don't tend to create
much of anything.

1881
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,008
So you'll always
need people like me.

1882
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,278
Great news though, you get
to have everything else.'"

1883
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,347
And their question was,

1884
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,949
"What does he mean
by everything else?"

1885
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:57,217
And then I said, "Oh, cars

1886
01:25:57,219 --> 01:26:00,521
and houses
and success and power.

1887
01:26:00,523 --> 01:26:04,825
You get to have everything
but creativity."

1888
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:07,494
Oh.

1889
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:09,029
So can you
list those things?

1890
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:10,430
Money, power, control,

1891
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:15,736
private islands where you
hunt humans for sport.

1892
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:19,173
All right, done with that.

1893
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,574
Okay, last note is actually

1894
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:22,709
probably the toughest
of the bunch.

1895
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:25,345
"Jack starts singing the song.

1896
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:28,615
Why would this act,
on his part, turn her?"

1897
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:30,817
What if he says to her,
like, "You can't...

1898
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:34,221
you can't turn your back on
your passion, on your art form."

1899
01:26:34,223 --> 01:26:38,992
Yeah, uh, she needs to say...

1900
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:41,828
She says, "Well,
like you... like you did?"

1901
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,064
Yeah.

1902
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:45,866
That means he'll change, right?

1903
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,267
Mm-hm.

1904
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,376
Um, then there's
announcement for the bus.

1905
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,145
She stands up,
looks down at him.

1906
01:26:58,147 --> 01:27:00,747
"You're not gonna change,
Jack... Dad.

1907
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:02,349
That's your whole deal, right?

1908
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:04,017
You don't change for anybody.

1909
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:05,385
You get to have your integrity

1910
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,788
and everyone else gets
to have everything else.

1911
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:08,522
See ya."

1912
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:09,990
She starts to walk away.

1913
01:27:09,992 --> 01:27:10,958
Mm-hm.

1914
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,859
And that means he'll change.

1915
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:13,827
Yeah.

1916
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,062
It means he's capable.

1917
01:27:21,136 --> 01:27:22,803
Depending on where
you put thresholds

1918
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:24,571
and calls to adventure
and whatnot,

1919
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:27,941
uh, we're closer to the end
than the beginning.

1920
01:27:27,943 --> 01:27:30,777
Also, I've been
struggling with a...

1921
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:32,479
with an epic realization

1922
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:35,115
that I am the villain
of this story.

1923
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,016
And if that's the case,

1924
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:38,018
I think that Spencer...

1925
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,987
Spencer Crittenden,

1926
01:27:39,989 --> 01:27:42,589
my own dungeon master,

1927
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,491
may be the hero.

1928
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:46,426
He's certainly a hero.

1929
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,894
He has been plucked
from the security

1930
01:27:47,896 --> 01:27:49,096
of his parents' basement

1931
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:51,498
and whisked across the threshold
into a strange land

1932
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,899
to which he has adapted.

1933
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:54,234
Going down a road of trials,

1934
01:27:54,236 --> 01:27:57,604
dealing with drunk dicks
and adoring fans.

1935
01:27:57,606 --> 01:28:00,907
He's met with the Goddess
of Unconditional Appreciation,

1936
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:03,543
and all of this has
only caused him to realize

1937
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,879
how... how alone
he will always be.

1938
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:08,749
It's very heroic
sounding stuff.

1939
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:12,419
Much more heroic
than, uh, than me.

1940
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:17,391
Which makes me realize
that I must kill Spencer

1941
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:19,793
or he must kill me.

1942
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:23,196
So, um, Spencer,
if you're watching,

1943
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:25,365
prepare to be destroyed.

1944
01:28:25,367 --> 01:28:26,500
You're saying,
story structure-wise,

1945
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:27,567
he's on a journey.

1946
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:29,202
He's meeting
the outside world.

1947
01:28:29,204 --> 01:28:31,338
He's coming to grips
with other people

1948
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,939
and what that
means about him.

1949
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:36,443
So we're gonna find out that
he's the hero of this, like...

1950
01:28:36,445 --> 01:28:38,378
And that makes me,
like, Jafar.

1951
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,814
(laughing)

1952
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:42,416
I didn't mean to say it
like Christopher Walken, but.

1953
01:28:42,418 --> 01:28:43,950
It's Jafar.

1954
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:45,319
That makes me, like, Jafar.

1955
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:46,720
Yeah it is.

1956
01:28:46,722 --> 01:28:47,688
Aladdin.

1957
01:28:51,393 --> 01:28:54,094
You seemed a little
sad in your blog.

1958
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:55,562
I just get depressed.

1959
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,631
I mean, I've always got
depressed when nothing happens,

1960
01:28:57,633 --> 01:28:58,732
when everything's happened,

1961
01:28:58,734 --> 01:29:00,033
when good stuff happens,
bad stuff happens.

1962
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:03,136
Yeah, you... you said,
"Everyone could appreciate me,

1963
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:05,272
but no one, you know,
no one can understand me."

1964
01:29:05,274 --> 01:29:06,273
Yeah.

1965
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:07,607
Like, like that realization,

1966
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:09,576
giving me full permission
to be who I am,

1967
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:12,879
and then you're like, "Oh yeah,
who I am is still alone."

1968
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:17,117
I think those,
just, personal relationships

1969
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,553
seem to be
the most important.

1970
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:22,422
But, um, I don't
have very, very many.

1971
01:29:22,424 --> 01:29:26,326
I'm just saying, like, people
want you to be who you are.

1972
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:29,029
You're a hero to them because of
your incorruptibility.

1973
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,665
They like the... they like...
they like what they see.

1974
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:34,801
They've liked what they've
seen for a long time.

1975
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:38,171
Everybody that I've ever
talked to since the first time

1976
01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:39,639
we had you up
on stage was going,

1977
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:41,208
like, "Do you realize
what you have here?

1978
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,577
Like, what...
how did this happen?"

1979
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:45,512
It was like,
magic, you know?

1980
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:47,714
Like, going limp
and letting shit happen.

1981
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,649
Like, the show
was open to this guy

1982
01:29:49,651 --> 01:29:50,851
that wanted
to dungeon master...

1983
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:52,152
being our dungeon master.

1984
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:56,256
Here's the thing that,
I think, saves me every time,

1985
01:29:56,258 --> 01:29:58,358
and I think saves
all the people out there.

1986
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,594
I truly believe,
about myself

1987
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:02,295
and about every single person
in that audience,

1988
01:30:02,297 --> 01:30:05,198
that they want
other people to be happy.

1989
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:11,772
You can be selfishly motivated,
that's ego-driven,

1990
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:13,940
but that's as good as ego-driven
gets is when you go,

1991
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:17,010
"I want to be the guy

1992
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:19,179
who makes people happy."

1993
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:31,525
Good job, baby.

1994
01:30:31,527 --> 01:30:33,026
Everything's gonna be fine.

1995
01:30:38,801 --> 01:30:41,034
Higher.

1996
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:42,369
Hi.

1997
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:47,908
Well, that's it.

1998
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:51,378
Um, this is the moment
when it really sinks in

1999
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:56,082
that we're... we're done
and that we did it.

2000
01:30:56,084 --> 01:30:58,418
We did a little tour.

2001
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,686
All right, Harmon,
I think it's time

2002
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:01,521
to bring this train
right into the station.

2003
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,890
And talk about
what we learned?

2004
01:31:03,892 --> 01:31:04,858
It's so sad.

2005
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,026
It's a bummer.

2006
01:31:06,028 --> 01:31:09,396
Have we grown
at all as people?

2007
01:31:09,398 --> 01:31:12,065
I think we have.

2008
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:15,535
I know I have, you guys.

2009
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:19,639
From this one show
that I've joined you on.

2010
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,809
The show, it just dissolves,
and everybody's in the show.

2011
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,244
Like, we prove
there's no show.

2012
01:31:24,246 --> 01:31:26,146
And then the audience
embraces there's no show.

2013
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,615
And the show gets to be,
kind of, this crackpot

2014
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:31,218
of weird ingredients that
happen to be there that night.

2015
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,619
It's, kind of,
marvelous to me,

2016
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:35,522
like, in the sense that
I marvel at what goes on

2017
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:37,491
and how completely different
it is every time.

2018
01:31:39,795 --> 01:31:43,296
 As I close down the show

2019
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:46,533
 I wonder how to grow

2020
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:49,836
 In Harmontown

2021
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,939
 Where pee is yellow,
and poop is brown

2022
01:31:55,444 --> 01:31:58,812
 I see a sea of hands

2023
01:31:58,814 --> 01:32:02,415
 Across this fair land

2024
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:05,218
 Reaching out for Harmontown

2025
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:10,957
 I see Brooklyn
coming at me with style

2026
01:32:10,959 --> 01:32:12,659
 I love everyone here

2027
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:14,427
 I see their eyes
and their smiles

2028
01:32:14,429 --> 01:32:16,396
 And I just wanna
reach out to them

2029
01:32:16,398 --> 01:32:18,765
and welcome them
to<i> Harmontown</i>

2030
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:19,866
That's it.

2031
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:21,735
I mean, we're
pretty much done now.

2032
01:32:21,737 --> 01:32:24,771
It's almost like a new start.

2033
01:32:24,773 --> 01:32:26,072
It sounds pretty contrived,

2034
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:27,407
but that's really
how I feel about it.

2035
01:32:29,745 --> 01:32:32,212
Honestly, no joke,
getting to know you

2036
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:34,648
is my favorite part
of this tour.

2037
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:36,182
That's so awesome, man.

2038
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:38,685
I really can't imagine
Harmontown without you in it.

2039
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:39,953
You're a centering force.

2040
01:32:39,955 --> 01:32:42,355
You... you're
the world's narrator.

2041
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,927
You're okay.

2042
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:48,228
You too, man.

2043
01:32:49,798 --> 01:32:52,599
When people come up and go,
"I was sitting in my apartment,

2044
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:55,835
surrounded by pizza boxes
and mannequin legs of my own.

2045
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:57,571
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

2046
01:32:57,573 --> 01:32:59,339
My next door neighbor
didn't like me.

2047
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:01,074
I felt like every time
I opened my mouth,

2048
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:04,578
I had to lie because I don't
like what's inside of me.

2049
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:07,714
And then I heard your podcast
or I saw your TV show

2050
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:09,816
and something about
it made me feel

2051
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:12,485
like I didn't have to be
ashamed of myself anymore.

2052
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:15,989
And it's made me more
able to express myself

2053
01:33:15,991 --> 01:33:19,025
and it's made me able
to do what you're doing,

2054
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:23,063
which is find other people who
don't mind what I'm saying."

2055
01:33:23,065 --> 01:33:24,364
I'm a human being!

2056
01:33:24,366 --> 01:33:26,366
(cheering)

2057
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,212
We did it, America.

2058
01:33:44,686 --> 01:33:47,754
 Whoa oh oh

2059
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:51,291
 Whoa oh oh

2060
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:55,495
 Whoa oh oh oh oh

2061
01:33:55,497 --> 01:33:57,564
Ah!

2062
01:33:57,566 --> 01:33:58,632
We did it!

2063
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:02,102
See you soon, buddy.

2064
01:34:02,104 --> 01:34:03,103
Now, now.

2065
01:34:03,105 --> 01:34:04,704
I'll see you
in a couple days, right?

2066
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:06,106
Can I get a Dan Harmon hug too?

2067
01:34:06,108 --> 01:34:07,040
Sure.

2068
01:34:07,042 --> 01:34:09,009
Oh, thanks for everything.

2069
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:11,611
They grow on trees.

2070
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:14,914
I feel like I'm never gonna get
the chance to do this again.

2071
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:18,685
I mean, it's not everyday that
someone who's rich and famous

2072
01:34:18,687 --> 01:34:20,253
pulls you out of obscurity

2073
01:34:20,255 --> 01:34:22,422
and just lifts you
up on a pedestal.

2074
01:34:22,424 --> 01:34:24,991
People imagine themselves
being rock stars

2075
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,893
so they can have
a life like this.

2076
01:34:26,895 --> 01:34:29,396
And all I had to do
was be a nerd as a child.

2077
01:34:31,299 --> 01:34:32,766
Hello!

2078
01:34:32,768 --> 01:34:34,067
Hey, welcome home!

2079
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:36,369
Hey, I'm home.

2080
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:37,303
Did you miss me?

2081
01:34:37,305 --> 01:34:38,805
Oh, of course.

2082
01:34:38,807 --> 01:34:40,006
The great Spencer.

2083
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:45,645
I hope that I'll approach
life differently,

2084
01:34:45,647 --> 01:34:47,180
you know,
after this whole thing.

2085
01:34:49,685 --> 01:34:52,419
I don't think people are
really as aware of our mistakes

2086
01:34:52,421 --> 01:34:55,422
as we are and we just
think and live in fear

2087
01:34:55,424 --> 01:34:57,057
that everyone's judging us.

2088
01:34:57,059 --> 01:34:58,391
But they're just doing
their own shit

2089
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:00,927
and worrying about that
everyone's judging them.

2090
01:35:00,929 --> 01:35:02,462
So, in light of that,

2091
01:35:02,464 --> 01:35:04,531
it's like I don't have
to worry about myself as much

2092
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:06,966
because people just kinda
enjoy what I'm about.

2093
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:10,937
I mean, I very much
hope that I can apply

2094
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:12,939
what I've learned
to the rest of my life.

2095
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:17,143
But, I don't know.

2096
01:35:17,145 --> 01:35:18,478
I'm a pretty stubborn person.

2097
01:35:32,094 --> 01:35:34,994
We're back in my bed.

2098
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:39,065
Back with my kitty,

2099
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,900
who I missed very much.

2100
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:46,673
So, um, now that
it's all over...

2101
01:35:46,675 --> 01:35:49,509
um, tell me
what you learned.

2102
01:35:57,352 --> 01:36:02,822
I, uh... tried too hard
for an audience

2103
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:08,094
that wanted me
to... just exist.

2104
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,663
I have just been drunk

2105
01:36:10,665 --> 01:36:14,734
for an audience
that didn't mind.

2106
01:36:14,736 --> 01:36:16,169
I came clean

2107
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:19,405
as much as I
had dirt left.

2108
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,110
There's not much more to me

2109
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:27,781
than a guy that just wants
people to like him.

2110
01:36:29,384 --> 01:36:34,554
I learned that
I have effects on people.

2111
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:38,024
I have effects on strangers
that admire me.

2112
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:41,427
I have effects
on 23 year old dungeon masters

2113
01:36:41,429 --> 01:36:43,930
whose lives are
not yet fully formed

2114
01:36:43,932 --> 01:36:47,700
and therefore can be sucked
into the gravity of mine.

2115
01:36:47,702 --> 01:36:50,436
Um, and, uh,
that's a... that's a...

2116
01:36:50,438 --> 01:36:53,306
that's a good thing
for a guy like me

2117
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:57,143
to be able to have
effects on people.

2118
01:36:57,145 --> 01:37:01,114
That... that means
that it's up to me.

2119
01:37:03,618 --> 01:37:04,717
I'm 40 years old.

2120
01:37:08,056 --> 01:37:11,491
I hafta, like,
become responsible.

2121
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:19,232
And, uh, I can move on to
whatever the next step is.

2122
01:37:23,438 --> 01:37:27,173
From Hollywood, California,
<i>Harmontown...</i>

2123
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:29,175
(unintelligible announcing)

2124
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:31,177
(cheering)

2125
01:37:44,326 --> 01:37:47,360
Hey!

2126
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,863
If it seems
like I'm taller,

2127
01:37:49,865 --> 01:37:51,497
they've raised the stage
here at Meltdown.

2128
01:37:51,499 --> 01:37:54,400
It's... it's not just
because I got my job back.

2129
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:55,702
I'm not, like, floating.

2130
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:57,704
(cheering)

2131
01:38:20,962 --> 01:38:23,796
Wonderful, let's do
that one more time.

2132
01:38:23,798 --> 01:38:26,599
I'm, uh, I'm on Community.

2133
01:38:26,601 --> 01:38:28,935
I'm on Community.

2134
01:38:28,937 --> 01:38:29,669
Do you need to...

2135
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:31,537
I'm sorry.

2136
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:33,806
Thanks.

2137
01:38:33,808 --> 01:38:35,074
Superstar's gonna go away.

2138
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:36,776
He's too good for us now.

2139
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:40,313
We... we knew you
when you were nobody.

2140
01:38:40,315 --> 01:38:41,748
Son of a bitch.

2141
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,883
Let's go on the bell
and let's roll.

2142
01:38:43,885 --> 01:38:45,885
(unintelligible chatter)

2143
01:38:52,127 --> 01:38:53,426
All right, here we go.

2144
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:54,827
Yeah.

2145
01:38:54,829 --> 01:38:57,497
Ready and action.

2146
01:38:57,499 --> 01:38:59,966
Hello.

2147
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,935
What do you think
happens after you die?

2148
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:06,572
I don't know.

2149
01:39:06,574 --> 01:39:07,840
You're lucky.

2150
01:39:07,842 --> 01:39:10,109
All right,
cut that right here.

2151
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,644
Guys, that's it.

2152
01:39:11,646 --> 01:39:13,313
Fix your wrath on Spencer.

2153
01:39:13,315 --> 01:39:15,315
(cheering)

2154
01:39:19,354 --> 01:39:21,020
All that matters,
at the end of it all,

2155
01:39:21,022 --> 01:39:24,757
is the content on the screen
for these 13 episodes.

2156
01:39:24,759 --> 01:39:26,459
Doesn't matter
what time slot we have.

2157
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:28,795
Doesn't matter
what our ratings are.

2158
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:31,831
I have to just work,
and, uh, make the show good.

2159
01:39:33,802 --> 01:39:35,101
For me,

2160
01:39:35,103 --> 01:39:38,905
it's a way of reaching out,
touching people,

2161
01:39:38,907 --> 01:39:41,040
making them happy.

2162
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:44,544
And, uh, that's, uh,

2163
01:39:44,546 --> 01:39:46,846
that's the best kinda
therapy I can get.
