1
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:07,684
No, that's not faster.

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,589
I know, but it's dark, and we
could fool around. Dude, tunnel.

3
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,695
India's Grill on 6th Street,
please.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,714
Is that where we ran into...
Yes.

5
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:22,265
When she was still with...
Uh-huh.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,602
You know, part of me thinks...
I could not agree with you more.

7
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,643
(Horns honking)

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,818
Ah, I hope your sister
likes me.

9
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:44,788
Don't worry. She will.

10
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:47,157
It has to work with this kid.

11
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,526
I'm always the only guy
at your family dinners.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,378
Oh, I know, baby. I know,
but I have a good feeling.

13
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:52,929
My sister says

14
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:54,915
he's totally different
from other guys she's dated.

15
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:57,700
Yeah, but she said the Sam
thing about Nate a Mike...

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,935
And Emma.

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,371
You know, the girls
are having dinner tonight.

18
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,373
Maddie's gonna meet
Mia's new fella.

19
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,375
I kinda wish we were joining.

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,377
We are going to have
a lovely evening...

21
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:10,680
go home, have a nice meal,
really reconnect.

22
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,767
You're gonna fall asleep
in your clothes.

23
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:15,986
Yeah.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,788
Almost there.

25
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:19,389
How do I look?

26
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:21,525
Like someone
who's about to get kissed.

27
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,462
How do I look?

28
00:01:25,496 --> 00:01:26,696
Not fat.

29
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:32,836
How do I look?
Oh, honey, please, let's not fight.

30
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,239
♪ I don't know where I'd be ♪

31
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:39,793
♪ without someone to see ♪

00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:43,180

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,560
Hi. We have a reservation
under the name Coles.

36
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,495
Oh, yes,
your table will be ready

37
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:00,430
in just a few minutes,
Mrs. Coles.

38
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:03,433
Oh. No, he's Mr. Coles,
but I'm not Mrs. Coles.

39
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:06,670
We're not married.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

40
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:08,171
Oh, no, don't be.

41
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,707
For real, there's no need
for the sad eyes.

42
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,659
Neither of us
want to be married,

43
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,162
but we love each other.
We're very happy.

44
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:18,165
It's a valid life choice.

45
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:21,017
Show me your eyes again.

46
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:23,620
Honey, stop. She, uh,
she just has sad eyes.

47
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:26,789
Oh, a text from Mia.

48
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:28,925
"One minute away.
Are you there?"

49
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,928
Why does that need to be texted?
We said we'd meet at 8:00.

50
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:35,932
I don't get this generation's need for constant
communication. You're only four years older.

51
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,934
But it's a big four years.

52
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,303
None of the famous people
her age wear underwear.

53
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:43,106
Oh, here they are.
(Gasps) Oh, he looks okay.

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,643
No weird hat. No bird.
I like what I'm not seeing.

55
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:48,695
Hey, you guys.
Hey.

56
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:50,614
Oh, sorry we're late.
Traffic.

57
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,116
Casey, this is my sister Maddie.
Hi.

58
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,118
And that's Ben.
Hi. Oh!

59
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:59,456
Strong shake. Better watch what
I say around him. Tough guy.

60
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,728
Tough? I'm not tough.
I mean, I work out a little.

61
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:06,963
(Whispers) Love this guy.

62
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:10,383
Hey, I'm headed to the bar. You want a shot of tequila?
Uh, thanks, perfect. Yeah.

63
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:14,271
You hate tequila. (Whispers) Shh!
Not in front of Casey.

64
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,859
Hello?
Hey, I'm so busy with work,

65
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:22,445
<i>but I'm dying to know. What did you think of Casey?
Oh, my God. Loved him. Loved, loved, loved him.</i>

66
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,447
Oh, that makes me so happy,
Maddie.

67
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,449
You know,
you never ask my opinion

68
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:29,452
about this kind of stuff.
You were, like, 12 when I started dating Ben.

69
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:33,790
You just thought it was cool he could drive at night.
(Singsongy) Found your size.

70
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:36,543
Where are you? You said you were working.
I telecommute, Maddie.

71
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:39,629
When you're an inventor,
you can do things like that.

72
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:41,131
You're not an inventor.

73
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:43,300
You and your friends
just copied the idea of evite.

74
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,802
Paper free post features
stylish custom online stationery

75
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,837
and offers a hip alternative

76
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,806
to first generation invite web sites.
Ooh, that sounds nice.

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,708
Thank you. It is.
(Chuckles)

78
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:54,010
Now do you think mom and dad
are gonna like him?

79
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:56,346
Oh, honey, you care way
too much about their approval.

80
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,181
Well, it's easy for you to say.
You're their favorite.

81
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,683
I was at their house
the other day,

82
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,102
and I did a picture count
on the fridge.

83
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:05,021
You're winning seven to three.
Well, that sounds like a great use of your time.

84
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,523
I'm gonna let you go.

85
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:09,025
You probably have some
important inventing to do.

86
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,560
(Knock on door)

87
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:12,895
Hey.
Casey?

88
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:15,966
Mia doesn't know I'm here.
I need your help.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,952
Oh, God.
Do you need legal help? Ugh.

90
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:21,972
What was it, shoplifting?
Drunk driving?

91
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,473
Selling weed?

92
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:27,210
These guesses are really
hurting my feelings.

93
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:28,845
What do you want?

94
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,183
I need to figure out the best way
to propose to Mia. (Gasps) Wh...

95
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:36,770
<i>yeah, so she won't
react like that.</i>

96
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:41,758
Ben?
Yo!

97
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,760
Oh. We need to talk.

98
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:46,529
Casey came to my office today.

99
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:49,032
Really? Did he... did he say
anything about me, or did...

100
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,268
He wanted my advice
on how to propose to Mia.

101
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:54,270
Getting married
after two months?

102
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,072
What is she, a Kardashian?

103
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:58,174
Well, the good news is,
I bought us some time.

104
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:00,777
I was able to slow him down
a little bit

105
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:04,080
by stalling the proposal.
How do you stall a proposal?

106
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:05,665
Some quick thinking on my part.

107
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:07,717
Told him it's always been
Mia's dream

108
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,719
to get engaged
at the summer Olympics.

109
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:12,422
So he'll have to wait
till the next ones in 2012.

110
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,923
Stuff like that.

111
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,592
So quick thinking.

112
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:18,361
Not good thinking.

113
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:22,198
I think I have to tell Mia this is all
just way too fast. I don't... I don't know.

114
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,401
Whenever you butt in, it only
makes her do the opposite.

115
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:26,069
You remember
when she was in college,

116
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:28,438
and you told her not to take
that Spanish class?

117
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,440
What did she do?
Majored in Spanish.

118
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:33,209
And?
Went to Spain for a year?

119
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:36,446
And now what does she dip her chips in?
(Imitates Spanish accent) Guacamole.

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,980
Exactly.

121
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,149
Can I ask you somethin'?
Hmm?

122
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,319
Is there any part of you
that's upset about this

123
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:45,388
because we're not married? No.
I know why we aren't married.

124
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:47,374
It's a valid life choice.

125
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,158
You know, in the beginning,
we were too young,

126
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,661
and then we wanted
to establish our careers,

127
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,663
and then everybody
was getting married,

128
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:55,665
and we were like, "maybe,"
and then everybody

129
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,717
<i>was getting divorced,
and we were like, "no."</i>

130
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:00,070
Well, hey, I love
that we wake up every day,

131
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:02,022
and we make the decision
to be together,

132
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:04,006
not because some
piece of paper tells us to.

133
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:07,210
That's what you always say, right?
I don't just say it. I believe it.

134
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:09,679
Oh, me, too. I love saying it.
I love believing it.

135
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:11,681
You know what?
Maybe I'm overreacting.

136
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,683
I mean, she's only known
this guy

137
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,185
for seven and a half weeks.
Even if he does propose,

138
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:18,187
what are the chances
she says yes?

139
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,323
Casey just proposed!

140
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:22,542
We're engaged! I said yes!

141
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,432
Wow.
(Door closes)

142
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,600
You proposed.

143
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,102
I know. I'm sorry.

144
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,104
I so appreciated
all your great ideas,

145
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:34,673
but I couldn't wait for the
perfect moment. (Giggles)

146
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,209
I used some of your stuff.
I could re-enact it for you

147
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:39,645
if you want. Oh, no, no.
It's really okay.

148
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,713
I'd kinda like to see.

149
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,319
Mia, baby, I know it's not
your dream proposal.

150
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,855
It's not the summer Olympics.

151
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:54,293
Or the year social security
becomes insolvent.

152
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,696
I hope you'll take me anyway.

153
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,699
I love you, and I can't wait to
start our life together. Oh.

154
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,734
Will you marry me?
Yes! (Laughs)

155
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,987
Mmm, and then I cried.

156
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,339
Let me try.
Everyone be quiet.

157
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:12,544
Ugh. Nah, I can't get ere.

158
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:15,163
I need some more wine.

159
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:18,667
Are you okay? Oh, sure.
This is just such a surprise.

160
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,669
Not to you.
I know you helped,

161
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,754
and I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate it.

162
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:25,173
Although some of your ideas
were a little wacky.

163
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:27,792
Why did you say I thought
the Olympics were romantic?

164
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,961
Because... swimmers...

165
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:33,332
Like dolphins, mate for life.

166
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:37,686
Do mom and dad know?
Not yet.

167
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:40,739
I want them to at least
meet him first, but I'm nervous.

168
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:42,741
I mean, you know Casey.

169
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,242
No, I don't.
Not really.

170
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:46,695
I love the way he looks
at the world,

171
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:50,248
but he can be a bit of a...
Oddball.

172
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,251
Yes. (Chuckles) So, Ben,
I-I was hoping that you would,

173
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:56,321
you know, give him
a few pointers, coach him a bit.

174
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:59,257
Mom and dad love you so much.
Oh, I don't know.

175
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,259
Come on, Ben. You owe me.

176
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:04,096
Who supported you when you wore
that goatee for a month?

177
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,465
That did mean a lot to me.

178
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,601
Some people didn't handle it...

179
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:11,136
So elegantly.

180
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,407
So... you wanna come over
for breakfast tomorrow?

181
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,176
Great. How's 3:00 sound?

182
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:21,513
It sounds late.
How's 8:00?

183
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:24,015
2:00?
9:00.

184
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,352
Okay, dude,
but I'm gonna be late.

185
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,854
Thank you, Ben.
This is gonna be so great.

186
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,490
You work with Casey
a little bit,

187
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:34,192
then tomorrow night, we go to
a nice dinner with mom and dad.

188
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,162
Maddie says how much she loves him... me?
How did I get involved?

189
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:40,332
Hey, at least you don't have to
wake up at 9:00 for your thing.

190
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,368
<i>To be clear, we're meeting at 9:00.
You have to be there.</i>

191
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:45,003
I need you there.
You know how critical

192
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:48,256
mom and dad can be
about the guys that I date.

193
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:50,709
They find the tiniest reason
not to like them.

194
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:55,180
I didn't like him. How much hair
does one person need?

195
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,215
Did he seem just a touch...

196
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,218
French. Yes. Awful.

197
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,821
What kind of a guy
is named Emma?

198
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:06,274
I'll be there.

199
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,692
Really?
Yeah.

200
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,327
Yay. Oh!
Okay, this is so exciting.

201
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,829
Come on, honey.

202
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:13,231
We gotta go get started
on the wedding planning.

203
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:15,233
Are you thinking
something small?

204
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:18,236
I don't know. I have all
those half brothers and sisters.

205
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:22,007
<i>You do? Isn't this fun...
how fast this is going? Oh!</i>

206
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,242
(Door closes) I thought
we were against this.

207
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:27,345
We are. Then why am I having two
meals with this guy tomorrow?

208
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,132
Because I wanna protect her.
But you're right.

209
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:33,135
<i>She's not gonna listen to me.
She will listen to my parents.</i>

210
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,654
So let's let them do
what they're great at...

211
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:39,474
tearing apart the guys their daughters date.
Just out of curiosity, when they first met me, what did they...

212
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,193
you don't wanna know.
I can take it.

213
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,061
You can't.
Yeah, you're right.

214
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,098
I have jotted down a few notes

215
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:49,901
about how to deal
with Mia's parents.

216
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:53,205
Oh. That is a lot of stuff.

217
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,240
Well, I run a hotel,
and it's successful

218
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:58,076
because I'm good at picking up
on people's wants and needs.

219
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,245
See, I treat Maddie's parents
like a couple of clients,

220
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,581
and you should do the same.
Like, uh, what do you do?

221
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,083
Uh, I play
in an avant-garde metal band

222
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,786
with a performance art
component.

223
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,421
(Pen clicks)

224
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:13,291
<i>"Don't... mention... job."</i>

225
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,260
Okay, let's see.

226
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:17,295
Their dad is
a huge grammar snob,

227
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,264
so think about
your sentence structure.

228
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:21,266
<i>No
"my friend and me went out."</i>

229
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,401
<i>No, "that's the gym
exercise at."</i>

230
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:27,439
You have no idea
why those are wrong.

231
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:30,408
Grammar's not really my thing.

232
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:33,812
Hey! Does your hotel ever have
an event where you need a band?

233
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,281
Oh. We already have an in-house
avant-garde metal band

234
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,383
with a performance art
component.

235
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,286
Uh, let's see. Call them
"Mr. and Mrs. Putney,"

236
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,288
even though they'll say,
"call us whatever."

237
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:45,290
Oh, and don't try
and make a joke

238
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:47,425
and actually call them
"whatever."

239
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,095
Why would I do that?
That's stupid.

240
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:54,065
Well, it's an ice breaker.

241
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,768
People like gentle comedy.

242
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:59,604
Oh, don't give Mrs. Putney
your e-mail address.

243
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,673
That woman has never met
a cutesy e-mail

244
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,174
she hasn't forwarded.

245
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,677
And don't make any jokes
about plastic surgery.

246
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:08,179
Five years ago, Mr. Putney's
ears stuck out like this.

247
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:10,348
Now they're fine.
I don't know what happened.

248
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,484
Never asked.
(Whispers) Don't wanna know.

249
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,486
So stick to the safe topics

250
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,854
like wine, theater,
and the Yankees.

251
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:20,125
Wow. Sounds like you work
pretty hard to keep 'em happy.

252
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,993
I really do, Casey.

253
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:24,496
You know what?
I think I'll just be myself,

254
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,331
and hopefully, they'll like me.

255
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:28,333
And if not... (Crunches)

256
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:32,203
If not, what? What is the end
of that sentence?

257
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,372
(Scoffs)

258
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:40,078
You... you really don't care
if they like you?

259
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:42,547
Oh, I mean, it'd be nice
if they did,

260
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:45,049
but all those rules
you just laid out... I'm me.

261
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:48,053
I like myself just fine.
The one mistake I could make

262
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,556
is to pretend to be
something I'm not.

263
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:54,326
They're gonna eat you alive.

264
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,831
I don't see them yet.
Babe, you seem nervous.

265
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:02,400
I just want this to go well.

266
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:05,870
I love you, and I want them to love you, too.
And hopefully, they will, but we need to listen to them.

267
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:07,372
They gave us life.

268
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:10,375
Oh, my God. Here they come.
Just be yourself. But better.

269
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,076
I'm sorry. But I mean it!

270
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:15,180
Sorry we're late.
It took us forever to get here.

271
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:17,182
Your father's
on a huge walking jag.

272
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:20,085
No, I'm on a huge
not-paying-for-taxis jag

273
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,589
because our net worth went on
a huge losing-75%-of-itself jag.

274
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:28,026
And she's on an acting-like-
it-didn't-happen jag.

275
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,562
Uh, okay. Uh, mom, dad,
this is Casey.

276
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:34,899
Great to meet you, Vicky.
Joel, I like your ears.

277
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:40,104
Hey, you know what you're gonna
hear with those ears this year?

278
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:41,623
Cheers for the Yankees!

279
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:43,041
Ah!
Oh!

280
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,543
Yes, sit down.
Great to see you, Ben.

281
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,712
(Under breath) Stick to the script!
(Mouths words)

282
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:50,114
Oh, before I forget, Casey.

283
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:52,150
I need to get
your e-mail address.

284
00:12:52,184 --> 00:12:55,086
<i>I find that it's the best way
to communicate.</i>

285
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,988
It is Captainorgasmo...
one word.

286
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,560
He doesn't have an e-mail.

287
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:03,762
Champagne?
Oh.

288
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,263
What's t, uh, occasion?

289
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,966
Oh, um, Mia has news.

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,517
Yes.

291
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:12,303
(Chuckles nervously) Mom, dad...

292
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,739
oh, my God! Maddie and Ben
are getting married.

293
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,741
It's a miracle.

294
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:18,910
<i>What? Why would that be
my news?</i>

295
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:21,413
"It's a miracle"?

296
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,782
Like I don't have anything
of my own going on?

297
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:27,152
I could see "surprising,"
but "a miracle"?

298
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:31,673
I'm sorry.
I guess I-I misunderstood.

299
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:33,692
Can we please just
get to the news?

300
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:37,262
We really should
start walking home soon.

301
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:40,265
Well, this isn't exactly
the mood that I wanted to set,

302
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,901
but, um, I'm getting married.

303
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,102
To who?

304
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,471
<i>Whom.</i>

305
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:49,441
To me!

306
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:55,046
<i>To... I?</i>

307
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,534
Um...

308
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:06,658
Anyway... that's the news.
(Chuckles nervously)

309
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:11,162
There's going to be a wedding.

310
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,630
(Laughs)

311
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:16,534
We're so happy for you, pumpkin.
Yay! (Chuckles)

312
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:20,705
What is going on?
Your sister's getting married. Keep up.

313
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:25,477
No, I get that. I just... I can't
believe you're okay with this.

314
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,145
Well, honey,
if there's one thing

315
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,482
our financial reversals
of the last year have taught us,

316
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,484
it's that life is short,

317
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,353
and you should grab all the joy
you can find when you find it.

318
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:37,122
You really don't think
this is too fast?

319
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,607
Well, not everyone
is going to wait 15 years.

320
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:41,960
Oh, darling, stop. (Chuckles)
Was that directed at me?

321
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:46,164
No, it was directed at Kurt
Russell and Goldie Hawn. (Laughs)

322
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,616
Okay, guys, this is my moment.
I just got engaged.

323
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,136
Make fun of Maddie
when she gets in engaged...

324
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,205
In 2044.
(Both laugh)

325
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,208
Hey, our not being married is a valid
life choice. Valid life choice.

326
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:59,961
Okay, she said it.
Everybody has to drink.

327
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,413
(Clinking)

328
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,716
So wait.
Is our not being married

329
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,818
something you talk about
behind our backs?

330
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:08,820
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

331
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,689
You never put any pressure on us at all.
Well, the therapist said...

332
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:14,225
oh, there's a therapist?
Therapists have been consulted?

333
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,727
Therapists, clergymen, waiters.

334
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,229
Ooh, and there was
that valet Parker who raised

335
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:21,733
some pretty tough questions
about Ben's sexuality.

336
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:24,569
I sat down.

337
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:28,873
I didn't know he hadn't gotten
out of the car yet.

338
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,375
I'm sorry.
Call me old-fashioned,

339
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,378
but I think it's appropriate
to apply a little though

340
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:37,549
before making huge life choices.
Where is this coming from? You were so happy for us.

341
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,551
Well, I didn't wanna burst
your bubble,

342
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,419
<i>but I thought somebody would
have the sense to say</i>

343
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:44,789
this is crazy. You two don't even
know each other. We know ch other.

344
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,257
Oh, really?
What's his favorite movie?

345
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,359
Favorite color? Flavor of ice cream.
Whoa, hold on.

346
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:50,929
We've been together nine years,
and we don't even know

347
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,597
stuff like favorite ice cream.
I absolutely know your favorite ice cream.

348
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:55,233
How? I don't even have a favorite.
Mint chip.

349
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,603
<i>(Whispers) It is mint chip.</i>

350
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:00,104
Oh, this is so insulting.

351
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:03,107
Does it make you feel better
to use your lawyer logic

352
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:05,109
and grill us like
some kind of...

353
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:07,111
(Imitates Spanish accent)
Geraldo Rivera?

354
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,113
Huh?

355
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:11,749
Yeah. Get used to that.

356
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:14,652
Let's just calm down here,
okay?

357
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,871
<i>This is what I want.
Why does it have to be now?</i>

358
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:19,057
Honey, stop.
No, I'm sorry.

359
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:23,795
<i>Why in the world does she have to get married right now?
'Cause she's pregnant. Ohh!</i>

360
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:30,966
I can't believe this.
You're pregnant?

361
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,469
Yes. I'm sorry
I didn't mention it earlier.

362
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:35,971
I was just trying to think
of the perfect way

363
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,742
<i>for Ben to say it.
I didn't mean to tell him.</i>

364
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,945
He was giving me all
this advice. We were bonding.

365
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:45,948
<i>(High-pitched voice) It was
real early in the morning.</i>

366
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:51,837
We're going to be grandparents.

367
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:53,321
(Laughs)

368
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,457
Oh.

369
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,926
A bond portfolio dies,
a child is born...

370
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:59,395
circle of life.

371
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:02,398
You see that, Maddie?
They're happy about this, too.

372
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:05,667
<i>Wanna tell them why they're wrong?
No, that's not fair.</i>

373
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:08,887
Fair? How about going
to your sister for support

374
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:11,173
and finding out she's trying to sabotage you?
I just wanted...

375
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,709
no, no, no. You wanted
to ruin my engagement,

376
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,078
only you just ruined my night.

377
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:18,447
You'll have to be satisfied
with that.

378
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,584
Do I follow?

379
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,386
Yes.
Yeah.

380
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,190
Hey. You guys,
you love each other.

381
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,743
Don't leave it like this.
Oh, do you guys want this cab?

382
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,796
Or do you wanna think about it
for nine years? Come on.

383
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,298
Casey, wait.
Can you talk to her?

384
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:38,000
I tried.
She's not interested.

385
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:40,252
Maddie, I'd like to apologize
for something. What?

386
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,204
For this.
Whoa!

387
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:44,106
Go, go, go. Wait.

388
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,843
Th-that's a $50.
Get change for that!

389
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:50,095
(Horns honking)

390
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,431
Why didn't you tell me
you were pregnant?

391
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:54,450
Because I wanted you
to like Casey first,

392
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,885
not because you had
or because we're stuck with him.

393
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,887
Oh, who cares what I think?
I do.

394
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,889
Oh, please.
You don't get it.

395
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:03,959
The person whose opinion
I care most about is you.

396
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:05,828
Really?

397
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,946
You're my big sister.

398
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,399
(Sighs)

399
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,401
I remember being 14 years old

400
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:14,403
and watching you
go off to college

401
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:18,340
and thinking to myself, I wish
I could be that beautiful,

402
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:21,409
that smart...
(Voice breaking) That together.

403
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:23,812
I'm sorry.
It must be the hormones.

404
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,848
(Voice breaking)
No. I'm not pregnant,

405
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:27,466
and I'm doing it, too.

406
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:29,985
I'm... I'm sorry I blew
the pregnancy news.

407
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,471
Ah, people were gonna
figure it out anyway

408
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:35,057
once she starts getting fat.

409
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:40,145
Showing.

410
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:44,233
You might wanna call it
"showing."

411
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,235
(Chuckles)
You're gonna be Uncle Ben.

412
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:47,820
(Laughs)

413
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:52,508
That's... that's good stuff.

414
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,992
Like the rice.

415
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:55,611
No, I got it.

416
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:58,113
Maddie, I need you
to be honest with me.

417
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,616
Having all this happen
at once... a marriage, a baby,

418
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,286
I mean, do you think
I'm making a mistake?

419
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:06,004
You're gonna be great.

420
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:09,007
I've seen you jump into things
feet first a million times.

421
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,026
And it scares the hell
out of me,

422
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,462
but you always make it work.
And you'll be there to help me?

423
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,464
I will read every baby book.

424
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,233
I will make
baby activity flowcharts.

425
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:20,903
I will research the crap out
of crib safety. (Chuckles)

426
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:23,105
<i>You think I'm making
a mistake?</i>

427
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:24,473
About what?

428
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:27,826
Should Ben and I have gotten
married a long time ago?

429
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:31,747
Is my life choice not valid?

430
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,882
You want my opinion?

431
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:36,451
Oh, my God.
I've dreamed of this day.

432
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,687
<i>You wanna know
what I think. (Laughs)</i>

433
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:41,323
So what do you think?

434
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:44,209
No idea! (Laughs)
(Laughs) Oh.

435
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,562
You know, Maddie does like you,

436
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:48,380
and she loves her sister.

437
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:50,899
It's just that you guys,
you know, are moving

438
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:52,901
a little fast for her.

439
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:54,403
Yeah, I got that.

440
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:58,140
You guys... valid life choice.
Us... too fast.

441
00:19:58,174 --> 00:20:01,009
You're getting married
after seven weeks.

442
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:04,012
It took us that long
to settle on a new coffeemaker,

443
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:07,516
and I'm still not sure
we didn't make a huge mistake.

444
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:11,954
But what you're doing... is
threatening our very existence.

445
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:15,123
I'm sorry, man.
Condom broke.

446
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:20,629
You should know...
The way I feel about Mia...

447
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,698
We were gonna get married anyway.

448
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:25,200
This just kinda sped things up a little bit.

449
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,469
You know, I believe you.

450
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:30,439
And by the way,
nice job with her parents.

451
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,424
You didn't even need my list.

452
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,443
Maybe I learn from you

453
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:37,813
and worry a little less
about offending them.

454
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,949
I guess I can throw out
that stupid card.

455
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:44,987
Oh, no.

456
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:52,461
"He gets chatty
at the urinals"?

457
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:59,034
"She's a little bit racist"?

458
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,646
So you wanna fool around?

459
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,966
