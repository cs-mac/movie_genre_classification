twelve plus series of routines.
And you don't know how to do this?

It's like Chief and I said, right
at the beginning of this platoon

148
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:57,547
Once we step off on campaign, once it reversed ready
for downranged, everything back home is be unbalanced

00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:02,159
we will not worth the dead of each other or self,
we get over there, something out of recommendative

150
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:07,774
Things aren't right with the family, things aren't right with the
finance or something's off. It's gonna put us all out of balance. So..

151
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,967

Three days ago two CIA agents, Walter Ross

198
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,348
and Miss Lisa Morales were ambushed

199
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,561
inside their hotel room here in Costa Rica

200
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:07,611
by eh.. unknown amount of
heavily armed assholes

201
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,948
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Ms. Morales

202
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:12,003
has been abducted.
We believe that

203
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:15,215
this is been a work of a guy
named Mikhail Troykovich

204
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:18,574
A.K.A Christo. LT's going to
give you the scanning on him

205
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:21,999
Thanks Senior.
Mikhail Troykovich A.K.A Christo

206
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:24,429
This guy's believed has been working

207
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:26,729
cocaine from weapon deals
between the Russian mafia,

208
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:27,647
the FARC guerrillas

209
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,991
and the Mexican drugs cartels
eversince the late 1990's

210
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:36,087
Now, before she was captured, Morales was working
on a possible link between our boy Christo

211
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:37,879
and this guy, Abu Shabal

212
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:44,487
Glory to Allah, Lord of the world, that has
created us as Muslims and delivered us with jihad

213
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,624
on His direct Path

214
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:49,955
Peace be upon those, who's on His
direct Path in the Day of Judgement.

215
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:54,248
On this explanation to you,

216
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:58,632
we are not separatists.
We're setting on all legal part of anyone

217
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:02,426
be you an agent are wilingly or unwillingly

218
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,927
assisting the agenda of genocide

219
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:06,053
of our people,

220
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:08,128
by demanding that we obey certain rules

221
00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:12,215
and by your continous occupation
of all Muslim countries,

222
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:17,103
With the Grace of Allah,
we must exile to this heed

223
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:24,612
America, you'll never be safe, until safety
becomes a reality for us. Allahu Akbar.

224
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:29,831
Abu shabal is a Chechen terrorist that
associated with the Beslan school massacre

225
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:33,927
He's been jumping between training
camps in Indonesia and the Philippines

226
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,696
Now, the connection between Christo

227
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:37,897
and Abbu Shabal is so a little bit fuzzy,

228
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,271
But if this was the lead
that Morales was working on

229
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,999
it could be why she was abducted.
Senior?

230
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,695
All right, this is a personal recovery

231
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:48,620
of Miss Morales.
All right, who's got questions?

232
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:52,495
See, Chief. If you have any update
resource, and tell us numbers inside the

233
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,122
camp, what about roving patrols?

234
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,431
Maybe 8 to 10 Bro

235
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,208
but we don't know anything
about roving patrols

236
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:01,407
you just gonna have to assume that's all working
around the squared away you just did for a living too

237
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,721
Senior, what kind of weapons
on target are we looking at?

238
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:07,720
Heavy weapons. This guys are narco traffickers, so
they can have anything from Soviet block discus.

239
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:12,240
They can have a empty UHB for the
course out there, we don't know.

240
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:15,071
So, if there is a weapons in place out
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets

241
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:19,549
of course rockets and bullets don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.
All right, what else?

242
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,993
Any idea wether she's ambulatory or not?

243
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,250
There's ton of blood on the scene,

244
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,810
and alot of it was Mr Ross'

245
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:27,978
We confirmed that Ms. Morales
may has blood there too

246
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,817
But these guys are savages.

247
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,314
So, you're gonna have
to assume that she is..

248
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,286
Non ambulatory, so you gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.

Chief, are you set?

304
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:37,400
Chief, chick hold.

00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,399
One O'clock, base on the tower

Clear to the door

308
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:14,132
And what happened to the tomatoes?

309
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,963
I got two escorts coming from the back door

310
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,928
Move in!

LT, this is Chief. The target is secure.

317
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:28,924
Stand by for confirmation of package.
Be advised, Mikey is down, Mikey is down.

Chief, it looks like you have two aggressor
vehicle approaching from the north

You can take the truck outside the
west door, meet us at extract

Miss Morales, I'm going you home

I just need to ask you a few questions

327
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,295
What's your mother's maiden name?

<i>We just set secondary extract</i>

Shit, Sir this truck by a thousand yards

Let's go, let's go!
Moving!

Right turn, right turn!

00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,752
Hey man, we're not gonna
make this secondary extract

Hey Chief!

We're not gonna make secondary extract!

349
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:35,612

Stay with me, come on Mike!
Wake up, wake up, come on man!

352
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:52,528
Help Team, we can make it to rally point

353
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:54,998
Sounds good, pass it to LT!

<i>LT, LT, this is Assault Team. We just lost secondary

Move it to rally point, L copy, over.

<i>- What about the click hour?

Sir, what's the status on those boat?

365
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:16,981
I lost Whiplash on the run. Told you to hit
the target early, they're coming in hot

366
00:38:16,982 --> 00:38:18,282

Break it up, break it up!

371
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:04,393
Ajay, do it allright,
they're coming at our rear!

372

<i>Whiplash, Whiplash!

376

- Sit down, man. Get down!

377
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,282
Mikey's up man, Mikey's up.

378
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:04,951
- Mikey, hang on Buddy.
- Where are we?

379
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:08,079
On our way to extract. We're good to go

380
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,991
- You took one tho the face man, you harm another fcuker.
- Do we get it? / Yes, - Oh, I get it / on our way to extract

381

Ajay, splash it, splash it!

00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:17,564
Water!
Water, water!

<i>It wasn't for nothing</i>

385

UKRAINE

386
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:34,518
Who are you?

387
00:43:56,254 --> 00:44:03,510
- Is it Mendelsson?
- No, Brahms.

388
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,862
I am Kerimov.
You must be Shabal.

389
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,862
Ok, as I said to Christo on the phone,
I have the requirement you want

390
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,862
a vest

391
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:27,250
- Cool isn't it?
- It is simple but effective

392
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,862
over here

393
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,862
Inside them is tiny balls made of
ceramics-based.

394
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:36,862
Five hundred of them
woven into vest,

395
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,862
They contain explosive gel

396
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,862
It is our new technology

397
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,862
It is truly devastating,

398
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,862
please

399
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,262
Here is no big deal, you know this

400
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,862
It is designed for open spaces

401
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,862
You have to believe me

402
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:12,862
There are few weapons in the world
that they can operated only by one man

403
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,862
Look at this.

404

00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,862
They can go everywhere without get detected

406
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,862
You could take tour to White
House or wherever you like

407
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,862
Can I see a demonstration?

408
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,862
You kidding, you even have
no time to go to Siberia

409
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,862
Listen, when this explodes,
there is no safe place.

410
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:53,862
Imagine firing 500 bullets everywhere and
being scattered by a massive explosion.

411
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:02,862
Take one of these to the stage,
casino or shopping center

412
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:12,862
and create such a massal panic through American mass media.
A total collapse of economy will happened.

413
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:30,016
Buddy, look, you're never change

414
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:33,191
- Can I take his coat?
- No, thank you

415
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:39,476
And now from time to time, I get to
see my old friends by my old life.

416
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:44,880
And it's always, always disappointing.

417
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:49,398
Some become asshole, as other boring

418
00:46:49,399 --> 00:46:53,063
And I can't believe I tried to get
them in bed all those years ago

419
00:46:56,096 --> 00:47:01,807
Hey, it is nice not to be disappointed Yuri

420
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:06,966
It's not my name

421
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:11,602
I know. Muhammad Abu
Shabal, the son of Shabal

422
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:15,376
Come on, your father's name is Yevgeny

423
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,591
- It's changed.
- Yeah, I think it's changed

424
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:24,614
That's why this is the last time I might
have to see each other for quite some time.

425
00:47:24,615 --> 00:47:29,615
For am I have to find a hole to hide in.

426
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:32,079
I don't understand

427
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:37,847
I'm being watched by the CIA, and
not there gonna be any chances

428
00:47:37,848 --> 00:47:39,586
This is the most
oppotunities present itself

429
00:47:39,587 --> 00:47:41,720
I'm taking my family South.
I need the help, the energy,

430
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,563
or the will to fight the Americans

431
00:47:43,564 --> 00:47:47,438
What about Ardile and Michel,
and they have been in training

432
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:50,839
for almost a year now, I have
devoted much of my respect..

433
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,100
The deal stands, Yuri.
Just because I've taken early retirement,

434
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:56,985
does not mean I'm not holding
at my end into the bargain

435
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,985
<font color= "?ffff01" >There is so much to be done.</font>

436
00:47:57,218 --> 00:47:58,946
And it will be, just without me!

437
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,958
You have to use my trust in associates

438
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:03,885
- It's not so good for me!
- Hey!

439
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:11,589
Hey, shut up! Shut up! Stop! You're fcuking bullshit!
It's not good, it doesn't work

440
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,129
- You can't change it like that!
- Nothing changes, nothing.

441
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,938
You just told me everything change,
but what is it? What is that?

442
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:22,227
Do you know, what I do to get here?
Do you know, the man why has to sacrifice to get here?

443
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:23,939
Do you have any idea?

444
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:28,044
No, you shit, you live up here, this
ivory tower, you know I don't care.

445
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:45,059
USS BON HOMME RICHARD
- CENTRAL AMERICAN COAST

446
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:53,059
- Hey Chief, what's the status of Mikey?
- He's definitely lose the eye, but he's hang it tough.

447
00:48:55,952 --> 00:48:57,527
Yeah, I'm gonna get read into this

448
00:48:57,528 --> 00:49:00,242
Great job, small check in those
assholes, get Morales back

449
00:49:00,243 --> 00:49:03,294
It's a blunt deal for Mikey better get
to tell you what was the solid work.

450
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:06,414
- So Chief, make sure you get that down of
the boys right away. Do you hear me? - Sure

451
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:08,861
All right.
And Morales.

452
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,686
Morales was one tough chick.

453
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:15,302
But she should've got in this stuff up to change a lot faster
because this thing is way bigger than we thought it was.

454
00:49:15,303 --> 00:49:18,834
How was that? I thought this was
cut and dry arm search recovery

455
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,290
Yeah, wasn't until we got into that phone

456
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,346
that you guys picked up at that shit hole.

457
00:49:22,866 --> 00:49:26,108
- It turn me out of something just not look right at all.
- And what's not right about it?

458
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:29,118
Christo and Shabal are a lot
closer than I thought they were.

459
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,326
Shabal is a wild core man

460
00:49:31,327 --> 00:49:35,055
He's an old jahadi, that couldn't
give a rest-ass about money or drugs.

461
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,352
Yeah, that tells his friend
Christo, the dope dealer?

462
00:49:37,353 --> 00:49:39,471
He's not a dealer man,

463
00:49:39,472 --> 00:49:40,856
he's a smugler.

464
00:49:41,768 --> 00:49:42,992
You've gotta be kidding me.

465
00:49:42,993 --> 00:49:49,491
That is exactly what I'm thingking. Shabal wants to kill
Americans, Christo knows how to get fcukers inside America.

466
00:49:49,492 --> 00:49:54,991
This could be big trouble in little timing fellas.
They're gonna hit us at home.

467
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:59,991
I just got done talking to boss, on the
spec of task force, this is gonna go down.

468
00:49:59,992 --> 00:50:04,991
I need Ajay and Ray stand by to launch for NSR in 2 hours.
They gonna get some friggin' flower mouse on the way to Africa.

469
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:06,313
Why Africa?

470
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:08,813
We pended airfield there
by the phone that you got?

471
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:12,313
And I think that Shabal is gonna be there
during weapon transfer on his way West.

472
00:50:12,314 --> 00:50:14,313
When you say "West", what
do we talking about?

473
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:15,661
Mexico West?

474
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:16,644
Yeah

475
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:17,758
Mexico West

476
00:50:18,152 --> 00:50:20,005
It's the worst case scenario

477
00:50:20,006 --> 00:50:22,249
You two and the rest of
platoon are gonna stay here

478
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,005
and standby, you'll be the primary assault for
worst case that goes down anywhere near America

479
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:26,706
Check

480
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:27,606
Check

481
00:50:27,628 --> 00:50:29,947
You gonna be around for any
questions as they came up?

482
00:50:29,948 --> 00:50:34,519
<i>No man. Christo, he put a Roman
Polanski at my ass and disappeared.</i>

483
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,774
So I'm gonna link up for SEAL Team 4

484
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:39,132
and we're gonna go hunt his
ass down in the South Pacific

485
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:41,622
So straight up, my ties and
palm trees so maybe...

486
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,006
Yeah brother, I go get them

487
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:44,175
Be cool. take it easy

488
00:50:44,176 --> 00:50:46,273
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant

489
00:50:47,892 --> 00:50:48,815
Does everybody know?

490
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,025
All the important people

491
00:50:51,026 --> 00:50:52,347
The important people to who?

492
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:53,187
For you?

493
00:50:53,355 --> 00:50:53,955
I guess so

494
00:50:56,093 --> 00:50:57,735
I'm gonna go brood the boys

495
00:50:57,736 --> 00:50:58,957
Hey hold on one second

496
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,056
I brought it here cause I
want you to read it before

497
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:04,901
I'm trusted officer...

498
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:07,650
and but to be honest with you

499
00:51:08,526 --> 00:51:10,297
I was thinking to calling the commander

500
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,824
trying to get you home

501
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,106
And now worse picked up so much

502
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:16,812
I feel like we really need you here

503
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,634
You remember our last cruise on Alamar?

504
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,379
Yeah

505
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,956
When you got that final turn over op
you said I don't need to be there

506
00:51:24,108 --> 00:51:27,384
I was lying in bed, and I realized all
the thing I need do now was go home

507
00:51:27,854 --> 00:51:30,538
But if something went south in your op

508
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:32,742
I would always regret not
being there with you

509
00:51:32,743 --> 00:51:35,495
I appreciate you're taking
care of me big time, Dave

510
00:51:35,496 --> 00:51:37,565
But I'm working sometimes with the brass

511
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:38,965
If I can

512
00:51:38,966 --> 00:51:39,907
And things slow down

513
00:51:39,908 --> 00:51:41,571
I'm gonna get 2 weeks off

514
00:51:41,572 --> 00:51:43,831
I'll leave the works now eitherway,

515
00:51:43,832 --> 00:51:44,693
I really do

516
00:51:44,694 --> 00:51:45,459
But if it doesn't

517
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:51,599
I'm gonna take this piece of paper and
I'll make it into nice paper airplane

518
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:52,735
Bid it

519
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,352
AFRICAN COAST

520
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,478
Good, we're good

521
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:02,188
- 601, emerge the ship at 160 feet
- Guide, guide

522
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:30,263
Hey guys thank you for being here so fast

523
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:31,152
Grab a seat, please

524
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:31,987
Thank you

525
00:53:32,023 --> 00:53:33,771
You have Bulldog overhead

526
00:53:33,772 --> 00:53:35,998
We need you te get in, grab the intel

527
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:37,556
and down to back to us

528
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:39,262
Do you have any questions?

529
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:39,928
Sir, I have a question

530
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:42,574
We have the rally point time

531
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,093
What if the meeting doesn't
take place as schedule

532
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:46,231
How long do you want us to stay on target?

533
00:53:46,232 --> 00:53:47,403
That's one counts

534
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:50,367
So, I plan on B out there for awhile

535
00:53:50,368 --> 00:53:51,650
Check

536
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:52,648
Are we good?

537
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:53,723
Think so Sir. Yes Sir.

538
00:54:04,297 --> 00:54:10,367
- Ray - Ajay, I'll reached up and ready to check each other out
- Grab the door, clear.

539
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:59,367
SOMALIA

540
00:55:26,631 --> 00:55:28,157
Do we have visual?

541
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,445
Yeah

542
00:55:29,446 --> 00:55:30,446
Got three trucks moving in

543
00:55:30,447 --> 00:55:33,948
a fuel truck, 2 jeeps,
Some skinnies in the back

544
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:36,755
One at the last fifty count

545
00:55:47,098 --> 00:55:47,744
Do you hear that?

546
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,206
Yeah, think that our plan

547
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:50,288
Yeah, we get some inbound

548
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:03,408
About time he's gonna showed up, Jesus!

549
00:56:03,409 --> 00:56:05,141
Give me my camera

550
00:56:21,374 --> 00:56:24,378
Hey Ray, we got two birds
down here in the field

551
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:25,835
It's obvious our pass

552
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:28,620
No tail ID's

553
00:56:29,317 --> 00:56:30,687
You got that?

554
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:32,742
Check, no tail IDs

555
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:44,752
Ray, last time I checked
you were in Africa, right?

556
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:45,915
Yeah

557
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:46,679
Why, what's up?

558
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:51,809
Dude, these like 16 Filipinos down there

559
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,042
all praying to Mecca right now

560
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:54,057
Filipinos?

561
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:55,945
Filipinos definitely not skinnies

562
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,323
Who pick up the praying?

563
00:56:57,324 --> 00:56:59,391
Unless he's picking up some Russian

564
00:56:59,392 --> 00:57:00,692
You two come here

565
00:57:00,923 --> 00:57:04,093
Be very careful with
these boxes, do you hear me?

566
00:57:04,094 --> 00:57:07,892
Drop one of these and
you are all going to heaven

567
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,165
Aircraft will change

568
00:57:13,622 --> 00:57:16,493
And enter through two
different border crossings

569
00:57:16,494 --> 00:57:17,567
be careful

570
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,764
Once on the island, your men will
have time to finish preparations

571
00:57:24,015 --> 00:57:26,475
A friend will be
with you on the plane

572
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:29,102
and help the rest of the way

573
00:57:30,535 --> 00:57:31,646
Bulldog, Bulldog

574
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,342
we have around and we checked, over

575
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:35,115
<i>Get check, copy</i>

576
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:40,563
Roger get check, be advised, we got 2
sterile aircraft departing to the East

577
00:57:40,564 --> 00:57:41,884
at following location

578
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:44,916
<i>Ten Kappa Lima Sierra</i>

579
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:47,796
Please advise, when you
intel the target, over

580
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:51,114
<i>Roger, copy two aircraft ...
Location Ten Kappa...<//i></i>

581
00:57:51,115 --> 00:57:54,204
<font color= "?ffff01" >Hey Chief, you
are not gonna believe this</font>

582
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:59,784
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged, just
landed on Cedros Island of the coast of Mexico

583
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:02,507
It has Shabal with unknown
number of jihadist

584
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:03,683
Are you kidding me?

585
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:05,765
No, it looks like we're
getting ahead of target

586
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:07,975
Well, Senior and his sweep
motor punching out,

587
00:58:07,976 --> 00:58:10,564
they should call a liitle
more intel for shore sea

588
00:58:10,565 --> 00:58:11,649
All right

589
00:58:14,754 --> 00:58:17,095
SOUTH PACIFIC

590
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:41,049
I don't know how long we'll stay

591
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:41,849
Hold on Baby

592
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,208
Be safe

593
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:51,088
You know I will, I gotta to go, Honey

594
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:52,508
I love you

595
00:58:53,308 --> 00:58:54,408
I love you

596
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:13,010
Joann, I don't want to play with these

597
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:17,945
Are you listening?
There's nothing to worry about

598
00:59:18,111 --> 00:59:20,260
OK?
I'll talk to you soon.

599
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:42,260
<i>Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out</i>

600
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:56,760
<i>We got you have a Tango on your starboard
side, Tango on your starboard side</i>

601
01:00:05,111 --> 01:00:07,760
<i>Winky Charlie, we
have visual on Tango</i>

602
01:00:27,611 --> 01:00:29,760
<i>Bubble, you have a
Viper on 12 O'clock</i>

603
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,587
Get out! Get out!

604
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:03,241
Clear!

605
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:04,379
Bridge secure!

606
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,826
Senior, you're clear

607
01:01:33,683 --> 01:01:35,660
Good afternoon, how are you?

608
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:38,883
Right. Do you speak Serbian Croatia?

609
01:01:38,884 --> 01:01:39,971
Russian

610
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:40,921
Is it Russian?

611
01:01:40,922 --> 01:01:41,862
Yes

612
01:01:41,863 --> 01:01:43,521
Do not speak Russian

613
01:01:43,522 --> 01:01:44,506
English ok?

614
01:01:44,507 --> 01:01:45,602
English is fine

615
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:46,666
Let's do that

616
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:48,792
Can you cut him loose, please

617
01:01:48,793 --> 01:01:50,578
If you cut loose, you will not
do anything crazy, right?

618
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:54,029
Crazy iron, so to speak.

619
01:01:54,604 --> 01:01:55,387
So you Russian, yeah?

620
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,175
Yes, I am.

621
01:01:57,176 --> 01:01:58,788
Are you all right?

622
01:01:58,994 --> 01:02:00,437
Yes I'm good, thank you

623
01:02:00,438 --> 01:02:00,996
You're welcome

624
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:02,970
I'm sorry, I don't know your name

625
01:02:02,971 --> 01:02:03,576
I'm Otto

626
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:05,826

- Yes, nice to meet you

01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:08,233
Chrisko?

630
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:10,012
Christo

631
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:12,179
Traskovich?

632
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,659
Hey Brother, we need to make this hit count

633
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:17,306
Beause I'm ready promote new
Liutenant commander ...

634
01:02:17,307 --> 01:02:18,643
I'm working at the White House

635
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:20,463
Oh man, looks carry football

636
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:22,470
- It was better let me carry that thing
- Oh I'm kidding, man

637
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:27,592
Hey you know Otto, eitherway, there has to be
some quality time for your the new family, Bro

638
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:29,365
Yeah man, now is gonna
be a good carrier move,

639
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:33,888
but, I'll be a powerful in-commander if I
suppose to shoot bad guys and few nurglars

640
01:02:33,889 --> 01:02:36,827
Yeah, well, truth to be told you will
never good be an operator anyway

641
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,784
Come on man,

642
01:02:39,785 --> 01:02:41,889

- Yeah

643
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:47,086
Hey, come on, come on

644
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:57,548
You sitting on wonderful boat,

645
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:57,548
<font color= "?ffff01" >Fabulous</font>

646
01:02:57,563 --> 01:02:59,052
I believe it's called "starship"

647
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:00,009
"starship"?

648
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,645
I love the way you say "starship"

649
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:02,245
It's like Russian

650
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:04,361
Like guy in Star Trek, what's his name?

651
01:03:04,362 --> 01:03:06,596
Scotty, I'm sorry, Scott

652
01:03:06,896 --> 01:03:07,800
I would not

653
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,022
You never seen Star Trek?

654
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:09,904
No

655
01:03:09,905 --> 01:03:10,802
That's insane

656
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:12,052
So, here's the problem, pal

657
01:03:12,053 --> 01:03:13,782
You're with a lot of money

658
01:03:14,656 --> 01:03:15,917
<i>Or you were with a lot of money?</i>

659
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:17,587
I believe I still have

660
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:18,336
You do?

661
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:19,144
Yes

662
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:20,194
All right

663
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:21,543
Let me tell you how the world works there

664
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:23,213
Chrisco ...

665
01:03:23,229 --> 01:03:24,338
It's Christo

666
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:24,511
sorry?

667
01:03:24,512 --> 01:03:25,944
<font color= "?ffff01" >Christo</font>

668
01:03:25,213 --> 01:03:26,544
<font color= "?ffff01" >oh, of course</font>

669
01:03:26,255 --> 01:03:26,966
Oh it's ok

670
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,659
Let me tell you how
the world really works

671
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:29,959
<font color= "?ffff01" >please</font>

672
01:03:29,748 --> 01:03:30,955
This is no longer your boat

673
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,913
Since I walk through that door, you're not
the same guy you used to be. You just not.

674
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:37,720
There's nothing I can do to stop that

675
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:39,433
Nothing I can do to help you right now

676
01:03:39,434 --> 01:03:40,650
unless you let me help you

677
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:43,280
We need to do this together pal, you and me

678
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:47,415
So, how is you think you working
with these jihadi folks then?

679
01:03:49,813 --> 01:03:51,140
Your're Jewish, right?

680
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,815
Shabal is ...what?

681
01:03:57,089 --> 01:03:59,925
Have you ever had a
friend that you grew up with?

682
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:00,449
Sorry?

683
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,586
Have you ever had a
friend that you grew up with?

684
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,075
<font color= "?ffff01" >Yes</font>

685
01:04:03,076 --> 01:04:04,711
Like play interest, like soccer..

686
01:04:04,712 --> 01:04:06,961
Or what would you play,
base ball probably, right?

687
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:07,201
<font color= "?ffff01" >probably</font>

688
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:07,453
Ya

689
01:04:07,753 --> 01:04:08,238
<font color= "?ffff01" >Ya</font>

690
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,269
And anyone has his separate ways,
and some years later you meet up

691
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:15,105
And you totally didn't recognize the person

692
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,389
That's what I have been with Shabal

693
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:21,139
We share a common interest

694
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:24,522
So, he came up with his incredible idea

695
01:04:24,523 --> 01:04:26,518
because of his beliefs

696
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:28,156
I don't necessarily share his beliefs

697
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:29,948
But he's a smart guy

698
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:30,892
You know?

699
01:04:30,893 --> 01:04:32,582
Almost like ...

700
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:33,931
you know, almost like...

701
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:36,736
like, this is me.

702
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,953
And that's Shabal

703
01:04:42,954 --> 01:04:43,775
Is it?

704
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:45,330
And America is in between

705
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:46,114
Is it?

706
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,590
Yeah

707
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:50,582
Cool concept, no?

708
01:04:50,634 --> 01:04:51,583
Right here?

709
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:52,204
Yes

710
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:55,093
You think this is some kind of game?

711
01:04:57,712 --> 01:04:59,780
Do you? You find this amusing?

712
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:00,555
I'm not find ...

713
01:05:00,556 --> 01:05:02,012
Do you realize what you're doing here?

714
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,005
<i>Blackbeard actual to Blackbeard Main</i>

<i>Roger Main, clear to target</i>

718
01:05:17,256 --> 01:05:19,483
The only people I answer to is my family

719
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:22,296
to my wife and to my child

720
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,739
and nobody else

721
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:27,024
Running late somewhere?

722
01:05:27,025 --> 01:05:28,663
6 after 4

723
01:05:28,664 --> 01:05:29,159
Really?

724
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:29,590
Yeah

725
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:30,823
So ...

726
01:05:30,824 --> 01:05:32,309
Here's the problem pal

727
01:05:33,234 --> 01:05:35,076
You do love your family don't you?

728
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:37,074
Yes I do

729
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:38,559
And what about your daughter?

730
01:05:38,865 --> 01:05:39,829
What about my daughter?

731
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,662
Are you looking forward
to seeing her again?

732
01:05:42,343 --> 01:05:43,808
Every minute on my life

733
01:06:06,615 --> 01:06:09,663
I wanted you to see that,
so you can think about something

734
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,088
very seriously

735
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:13,850
Because you're gonna be sitting
in a box somewhere

736
01:06:14,844 --> 01:06:17,459
You'll be treated properly and humanely

737
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:23,414
That girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married

738
01:06:24,092 --> 01:06:26,324
and your wife is gonna find someone else

739
01:06:27,091 --> 01:06:29,682
And you're gonna miss everything

740
01:06:37,238 --> 01:06:38,691
If I had done something

741
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,957
that would endanger my family

742
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:42,901
I would feel just like you do right now

743
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:47,801
Do you promise not to touch my family?

744
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:49,295
I would never touch your family

745
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:52,670
I would not

746
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:00,523
Are you familiar with ...

747
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:05,238
"ceramic bullbearings"?

748
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,119
No

749
01:07:07,668 --> 01:07:11,901
Just imagine 16 suicide vests
filled with ceramic bullbearings

750
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:13,988
Slipping by every metal detector

751
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:15,680
and every check-point in your country.

752
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:19,878
Do you think your economy's fcuked now?

753
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,211
Just think what the
Media is gonna do with this

754
01:07:25,214 --> 01:07:31,252
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fcuking
walking park, the Grand Central Park

755
01:07:33,077 --> 01:07:34,695
So, you're telling me ..

756
01:07:35,591 --> 01:07:41,731
There is 16 jahadis wearing suicide vests

757
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:45,532
they're gonna walk right accross the border

758
01:07:46,321 --> 01:07:47,690
So, where are they going?

759
01:07:49,426 --> 01:07:52,195
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston

760
01:07:52,589 --> 01:07:54,016
You pick a city, they'll be there

761
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,036
And this is happening now?

762
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:58,499
It's happening as we speak

763
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:00,735
say what?

764
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:04,162
It's happening as we speak

765
01:08:07,353 --> 01:08:09,025
How can you stop this?

766
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:13,604
I can't

What are you doing?

780
01:13:18,491 --> 01:13:21,906
<i>Weimy, I got chaseborders heading south,
they pick up truck</i>

781
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:28,011
I see them

782
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,786
Echo, two guys in the truck

783
01:13:55,037 --> 01:13:56,287
Mortar!

784
01:15:05,278 --> 01:15:06,657
Sir, sir!

785
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:09,698
LT, you all right?

786
01:15:16,675 --> 01:15:17,538
Damn

787
01:15:17,787 --> 01:15:18,996
You check that box huh?

788
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:20,378
Yeah

789
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:25,265
Good thing that was a dart,
how am I gonna hurt?

790
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,534
Woow

791
01:15:30,174 --> 01:15:30,958
Jesus

792
01:15:34,539 --> 01:15:37,825
These are not some bushky
vest from Iraqi hut

793
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,292
These some high speed shit

794
01:15:40,673 --> 01:15:42,927
Maybe we should put
this somewhere else, huh?

795
01:15:51,021 --> 01:15:53,418
Hey Sonny, find somewhere
to put this would you?

796
01:16:00,094 --> 01:16:01,357
Target secure

797
01:16:01,358 --> 01:16:02,975
set security

798
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:05,918
rest to the north, three south

799
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,531
Here are your objectives

800
01:16:35,436 --> 01:16:36,703
Well ...

801
01:16:38,191 --> 01:16:40,424
I'm proud of you

802
01:16:46,505 --> 01:16:48,581
We are family now

803
01:16:50,886 --> 01:16:53,163
Chief, target blasting
up, everything secure

804
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:55,645
<i>Actual, mission not complete</i>

805
01:16:55,646 --> 01:16:59,608
<i>Stand by for follow one
You only got half that you had at cell</i>

806
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:01,037
Target secure, Sir

807
01:17:01,038 --> 01:17:02,988
This fight isn't over yet

808
01:17:03,063 --> 01:17:04,000
<i>Now listen,</i>

809
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:10,503
<i>at 0700, we're
coordinating with State</i>

810
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,866
but for now the principal job
you have outside the city

811
01:17:12,867 --> 01:17:15,488
where your POC is Commander Pedros

812
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:18,546
<i>I'll give you more details on route
Actual, are you copy?</i>

813
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:20,085
Roger Maam.

814
01:17:20,086 --> 01:17:23,954
Ok, we got the hill laming on the deck, we're
gonna meet a Mexican South Commander and his team

815
01:17:23,955 --> 01:17:26,954
We're gonna help infiltrate the
target, and join us on the assault

816
01:17:28,242 --> 01:17:29,761
What the hell are you talking about?

817
01:17:29,762 --> 01:17:30,837
We didn't got all of them yet, Chief

818
01:17:30,838 --> 01:17:31,974
Where's the rest of it?

819
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:33,589
They're in Mexicali, on the border

820
01:17:33,886 --> 01:17:36,927
All right, and the rest of the boys,
how they getting back to the ship?

821
01:17:36,928 --> 01:17:39,953
Bon Homme Richard stayed on station,
they're gonna send them Marine helmet

822
01:17:39,954 --> 01:17:42,493
head all back split to target, and when they're
done, the boys will pull off with them

823
01:17:42,494 --> 01:17:43,400
Ok

824
01:17:43,401 --> 01:17:44,113
I'm thinking

825
01:17:44,299 --> 01:17:45,716
squad 1 and myself roll out

826
01:17:46,172 --> 01:17:49,607
- Perfect squad, Tuesday's here, buttons
up, pulls out of the marines - Ok

827
01:17:56,244 --> 01:17:58,011
But now we know to put them to town

828
01:17:58,012 --> 01:17:59,065
and crushing the sunrise

829
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:04,940
<i>Gather group we're gonna take
as following day, the wadis</i>

830
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:06,941
<i>comprendors</i>

831
01:18:18,376 --> 01:18:23,023
Hey sir, who the hell clear us
had to go to Mexicali anyway?

832
01:18:23,024 --> 01:18:26,861
This would do all that we up to the platform.
States Department on it.

833
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:39,413
Border Wall with Mexico

834
01:19:05,876 --> 01:19:06,638
Hey Sir

835
01:19:06,994 --> 01:19:07,719
channel 2

836
01:19:13,177 --> 01:19:17,983
By this time on keep work like this, Jacky's
gonna be squeezed and kicked out on road

837
01:19:19,228 --> 01:19:23,657
however, if we had this target quick enough,
he jump on the burrow right at shit home

838
01:19:24,998 --> 01:19:27,153
Hey, I gonna need no burrow

839
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,208
you got it two weeks

840
01:19:30,838 --> 01:19:32,844
on the time I was there on the plane hall

841
01:19:32,989 --> 01:19:34,881
you were not convinced so let me go home,

842
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:39,428
but I'm convinced gonna
leave your ass in charge

843
01:19:58,686 --> 01:20:02,958
MEXICALI,
US/MEXICO BORDER

844
01:20:44,802 --> 01:20:45,685
Sir

845
01:20:45,686 --> 01:20:46,518
Lieutenant

846
01:20:46,932 --> 01:20:49,537
Seems our government have been very
busy to make this possible, huh?

847
01:20:49,538 --> 01:20:51,094
<font color= "?ffff01" >All the way
the tough, from I heard</font>

848
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:53,059
There is something that
you have to understand

849
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:57,353
my superiors, they're very
fearful of Mexican "mogadishu"

850
01:20:57,354 --> 01:20:59,828
no black or down, that's
what they're saying, so

851
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:01,016
we do need to stay under the radar

852
01:21:01,017 --> 01:21:02,615
I understand completely Sir.

853
01:21:02,616 --> 01:21:05,146
Your team presence here
is greatly appreciated

854
01:21:05,147 --> 01:21:06,890
But we're out of time, we need to move

855
01:21:06,891 --> 01:21:07,807
Tell me where, we go

856
01:21:07,808 --> 01:21:12,233
Help piece these together for me.
Our intel says they using a tunnel network,

857
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,325
but it's under a milk factory

858
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:15,195
This mean anything to you?

859
01:21:15,196 --> 01:21:17,214
I know exactly where it is

860
01:21:17,215 --> 01:21:18,397
It's not far from here

861
01:21:18,398 --> 01:21:20,284
And that's where we going

862
01:21:20,285 --> 01:21:23,909
From all of the places of Mexicali you
could have been, this probably the worst

863
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:26,320
The cartels control any of
that from all the angles

864
01:21:26,321 --> 01:21:30,161
They had us heavily outgunned.
Simply reaching your target's gonna be very difficult

865
01:21:30,162 --> 01:21:33,052
Sir we have a thorn national's
heading to our country

866
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:35,540
needless to say, they're no big fan of ours

867
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:37,768
If they are in that factory,
that's where we going

868
01:21:37,769 --> 01:21:40,230
Lieutenant, I'll take you
anywhere you need to go

869
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:43,202
But prepare your men for a bigger
fight than you had imagine

870
01:21:43,203 --> 01:21:44,592
You're not fighting at men

871
01:21:44,593 --> 01:21:47,143
you're also fighting the
cartels that protecting them.

872
01:21:47,144 --> 01:21:50,773
If your targets make it into those
tunnels, they'll disappear like ghosts

873
01:23:34,058 --> 01:23:35,726
You enter the tunnels right here

874
01:23:35,908 --> 01:23:37,717
You walk several miles to this fork

875
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:39,784
my men will tell you which way to take

876
01:23:40,313 --> 01:23:42,408
Once you get to this point

877
01:23:42,757 --> 01:23:43,917
My job is done

878
01:23:44,762 --> 01:23:45,907
You're on your own

879
01:24:15,202 --> 01:24:16,311
Lieutenant, we're going now

880
01:24:17,023 --> 01:24:17,569
Roger that

881
01:24:40,522 --> 01:24:42,922
Chief, We'll not stopping, we'll
rolling up on target hard

882
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:45,040
Roger that, should've
there about 30 seconds up

883
01:25:38,987 --> 01:25:40,508
SA, on the roof!

884
01:25:51,987 --> 01:25:52,508
We gotta go

885
01:25:52,987 --> 01:25:53,508
Now!

886
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,871
Come on.
You stay here

887
01:26:26,273 --> 01:26:27,457
Sir, leave two men here

888
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,014
You two, stay here!

889
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,514
Weimy!

890
01:27:02,595 --> 01:27:03,533
Weimy!

891
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:06,265
I need you to lock this shit down

892
01:27:14,797 --> 01:27:15,540
Watch out!

893
01:27:45,855 --> 01:27:47,590
You guys got the gate

894
01:27:47,591 --> 01:27:48,391
Go!

895
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:49,952
Go to the front door!

896
01:27:52,782 --> 01:27:53,329
Go!

897
01:28:52,156 --> 01:28:52,904
One moment

898
01:28:53,132 --> 01:28:55,003
This is where you have to blow the bomb

899
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:58,829
What happens?

900
01:28:59,038 --> 01:29:01,685
You will meet your husband in heaven

901
01:30:00,464 --> 01:30:01,791
Boooooomb!!!!!!!!!

902
01:30:55,473 --> 01:30:56,384
Damn it, sir

903
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:58,433
I could explain that one to my family

904
01:30:58,434 --> 01:31:00,603
Keep back there, so I won't have to, huh?

905
01:31:17,269 --> 01:31:18,069
Clear

906
01:31:40,906 --> 01:31:42,777
Grenaaaaaade!

907
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:49,443
Chief, I got him

908
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:14,099
Keep going, I cover you

909
01:35:01,081 --> 01:35:02,099
Chief!

910
01:35:12,145 --> 01:35:17,702
Assault 2, this is Assault 1. Be advised, tunnel
is secure, and all threats are neutralized

911
01:35:18,131 --> 01:35:24,146
LT and Chief are down.
I say it again, LT and Chief are down.

912
01:36:20,599 --> 01:36:22,595
<i>Your father was a good man</i>

913
01:36:23,006 --> 01:36:25,392
<i>Growing up without him
is gonna be hard,</i>

914
01:36:25,393 --> 01:36:31,803
<i>It's gonna hurt. You feel alone, out
to see with no shore and sight</i>

915
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:49,316
<i>Remember, you have your

<i>The code that make your
father who he was</i>

917
01:36:51,008 --> 01:36:54,007

make you a man</i>

918
01:36:57,007 --> 01:37:00,507
<i>Your father's will, his

<i>No one's stronger than a man</i>

<i>who can harness his
emotions and his past</i>

928
01:37:44,858 --> 01:37:49,666
<i>use it as motivation to write the
most important letter of your life</i>

929
01:39:03,101 --> 01:39:08,748
