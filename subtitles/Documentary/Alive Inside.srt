1
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:06,096
How old are you?

2
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:07,425
How old am I?

3
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:07,725
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,850
I'm 90 years old.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,679
What was life like when

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,508
You were a little girl?

7
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:19,933
Oh, god.

8
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,925
I've forgotten so much.

9
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,308
I can't...

10
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,467
I've forgotten so much.

11
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,862
I'm very sorry.

12
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,058
No, it's okay.

13
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:30,975
What have you forgotten?

14
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:34,491
I've forgotten what I used to

15
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:38,008
Do after I became a young lady.

16
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,258
I've forgotten so much.

17
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,883
I can't remember.

18
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,308
I've been here...

19
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:45,633
I've been here... I've been

20
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:46,683
Here 90 years.

21
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:48,725
And if I could remember,

22
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:51,383
I would tell you, but I don't.

23
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,925
I can't remember.

24
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,392
I want

25
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,967
To try an experiment.

26
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:58,933
What?

27
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,050
I want you to try and let the

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,946
Music take you back

29
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:05,642
Into your memories.

30
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:09,550
To travel back into time...

31
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,196
and then we'll stop,

32
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:12,789
And you can tell me

33
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,383
Where it took you.

34
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,320
You ready?

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,058
Mm-Hmm.

00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:19,633

and I worked in Kingstown for

59
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:03,133
Nine years in the "E" building

60
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,058
In Kingstown...

61
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,950
my birthday November 20th...

62
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,642
that was in the wartime...

63
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:10,217
I was working in ft. Jackson...

64
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:11,100
and my son,

65
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,408
On February the 4th, was 69.

66
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:15,717
I didn't know I could talk so

67
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,717
Much!

68
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:23,200
This is Dan Cohen.

69
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,842
Six years ago, he volunteered

70
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,862
At a nursing home, and

71
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:30,883
What he experienced there

72
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,267
Changed his life.

73
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:35,800
Dan asked me to film him

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
For one day.

75
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,842
Adjusting the camera.

76
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,592
Go get the...

77
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,142
he wanted to show

78
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:48,575
People what he was seeing...

79
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:52,008
what was happening when he gave

80
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,850
Elders with dementia

81
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,550
Music that they had loved.

82
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,950
Music connects people

83
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,833
With who they have been, who

84
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,379
They are, and their lives.

85
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,725
'Cause what happens when

86
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,325
You get old is all the things

87
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,791
You're familiar with, and your

88
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,258
Identity are all just being

89
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,592
Peeled away...

90
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:05,017
what unfolded that

91
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:07,092
First day moved me so much,

92
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,508
I ended up following

93
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,978
Dan for three years.

94
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:15,342
Did you work with

95
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,550
Elderly people before?

96
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,183
Well, I'm

97
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,575
A social worker, and so I have

98
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:20,967
Worked with elderly people

99
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:21,433
When I was...

100
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,050
Actually for my internship, but

101
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,987
It really wasn't...

102
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:24,725
Most of my life was

103
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,721
Spent in the computer industry.

104
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,717
And this is sort of, for me,

105
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,175
Putting two things

106
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,633
I love together.

107
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:41,700
We really want to learn what

108
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,175
Music someone's going to really

109
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,487
Recognize and enjoy.

110
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,727
One of the residents

111
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,967
Is a resident who likes

112
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,183
Gospel music.

113
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:56,008
Church was all his life, and

114
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,183
I think that

115
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:59,675
We could start with him.

116
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:05,491
Henry, speak to me!

117
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:07,758
I want to hear your voice.

118
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,112
Can you talk to me?

119
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,267
Let me hear you.

120
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,217
Tell me your full name.

121
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,258
Henry has

122
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,808
Dementia and he needs

123
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,700
Total assistance with all his

124
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,592
Activities of daily living.

125
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,883
Hi, papa.

126
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:30,841
Hi, papa.

127
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:31,600
Huh?

128
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,225
How you doing?

129
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm all right, I'm fine.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,133
Who am I?

131
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:37,850
Huh?

132
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,142
Who am I?

133
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:41,133
I'm your daughter.

134
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,362
Daughter?

135
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:43,560
Mm-Hmm.

136
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,558
Which one?

137
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,262
Wait a minute...

138
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:47,767
I don't know...

139
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,342
I got so many, I don't know.

140
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:50,933
God knows.

141
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,554
You've got so many?

142
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:53,975
Maybe grand-Daughters...

143
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,467
well, that's what I mean...

144
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:57,433
I don't know.

145
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,012
Okay, it's Cherie.

146
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:00,592
How long has he been in

147
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:01,600
The nursing home?

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,475
Approximately 10 years.

149
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:06,008
It affects me greatly, because

150
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,767
He was always, you know,

151
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,304
Fun-Loving, singing, you know?

152
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,842
On every occasion, he would come

153
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,058
Out with a song.

154
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:15,967
I remember as a child he used to

155
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,362
Walk us down the street,

156
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:18,758
Me and my brother, and he'd

157
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:19,267
Stop and do

158
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:20,517
"Singin' in the rain."

159
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:22,592
He would have us jumping and

160
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,237
Swinging around poles.

161
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:25,883
He was good, he was always

162
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,612
Into music, you know?

163
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:29,342
He always loved singing,

164
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:29,975
Dancing.

165
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:32,550
You want your music

166
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:32,933
Now?

167
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,808
Let's try your music, okay?

168
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,175
And then you tell me if it's too

169
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,350
Loud or not, okay?

170
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,508
Music is inseparable

171
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,154
From emotion.

172
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:43,600
So it's not just

173
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,929
A physiological stimulus.

174
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,058
If it works at all, it

175
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,450
Will call the whole person...

176
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,604
The many different parts of

177
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,681
Their brain, and the memories

178
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,758
And emotions which go with it.

179
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,633
♪ He is my lord ♪

180
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,508

181
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,392
This?

182
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,054
You can if you like.

183
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,717

00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,300
When I first met him, he was

188
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,475
Very isolated, and he

189
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:27,304
Used to always sit on the unit

190
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,133
With his head like this...

191
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,225
he didn't really talk

192
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,075
To much people, and then when

193
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,729
I introduced the music to him,

194
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:39,383
This is his reaction ever since.

00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,758
Something to all of us...

200
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,971
Everyone in the room felt it.

201
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:01,948

202

The philosopher Kant once

207
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:19,642
Called music

208
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:20,975
"The quickening art,"

209
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:22,783
And Henry is being quickened,

210
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,592
He is being brought to life.

211
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:24,933
Yeah?

212
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,491
I'm going to take the music

213
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,050
For one second, okay, just to

214
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,883
Ask you a few

215
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:29,883
Questions, okay?

216
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:30,945
How awake was he?

217
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,008
I'm gonna give it

218
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:32,600
Back to you.

219
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,054
Was he still lost

220
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,385
In his dementia?

221
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:36,517
Or had the music

222
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,467
In some way changed that?

223
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,133
Henry?

224
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:39,600
Yeah?

225
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,387
Do you like the iPod?

226
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,175
Do you like the music you're

227
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:43,946
Hearing?

228
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:44,517
Yes.

229
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:46,700
Tell me about your music.

230
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,666
I don't... I don't...

231
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,733
I don't have one, I mean.

232
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,800
Do you like music?

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,975
Yeah, I'm

234
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,975
Crazy about music.

235
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:58,008
Used to play beautiful music,

236
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:58,975
Beautiful sounds.

237
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:00,846
Did you play music when you

238
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,717
Were... Did you like music

239
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,050
When you were young?

240
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,392
Yes. Yes.

241
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:08,012
I went to big dances and things.

242
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,633
What was your favorite music

243
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,841
When you were young?

244
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,091
Well, I guess...

245
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,142
well, cab Calloway was

246
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:20,425
My number one band guy I liked.

247
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,800
Good?

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,475
Yeah.

249
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:36,050
What was your favorite song?

250
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,892
Oh.

Yeah?

264
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,592
What was the favorite part of

265
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,058
Your life?

266
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:14,758
What was your favorite part

267
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:15,570
Of your life?

268
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,183
My life?

269
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,491
Well, part of my life

270
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:18,800
Was riding a bicycle,

271
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,683
Grocery boy...

272
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,633
what did you like about

273
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,683
Riding a bicycle?

274
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,241
That's where I made my money.

275
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,562
So, in some sense,

276
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:29,683
Henry has re-Acquired his

277
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:32,467
Identity for a while through the

278
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,683
Power of music.

279
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,925
What does music

280
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:36,767
Do to you?

281
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:39,217
It gives me the feeling of

282
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,267
Love, romance.

283
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,429
Figure right now, the world

284
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,592
Needs to come into music,

285
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:45,225
Singing.

286
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,675
You got beautiful music here,

287
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,696
Beautiful, oh, lovely.

288
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,717
And I feel a band of love,

289
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,558
Of dreams.

290
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:55,050
The lord came to me, made me

291
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:55,558
Holy.

292
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,883
I'm a holy man, so he gave

293
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,142
Me these sounds.

294
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,925
Let's say I meet you...

295
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,392

296
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:06,842

Think happened with Henry?

301
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:13,925
I mean, what did we just see

302
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:14,725
Happening with Henry?

303
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,408
We connected with Henry.

304
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,092
We connected with Henry's self.

305
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:21,800
You know, when you're in

306
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,308
A nursing home or when you

307
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,700
Have Alzheimer's disease, you're

308
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,092
Really struggling with your own

309
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,967
Thoughts and confusion...

310
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,050
Dan was excited.

311
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,475
I was excited.

312
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:37,158
What if all these people we'd

313
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,842
Seen could be awakened like

314
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:41,892
Henry?

315
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,033
All a sudden,

316
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,166
Everything falls into

317
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,337
Place and you're right

318
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:46,508
There with the music, you

319
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,487
Understand it.

320
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:48,267
It's pleasurable.

321
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,054
You're not thinking about

322
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:51,842
Anything else, you're not

323
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:52,517
Struggling.

324
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:56,508
Oh, how lovely!

325
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:04,367
This is no small problem.

326
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,292
There are five million people

327
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:10,017
In America with dementia.

328
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:13,200
10 million people spend a large

329
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,383
Part of their life caring for

330
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,100
Them.

331
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,158
There are maybe a million

332
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:21,217
People in nursing homes

333
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:21,767
Losing their

334
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:22,850
Connection to life.

335
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,383
Let me give you a kiss.

336
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,550
C'mon, sweetheart!

337
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,133
Mmm.

338
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,716
Dad!

339
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,195
Hello.

340
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:35,143
Hello!

341
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,892
Johnny?

342
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:39,033
Hey, Johnny!

343
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,975
How are you?

344
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:46,300
I mean, isn't this desire...

345
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,904
A desire to awaken another

346
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:52,039
Person, to what they are,

347
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:56,669
To what they could be...

348
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,276
A deep part of being human?

349
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:03,434
How often does anybody have

350
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:06,592
A chance to affect the lives of

351
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,600
A million or more people?

352
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,533
I'm hoping people are ready to

353
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,467
Come along on this journey...

354
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,883
here you go..

355
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,800
You hold this.

356
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,966
There you go.

357
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:24,175
We all know music is magic.

358
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,091
I feel like I'm

359
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,808
One with the world.

360
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,467
And for those with dementia,

361
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,633
It can be a back door into

362
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,433
The mind.

363
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,508
The parts of the brain

364
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,487
Which are involved in

365
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,560
Remembering music and

366
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,701
Responding to music are

367
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,875
Not affected too much in

368
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,050
Alzheimer's disease or other

369
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,975
Dementias...

370
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:52,050
part of the reason why

371
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,675
Musical memories are

372
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,600
So strong has

373
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,825
Something to do with the way

374
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,050
Music enters our brain in the

375
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,933
First place.

376
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,300
Music has more ability to

377
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,946
Activate more parts of

378
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:05,435
The brain than any

379
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,725
Other stimulus.

380
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:09,846
Music seems to be a cultural

381
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,698
Invention which makes use of

382
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:15,550
Parts of the brain developed for

383
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,767
Other purposes.

384
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,717
Not only auditory parts,

385
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,383
But visual parts,

386
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,850
Emotional parts,

387
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,600
And at the lower level,

388
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,762
In the cerebellum... All the

389
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:29,343
Basic parts for coordination.

390
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:32,217
When we are young, music

391
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:35,092
Records itself in our motions

392
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,600
And emotions.

393
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,842
Luckily, these are the last

394
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,142
Parts of the brain

395
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:42,133
Touched by Alzheimer's.

396
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:47,217
Great song.

397
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,683
Yep.

398
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:52,425
Can we hold hands a little bit?

399
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,850
Ah, that's better.

400
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,908
We're too far from each other.

401
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:59,967
For the patients with

402
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,683
Alzheimer's, it has to be

403
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:05,383
Music which has meaning for them

404
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,683
And is correlated

405
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,642
With memory and feeling.

406
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,562
♪ Hold you so much ♪ ♪

407

And by exciting or awakening

408
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,600
Those pathways, we have

409
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,967
A gateway to stimulate and reach

410
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,717
Somebody who otherwise is

411
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,008
Unreachable.

412
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:24,033
Yeah, it's not an

413
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:26,133
Easy life for you.

00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,600
I love you.

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,133
I love you, too.

416
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,575
I have one resident

417
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,758
That barely opened her eyes, she

418
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,683
Didn't respond.

419
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:48,800
As much as I tried... I knew

420
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,058
Her for two years...

421
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,342
No matter what I tried, massage

422
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:55,342
Wouldn't work,

423
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:58,142
Nothing worked.

424
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:00,258
But when we got introduced to

425
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,966
The iPods and the family

426
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,779
Told me the things that she

427
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,592
Liked, it was amazing once we

428
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:06,808
Put the iPod on her.

429
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,429
She started shaking her feet,

430
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:16,050
She started moving her head.

431
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:26,300
Her son was just amazed...

432
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,341
okay, can we stop?

433
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,383
'Cause now I'm...

434
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,183
getting...

435
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:34,550
I'm seeing her all over again.

Nursing home resident in

441
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:49,517
America.

442
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,717
That's to pause it, to

443
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:52,933
Start it up again,

444
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,200
And hit the button again.

445
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,467
Couldn't be easier.

446
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:57,933
Yes.

447
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,408
So why don't these people

448
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,883
Have their music already?

449
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,945
And why does it take

With a $40 personal music

462

System, that will take a lot of

463

Work,

464
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:41,179
Because personal music doesn't

465
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:43,925
Count as a medical intervention.

466
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,850
You see what I'm saying?

467
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,175
It's sort of a side thing over

Here.

The real business, trust me,

00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:52,342
Is in the pill bottle.

Our healthcare system

473
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:58,156
Imagines the human being to be

474
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,425
A very complicated machine,

475
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,612
And we've figured out

476
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:02,800
How to turn the dials.

477
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,475
Blood pressure?

478
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:05,175
Oh, turn that down, you know?

479
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:05,725
Blood sugar?

480
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:06,808
Oh, turn that down.

481
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:09,550
We have medicines that can

482
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,183
Adjust the dials.

483
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,642
We haven't done anything,

484
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,617
Medically speaking, to touch the

485
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:19,592
Heart and soul of a patient.

486
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,446
Gil?

487
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,100
Yes?

488
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,600
They want you upstairs.

489
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,592
You have to come take your meds.

490
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:26,975
Mmm.

491
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,758
No, you refused this morning,

492
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,862
So they want you to

493
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:30,967
Come now and take them.

494
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:31,225
No.

495
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,258
Listen, you know it's

496
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,350
Important, okay?

497
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,017
Look how you're acting,

498
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,242
Okay, you need your medication.

499
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:40,396
Well, Gil is a little different.

500
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,550
As you can see, he's a big guy,

501
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,029
He's a strong guy.

502
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:45,308
When he gets agitated,

503
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:46,908
We really need things in place

504
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,508
That are going to work and

505
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,142
Work quickly.

506
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:52,842
My anger manifests itself in

507
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:56,237
Very many different ways.

508
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:59,433
The anger is there, but

509
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:04,092
Sometimes I can't express it.

510
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:07,033
I like to think of

511
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,270
Distress as communication.

512
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,118
If you give a highly sedating

513
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,730
Medication to that kind of

514
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,142
A person, you're actually

515
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,050
Taking away the one avenue they

516
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,258
Have to tell you they

517
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:17,975
Have a problem.

518
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,804
And the problem with that is you

519
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:21,633
Can turn a person who is engaged

520
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,475
Into a person who

521
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:24,325
Is withdrawn into themselves

522
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,175
And no longer able to connect to

523
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,308
The world around them.

524
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:29,762
I wish I had my freedom.

525
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,114
That's the most important part.

526
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,467
That is what makes me the most

527
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,633
Pissed off of all.

528
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,600
That I can't go out.

529
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,554
The thing people lose most

530
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:44,508
Is those intangibles... The idea

531
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,154
Of choice and control.

532
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:47,518
We're going to do your

533
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:48,683
Medicine now, all right?

534
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,116
Just every aspect of

535
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,550
"What am I going to do next?"

536
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,308
Is dictated to you in

537
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:53,925
Most institutional environments.

538
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,183
Drink some of that.

539
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:56,991
And music creates

540
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,708
Spontaneity that you cannot

541
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:00,462
Create in an institution.

542
00:20:00,662 --> 00:20:02,152
It takes you to a place where

543
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:03,684
You can leave the regimen

544
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,017
And go off in a world

545
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,950
That you create and that you

546
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,883
Connect with on your own terms.

547
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,092
Hi, Gil.

548
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,058
Hi.

549
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,550
I brought you your music

550
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,216
That you requested.

551
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,966
And put it on your

552
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,717
Ears, over your head.

553
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:20,883
That fit okay?

554
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:21,475
Yeah.

555
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:23,762
Okay. And here's your iPod.

556
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:26,050
All you have to do is click the

557
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,642
Center button, one time.

558
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:30,467
♪ The magic of your sighs ♪ ♪

559
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,767

00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:53,800

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,392
Does that.

568
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:56,158
And medicine can dim the

569
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,925
Spark or the light, it never

570
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:58,767
Brings it out.

571
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,967
What they need is engagement,

572
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,612
They need to succeed in

573
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:04,058
The world around them.

574
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:06,533
So, you want an iPod, too?

575
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,791
First, what is an iPod?

576
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,050
I don't know anything about

577
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,975
Electronics!

578
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:14,175
He has his favorite music,

579
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:15,679
And it's playing.

580
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:16,933
That's all it is.

581
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,050
It's like your own jukebox.

582
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,142
Okay, let's start.

583
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:23,508
She wants to see what it

584
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,467
Looks like, the iPod.

585
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,154
Small.

586
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,642
No kidding.

587
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:31,637
Denise is

588
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:33,760
A bipolar schizophrenic.

589
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,883
She's been with us for about

590
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,300
Two years.

591
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:43,050
I like...

592
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:56,133
Denise doesn't hold back any

593
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:56,850
Emotion.

594
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,179
Her joy is off the charts.

595
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:01,406
Unfortunately, so is her

596
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:03,433
Sorrow and her anger.

597
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:06,508
So, she's very raw, she's very

598
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,142
Real.

599
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:08,700
Do you know

600
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,258
What I'd like to do?

601
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:21,217
Denise is probably

602
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,508
An extreme resident that

603
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,767
We have here.

604
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,179
I'm being emphatic,

605
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,592
And I have a very vivid

606
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:30,892
Imagination.

607
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:34,217
I'm very resilient but I drop,

608
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:37,529
And I keep on trying,

609
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:40,842
And I drop, but I never

610
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,112
Stop, and I drop.

611
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,310
One of these days,

612
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,326
I'm going to drop and

613
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:49,342
Stay on the floor!

614
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,433
Careful.

615
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,225
I won't fall!

616
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:12,633
I've lived here two years

617
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,058
And never fallen!

618
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:16,467
I couldn't believe the music

619
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,225
Let Denise

620
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:18,850
Push away her walker.

621
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,241
She'd been using that walker

622
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,291
Every day for two years.

623
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,470
It's Spanish.

624
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,426
You're not Spanish.

625
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,425
No, I'm not Spanish.

626
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,425
I'm following your lead.

627
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,575
I'm having fun.

628
00:23:59,775 --> 00:24:01,475
Good, me, too.

629
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:04,508
A little music bringing this

630
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,433
Much joy.

631
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,741
It only makes sense when you

632
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:10,050
Understand their isolation.

633
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,137
What happens when

634
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:22,758
They come to a nursing home?

635
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,975
What are their losses?

636
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:28,550
I never thought I would be in

637
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,279
A situation like this.

638
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:34,008
They lose their

639
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,558
Independence.

640
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:37,925
It's sad to say but sometimes

641
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,758
They lose their dignity.

642
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,433
That's it.

643
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:45,383
Sometimes they are

644
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,467
Dealing with the loss

645
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:51,050
Of a loved one.

646
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:56,842
Imagine losing that all in one

647
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:59,883
Day.

648
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:02,721
I wanna get home.

649
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:03,725
Yeah, you do?

650
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,300
I've been here for the last

651
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,175
Two or three days.

652
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,767
Right.

653
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,217
What do you want to do at home?

654
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:13,842
Be with my family.

655
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,346
Where we going?

656
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:19,892
Right down here.

657
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:21,467
People who have been here for

658
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:22,571
Years, that have dementia,

659
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,727
They'll still tell you,

660
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:24,883
"This is not where I live."

661
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:25,767
Well, I can

662
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,408
Go out this way, too.

663
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,050
Tom has been in this

664
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,404
Nursing home for

665
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:31,758
Five years now.

666
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:36,425
So, they're always

667
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,725
Trying to escape.

668
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:39,866
I have to go that way.

669
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:42,008
They're looking for the

670
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:42,558
Exits.

671
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:43,892
That's one of the most

672
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:45,596
Frequently asked questions is,

673
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,456
"How do I get out of here?"

674
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,517
Ah, no.

675
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:55,425
Can't get out here either,

676
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:55,850
Right?

677
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,471
Because this isn't their

678
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:59,092
Normal world when they come

679
00:25:59,292 --> 00:25:59,350
Here.

680
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,096
Now they're in this world, and

681
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:02,842
They're like, "this isn't the

682
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:04,252
World that I know."

683
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:10,225
It's stuck.

684
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:12,558
With few choices,

685
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:15,717
Little hope for the future,

686
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,475
No control over the

687
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:20,262
Medications flowing through

688
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:23,050
Them, is it any surprise their

689
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,279
Minds struggle to adapt?

690
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,310
People close their

691
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,342
Eyes and withdraw inward

692
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:30,350
More and more.

693
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,342
If the outside world is

694
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:33,558
Horrible, I go to

695
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,592
The inside to restore my

696
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,267
Balance.

697
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:40,592
But, after a while, people just

698
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,571
Become living dead people.

699
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:46,519
They go into vegetation, and

700
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:49,467
This does not have to be.

701
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,683
No.

702
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:53,758
I play... I play music.

703
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:54,308
I know.

704
00:26:54,508 --> 00:26:56,241
You're a trumpet player, right?

705
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,791
Yeah, and I play in a band.

706
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:01,142
What I've found is

707
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:05,175
That we all have music in us and

708
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,642
When we go through

709
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,283
What we go through, like trauma,

710
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:11,812
Caused by disease, caused by

711
00:27:12,012 --> 00:27:14,342
Wars, that gets covered up.

712
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,600
And I've found a way of

713
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,762
Accessing that with some people.

714
00:27:22,962 --> 00:27:25,552
So, it's really to help them

715
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:28,142
Find that song that they've

716
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:31,175
Covered up from the pain so they

717
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,508
Can sing again.

718
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,500
Samite is a volunteer who

719
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,050
Understood how music can bring

720
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,300
Back souls that have fled

721
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,308
The body...

722
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,383
souls that have been

723
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,475
Traumatized.

724
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,116
I've had a situation where

725
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:54,758
I was actually overwhelmed.

726
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,433
I was in the Congo.

727
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,425
These people were told that

728
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,142
This guy is

729
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:00,767
Coming to bring music...

730
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,700
The healing power of music...

731
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,633
Which was a little overwhelming

732
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,237
Because these were about

733
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:07,842
150 women who had just gone

734
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:08,683
Through rape...

735
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:11,258
who had just gone through the

736
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,133
Worst abuses you could

737
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,225
Have imagined.

738
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:17,158
I think I was inspired actually,

739
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,812
Because I picked up the flute

740
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:22,267
And I played a really sad

741
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,425
Melody, and the melody came from

742
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,966
The pain that I knew these

743
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,445
Women had been subjected to.

744
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,747
And when I finished the flute

745
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:34,850
I could see tears running

746
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,991
Down some of the women's faces.

747
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:41,133
And the next place I knew that

748
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,175
I had to take them was to

749
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,133
Sing a happy song.

750
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,892
So, I kicked into...

751
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:58,425
And soon they started moving

752
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,142
A little bit,

753
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:01,082
And soon they were clapping.

754
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:04,842
And I'm telling you, three hours

755
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,404
Later we're still singing.

756
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:10,206
And now we're all connected.

757
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:13,274
We're all just one body.

758
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:16,342
Everybody just singing.

759
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,658
When I go to nursing homes, they

760
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:27,104
Remember these amazing stories,

761
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:29,550
But it's always through music

762
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,808
That they're able

763
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,642
To express themselves,

764
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:35,346
And that reminds those people,

765
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:38,050
We will have a chance to be

766
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,008
Happy again.

767
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:53,967
Music had always been

768
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,433
A big part of my life.

769
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,575
When I was younger, I played the

770
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:00,717
Trumpet, I played the organ,

771
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,258
I played the piano...

772
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:08,242
when I went off to college in

773
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:10,517
The early '70s, I had the

774
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:13,467
Requisite giant album collection

775
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,758
Which I carried through

776
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,217
To my marriage.

777
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:27,217
When I ended up here, I lost all

778
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:29,258
Of my music...

779
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,217
my world became this facility.

780
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:44,221
This is

781
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:46,885
Solitary confinement.

782
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:49,350
And every human being

783
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,800
Needs stimulation from the

784
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,654
Outside, from little

785
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:56,123
Babies to old people.

786
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:58,592
That's why music is so

787
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,058
Important.

788
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,179
If you find the music that the

789
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:04,300
People know, there's stimulation

790
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,392
And communication,

791
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:07,342
And people do not withdraw

792
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:08,800
Inward.

793
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:14,533
Like many people in this

794
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:17,633
Institution, Steve found

795
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,383
Himself alone.

796
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,575
After eight years of

797
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:33,979
Being here, I finally had the

798
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:37,389
Opportunity to get my music.

799
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,800
Okay, how's that? Good?

800
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:59,800
And all of a sudden...

801
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,300
vistas which I thought were

802
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,800
Closed to me opened up.

803
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,258
Have you ever had music just

804
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,558
Hit you in a place that

805
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:31,758
Immediately brought you to tears

806
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:32,517
And you don't

807
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,075
Understand why, you know?

808
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:35,458
Music has that power.

809
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:36,842
I can remember being

810
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:37,600
Five years old,

811
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,221
Hearing this music in the

812
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:41,531
Distance, crawling to it.

813
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,842
It was "rhapsody on a theme

814
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:45,350
Of Paganini."

815
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,575
You know, crawling to the music,

816
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:49,800
Laying on the floor, and crying.

817
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,425
Music touches us all.

818
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,050
How deep does it run

819
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,946
Inside of us?

820
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:58,642
Watch.

821
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:01,933
♪ Ba, Ba... ♪

822
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:06,675
♪ Ba, Ba... ♪

823
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,492
Okay.

824
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:32,425
When does our relationship

825
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,717
With music begin?

826
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:40,842
At 22 days, a single cell jolts

827
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:43,433
To life.

828
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:45,308
This first beat

829
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:48,304
Awakens nearby cells and,

830
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:51,300
Incredibly, they all begin to

831
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,383
Beat in perfect unison.

832
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,508
These beating cells divide

833
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,383
And become your heart.

834
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,133
And this desire to beat in

835
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,883
Unison seemingly fuels our

836
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,267
Entire lives.

837
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:27,383
♪ Ah, Bo, Bo, Ba... ♪

838
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:35,741
♪ Ba, da, da, da, da... ♪

839
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,925
Amazingly, after six months

840
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,091
Of development, the

841
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,058
Cerebral cortex is

842
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:46,467
Capable of supporting thought.

843
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,133
Yeah, oh, the ladybugs

844
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,725
Are super-Cute.

845
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:54,175
Researchers have studied the

846
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,475
Sounds of newborns and

847
00:34:56,675 --> 00:34:59,325
Discovered that in their cries

848
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:02,175
Are patterns that reflect their

849
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,642
Mothers' speech.

850
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:05,758
I know, and you want

851
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:06,725
To bring it.

852
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:09,679
This means that even before

853
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:12,633
We're born, we are learning

854
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:13,850
How to sing

855
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,425
With another human being.

856
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:26,883
♪ Ba, Ba, Ba... ♪

857
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:34,041
I wondered how

858
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:35,892
Everyone knows that.

859
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,217
Regardless of what country I'm

860
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:39,633
In, it seems like

861
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,850
Everyone knows that.

862
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,633
Now, how is that possible if it

863
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,675
Wasn't already inside you?

864
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:55,220
Every child will tend

865
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,010
To keep time to music, heard

866
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,800
Or imagined, which you will not

867
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,758
See in a chimpanzee.

868
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:06,039
That's it!

869
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,475
I got it!

870
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:09,308
Music seems to be

871
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:11,592
Almost as quintessentially human

872
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:13,300
As language.

873
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:26,550
This response to a beat may be

874
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,050
Hard-Wired and human...

875
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,058
and I think

876
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:33,100
Almost all human beings

877
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,800
Will bring out their inherent

878
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Musicality...

879
00:36:52,258 --> 00:36:55,017
277.

880
00:36:55,217 --> 00:36:57,217
You have a little bit of room

881
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:57,725
To grow.

882
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,533
I've got a lot of room to

883
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:01,342
Grow, considering it will

884
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,350
Hold 2,000 songs.

885
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,975
Do you have "piano man"?

886
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,133
It's thrilling to me

887
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,925
To be able to see a person

888
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,612
Who's been without music for

889
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,289
Years and then watch how

890
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:12,967
That person comes alive.

891
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:13,975
I mean, that's...

892
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:16,195
As a physician, that's a thrill.

893
00:37:19,883 --> 00:37:23,133
But there's something behind

894
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,633
That wonderful moment.

895
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:31,675
I mean, how did that happen in

896
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,946
The first place?

897
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:38,017
Why were we able to

898
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,758
Feed and water and medicate this

899
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,842
Person but not respond to

900
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:43,808
Deeply human

901
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:45,925
Needs that he might have?

902
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,804
A century ago, they

903
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,675
Were called "nursing homes"

904
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:53,850
Because you received

905
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,883
Nursing care, and most of the

906
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:56,558
Time it was

907
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:58,350
In a home-Like setting.

908
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,575
That was before, I guess, our

909
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,800
Civilization advanced to the

910
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,654
Point where we created

911
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:06,508
15,000 nursing homes based

912
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:07,978
On a hospital model.

913
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,096
How did this become the way

914
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:19,592
Millions of Americans end their

915
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:20,433
Life?

916
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,345
The civilization of the

917
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:24,058
Past 100 years with its

918
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,408
Startling industrial changes

919
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:28,758
Has tended more and more to

920
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,592
Make life insecure...

921
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:35,425
technology has radically

922
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,633
Transformed the

923
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,642
Human environment.

924
00:38:39,842 --> 00:38:42,283
Our safety, no longer tied

925
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:46,000
To the home, or the village,

926
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,717
Became tied to something else.

927
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:52,392
We became urban and the

928
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:56,050
Traditional family structures

929
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,842
Began to feel pressure

930
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,308
And weaken.

931
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:02,850
As a consequence, by

932
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,175
The late 1800s, elders, in

933
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,225
Alarming numbers,

934
00:39:08,425 --> 00:39:12,008
Were ending their days in the

935
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:15,091
Poorhouse, alongside the

936
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,975
Insane and the homeless.

937
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:20,637
This social security measure

938
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:23,364
Gives at least some protection

939
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:26,092
To 30 millions of our citizens

940
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,350
Who will reap

941
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,533
Direct benefits through

942
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,517
Old-Age pensions...

943
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:34,492
There was a real

944
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:37,542
Awareness that older people

945
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,046
In America were sick and poor,

946
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,402
And a decision was made to

947
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:44,726
Support them, not through the

948
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,050
Welfare system, but through the

949
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,308
Healthcare system.

950
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:50,825
And so, what we had was this

951
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:53,333
Incredible shotgun marriage of

952
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:55,842
The poorhouse and the hospital

953
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:57,058
And that's what

954
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:58,925
Nursing homes became.

955
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:04,450
A new industry was born.

956
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,729
This business exploded after

957
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:10,618
The Medicaid act of 1965.

958
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:13,334
The idea of taking

959
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:16,050
Care of elders on a mass scale

960
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,100
Was something new

961
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,054
In human history, and it was

962
00:40:19,254 --> 00:40:20,808
Bound to run into problems.

963
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,800
Early on, there were accusations

964
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,808
Of "warehousing" elders,

965
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:28,675
Overusing physical restraints,

966
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,600
And even when reformers

967
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,262
Challenged that practice and

968
00:40:33,462 --> 00:40:35,925
Reduced it, a new problem came

969
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,862
Up... The overuse of

970
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:39,600
Anti-Psychotic drugs.

971
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,866
These drugs aren't designed

972
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:44,133
For use with elders, and yet

973
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,008
They're being massively

974
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,883
Overused in nursing homes.

975
00:40:52,342 --> 00:40:54,925
Give me a kiss right here.

976
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,717
Kiss me.

977
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:59,433
Thank you.

978
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:01,058
American

979
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,450
Nursing homes actually have

980
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,729
Some of the best people in our

981
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,035
Nation, some of the biggest

982
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:10,313
Hearts, most generous spirit,

983
00:41:10,513 --> 00:41:12,592
The greatest joy and laughter.

984
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:15,029
I love these people.

985
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:17,267
However, they go to work

986
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:21,012
Every day inside an institution

987
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,758
That defines people in terms of

988
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:26,862
Their diagnoses and

989
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:28,767
Their disabilities

990
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:31,783
And thinks of them as patients

991
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:34,800
First, human beings second.

992
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:38,508
He doesn't really

993
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,050
Initiate conversation.

994
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,392
He just kind of... exists.

995
00:41:43,592 --> 00:41:45,217
Does he already have music in

996
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:45,642
His room?

997
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:46,767
Does he have a radio?

998
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:49,800
I don't think he has a radio

999
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,258
In his room, no.

1000
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,717
He has dementia?

1001
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:53,308
Mm-Hmm.

1002
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:54,433
He has dementia.

1003
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:56,467
Johnny, can you tell

1004
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:57,927
Us, who's this guy?

1005
00:41:59,175 --> 00:42:00,767
Who's that guy?

1006
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:04,217
Is that you, when you were in

1007
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,350
The navy?

1008
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,725
Is that me?

1009
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:09,387
Do I look like that?

1010
00:42:09,587 --> 00:42:12,510
Yeah, that's you.

1011
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,433
That's not too bad!

1012
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,575
A couple of years and

1013
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:19,646
A lot of Tommy Dorsey, big band?

1014
00:42:19,846 --> 00:42:21,717
All of this stuff, let me sort

1015
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:22,225
It out.

1016
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:23,433
Frank Sinatra...

1017
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:26,241
How about this one?

1018
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:29,050
We tried to learn john's

1019
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:29,642
Story.

1020
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:30,308
Who's that guy?

1021
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,267
Is that the same guy?

1022
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,675
To help us find his deepest

1023
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:34,225
Music.

1024
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:35,850
I got more muscles.

1025
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,133
But how do you do this for

1026
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,392
Someone like john?

1027
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:41,887
All right, what about this?

1028
00:42:42,087 --> 00:42:44,383
We were told a few things.

1029
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,258
He played baseball.

1030
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,308
Oh!

1031
00:42:48,508 --> 00:42:51,633
He'd been drafted and served

1032
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,133
At Los Alamos.

1033
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:04,925
It was there that the army

1034
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,633
Gave him shots for

1035
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,142
Radiation poisoning...

1036
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:10,967
Shots that caused all his hair

1037
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:12,058
To fall out.

1038
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:14,058
Lastly, after the war, he

1039
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,470
Performed in Philadelphia under

1040
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,531
The stage name Larry Stewart,

1041
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,592
But we couldn't learn this from

1042
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:23,517
John.

1043
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:25,475
The sensory record...

1044
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:28,137
The movie that played only in

1045
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:30,800
John's mind, called memory...

1046
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,600
Is gone.

1047
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,842
His love, his dreams...

1048
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:41,642
gone.

1049
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:45,383
Who are we without our memory?

1050
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:51,842
♪ Oh Johnny, oh Johnny ♪

1051

Have known there was this much

1073
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,017
Life inside of john.

Him.

1079
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:00,304
For Johnny, getting his

1080
00:45:00,504 --> 00:45:02,633
Music, and a little focused

1081
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:03,683
Attention...

1082
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:06,012
you're quite the singer.

1083
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:08,260
Was all it took to awaken

1084
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,508
Feelings he hadn't felt in

1085
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,100
Years.

1086
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,933
I love to do it.

1087
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:16,092
When did you first

1088
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:16,517
Sing?

1089
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,758
When you were young, did you

1090
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:19,183
Sing?

1091
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,142
I don't know.

1092
00:45:22,342 --> 00:45:25,133
I'm just a small guy.

1093
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:26,350
Yeah?

1094
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,142
I'm crying.

1095
00:45:30,342 --> 00:45:32,575
Why? Are you sad?

1096
00:45:32,775 --> 00:45:34,808
I don't know.

1097
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:37,512
I love everybody around here.

1098
00:45:37,712 --> 00:45:40,156
My gang... This is my gang.

1099
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:42,800
This is your gang?

1100
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,225
Yeah?

1101
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:45,592
Does it make you happy to sing

1102
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:46,967
For us?

1103
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,142
Yeah.

1104
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:50,117
Half the people in

1105
00:45:50,317 --> 00:45:52,092
Nursing homes get no visitors,

1106
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,342
So it's not like

1107
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,392
Family can do it.

1108
00:45:54,592 --> 00:45:56,221
The nursing homes don't really

1109
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,050
Have a ready budget for this.

1110
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,308
The government does not

1111
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,325
Reimburse for music, and iPods,

1112
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,342
So it really needs to come from

1113
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:07,267
Somewhere.

1114
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:09,342
So my ultimate goal is to make

1115
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:10,642
This a standard of care

1116
00:46:10,842 --> 00:46:12,675
In all 16,000 nursing homes in

1117
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:13,716
The country.

1118
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:14,633
That's the goal.

1119
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:15,550
It depends on the

1120
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:15,933
Nursing home.

1121
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:17,300
It depends on how proactive the

1122
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,020
Volunteer department is.

1123
00:46:20,258 --> 00:46:22,075
Is this something you'd

1124
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:24,092
Want to explore for your own

1125
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:25,112
Facilities?

1126
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:26,227
Well, I have

1127
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:27,142
Several concerns.

1128
00:46:27,342 --> 00:46:28,592
That you give it to 2 people

1129
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:29,350
And 10 people are going

1130
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,616
To want it and I'm not going to

1131
00:46:30,816 --> 00:46:31,883
Be able to give it to them.

1132
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:32,841
Frankly, how

1133
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:33,600
It's administered.

1134
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,092
This is a very

1135
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:35,558
Big place.

1136
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:37,429
We have 600 residents here.

1137
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,510
Cost is also a significant

1138
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,592
Factor that we have to consider

1139
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:42,892
In every program.

1140
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:47,550
So tell me, how can

1141
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,475
I help you today?

1142
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:51,383
I'm looking for a donation.

1143
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,195
Sir, one second here.

1144
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,789
The research shows it,

1145
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:56,190
Our experience shows it...

1146
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,974
There is no doubt that

1147
00:46:58,174 --> 00:46:59,758
Mainstreaming the use of

1148
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:01,550
Personalized music,

1149
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,142
Using iPods...

1150
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:06,100
I spoke to the senior vice

1151
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,450
President and they... They have

1152
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,800
A no corporate philanthropy

1153
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,267
Policy.

1154
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:16,033
There are 16,000 nursing homes

1155
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,666
In the united states, and the

1156
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:19,337
Challenge is getting it out

1157
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,008
There, and we could really use

1158
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:21,517
Your help.

1159
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:24,179
Sandra day O'Connor

1160
00:47:24,379 --> 00:47:26,842
Talked to him about your project?

1161
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:28,112
No, about Alzheimer's,

1162
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,383
Support of the Alzheimer's

1163
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:29,892
Association.

1164
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:33,758
Support for Alzheimer's.

1165
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:34,779
She talked to

1166
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:35,800
The man himself.

1167
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,267
Yeah.

1168
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:37,633
And he said no?

1169
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:38,058
Yeah.

1170
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:39,675
So, what luck am I going

1171
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,633
To have?

1172
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:55,050
How's the work going?

1173
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,092
It's a struggle.

1174
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,308
It's a struggle.

1175
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:01,679
I have to tell you,

1176
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,050
I am one of the few people who

1177
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:05,591
Actually knows how

1178
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:06,933
You feel about this.

1179
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:09,470
Because a couple of decades ago,

1180
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,008
I got really charged up by this

1181
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,767
Idea that we could bring

1182
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:16,425
Plants and animals and children

1183
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,341
Into the lives of elders.

1184
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:20,216
I had the same kind of

1185
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:22,112
Experiences that you've

1186
00:48:22,312 --> 00:48:23,935
Described, where I could

1187
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,558
See people come alive.

1188
00:48:25,758 --> 00:48:28,700
We had this dream that we'd

1189
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,000
Just go door to door, but we

1190
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,300
Couldn't penetrate, sort of, the

1191
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,808
Fog of the nursing home.

1192
00:48:38,008 --> 00:48:39,991
What you're doing is outside of

1193
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,175
Conventional practice and you

1194
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,008
Have to... And if you're

1195
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,987
Going to be successful going

1196
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:47,967
Forward, you have to understand

1197
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,777
How big a barrier that is.

1198
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:56,550
Ladies and gentlemen,

1199
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,267
Please find your seats.

1200
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,133
We went looking for

1201
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:01,017
Answers.

1202
00:49:01,217 --> 00:49:03,221
It turns out we are not alone.

1203
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:05,239
There are lots of people who

1204
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:07,269
Believe there's something

1205
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,300
Fundamentally wrong with the

1206
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,808
American nursing home.

1207
00:49:11,008 --> 00:49:12,950
I think we are part

1208
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,092
Of a movement that is much,

1209
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,100
Much, bigger.

1210
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,592
I want to work on culture

1211
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:17,933
Change.

1212
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:19,225
I want to support culture

1213
00:49:19,425 --> 00:49:21,285
Change as a national priority.

1214
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:33,325
Hi, bonnie.

1215
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:34,508
Hi, Dan. What's up?

1216
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:35,142
How are you?

1217
00:49:35,342 --> 00:49:37,300
We value independence and

1218
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,683
Have the hardest time,

1219
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:40,762
I believe, of any country with

1220
00:49:40,962 --> 00:49:42,642
The concept of dependence.

1221
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:45,967
And so, whereas other folks have

1222
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,612
Integrated aging, we had

1223
00:49:48,812 --> 00:49:50,810
A unique interest in saying,

1224
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,008
"Over there... I don't want to

1225
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,195
See it, I don't want

1226
00:49:54,395 --> 00:49:55,183
To know about it."

1227
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:56,758
Why are we changing

1228
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:56,975
Now?

1229
00:49:57,175 --> 00:49:58,554
Why are we changing now?

1230
00:49:58,754 --> 00:50:00,218
Because it's not working.

1231
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:01,967
Because it's dehumanizing.

1232
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,517
And I think, quite frankly,

1233
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:05,800
I think baby boomers are saying,

1234
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,571
"This is not acceptable.

1235
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,560
This is not how I want to be

1236
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,221
Treated when I get older."

1237
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:15,883
This was inspiring,

1238
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:16,558
But are

1239
00:50:16,758 --> 00:50:18,558
We really interested in

1240
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:21,158
Changing the way America ages?

1241
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,750
Might not realize it

1242
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,316
But the united states of America

1243
00:50:26,516 --> 00:50:28,766
Has only 6,000 geriatricians in

1244
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:31,217
A nation of 300 million people.

1245
00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:36,616
Even worse, that number is not

1246
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:40,124
Going up, it's going down.

1247
00:50:40,324 --> 00:50:43,003
This is unfortunate timing,

1248
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:45,485
Because the challenges we're

1249
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:47,967
Going to have to face are

1250
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:48,683
Growing.

1251
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:50,845
We're facing an epidemic

1252
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:53,008
Of neurologic diseases on

1253
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,258
A global scale.

1254
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:56,850
A cheery thought.

1255
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,762
On this map, every country

1256
00:50:58,962 --> 00:51:00,593
That's colored blue has more

1257
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:02,425
Than 20% of its population

1258
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:03,558
Over the age of 65.

1259
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:05,554
This is the world we live in.

1260
00:51:05,754 --> 00:51:07,364
And this is the world your

1261
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,978
Children will live in.

1262
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:10,392
For 12,000 years, the

1263
00:51:10,592 --> 00:51:12,342
Distribution of ages in the

1264
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:13,517
Human population has

1265
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:15,633
Looked like a pyramid with the

1266
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:16,475
Oldest on top.

1267
00:51:16,675 --> 00:51:20,592
It's already flattening out.

1268
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:23,100
By 2050, it's going to

1269
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,675
Be a column and will start to

1270
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,975
Invert...

1271
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:29,533
and this is why that's

1272
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:30,892
Not entirely a good

1273
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:33,092
Thing, because over the age of

1274
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,758
65, your risk of getting

1275
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:35,683
Alzheimer's or

1276
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:37,408
Parkinson's disease will

1277
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,187
Increase exponentially.

1278
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,014
There are five million

1279
00:51:41,214 --> 00:51:42,842
Alzheimer's patients in

1280
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:44,183
The united states.

1281
00:51:44,383 --> 00:51:46,054
In the next 10 years, that

1282
00:51:46,254 --> 00:51:47,925
Number will come close

1283
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:48,725
To doubling.

1284
00:51:48,925 --> 00:51:50,825
We do not have the facilities,

1285
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,925
We do not have the resources,

1286
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,737
Financial or otherwise,

1287
00:51:54,937 --> 00:51:56,550
To cope with that number

1288
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,350
Of people

1289
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,350
Suffering from dementia.

1290
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,387
We have to find a way to help

1291
00:52:01,587 --> 00:52:03,425
Them age in place in a healthy

1292
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:04,883
Manner.

1293
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:12,491
What do you call that?

1294
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:16,300
It's a... Fork... Sp...

1295
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,175
Knife?

1296
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:19,862
No? Fork?

1297
00:52:20,062 --> 00:52:21,550
Or spoon?

1298
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:26,758
She says we just don't

1299
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:27,683
Understand.

1300
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:30,241
I think that's probably true.

1301
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:32,833
You end up being dependent on

1302
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:35,425
Someone else for everything that

1303
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:36,100
You do.

1304
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,767
You can no longer write

1305
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,492
Your name, you struggle reading,

1306
00:52:40,692 --> 00:52:42,729
You lose small motor control.

1307
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:44,967
You can't even remember how to

1308
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:46,100
Get in and out of your

1309
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,990
Apartment, or the elevator.

1310
00:52:48,508 --> 00:52:50,700
So, do you remember where is

1311
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,092
The elevator, maybe it's here?

1312
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:54,842
It could be, yes.

1313
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:55,904
Okay.

1314
00:52:56,104 --> 00:52:56,767
Let's press.

1315
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:58,471
Do we go down or up?

1316
00:52:58,671 --> 00:52:59,975
We have to go down.

1317
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:02,133
Okay, so, do you want to

1318
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,404
Press for me?

1319
00:53:03,604 --> 00:53:04,675
Oh, yes, here.

1320
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:05,612
This one?

1321
00:53:05,812 --> 00:53:06,581
I'm not sure.

1322
00:53:06,781 --> 00:53:07,350
That's up.

1323
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,783
So that's down?

1324
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:10,217
This is down, yes.

1325
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:10,725
Okay.

1326
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:12,325
Oh, did I do that badly?

1327
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:13,833
I don't think so.

1328
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:15,342
Do you see the light?

1329
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:17,133
Yeah.

1330
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:39,642
Whoo!

1331
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:42,258
Oh, look, look, look.

1332
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,987
Oh, beautiful.

1333
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,517
Look at that.

1334
00:53:45,717 --> 00:53:47,842
Isn't that lovely?

1335
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:48,767
Oh, gotcha.

1336
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:50,675
I gotcha, I gotcha.

1337
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:51,892
Didn't I, huh?

1338
00:53:52,092 --> 00:53:55,008
For Marylou, loving her

1339
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,933
Grandson is easy.

1340
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:00,883
This is going to the, what?

1341
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:04,575
Where are you going to go?

1342
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,883
It's just everything else

1343
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:07,725
That is hard.

1344
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:10,592
I'm really bad, see.

1345
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:15,308
Let's see.

1346
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:19,508
But surprisingly, even deep

1347
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:22,100
Inside Alzheimer's,

1348
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,366
Her capacity for love and

1349
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:28,633
Affection remains strong.

1350
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,241
I have lots of people to talk

1351
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:37,883
To me and do all that kind of

1352
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:40,029
Thing, so I...

1353
00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:41,975
Yeah.

1354
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,283
Are you sad because

1355
00:54:44,483 --> 00:54:46,592
Other people don't have that?

1356
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:47,183
Yes.

1357
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:49,450
Of course, because how could

1358
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,717
I do things if I didn't have

1359
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:54,404
People with me?

1360
00:54:54,604 --> 00:54:56,892
So, that's...

1361
00:54:57,092 --> 00:54:59,342
this is a hard journey for

1362
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:00,217
You, huh?

1363
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:00,892
Yeah.

1364
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:04,283
Well, my husband...

1365
00:55:04,483 --> 00:55:07,675
he's wonderful.

1366
00:55:10,425 --> 00:55:11,637
Would you like to

1367
00:55:11,837 --> 00:55:12,850
Hear some music?

1368
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,467
Would you like to listen

1369
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:15,654
To some music.

1370
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:16,642
Sure. Why not?

1371
00:55:16,842 --> 00:55:18,758
What do you have, Dan?

1372
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:19,475
Here you go.

1373
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:20,967
I don't know how to do this.

1374
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:21,725
Straight over

1375
00:55:21,925 --> 00:55:23,050
Your ears and your head...

1376
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:23,308
perfect.

1377
00:55:23,508 --> 00:55:24,308
See the little

1378
00:55:24,508 --> 00:55:25,925
Button in the middle?

1379
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:26,558
Press that?

1380
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:28,300
Yeah, right in the middle.

1381
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,112
Click it once.

1382
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:29,725
There you go.

1383
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:31,092
♪ Round round get around

1384
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:32,821
I get around, yeah ♪

1385
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,550

Okay.

00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:43,100
It was...

I'm so glad to get it.

Thank you.

00:56:46,342 --> 00:56:49,008
And I love it, and you were very

1425
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,392
Nice to me and...

1426
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:52,258
okay, so they're tears of

Joy?

00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,414
Yeah.

1429
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:53,808
Okay

1430
00:56:54,008 --> 00:56:56,220
Just wanted to make sure.

1431
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,633
That's the best thing I've

1432
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,716
Ever, ever had.

1433
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,600
This thing, this...

1434
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,883
I don't know how to say it.

1435
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,350
It's just...

1436
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:11,633
it can't get away from me if I'm

1437
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,558
In this place.

1438
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:14,925
I thought you were

1439
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:16,237
Going to grow wings.

1440
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:17,872
I was trying.

1441
00:57:21,758 --> 00:57:23,679
We wanted to believe that

1442
00:57:23,879 --> 00:57:25,800
Music would help Marylou stay

1443
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,175
With her family longer.

1444
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:28,466
We didn't know if it

1445
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:30,862
Could do this, until we

1446
00:57:31,062 --> 00:57:33,456
Met Norman and Nell.

1447
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:46,012
Nell and I have been

1448
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,050
Able to avoid long term care for

1449
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,904
A number of years by

1450
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:52,831
Trying to keep her

1451
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:54,758
Constantly stimulated.

1452
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:55,558
Music has

1453
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:58,075
Been an enormous part of it.

1454
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,592
Then you'll play the piano for

1455
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:00,975
Us?

1456
00:58:01,175 --> 00:58:02,842
Yes, but I just want to be

1457
00:58:03,042 --> 00:58:03,717
With you lot.

1458
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:04,267
Okay.

1459
00:58:04,467 --> 00:58:05,617
Do you mind?

1460
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:06,854
Absolutely not.

1461
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:07,892
I'd love that.

1462
00:58:08,092 --> 00:58:11,175
Norman has cared for Nell at

1463
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:12,987
Home for 10 years

1464
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:14,600
Without drugs.

1465
00:58:21,508 --> 00:58:23,925
Without personalized music,

1466
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,154
Nell would be in

1467
00:58:26,354 --> 00:58:28,183
An institution.

1468
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:31,616
I have spent 38 years now

1469
00:58:31,816 --> 00:58:34,770
Working on Alzheimer's disease

1470
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,681
And I haven't done anything for

1471
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,219
Patients that's as effective

1472
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:42,758
As the music therapy is.

1473
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:46,342
I wish I had, and I'm

1474
00:58:46,542 --> 00:58:47,725
Still trying.

1475
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:51,387
But I really haven't seen

1476
00:58:51,587 --> 00:58:55,050
Anything as positive as that.

1477
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,175
Marylou and Nell have

1478
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:07,933
Family.

1479
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:12,717
Imagine having to navigate this

1480
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:17,342
On your own, far from

1481
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,892
Your home.

1482
00:59:20,092 --> 00:59:22,554
Denise got a message to us that

1483
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:25,010
She wanted us to come back...

1484
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,467
That she had something she

1485
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:30,092
Wanted to tell us.

1486
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:32,517
And we came...

1487
00:59:32,717 --> 00:59:34,137
Dan, how are you?

1488
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:35,558
Because we know

1489
00:59:35,758 --> 00:59:37,383
No one else visits her.

1490
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:44,550
It's a letter from the

1491
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,592
Hospital describing her

1492
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,017
Condition.

1493
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:50,767
"Meta-Stasis..."

1494
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:53,425
That means that it has

1495
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:54,966
Spread.

1496
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,508
Yes.

1497
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,758
So, because of that, I think

1498
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,925
It's very serious.

1499
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,550
It is very serious.

1500
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:10,175
You know, life goes on.

1501
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:14,267
It goes on!

1502
01:00:14,467 --> 01:00:17,217
Whether you die or not,

1503
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,600
It goes on.

1504
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,012
And I can not accept that

1505
01:00:21,212 --> 01:00:23,322
I don't leave something in

1506
01:00:23,522 --> 01:00:25,477
This world for somebody.

1507
01:00:25,677 --> 01:00:27,597
I cannot accept that!

1508
01:00:27,797 --> 01:00:29,717
Do you understand what

1509
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:30,917
I am saying?

1510
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:38,175
It's painful to feel that

1511
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,842
What you have to give

1512
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:40,850
Is not needed.

1513
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,717
That there's no one there to

1514
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:45,717
Receive your gifts...

1515
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:52,304
in our past, in all our

1516
01:00:52,504 --> 01:00:56,968
Stories, in other cultures,

1517
01:00:57,168 --> 01:01:01,633
Elderhood had something to

1518
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:04,433
Give, and there was

1519
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:07,758
Always someone there who needed

1520
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:10,058
What elders had to give.

1521
01:01:10,258 --> 01:01:15,575
Is this true in our new world?

1522
01:01:15,775 --> 01:01:19,416
Does elderhood have a place?

1523
01:01:19,616 --> 01:01:22,524
We're taught from

1524
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:25,099
A very early age that adulthood

1525
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:27,675
Is the pinnacle of existence.

1526
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:33,721
And that older people are really

1527
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:36,217
Just broken-Down versions of

1528
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:38,133
Their former incredible

1529
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:40,467
Selves...

1530
01:01:42,217 --> 01:01:44,825
we've built a culture that

1531
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:47,633
Prizes individuals who are

1532
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:49,142
Able to emulate

1533
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:51,762
The success of machines,

1534
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:54,383
That can be machine-Like

1535
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,092
In how they live.

1536
01:02:06,008 --> 01:02:08,262
This is not good news for aging,

1537
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:10,468
I have to say, because aging is

1538
01:02:10,668 --> 01:02:12,675
Not a machine-Like endeavor.

1539
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,700
And it's the fact that they are

1540
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,916
Moving into a different way of

1541
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:22,133
Living that causes America

1542
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:25,550
To put them away,

1543
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,967
To hide them away.

1544
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:29,767
What I have

1545
01:02:29,967 --> 01:02:31,350
Learned over a career

1546
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,679
Of working with older people is

1547
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:36,052
That American culture is wrong.

1548
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,425
There is actually life beyond

1549
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:39,625
Adulthood.

1550
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:43,142
There is actually the

1551
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,925
Opportunity to live and grow,

1552
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:49,758
And become elders.

1553
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:58,092
Every Indian people, all for

1554
01:02:58,292 --> 01:02:58,642
All.

1555
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:01,133
One people, very happy.

1556
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,267
Very happy.

1557
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:04,017
Ah, yes, you are happy.

1558
01:03:08,342 --> 01:03:10,350
We are made to age,

1559
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,550
And the aging that we experience

1560
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,925
Actually holds in it very

1561
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,300
Important learnings and

1562
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,592
Lessons...

1563
01:03:26,008 --> 01:03:28,800
there is a touch that takes

1564
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,258
A lifetime to achieve.

1565
01:03:36,175 --> 01:03:39,262
Locking this touch away is like

1566
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:42,550
Stripping from ourselves part

1567
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,925
Of being human.

1568
01:03:50,383 --> 01:03:51,866
These people that we

1569
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:53,437
See in this nursing home, their

1570
01:03:53,637 --> 01:03:55,008
Spirits are dumped on because

1571
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,100
We're locking them away.

1572
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,637
But when you bring the music,

1573
01:03:57,837 --> 01:03:59,175
That spirit is what we see

1574
01:03:59,375 --> 01:03:59,850
That comes out.

1575
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,491
That spirit is still

1576
01:04:01,691 --> 01:04:03,791
Fresh and young.

1577
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,217
My pain is very painful.

1578
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:09,225
Oh, sorry.

1579
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:12,383
But you know what?

1580
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:13,642
What?

1581
01:04:13,842 --> 01:04:16,387
I can take a lot of pain.

1582
01:04:16,587 --> 01:04:19,133
You look like a very strong

1583
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:19,892
Person.

1584
01:04:20,092 --> 01:04:22,550
I am a very strong person.

1585
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:28,508
♪ Na-Na-Na-Na-Na... ♪

1586
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:42,642
♪ mmm ♪

1587
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:46,925
Very soothing.

1588
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:51,529
Isn't it?

1589
01:04:51,729 --> 01:04:55,933
♪ Mmm ♪

1590
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,183
♪ yeah, yeah ♪ ♪

1591
01:04:58,383 --> 01:04:59,991
You need to have that person in

1592
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:01,800
Front of you who you're going

1593
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,321
To be sharing with.

1594
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:06,642
Keep playing.

1595
01:05:06,842 --> 01:05:09,012
It's not something

1596
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:11,383
You can just switch on.

1597
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:12,517
You have to

1598
01:05:12,717 --> 01:05:15,467
Completely open yourself up.

1599
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:19,058
You give yourself.

1600
01:05:19,258 --> 01:05:22,800
And once you give yourself, then

1601
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,092
It opens up dialogue.

1602
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,508
Take this off, please.

1603
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,217
Now, when you go back to Uganda,

1604
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:36,300
They'll ask you who gave

1605
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,100
You that.

1606
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,575
What are you going to say?

1607
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:42,050
"The strongest woman I have

1608
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,250
Ever met."

1609
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:54,433
I love you.

1610
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:56,592
I love you, too.

1611
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:12,158
Dan was breaking through...

1612
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:16,008
he received a grant to give

1613
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:18,987
Matching funds to

1614
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:21,767
35 nursing homes...

1615
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:24,217
and this time the nursing homes

1616
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:25,267
Were lining up.

1617
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:27,387
Gosh, how many different

1618
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:29,508
States is this going to be?

1619
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:30,892
That's just amazing.

1620
01:06:31,092 --> 01:06:33,471
Here we have 50 headphones

1621
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:36,050
And this represents 50 changed

1622
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:36,642
Lives.

1623
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:39,179
It's great!

1624
01:06:39,379 --> 01:06:41,517
Lot of music.

1625
01:06:41,717 --> 01:06:44,158
After three years of

1626
01:06:44,358 --> 01:06:46,800
Filming, Dan had music

1627
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,225
In 56 homes.

1628
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:50,633
We knew this was just a drop in

1629
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:51,475
The bucket.

1630
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,971
Just changing

1631
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:56,427
Something in a nursing home

1632
01:06:56,627 --> 01:06:58,883
Somewhere doesn't take you

1633
01:06:59,083 --> 01:06:59,933
Far enough.

1634
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:02,345
Our real focus of concern needs

1635
01:07:02,545 --> 01:07:04,676
To be the 1.6 million people who

1636
01:07:04,876 --> 01:07:07,008
Are living in nursing homes and

1637
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,800
How to make the lives of

1638
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,933
Everyone better.

1639
01:07:10,133 --> 01:07:11,967
I thought this was just

1640
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:13,217
Going to be... pshew!

1641
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:14,475
Just like that.

1642
01:07:14,675 --> 01:07:17,300
People would just take the idea

1643
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,675
And run with it.

1644
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,850
They didn't.

1645
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:25,800
I left Dan knowing he would

1646
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,392
Never stop.

1647
01:07:27,592 --> 01:07:29,429
I hoped maybe he'd reach the

1648
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,489
Right person and they would

1649
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:33,550
Help him and this dream of his

1650
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,050
Would come true.

1651
01:07:44,967 --> 01:07:47,179
We first see Henry

1652
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:49,592
Unresponsive and almost

1653
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:50,433
Unalive.

1654
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,342
I've got your music.

1655
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:55,467
Then he is given his

1656
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,008
Favorite music.

1657
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,225
Oh.

1658
01:07:58,425 --> 01:08:00,050
And immediately

1659
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,350
He lights up.

1660
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,592
His face assumes expression,

1661
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:05,217
His eyes open wide.

1662
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:06,842
And he's being animated

1663
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:07,767
By the music.

1664
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:10,383
This is his reaction

1665
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,279
Ever since.

1666
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:15,550
Do you like music?

1667
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:16,100
Yeah, I'm

1668
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,058
Crazy about music.

1669
01:08:17,258 --> 01:08:18,717
Used to play beautiful music,

1670
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:19,475
Beautiful sounds.

1671
01:08:19,675 --> 01:08:22,675
What does music do to you?

1672
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:26,767
Love, romance.

1673
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:28,721
Figure right now, the world

1674
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:30,675
Needs to come into music...

1675
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:35,383
and I feel a band of love,

1676
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:36,308
Of dreams.

1677
01:08:36,508 --> 01:08:38,304
You know that little

1678
01:08:38,504 --> 01:08:40,300
Video that I made for Dan,

1679
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:40,767
Right?

1680
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:43,008
Um, I think some kid posted it

1681
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:45,404
Onto reddit.com.

1682
01:08:45,604 --> 01:08:47,018
And it's insane!

1683
01:08:47,218 --> 01:08:48,433
♪ Ooh ♪ ♪

1684
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:50,092
And I am getting

1685
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:50,558
Swamped.

1686
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:52,408
I'm behind by 85 emails.

1687
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:54,258
85 people contacted me and

1688
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:55,683
If I had 300 people,

1689
01:08:55,883 --> 01:08:57,929
I mean, it's just, you know...

1690
01:08:58,129 --> 01:09:00,175
you've just got to scroll down

1691
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,800
And just read what these

1692
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,933
People are saying.

1693
01:09:03,133 --> 01:09:05,866
You've never heard anybody

1694
01:09:06,066 --> 01:09:08,800
Write anything like this.

1695
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,133
It's crazy.

1696
01:09:10,383 --> 01:09:12,008
My grandmother is very much

1697
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:12,642
Like Henry...

1698
01:09:12,842 --> 01:09:14,100
we've been trying nearly

1699
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,008
Everything to get her more alert

1700
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:16,517
And happy.

1701
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:17,967
My grandfather died

1702
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:18,683
Three days ago.

1703
01:09:18,883 --> 01:09:20,304
Music has so much power.

1704
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:21,843
Her eyes lit up instantly and

1705
01:09:22,043 --> 01:09:23,383
The smile on her face made

1706
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:23,725
My day.

1707
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:25,471
I haven't cried yet, but this

1708
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:27,198
Has made me start tearing up.

1709
01:09:27,398 --> 01:09:28,832
Maybe if this worked for

1710
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:30,467
Henry, it could work for

1711
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:31,350
My grandmother.

1712
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,512
When the music ended,

1713
01:09:32,712 --> 01:09:33,697
My mother looked up...

1714
01:09:33,897 --> 01:09:34,883
she got so emotional...

1715
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:35,820
and she saw me...

1716
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,664
and so caught up

1717
01:09:36,864 --> 01:09:37,308
In the music...

1718
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:38,758
and I'll hold that memory

1719
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:39,058
Forever.

1720
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,133
The music carried her away.

1721
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:42,392
I have to do this.

1722
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:44,633
I'm going home to see my mother

1723
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:45,683
With Alzheimer's.

1724
01:09:45,883 --> 01:09:47,262
She is, at this moment,

1725
01:09:47,462 --> 01:09:48,642
Listening to ray Charles

1726
01:09:48,842 --> 01:09:51,408
Sing, "come rain or come shine,"

1727
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:54,175
And she has found her place in

1728
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,058
The world again.

1729
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,633
You got music back in your

1730
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,133
Life, mama!

1731
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:02,183
Were you surprised

1732
01:10:02,383 --> 01:10:03,642
That that clip went viral?

1733
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:05,550
I mean, millions and millions of

1734
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,800
People have seen it.

1735
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,175
Completely surprised!

1736
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,696
People just... They watched

1737
01:10:09,896 --> 01:10:11,269
And they saw a human being come

1738
01:10:11,469 --> 01:10:12,826
Alive, and when any of us come

1739
01:10:13,026 --> 01:10:14,229
Alive, it touches us deeply.

1740
01:10:14,429 --> 01:10:15,633
That's why we want to involve

1741
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:16,612
The community, both in

1742
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:17,685
Getting iPods donated and

1743
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:18,721
Having the students come into

1744
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:19,758

1745

Find their playlist...

1747
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,967
We've been afraid to

1748
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:28,571
Enter these places.

1749
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:29,975
Afraid of aging,

1750
01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:32,633
Afraid of having nothing to

1751
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:33,267
Give.

1752
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:35,267
But music,

1753
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:39,800
Entering one 94-Year-Old man,

1754
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,100
Reminded us...

1755

We do have something to give.

1756
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:47,517
Oh, my friends.

1757
01:10:47,717 --> 01:10:50,554
All we have to do is ask,

1758
01:10:50,754 --> 01:10:53,592
"What's your favorite song?"

1759
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,425
Vinny, what's your

1760
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:54,808
Favorite song?

1761
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:57,470
