1
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,282
Ma?

2
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,080
Why'd you marry Dad?

3
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:59,149
He was one of my brother's friends,
one day he just asked me

4
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,627
That's it?

5
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,390
That's it

6
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,925
Nothing else happened?

7
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,126
Really?

8
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,070
No

9
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,939
I don't believe you.
You're leaving something out

10
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,206
- Like what?.
- He had to fight for you

11
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,080
- He was a fighter, all right
- And he kidnapped you

12
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:32,887
Didn't he?.

13
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,186
Yes

14
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,058
Then what happened?.

15
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,699
Then he took me to a hut
up in the mountains

16
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,607
I was a prisoner there
for three days

17
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,804
Were you scared?.

18
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,312
Oh, Yes.
He was so strong

19
00:06:59,485 --> 00:06:59,951
Then?.

20
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,053
Then he took me
to the top of the mountain

21
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,416
To show me the world

22
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,820
He said:
All that belongs to you and me

23
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,929
And then he kissed me so hard,
I can still feel it

24
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,402
Just like a film

25
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,607
Better...Much better

26
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:41,951
And the tits of Mary Cobb
have each one got a knob

27
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,697
To play with,
to play with...

28
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,077
I got a present...
From the boys at work

29
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,523
I got something, too

30
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:22,701
What?.

31
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,072
Later

32
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,818
So?.
She's still got all her clothes on

33
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,719
She's a princess.
They always dress in white

34
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,521
And the prince had to fight
for her first

35
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,229
Then he was allowed to marry her

36
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,226
You believe that crap?.

37
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:58,603
Yes

38
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,802
Want to know
why grown-ups get married?.

39
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,675
So they can fuck

40
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,682
You know what that is, fucking?.

41
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:16,983
Not really

42
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,955
Don't know much, do you?.

43
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,753
- That's what grown-ups do?.
- If they're not fighting

44
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,051
Your parents do it, too

45
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:57,785
Look

46
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,963
That's your mother

47
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,764
And that's your father

48
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,074
And that's fucking

49
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,679
Like to try it?.

50
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,053
Listen

51
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:37,667
To fuck well,
you have to learn to kiss well

52
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,599
I know how to kiss

53
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,970
With your tongue?.

54
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:52,616
That's kissing...
And here's where you learn it

55
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,033
Don't worry.
I've scored here loads of times

56
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:25,342
You're lucky. That's Kathy,
she's the hottest of them all

57
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:38,252
Go and sit next to her,
or someone else will get her

58
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,037
- Look at her teeth!
- Then look at her legs

59
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,037
Don't tell me
you blew a chance like that!

60
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,414
I didn't know what to do

61
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,955
And now, ladies and gentlemen!

62
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,320
The most beautiful women in the world

63
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,795
Step right up! Step right up!

64
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:30,526
And let me introduce you
to Tiger Rita!

65
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:38,032
And right here the one and only
Eva Pavlova, the terror of Warsaw!

66
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:48,249
See their breasts?.
They're topped with nipples

67
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,518
When you rub them,
they get stiff

68
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:59,398
And when they get stiff,
you know you're in business. Got it?.

69
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,081
Here, this'll make you feel better

70
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,526
I never saw a woman like that before

71
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,527
- Beautiful...
- No, hot!

72
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,766
If anyone can teach you,
it's her...

73
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,675
What a woman!

74
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,770
Come on. Now you'll see
what fucking is

75
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,768
Mummy!...Can we go?.

76
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,474
- Play some more. Here
- No...

77
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,777
The ginger one is Theo.
He's in my class

78
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,452
Didn't know his mother was like that

79
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,024
- Can I come?.
- Of course not...

80
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,334
Bloody hell!
That ginger bastard

81
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,075
I thought they were really
going to do it

82
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,846
Right in front of us

83
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,984
That'd have been worth seeing

84
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,485
Know where Ginger lives?.

85
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,024
Yes, but I've never been there

86
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,459
Then it's time we went there to play

87
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:34,900
Tomorrow

88
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,866
You sure it's here?.

89
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:52,843
Yes

90
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,871
What a woman

91
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:00,100
Theo?.

92
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,043
I never saw a woman
like that before

93
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,707
- I'm horny as a rabbit
- Me, too

94
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,354
I need to cool down

95
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,738
That's better

96
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,268
I need some water too

97
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,009
This may be your big day, kid

98
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:26,540
I can't

99
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,615
Don't be scared.
She's blind drunk

100
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,484
She won't wake up

101
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,785
What shall I do?.

102
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,856
Remember what that bloke
at the fair did to her?.

103
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,099
Do the same as him

104
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:49,573
Go on

105
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,731
- She smells good
- Because she's horny

106
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,443
Lie down on top of her.
Lie down

107
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,140
I still haven't done it

108
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:18,247
I'll show you something
that'll make you feel better

109
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,123
Watch now

110
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,702
But make sure
you don't do it too often

111
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,346
You might get a crooked back

112
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,412
Or go crazy

113
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,699
Ma, dad didn't kidnap you, did he?.

114
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:28,552
No

115
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,847
Why did you lie to me?.

116
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,061
Because you're so young

117
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,099
Everything is ugly

118
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:50,936
No. There are many beautiful things
in life, son

119
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,938
Go to sleep now

120
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,193
- You must be nervous
- Why's that?.

121
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,962
It's your last day at school

122
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:16,503
I can still remember
my last day at school

123
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,507
The school dance

124
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:25,876
The girls were sweating.
And not just from dancing...

125
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:45,833
- Do you use the cream I gave you?.
- Every day, but it doesn't help much

126
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,167
- You must be patient
- I've been patient for two years

127
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,970
It'll go away eventually

128
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,281
And if you don't scratch
you won't have any scars

129
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,685
Here, try this.
And come back next week

130
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,586
So what do you want to be,
later?.

131
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,433
Not a doctor, for sure

132
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,675
Lisa Velani

133
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:45,692
I'll fuck her tonight
or my name's Harry Frankenstein

134
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,236
Harry Voss

135
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,773
Harry Voss

136
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:12,518
- Didn't dare show himself, huh?.
- With that ugly spotty mug of his...

137
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:58,188
Dreaming again?.
You think too much

138
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,961
It'll give you a headache

139
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,761
Your diploma

140
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:20,145
Wondered if you wanted
to come to the school dance

141
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:24,452
- Why you asking me?.
- Cos I don't want to go on my own

142
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,155
And I like to be the best looking

143
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,497
I don't like parties.
Too many people

144
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,201
- Then we'll go somewhere else
- Where?.

145
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,361
Where there's no people

146
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,285
What you doing?.

147
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:52,841
Let the wind carry my message.
In my soul there is a song

148
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:59,006
She's the answer to all my problems
Though her heart doesn't know it yet

149
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,926
- I didn't know you were a poet
- It's easy when you're in love

150
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,066
Know who I wrote that for?.

151
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,471
Read the first letter of each line

152
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:49,193
I love her...I love them all,
but they aren't interested in me

153
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,036
So come to the dance
and you can read it to her

154
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:58,775
Are you nuts?.

155
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,544
I can't even talk to her

156
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,882
It's easy when you're in love

157
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,725
You think this is what women
dream of?.

158
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:21,057
You don't know women.
They can look right through men

159
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,997
When Lisa looks at you,
she won't see your spots...

160
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,570
she'll see the poet in your eyes

161
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,007
If you don't do it tonight
you never will

162
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:48,321
Congratulations!
The Future Beckons

00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,318
See her anywhere?.

164
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:25,618
- Hello Marina
- Hello, handsome

165
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,627
- Will you dance with me later?.
- Of course

166
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,995
Don't forget, eh?.

167
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:38,902
Friend of mine

168
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,147
Hey, she's on her own

169
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,685
- What should I do?.
- Ask her to dance

170
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:58,658
- She doesn't dance
- Of course she dances. Go on

171
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,825
- OK, it's fixed
- What is?.

172
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,034
You'll see. Come on

173
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,412
- There she is
- Who is?.

174
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,989
Marina.
I made a date with her

175
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,184
I'll go first. Then we'll swap

176
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:54,134
- But I don't know her
- That doesn't matter

177
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,299
But I don't feel anything for her

178
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,679
That won't stop you doing it

179
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,414
She won't want me

180
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:18,457
She's not like Lisa.
Marina likes doing it...with everyone

181
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:22,087
She knows you're part of the deal

182
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,197
- Really?.
- Yes. I'll be quick, OK?.

183
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,973
I'll need some more soon

184
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,980
You can have more right now

185
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,887
Have you taken a pill?.

186
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:37,496
No, but I've got a friend.
He's waiting outside

187
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,760
Do I know him?.

188
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,507
He's a sensitive boy. A poet

189
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,041
A poet?.

190
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:58,551
- All right?.
- Well, if you can't do it

191
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:16,768
Your turn

192
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,503
- You sure she wants me?.
- Yes, she's ready for you

193
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,475
Come on, little poet.
I'm getting cold

194
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:32,911
Sorry

195
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,488
Finished already?.

196
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:24,181
Look, Frankenstein.
If you're trying to be funny...

197
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:33,941
- lncredible! You did it
- Yes, with shit paper

198
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,852
Any whisky left?.

199
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:44,223
- In the car
- Take me home

200
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:35,668
Here, let me

201
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:05,340
Go on

202
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,036
Drive on!

203
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,817
I live right there

204
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,122
But I can't make it

205
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:47,905
Can't you carry me in?.
I really can't make it

206
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,079
Is that yours?.

207
01:00:58,788 --> 01:00:59,812
It's my poem

208
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,621
Where did you get it?.

209
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,125
On a train

210
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:24,745
You can keep it.
I don't need it anymore

211
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,617
Have a heart,
carry me indoors

212
01:01:55,978 --> 01:02:00,642
I can hear it beating...
So you have got one

213
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,727
- Bill!
- Harry!

214
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,033
- Where have you been?.
- Vacation

215
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:19,798
For how long?.

216
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:27,572
Three months in prison,
eight months in jail...

217
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,553
And how are you?.

218
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,825
I'm thirsty... and broke

219
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:17,888
<Silence.
Hospital>

220
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:50,687
I'm tired

221
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,756
I live nearby.
I'm looking after someone's house

222
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,761
Someone?.

223
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:03,365
Who I don't know
and who doesn't know me

224
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,191
- Dare we?.
- For old times' sake

225
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,556
- We never dared before
- You never dared!

226
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:01,816
Let me do it

227
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,517
Nice place

228
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:53,693
So we did it

229
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,805
It weighed less than I thought

230
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:02,703
It was mellow

231
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,038
He's still warm

232
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,644
She's dead

233
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,249
But she's alive

234
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,061
No Harry...

235
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,137
I wouldn't do that

236
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,787
Best woman I ever had

237
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:48,829
You only ever meet one like that

238
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:54,667
We'd better bury her
or we'll get into trouble

239
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,263
She's too beautiful to bury

240
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:24,556
Where are we going?.

241
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:28,993
To a wedding

242
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:56,718
And do you take
as your lawful wedded husband

243
01:19:57,893 --> 01:19:58,689
Harry Voss

244
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,971
For better and for worse

245
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,173
Until...

246
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,310
...death do you part

247
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,189
Until death do you part
