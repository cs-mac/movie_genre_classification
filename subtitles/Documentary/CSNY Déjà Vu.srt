4
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,900
Can't believe it.
They're right on time.

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,300
Let's get these boys to their party.

6
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,700
Mama!

8
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,600
It's 10:48 on Fat Tuesday, Mardi Gras.

9
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,400
Now let's go back in time to 1964.

10
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
The Beach Boys on 105.3 FM,

11
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,200
the heart of New Orleans.

13
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Okay. Take it out wide.
Give the pig some room.

19
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,300
My daughter's on that ferry.
Please. Please.

20
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,800
Oh, God, my daughter!

22
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
Do the other side?

25
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
ATF New Orleans, Agent Donnelly.

26
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,300
Listen, call New Orleans PD.

27
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,700
I want all surveillance
from the Algiers dock.

28
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,100
Then call City Transit.

29
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,500
I want the Crescent City 
Bridge surveillance,

30
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,200
westbound between 10:00 and 11:00.

31
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,400
All right, got it.

32
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,500
Hey. Seen an ATF agent around here?

33
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,100
Yeah, he went down below.

34
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,300
How do I get there?

35
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,200
The south side of the bridge.

36
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
You Agent Minuti?

37
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
Larry Minuti, ATF?

38
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,700
No, Larry's my partner.
I'm Doug Carlin.

39
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,700
Paul Pryzwarra, FBI.

40
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
- How you doing?
- Where's Minuti?

41
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,200
On vacation.

42
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Not anymore. We're calling in
half the region on this one.

43
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,700
You can reach him?

44
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,300
I tried. He's not picking up his phone.

45
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
Well, try harder. It's important.

46
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,300
Obviously.

47
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,500
What are you looking for?

48
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,600
Anything that doesn't belong.

49
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
You want to give me a spot?

50
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,500
Yeah.

51
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,100
ANFO.

52
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,200
ANFO.

53
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,200
Ammonium nitrate, water-soluble.

54
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,000
Fuel oil would have burned off
during the blast.

55
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Between the river and the rain,
if ANFO was used,

56
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,600
the only place you'd find it would be...

57
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,500
Underneath this bridge.

58
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,400
That's right.

59
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,200
We can't rule out an accident 
at this point.

60
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,500
- It's not officially a crime scene yet.
- Here's a thought.

61
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Why don't we double the perimeter

62
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,700
so we don't have wall-to-wall 
trailers down there?

63
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,300
No, we're gonna need all our manpower

64
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,200
for evidence control 
and witness processing.

65
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,500
Now, we need to keep it tight

66
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,900
until we can determine
that it is a crime investigation.

67
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,700
It is a crime investigation.

68
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,900
Got a piece of electric blasting cap

69
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
and a strand
of what appears to be leg wire.

70
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,400
About a million of those blue particles
washed up on the Algiers side.

71
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
It's probably from a plastic 
container or a barrel.

72
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,300
ANFO?

73
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,200
Most likely.
There was post-blast residue

74
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,200
under the Crescent City Bridge.

75
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,900
The insulation on the leg wire
will inform us

76
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
of who the manufacturer
of the blasting cap is.

77
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,000
Then we go after the switching mechanism

78
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,600
and the bomb's power source.

79
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,600
We probably don't need to wait for
the lab to tell us what we already know,

80
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
that this is an explosive 
and a trigger.

81
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,400
And you are?

82
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Doug Carlin, ATF.

83
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,600
- Who's in charge?
- We're working on that now.

84
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Gentlemen, please.

85
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,700
Ed Elkins. I'm in charge.

86
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,900
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Yeah.

87
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,500
You're in charge, then? Okay.

88
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,700
First things first.
Where's the coffeepot?

89
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Ed?

90
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
Come on, this is a police 
investigation, right? Operation.

91
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,600
We gotta have a coffeepot.

92
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
Yeah, you'll find it in the back.

93
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
- Back there?
- Yeah.

94
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,800
He is in charge.
Thank you, gentlemen.

95
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,700
See anything?

96
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
Traffic.

97
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,000
Hit rewind for me.

98
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Hey, did Larry call?

99
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,300
Still not answering his cell.
We left another message.

100
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
All right.

101
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,600
- Say, that girl ever get ahold of you?
- What girl?

102
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,200
You know, sexy voice, asked if
you were tall, dark and handsome.

103
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
I gave her two out of three.

104
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,900
Two out of three.
That's very good. Hit play.

105
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,400
Thank you.

106
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,200
Hey, Larry, this is Doug.
How you doing?

107
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,200
Listen, I know you're maybe 
still pissed off at me,

108
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,100
but you need to get your 
behind down here, all right?

109
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
- Doug.
- Yeah?

110
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,500
Doug, Orleans Parish on line one.
It's Sheriff Reed.

111
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,800
They pulled a body out of the water,
and they want a profile.

112
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,500
All right, tell him 
they don't need a profile.

113
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,400
- Just tell him to bag it. I'll call him back.
- Okay, got it.

114
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
Put this on a candy wrapper?

115
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
It's all I had.

116
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Cutting back, huh?

117
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,900
Hold it right there.

118
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,100
Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug 
Carlin returning your call.

119
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,300
My cell number is 504-555-0130.

120
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,200
What's that?

121
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,700
Looks like a dude on a bike.

122
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,000
Run it forward a little bit.

123
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
Stop right there.

124
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What is he doing?

125
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,400
Going to the bathroom?

127
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
Run it forward, run it forward.

128
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,400
- What time does it say?
- 10:4 7.

129
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,000
- That's before the explosion, isn't it?
- Right before.

130
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,300
Can I have your attention, please?

131
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Thanks very much for coming.

132
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm Jack McCready, special agent
in charge of this investigation.

133
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
First, let me say our hearts go out

134
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
to all of those affected by this tragedy.

135
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,400
Early estimates
place the number of casualties

136
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,400
at 543 men, women and children.

137
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,100
Now, Lord knows this city has seen
its share of pain,

138
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
but unlike Katrina,

139
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
this disaster was not an act of nature.

140
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,700
After careful review of evidence
retrieved at the scene,

141
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,300
we have concluded
this was a deliberate act of terrorism,

142
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,800
and the President concurs
with our assessment.

143
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,500
On our end,
we have to ask for your patience,

144
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,400
as the investigation will take time.

145
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,200
It's a unique and complicated
crime scene.

146
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,900
There's no baggage checks.
There's no flight data recorder.

147
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,900
There are maximum casualties,

148
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,700
and most of the evidence
is under 100 feet of muddy water.

149
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,000
There are no shortcuts.

150
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
- Kevin, where's Doug?
- You just missed him.

151
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,800
- Well, his car's still here.
- Took the streetcar.

152
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,200
- What? Streetcar?
- Hey, don't look at me.

153
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,300
It's part of his process.
He says it helps him think.

154
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Sheriff Reed.

155
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
How you doing?
It's Doug Carlin returning your call.

156
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,000
Hey, Doug. I know you got
your hands full right now.

157
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,400
Yeah, that's okay.
What do you got for me, Bob?

158
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Well, a couple of kids found a woman

159
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,500
face down in the waters
off Algiers Point.

160
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,700
She was burned over 30% of her body.

161
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,900
Right, well, you're gonna see
a lot of that over the next few weeks.

162
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,300
We've just set up ECC.
Just have Crime Scene bag it for us.

163
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, we already done that.
The body's at the ME's right now.

164
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,700
Crime Scene's already been there?

165
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah, they've been and gone.

166
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, exactly what time
did this woman wash up on shore?

167
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,500
Kid called it in at 10:42 a.m.

168
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,300
You mean 11:42, don't you?

169
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,400
No, I mean 10:42.
I got the sheet right in front of me,

170
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,100
and I got my reading glasses on.

171
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,500
Immediately evident is the
focal charring of the limbs and torso.

172
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,600
Anterior face, neck and chest
are intact,

173
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
though swollen
from apparent immersion in water.

174
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Hold her hand for me, will you?
Right here.

175
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,800
There we go.

176
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,600
Each digit of the right hand
has been severed

177
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,100
between the middle
and distal phalanges. Thanks.

178
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,000
Angle of shearing indicates
a single sharp-force trauma,

179
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,300
possibly caused by shrapnel.

180
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,900
No. No,
it's too even to be shrapnel trauma.

181
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,200
Posterior charring
gives off a strong odor,

182
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
suggesting perimortem immersion
in burning fuel.

183
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,400
Diesel.

184
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
- Accelerant, maybe?
- I don't know.

185
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
If she was that close to the bomb,

186
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
she probably wouldn't be
laying here now.

187
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,600
What are you doing?

188
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,500
What are you doing?

189
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,000
You got a UV gun?

190
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
Yeah, on the table behind you.

191
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,800
- You see that?
- Duct tape.

192
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
What's that stippling? You see that?

193
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,200
Adhesive probably retained
some substance against the water.

194
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,400
Yeah.

196
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah, go ahead.

197
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
I ran down those MPRs for you.

198
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,300
A Claire Kuchever was reported 
missing this morning.

199
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,500
Supposed to pick up her father
from the airport, pulled a no-show.

200
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,600
Okay.

201
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,800
All right, Phil,
I want you to do a full autopsy.

202
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,800
Concentrate on time and cause.

203
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Full spread of lab tests.
Everything.

204
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,800
Just pretend like the ferry explosion
never happened today, okay?

205
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,200
Absolutely.

206
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,000
Claire?

207
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,800
- She's beautiful, huh?
- Yeah.

208
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,400
Very.

210
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,700
You'll need a photograph
for your investigation, right?

211
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,200
There's plenty in the house.
Plenty to choose from.

212
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,700
Mr. Kuchever, I'm sorry about this,

213
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but I'm gonna need you to confirm 
your daughter's identity.

214
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,100
Okay.

215
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,100
Now, anything that you can tell me

216
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
about your daughter's activities
over the weekend,

217
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,700
or any time, anything at all,
will be helpful.

218
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,100
Well, I don't know.

219
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
My flight got in
at 8:00 a.m. this morning,

220
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
and she was supposed to pick me up,
but she wasn't there.

221
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,200
I thought maybe she just overslept,

222
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,400
so I took a cab
and I went straight to her house.

223
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
Her and Alan's car was gone,

224
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,000
so I thought maybe 
she'd just finally sold it.

225
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
- Who's Alan?
- Her fianc.

226
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,800
Or ex-fianc.

227
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,500
They broke up a few months ago.

228
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
And where is he now, Alan?

229
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,800
- He moved to Montreal.
- Okay.

230
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,300
She was too good for him, anyway.

231
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
I got a sweater that she left,
if you want to take it.

232
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,600
No, that's okay. But if you have keys
to her house, I would appreciate it.

233
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh, she had a date.

234
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,400
Last night on the phone, she told me
that she was gonna meet someone,

235
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,800
but she didn't say who.
Her friend Beth set it up.

236
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Beth.

237
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,900
Beth Walsh. Claire baby-sits
her daughter, Abbey, sometimes.

238
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,100
Okay.

239
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,400
Thank you.

240
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,800
That's good for now.

241
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Somebody'll be in touch.

242
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Agent Carlin?

243
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,800
Doug.

244
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
I want you to take these.

245
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,100
Well, that's...

246
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,500
Just go through them
when you get a chance.

247
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,100
- Well, it's really not necessary.
- Yes, it is.

248
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,900
See, I know how these things go,
Agent Carlin,

249
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,300
and I need her to matter to you.

253
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,600
Monday, 7:48 p.m.

254
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,500
Hi, Claire. It's Dad.

255
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,900
My flight gets in at 7:55 tomorrow morning,

256
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,500
so don't stay up too late.
Love you. Bye-bye.

257
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,400
Tuesday, 9:44 a.m.

258
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,800
Claire? Hi, it's Beth. Are you there?

259
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
I'm sorry to call you so early,

260
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,800
but you said you were gonna call me
when you got home,

261
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,300
and when you didn't,
I started to get worried.

262
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,500
Beth, is this a joke?
Oh, hey, hey! No.

263
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,500
Like I said, I was just worried
about you, that's all.

264
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,700
I can't talk right now.
Someone's here. I'll call you later.

265
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Claire...

266
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,700
Tuesday, 9:50 a.m.

267
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,700
Tuesday, 10:0 4 a.m.

268
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Claire, it's Dad.
I did say 7:55, didn't I?

269
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,700
I'm here at the airport, waiting for you.

270
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,000
If you're not coming, I hope
you're sending Beth or someone.

271
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,600
Call me.

272
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,200
Tuesday, 18 p.m.

273
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,900
Yeah, this is ATF Agent 
Doug Carlin returning your call.

274
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,100
My cell number is 504-555-0130.

275
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,400
Tuesday, 1:18 p.m.

276
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,700
Yeah, this is ATF Agent Doug 
Carlin returning your call.

277
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,100
My cell number is 504-555-0130.

278
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,900
The blast wave initiated here,
hit the bulkhead

279
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,800
and propagated fore and aft
along the path of least resistance

280
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,200
until it hits this access hatch.

281
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,500
And that's where it gets really bad.

282
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
The blast wave continues

283
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,300
into the engine room,
bursting the fuel tanks.

284
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,800
This utility shaft here
acts like a chimney,

285
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,300
draws the thermal components
into the engine room,

286
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,500
which ignites the fuel vapor,
causing a secondary explosion

287
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,800
of far greater magnitude.

288
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,300
Essentially, the initial
device turns the whole ferry into a bomb

289
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,100
and detonates it.

290
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,100
And so our early guess

291
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,600
is that the bomb vehicle
was a minivan or SUV.

292
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
- Possibly red or tan.
- Make and model?

293
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,900
- Take weeks, maybe months.
- I got a partial on the license plate.

294
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,100
Shit.

295
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,000
Check all the SUVs and minivans
that are registered in the state.

296
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,700
Anything recently rented or purchased,

297
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,200
anything tied to a theft
or a missing persons report.

298
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
- Agent McCready?
- Yeah.

299
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,400
Doug Carlin, ATF.

300
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,200
Oh, yeah. Oklahoma City.

301
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,300
Right. That's right.

302
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,400
This afternoon, I witnessed an autopsy

303
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,300
of a young woman who washed up
off the Poland Wharf.

304
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,800
Heavy fuel burns,
traces of PETN on her face.

305
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,100
PETN, that's the base explosive
used by domestic terrorists.

306
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,800
She also lost several fingers
in what appeared to be blast damage.

307
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Appeared?

308
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,200
That's right. I checked the tide tables
against the position of the blast.

309
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,900
For her to have washed up
that early and that far upriver,

310
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,500
she would've had to have been killed
two hours before the ferry exploded.

311
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
Before?

312
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,700
She died before the explosion?

313
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,500
She died before the explosion, yeah.
Her name is Claire Kuchever.

314
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,800
She washed up before the explosion
and against the tide.

315
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,900
- Do you have a scenario?
- Yes, I do.

316
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,800
I believe that somebody abducted her
in her home, taped her mouth,

317
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,700
bound her wrists, burned her alive,
dumped her in the river

318
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim.

319
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,400
A disaster that hadn't happened yet.

320
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,100
But the PETN tells us

321
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
that the bomber came in direct contact
with the victim.

322
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
You solve her case, you solve this case.

323
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,300
Why this woman?

324
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Good question. Her SUV is missing.

325
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,900
It's a tan and red Bronco.

326
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,600
It could have been stolen
to drive the bomb to the ferry.

327
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,200
Oh, one more thing.

328
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,200
The victim called the local ATF office

329
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,600
the morning of the explosion.

330
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,600
Yeah.

331
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,600
- We'll look into it.
- Okay.

332
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,500
All right.

333
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Okay.

334
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,500
Where's Larry?

335
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
- What?
- Larry Minuti, my partner.

336
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,400
That's his car right there. Is he here?

337
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,800
I thought you said he was on vacation.

338
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,700
Yeah, that's right.

339
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,600
What?

340
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,400
Those cars were brought here
from the Algiers ferry parking lot.

341
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,400
They're the vehicles
that belonged to the victims.

342
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,600
Sorry.

343
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,900
So he's a former Marine?

344
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes, sir. Yeah. Local, too.
He's born and bred in New Orleans.

345
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,800
His family still in the area?

346
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,500
Nope. Nothing, really, but his job.

347
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,200
- You like him?
- He's smart.

348
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,400
Yeah, I like him, too.

349
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,100
All right. Let's go find him.

351
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,800
Oklahoma City.

352
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,400
Yeah.

354
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,800
- You and Larry were close?
- Yeah.

355
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Yeah, you know, close enough
to get on each other's nerves.

356
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,400
Doug, I've been put in charge
of a newly-formed investigative unit.

357
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,500
The ferry disaster is our first case,
and I want you on the team.

358
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,700
Why me?

359
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,000
We've got
some unique time constraints.

360
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,200
I need someone who can look
at a crime scene exactly one time,

361
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,600
tell us what's missing,
tell us what shouldn't be there,

362
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,200
tell us what we can ignore

363
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,700
and, especially,
what we need to pursue.

364
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Also, you're local. You know the people
and you know the area.

365
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,100
But why an ATF guy?

366
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,700
Why not? It's your shot.

367
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,500
You want to find the guy
who killed Minuti, don't you?

368
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,400
Yes, I do.

370
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,000
I guess you've got some questions.

371
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,800
For me to have questions,
first I'd need to know something.

372
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,700
Now I do have some questions.

373
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,400
Don't touch anything.
We don't need you yet.

374
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,400
Doug, you remember
Dr. Alexander Denny.

375
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,600
Where's my audio?

376
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,400
Compensating for audio delay.
Just a second.

378
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,300
Compensating for a technical 
blunder by a tech guy...

379
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,200
Solid stream. Minus four days,
six hours, three minutes, 45 seconds.

380
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,600
And 14 and a half nanoseconds.

381
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,500
Okay.

382
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,400
Anytime you want to jump in here,
be my guest.

383
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,900
- Me?
- Yeah.

385
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,900
What are we looking for?

386
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,200
You know, clues, suspects,
anything out of the norm.

387
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,200
- When was this taken?
- Four and a half days ago.

388
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,700
Gunnars,
try the guy with the backpack.

389
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Oh, that's tender.

390
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,000
I wish I had someone. Okay, widen out.

391
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,300
Let's cruise the car deck for a while,
see what we got.

392
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
How can you change the angle

393
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,800
on footage taken four 
and a half days ago?

394
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,200
This is a digital recreation.

395
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,400
We're combining all the data 
we've got into one fluid shot.

396
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,000
Any angle, any view
within the target area.

397
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay, let's cruise the breezeway,

398
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,200
see what we get there.

399
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,800
It's a brand-new program.

400
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's called Snow White.

401
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,300
Our primary data comes from
seven orbiting satellites,

402
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,000
but at any given time, as many 
as four are surveilling one area.

403
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,500
It's like having multiple eyewitnesses,
each with their own vantage point.

404
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,300
Snow White?

405
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,700
Well, which one of the seven dwarfs

406
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,500
can explain to me
how you get the audio?

407
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,400
I don't understand.

408
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
Why do you gotta
look at four days ago?

409
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,200
Why don't you just fast-forward it
to the day of the explosion?

410
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,100
We have to wait.
It takes four and a half days

411
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
to render this single fluid shot.

412
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,000
The only thing that matters

413
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,300
is that we have exactly one look
at any one time.

414
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah. We can't go back 10 minutes,
you know?

415
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Can't look back and see
if there was a second gunman.

416
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,600
We can't watch the agent
buying 10 pairs of cargo pants in 1983.

417
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,700
All right? But given enough lead time,

418
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,100
we can look anywhere
within the target area, all right?

419
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,000
It's the when that's always constant.
It's always four days and six hours ago.

420
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,600
Always. You understand?

421
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,100
It's like a single trailing moment of now,
in the past.

422
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,200
Okay. So if you can't move forward
or backward in time,

423
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,300
how is it the image keeps
speeding up like that?

424
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,700
It's not the image that's moving faster,
it's just our shifting point of view.

425
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,500
The passage of time remains constant,
but we can shift our point of view

426
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,900
within the data stream
as fast as we want.

427
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,800
- You understand?
- Yeah. Yeah. No.

428
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
Yeah, I know.

429
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,300
So four days from...
Well, actually, three days from now,

430
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,800
since it's after midnight,
you'll be able to look back

431
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,600
to the day of the explosion,
see who did it,

432
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
how they did it
and what they did it with.

433
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,900
Yeah, you got it.

434
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,100
The only thing is,
you need to tell us where to look,

435
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,400
'cause, you know, we could miss it.

436
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,100
Besides, three days could be too late.

437
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,700
He could leave the country,
could strike again.

438
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,200
We need to do whatever we can now.

439
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,700
We know he's out there planning this.

440
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,900
We just don't know where to look.

441
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,700
So, Agent Carlin, where do we look?

442
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,200
Claire Kuchever's house.

443
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,500
Address is in range.

444
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,200
All right, match the viewer settings
to the signal.

445
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,900
- Signal's solid.
- All right, dazzle me.

446
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
What?

447
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,700
You see, with Snow White
we can track through walls.

448
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
It's part of the same infrared
thermal-imaging stuff

449
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,500
they're using in lraq.

450
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,200
Hello. This is 877-504-8423.

451
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,500
We triangulate from four satellites,

452
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
pick up the heat signal and reconstruct.

453
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,900
Basically, we can walk through walls.

454
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,800
Claire Kuchever.

455
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,200
- Claire? Hello?
- Did you know her?

456
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,300
We held hands once,
but no, I didn't know her.

457
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,700
Just checking in, 
wondering how you're doing.

458
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,500
Montreal's fantastic,
but my boss is an ass.

459
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,800
Can you rotate the view,
see what she's looking at?

460
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,600
I want you to come visit, though.

462
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,800
The city's phenomenal.
You're gonna love it.

463
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,000
Claire? Claire?

464
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
555-0118.

465
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,500
- Somebody got that?
- Yeah.

466
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,200
Claire, you there?

467
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,200
Listen, I've had a lot of time to think,

468
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,300
and I need you to sell the Bronco
as soon as possible.

469
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,100
Or at least pay me back my half.
I just really need the money.

470
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,600
I love you, honey. Call me.

471
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,400
Unbelievable.

472
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,200
- Where's she... Can you follow her?
- No problem.

474
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

475
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,600
What?

476
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,000
It's Stalhuth, at that house you found.
Female murder victim, Claire?

477
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,300
Right. What do you got?

478
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,400
We got some bloody cotton swabs
and gauze strips in the bathroom,

479
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,400
some blood in the sink trap.
And, oh, hey, Carlin?

480
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,800
Man, when did you completely forget
how to investigate a crime scene?

481
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,100
What do you mean?

482
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,800
This place is lousy
with your fingerprints.

483
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,700
They're all over the place.

484
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,500
Do me a favor. Just describe what
you see for me, okay? Just humor me.

485
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,700
Woman's bedroom. Vanity mirror.

486
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,500
Dressing table with makeup,
knick-knacks.

487
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,800
Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

488
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,600
Is there anybody there?
Anybody brushing their teeth?

489
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,400
No. Just a couple agents,
including Hendricks, who's bent over,

490
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,300
and I have a fine view
of the crack of his ass.

491
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,300
Okay, I get the picture.
Talk to you later.

492
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,200
You satisfied?

493
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,000
She was supposed to go on a date
the night before she died.

494
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,900
I want to get her appointment books
and everything brought down here,

495
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,500
you know, her phone records,
credit cards, diaries, anything.

496
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I wanna know everything
there is to know about this woman.

497
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,900
Well, shouldn't we be
concentrating on the ferry?

498
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,400
Well, yeah, it's likely that our guy

499
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,500
cased the ferry first,
but we don't know when.

500
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,700
We don't even know what he looks like.

501
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,800
I mean, we could stare him
right in the face and not know it's him.

502
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,900
But we will notice a change,
even a small change, in her life.

504
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,900
- Hey, Beth.
- Claire.

505
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,700
That guy I've been telling you about
really wants to meet you.

506
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay. Tell him
I'll meet him Monday night.

507
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Monday.

508
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,700
How about Sunday 
if you're not doing anything?

509
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,400
- No, Monday.
- Great. I'll give him your number.

510
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
No, do not give him my number.
I'll go meet him.

511
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,300
- He's not some psycho killer.
- Who? Him who?

512
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,700
I don't even know if I can do it Monday.
Hang on.

513
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,400
Show me the book.

514
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Monday works.

515
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
- Damn!
- Shit!

516
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Can we go back?

517
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
- No.
- Seriously?

518
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,700
No, it's far too much data
for any existing storage system.

519
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,700
It's a constant stream.
There's no rewind, no second chances.

520
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
We can record what we're seeing,
but we can't go back

521
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,900
and choose to look
at something different.

522
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,200
Okay. You said we can record, though?

523
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,500
- Yes.
- Okay.

524
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Tell me, is there any scientific
or forensic insight likely to be gained

525
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,800
by spying on this woman in the shower?

526
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,300
Shanti, we're trying to make sure
the woman's clean.

527
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,100
All right, why don't you,

528
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,400
you know, look around the rest of
the bathroom? Can you do that?

530
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,300
- Gunnars.
- Yeah.

531
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,500
- You back?
- Sorry.

532
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,700
All right.

533
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,100
lcy Hot, Band-Aids, baby oil.

534
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,600
This woman needs a vice.

535
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,300
What's on the other side of that wall?

536
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,600
Kitchen.

537
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,600
Let's take a look.

538
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,300
Hello? Hello?

539
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,900
Maybe there's someone out there.
Maybe there's a stalker.

540
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,500
Someone there?

542
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,700
Hey, Ginger.

543
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,300
Hello?

544
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,500
Does she know I'm here?
Does she know we're here?

545
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,100
No, impossible. Strictly one-way.

546
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,100
You sure?

547
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Hello?

548
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,500
Okay, let's check the perimeter.

549
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,400
Nobody.

550
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,500
Who's watching her?

551
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,800
We are.

552
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,600
They will also take up a request 
for more money for the...

553
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,400
God, thank you for blessing me
with this food and with my life.

554
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,700
I know today's gonna be a great day.
Amen.

556
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,600
You guys singing?
You singing a love song?

557
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,400
You singing a love song
to one another?

558
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,900
What you doing?

559
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Hi.

560
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,600
Yeah, it's been a while.

561
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,100
Everything God has done
will remain forever.

562
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,500
There is nothing to add to it,

563
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,500
nothing to take from it.

564
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,700
God has done this
so that men should be in awe...

565
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,300
Ex didn't show.

566
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,300
Would you?

567
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,600
Whatever is has already been,

568
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,000
and what will be has been before.

569
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,800
God calls forth the past.

571
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,100
Claire loved music.

572
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,600
There's a church near our house,

573
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,800
and gospel fills the neighborhood.

574
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,400
When she was little,
Claire saw a jazz funeral procession.

575
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,000
She asked me that day,

576
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,700
Why do they always wait until the end

577
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,300
to play the good music?

578
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,000
Claire, honey, the music's playing
for you now and forever.

579
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Were there four limo drivers or five?

580
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,400
Four limos.
Must have been four drivers, right?

581
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,100
Four limos.
Must have been four drivers, right?

582
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,200
He was here.

583
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,200
Address is in range.

584
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,300
Palace Restaurant.

585
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
They got good food there.

586
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,500
I'm so sorry for the wait.
I really am.

587
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Listen...

588
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,500
Your table will be ready
in a few minutes.

589
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,100
Drinks are on me, all right?

590
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,100
It is gonna be a few more minutes
for your table...

591
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,100
Go upstairs and see if Table 45
is ready for desserts.

592
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,100
- All right?
- I will.

593
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,000
Hold on. Hang on. Hello? Hello?

594
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,200
Hey, are you the lady 
with the Bronco for sale?

595
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,800
- That's him.
- How do you know?

596
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,700
- That's him.
- Well, call up the phone list.

597
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,900
Let's see if it's a number we've tracked.

598
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Yes, that's me. Just a second.

599
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
Cover for me, all right?

600
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,300
Keep that tape running, too.

601
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,100
I'm gonna want a recording
of this conversation for voice analysis.

602
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
- I'm here. Can you hear me?
- Well, hello, there.

603
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,700
Let me tell you, first off,

604
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm what you could call
a real motivated buyer.

605
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,000
I bet you are.

606
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,600
I'm ready to get something right away.

607
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,300
That sounds great.
I need to sell something right away.

608
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,600
Your price looks good, model, mileage.

609
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,800
So where can I come by and see it?

610
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,400
Don't tell him.

611
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,200
I'm at 827 Kings Oak, in the French Quarter.

612
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,100
- Need directions?
- Now he knows where she lives.

613
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,100
No, no, I'll find you.
Is tomorrow night good?

614
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,000
Actually, I...
Tomorrow night is not good.

615
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,500
- Tomorrow?
- I'm going out tomorrow.

616
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,000
He wants to wait for the last
possible moment to steal her car,

617
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,900
then it's too late to report it.

618
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,200
How does Tuesday sound?

619
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,500
Got it. 504-555-0147.

620
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,900
I see it. Tracking.

621
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,900
I think that's gonna be too late.

622
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,800
See, I need the vehicle
Tuesday morning.

623
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,500
Is there anyone else there
that can show me the car?

624
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,300
- No. Sorry.
- He's thinking.

625
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,900
I'll tell you what. There's a K5 Blazer...

626
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,800
A date means
somebody's gonna be expecting her

627
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,500
and will miss her
if she doesn't show up.

628
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,800
That could ruin his plans.
Shanti, I want to see this guy.

629
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,300
No good. It's an outdoor phone booth.
Three miles out of range.

630
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,500
I hope to hear from you.

631
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,700
Can we get someone out there
with a goggle rig?

632
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,200
What's that do? Extend the range?

633
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,100
Yeah, it's immediate line of sight.

634
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,900
But we can use it to gather data
outside the target area.

635
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,300
Provided there's any data to gather.

636
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,100
How long is this guy
gonna be at the phone booth?

637
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,500
Not long.

638
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,200
- Have a good night.
- Thanks.

639
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,200
Bye.

640
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,000
Story of my life.

641
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,700
Yeah, story of my life, too.

642
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
All right, now we heard
the voice of our bomber,

643
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,500
now we're gonna go after him
the old-fashioned way.

644
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,800
Can we get video surveillance
on that phone booth?

645
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,200
We can access all surveillance
available to any government agency.

646
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,500
Okay, this is from the ATM camera
across the street.

647
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,200
All right. Let's fast-forward to the exact
time of his phone call to Claire.

648
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,200
Where are we supposed to be looking?

649
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,000
Behind the guy on the left.

650
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,200
Can you enhance it, Gunnars?

651
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,400
Not enough for an ID.

652
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,700
Wait, go back. Can you 
rewind it just a little bit?

653
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,300
Stop. What is that on the ground?

654
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,500
Looks like a camcorder bag, maybe.

655
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,300
- We have facial recognition software?
- Yeah.

656
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,600
Let's use it on the bag.

657
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,100
Cross-match it to all the bags
on the south side of the city

658
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,100
in the 48 hours leading up
to the explosion, all right?

659
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,900
Don't think it's ever been
used this way.

660
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,100
Yeah, that's kind of a simple image
to go for a match.

661
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,100
Well, we got nowhere else to go.

662
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,200
- Look, same bag.
- Bingo.

663
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,900
Okay, freeze it.

664
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,800
Yeah, looks like the same guy, too.
Where is this?

665
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,300
Security camera
at the Algiers ferry dock.

666
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,800
Okay, when is this?

667
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,300
Two nights before the explosion.
Seven hours from now.

668
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,200
Two nights before the explosion
is seven hours from now?

669
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,500
Seven hours from now, we will be able
to access this point in our time window.

670
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,800
Gotcha.

671
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,800
Kind of creepy, seeing that lady's life
go down in flames.

672
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,300
Yep.

673
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,100
Makes you appreciate life.

674
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,700
I suggest you go home
and jump on whoever you got.

675
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,500
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Nobody home.

676
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,600
How'd you let that happen?

677
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,300
Everything you have, you lose, right?
Mother, father, gone.

678
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,100
Good looks, Pryzwarra, gone.

679
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,600
Loved ones gone in a second.

680
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,000
That's what this job teaches you,
doesn't it?

681
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,700
No matter what,

682
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,900
no matter how hard you grab
onto something, you still lose it, right?

683
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,600
Well, we're gonna grab onto this guy
in a couple hours.

684
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,700
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch.

685
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,200
What's wrong?

686
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,400
No matter what, we still lose her.

687
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,000
Right?

688
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:26,800
...dot-com for a link 
to the FEMA Web site.

689
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,700
...dot-com for a link
to the FEMA Web site.

690
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,400
Military helicopters that have
served as an emergency force

691
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,500
are leaving the city. Hundreds of 
thousands of New Orleans residents

692
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,100
have been unable to come back home,
and entire neighborhoods...

693
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,500
Did you talk to him?

694
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,100
...are still waiting to rebuild.
This while governmental agencies...

695
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,200
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

696
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,200
Mom asked me to say a prayer
for David this morning, but I forgot.

697
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,600
- Okay.
- Mom is gonna be so mad at me.

698
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,600
She's not gonna be mad at you.
Come on.

699
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,700
We'll just say one now, all right?

700
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,700
- It's too late.
- It's never too late, sweetie.

701
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,300
We'll just pray
that David had a good day, all right?

702
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,000
How about this? You pray for David,
and I'll pray for my mom, okay?

703
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,300
- Okay.
- All right.

705
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
- What's going on?
- Give it a second.

706
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,900
- Gunnars.
- It's rebooting. It's coming back.

707
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,900
- Are we online?
- Wait.

708
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
- Are we online?
- Gunnars!

709
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,100
- What the hell's going on?
- Shanti, are we back online?

710
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,600
I don't know.
Something broached the field.

711
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,100
- What broached the field?
- That broached the field, right there.

712
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,900
That broached the field, right there.
That's what broached the field.

713
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is?

714
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,500
It's not surveillance, Paul.
It's not electronic thermal imaging.

715
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,200
You guys have figured out a way
to look into the past. Yes or no?

716
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,300
- No.
- You're lying.

717
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,900
- You're lying, and you know it.
- I've told you everything I can.

718
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,800
She saw it, Paul.
I pointed this thing at her just now,

719
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,500
and she responded to it
from four and a half days ago.

720
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,900
- Explain that to me.
- All right.

721
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,200
Somebody explain it!

722
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,400
Hit it, Shanti.

723
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,900
For three years,
Cambridge has been working

724
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,900
for National Reconnaissance
on an R & D grant.

725
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,100
Okay.

726
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,600
We were attempting
to use concentrated bursts of energy

727
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,200
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes.

728
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,700
In the process, we had a breakthrough.

729
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,200
Given enough energy,
we could warp the very fabric of space.

730
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,900
I said explain it to me, not talk science.

731
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,600
- They found a way to...
- Look, I'll tell you what.

732
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,400
Why don't you guys just keep talking?
I'll just sit here

733
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,600
until you figure out what it is 
you really wanna tell me.

734
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,800
They found a way to fold space
back onto itself.

735
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,800
All right, look. We're used to 
viewing space as flat, right?

736
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
- Like this piece of paper.
- Right.

737
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,400
To see something from a distance,
light has always had to travel

738
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,100
the long way across 
the flat space in between.

739
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,600
But given what I was trying to explain,

740
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,400
we can fold the space,
bring the target closer to us,

741
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,400
create what's known as
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

742
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,500
otherwise known as a wormhole,
suspend it via gravitational field.

743
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,800
- That's what we're looking at?
- That's it.

744
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,900
What's on the other end of the bridge?

745
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,500
Claire's house.

746
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Wow.

747
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,700
Basically, we're folding space
in a higher dimension

748
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,500
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points.

749
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
- Instantaneous?
- Well, that's what we hoped for

750
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,900
and that's what we expected.
But the electrical force...

751
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,500
We used huge amounts of energy
to create this bridge.

752
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,700
All right, how huge?

753
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,900
You remember that little blackout
we had a few years back?

754
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,100
- Yes, I do.
- New York blamed Canada.

755
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,300
- Right.
- Canada blamed Michigan.

756
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,400
Half the Northeast.
You're saying you guys...

757
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
- Fifty million homes. Right.
- My bad.

758
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,300
Well, I still say 
we blame Canada, but...

759
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,700
Okay, so why can't I see this bridge?

760
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,200
It's not visible to the human eye.
I mean, it's real, though.

761
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,500
It's just as real and just as solid

762
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,100
as a cell phone signal or a radio wave.

763
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,400
Right. Well, I don't know
how a cell phone works.

764
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,200
I just know how to use it.
So how do we use this?

765
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,800
We can look back four and a half days.

766
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,700
- And what, we can look anywhere?
- Limited radius.

767
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
Right, right, right.
Looking into the past.

768
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
In a sense,
we're always looking in the past.

769
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,700
Even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror

770
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,300
takes some time to reflect back.

771
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
Let me get this straight.

772
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,300
You're trying to tell me
that on the other side of this bridge

773
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,500
- is the actual past?
- Yes.

774
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,000
- Wow.
- Yeah. But look, look, look.

775
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,200
We created this thing by pure accident.
All right?

776
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,900
This space and time...
This time window is a complete fluke.

777
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,000
All right? And everybody is terrified
of screwing with it for fear of losing it

778
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,200
or suffering the consequences
of God knows what,

779
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
which is why it can only be used
as a retroactive tool...

780
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,600
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is she alive or is she dead?

781
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,200
- You went to her funeral, Doug.
- I know that,

782
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,300
but I think the question still applies.
Is she alive or is she dead?

783
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,100
All right. Life, like time and space,
is not merely a local phenomenon.

784
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,600
All right!

785
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,700
Am I asking a hard question?

786
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,300
Looks like I picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash.

787
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,600
All right, I tell you what.

788
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,300
I'll speak slow, so those of you with
Ph.D.'s in the room can understand.

789
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,600
lt... Here. Look. Here's a monitor, right?

790
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,600
Now the monitor is broken. It's dead.

791
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,600
It is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy.

792
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,800
It's dead, right?
Now, is she alive or is she dead?

793
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,400
- She's alive.
- All right.

794
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Now we're getting somewhere.

795
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,500
All right, now, you said
light could go back. What else?

796
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,200
- Nothing.
- Something else could be sent back.

797
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,300
Come on, Paul. Something.
What? A body? A human being?

798
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,500
- No.
- Not a person. Not alive, anyway.

799
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,600
- Why not?
- Because you can't beat the physics.

800
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,200
The electromagnetic field.
Look, you transition across

801
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,200
what's known as the 
Wheeler Boundary, all right?

802
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,500
An EM pulse annihilates
all electrical activity.

803
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,500
That's your heartbeat,
that's brainwaves, that's everything.

804
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,500
So what? You haven't tried a person?

805
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,800
Let's just say that we've done enough tests

806
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,900
to know that it's not even possible.

807
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,600
It's not even theoretically possible.
The hamster goes back, dead.

808
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,800
- A drosophila fly, dead.
- What about a radio signal?

809
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,200
What about that?
We could send a radio...

810
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,500
- A radio signal?
- Yeah, a radio signal.

811
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,400
- Won't work. Electrical.
- The field would scramble it.

812
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,900
- All right, then a note, a warning note.
- No.

813
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,600
- A single piece of paper. One sheet.
- No.

814
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,200
- If we keep the mass low...
- No!

815
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,400
This could work! It could work.

816
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,700
Sure. We know where the guy's gonna be.

817
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,300
We can apprehend him and put him away

818
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
before he even blows up the boat.

819
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,900
- And how do we do that, exactly?
- We send it to ourselves!

820
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,500
You send it to me. Yeah, send it to me.
Send it to my office.

821
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,500
Send it to my office
four and a half days ago,

822
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,800
an anonymous tip, and we can capture
this guy before he even meets Claire.

823
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,700
We know he's gonna be at the dock.

824
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,900
Whatever you did, you did it already.

825
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,800
Whether you send this note or you
don't send this note, it doesn't matter.

826
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,900
You cannot change the past.
It's physically impossible.

827
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
What if there's more than physics?

828
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,700
Okay. Something spiritual, right?

829
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,600
- Yeah, something spiritual.
- Okay, okay, okay. Look.

830
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,100
Just try to think of it this way.

831
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,300
God's mind is made up about this.
All right?

832
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,000
I mean, you know, call it fate,
call it destiny, whatever.

833
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,400
But it already happened,
it will keep happening,

834
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,900
- and it always will happen.
- Maybe.

835
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,300
And why don't we call it fate,
since we're calling it something?

836
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,000
Maybe you're right. Maybe you guys
are exactly right. I don't know.

837
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,400
All I know is this.
For all of my career,

838
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,500
I've been trying to catch people
after they do something horrible.

839
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
For once in my life,

840
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,400
I'd like to catch somebody
before they do something horrible.

841
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,300
All right?
Can you understand that?

842
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,700
Address is in range.

843
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,300
Address is in range.

844
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,300
Two L's. Surveilling, two L's.

845
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,400
Since this is such a tremendous 
waste of taxpayer money,

846
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,100
the least we could do
is get the spelling right.

847
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,100
That's not necessarily true.

848
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,900
Branching universe theory holds
that you can do...

849
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,300
- Oh, branching universe theory.
- Look, hold it. All right.

850
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,300
- No, no, no.
- I'll show you.

851
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,600
The traditional view of time is linear,

852
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,700
like a river flowing from the past
toward the future.

853
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,700
But you can change the course 
of a river, right?

854
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,700
Exactly. Introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river

855
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,500
and you create a new branch,

856
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,100
still flowing toward the future,
but along a different route.

857
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,300
Changed.

858
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,500
Yeah, but that river is the Mississippi,

859
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,600
and we're lobbing what amounts 
to a pebble into it.

860
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,100
That's a very few tiny ripples in a kind
of big body of water, don't you think?

861
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,600
Traditionalist.

862
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,300
Say we do create this new branch.

863
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,600
What happens to the old one?
To this one?

864
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,300
Ask the radical.

865
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,600
Well, it might continue
parallel to the new branch,

866
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,100
but most likely it ceases to exist.

867
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,700
The idea is, we cease to exist.

868
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,400
All right? This version of us, anyway.

869
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,300
You know, we never came here.
We didn't meet Doug.

870
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,900
We don't remember it ever happening.

871
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,300
Well, that's worth $ 10 billion
right there.

872
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,000
Would've been a lot faster
if you'd written it yourself.

873
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,000
Right. Then I recognize
my own handwriting

874
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,100
and the universe blows up.

875
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
We're ready.

876
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,500
All right, third floor, southwest 
corner. That's where we are.

877
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,700
How'd you get that information?

878
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Good police work.

879
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,900
That's me. I can hear me.

880
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,500
- I don't wanna play games with you.
- Where am I?

881
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,900
- I'm not playing games.
- Yeah, you are.

882
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,700
- No, I'm not.
- There are protocols... Yeah, you are.

883
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,100
- There I am.
- Is that Minuti?

884
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,000
- There's procedures...
- Yep. That's my partner, Larry.

885
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,300
Look, I know how this job works,
you know how this job works.

886
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,300
Jesus, I forgot all about this part.

887
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,300
All right, let's find a nice, 
happy place to push the note onto.

888
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,300
- That your desk?
- Yeah, that's my...

889
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,000
Okay. Line us up.

890
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,900
When I peg a guy on a hunch,
that's good police work,

891
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,900
not some conspiracy to keep 
you out of the loop, all right?

892
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,300
- You know what, Doug?
- Okay, kid, start pushing.

893
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,600
Expand the wave past the note.

894
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,500
I can't watch your back
if you're holding out on me.

895
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,600
Why not?

896
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,700
If my memory serves me right,
we better hurry up,

897
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,400
'cause I think I'm about to leave.

898
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,200
- I need more cowbell.
- I'm trying.

899
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,600
- Okay, well, I...
- Good!

900
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,700
Just give me a second.

901
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,000
- Don't talk to each other.
- Expand.

902
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm about to leave.

903
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,800
...another partner?
How about that? How about that?

904
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,500
- Everybody relax.
- Okay. Yeah.

905
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,800
- Let's go.
- I'm working on it.

906
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,500
Prepare for the final power surge.
Ready?

907
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,900
- Have a good vacation.
- All right. Go, go, go!

908
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,100
Walk away.

909
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,500
What the hell happened?

910
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,600
I don't know.

911
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,600
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Pull it back!

912
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,300
- Did it go through?
- I don't know! I don't know!

913
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
Pull it back.

914
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,500
- There it is.
- It went through.

915
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,000
- That's right.
- It's through.

916
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,300
- It went through!
- Great.

917
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,000
Whoa, whoa.
No, wait a minute. Hang on.

918
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,200
It ain't great yet. I don't come back.

919
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,900
Put it down, Larry.
I'm not coming back.

920
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,800
Put it down, Larry.

921
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,800
Larry, don't do it.

922
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,800
- Follow him.
- I'm on him.

923
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,500
All right, look, let's... You know what?
Let's cut away from Minuti.

924
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,000
The bomber's on his way to the dock.
He's due there any minute.

925
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,200
We'll come back to Minuti
when he gets there, all right?

926
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,200
All right.

927
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,700
Okay, where is he?

928
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,500
Can we circle it?

929
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,100
We should be able to see him by now.

930
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,600
That's him. There he is. All right.

931
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,200
- Holy shit.
- All right.

932
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,800
Move in on him real close.
I want to see his... That's him.

933
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,200
That's him.

934
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,700
That's our guy. That's him.
At the bridge, the cemetery, the ATM.

935
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,900
That's our guy.

936
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Shanti, see if you can get
an ID, facial ID on him.

937
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,100
- Give me some time.
- Okay. All right. Take your time.

938
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,900
- There's your partner.
- I see him.

939
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,400
Try to move in on his truck.

940
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,200
See if we can get a plate.

941
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
- No plate.
- Get back on him.

942
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,900
Stay on him.

943
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,100
Where's Minuti?

944
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,500
Federal agent! Turn the engine off!

945
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,000
Turn the engine off!

947
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,500
Tilt back down.

948
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,300
He's still breathing.

949
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,900
- What can we do?
- I don't know what to do.

950
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,100
He's traveling east.
He's traveling out of range.

951
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,800
- Okay, what can we do? Anything?
- I don't know,

952
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,600
but if we don't do something fast,
I'm gonna lose this guy.

953
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,400
We're losing the signal.

954
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,800
We have to boost the signal.

955
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,100
We need to chase him
with the goggle rig.

956
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,900
Yeah, well,
Gunnars is a little busy right now,

957
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,800
and he's the only one who can use it.

958
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,600
- Where is it?
- What, the rig? It's...

959
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,600
- Yeah, the rig. Where is it?
- It's in his Hummer.

960
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,100
- Keys in there?
- Yeah.

962
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,300
All right, quiet, everybody. It's him.

963
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,200
- Carlin.
- Where's he now?

964
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,600
- Is he going east?
- Yes.

965
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,200
Okay, he's going east,
going up on De Gaulle.

966
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,500
All right, just try to keep him in sight,
and keep feeding me directions.

967
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,400
I'll try and track him with this goggle rig.

968
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,700
- Can he do that?
- Yeah, if he can catch up to the image

969
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,300
and keep him in sight, that could work.

970
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,100
Hey, how do you turn this thing on?

971
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,100
There's an on-off button
on the back of the rig.

972
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Okay, I see it.

973
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,000
It's really simple. Wherever you 
look, the eyepiece will auto-focus,

974
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,200
and we'll see what you see.

975
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,700
Okay, you're live. You're on.

976
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,300
- Try the goggles.
- Hang on, hang on.

977
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,800
- He's gone. Out of range.
- What?

978
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,500
- Where's he headed?
- He's headed toward the I-10.

979
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,300
East or west?

980
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,000
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

981
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,600
East or west?

982
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,500
We lost the signal. We're blind in here.

983
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,100
- I don't know.
- All right, hang on.

984
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,500
Oh, shit!

985
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,100
What? What happened?
What happened?

986
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,200
This is trippy.

987
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,400
Doug, look straight ahead.

988
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,000
We've got the window slaved
to your goggles.

989
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,100
We are seeing what you're seeing
four days in the past.

990
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,500
Okay, I got him. I got him.
He's back in range.

991
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,100
He's going west, not east,

992
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,100
on the Crescent City Bridge.

993
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,300
There he is. That's him. Opposite lane.

994
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,900
- I got him.
- That's him. That's him.

995
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,400
I got him!

996
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,500
Watch the traffic.

997
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,600
- What was that?
- I think he hit something.

998
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,400
Doug, you've gotta stay with him.
You're gonna lose him again.

999
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,500
Doug, what's happening?

1000
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,300
I got him! I got him.

1001
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,200
All right, all right, all right.

1002
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,200
Good. Now stay with him.

1003
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,500
Send paramedics to 
the Crescent City Bridge.

1004
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,000
Got that?

1005
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,100
I lost him.

1007
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,600
- I got him! I got him!
- All right. All right.

1008
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,000
That's him.

1009
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,300
He's headed for the 10 to the bayou.

1010
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,100
I can see him.
He's right in front of me.

1011
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,300
Carlin!

1012
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,400
What was that?
What the hell was that?

1013
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,200
Doug, are you all right?

1014
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,900
Doug!

1015
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,700
Doug?

1016
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,900
I think it's broken.
I can't see anything.

1017
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
We still have a signal here.
You're still transmitting.

1018
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,800
- You can see?
- We'll talk you through it.

1019
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,900
Can you still drive?

1020
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,400
Yeah, yeah. Where is he?

1021
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,900
Give us a 360 with the goggle rig.

1022
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,700
There! There he is!
Pan the thing around.

1023
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,500
- Which way?
- To your right.

1024
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,100
To your right.

1025
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,200
There! There he is!

1026
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,100
- He's taking the road to the bayou!
- Right there?

1027
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,900
The road is blocked.

1028
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,700
Take the expressway.
It parallels the road.

1029
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,300
Go. Go, go!

1030
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
See him?

1031
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,600
Pan right. Pan right!

1032
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,200
You still see him?

1033
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,000
He's at the end of the bridge.

1034
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,700
- You hear me?
- He's at the end of the bridge.

1035
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,700
Keep talking to me.

1036
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,800
I don't know what else to tell you.
I feel very, very close to you right now.

1037
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,100
He took the exit ramp beneath you.

1038
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,200
- Take the next off-ramp.
- Take the next off-ramp!

1039
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,800
All right, I'm on the off-ramp.

1040
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,200
Go right, then double back on yourself.

1041
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,000
All right, I got it.

1042
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,600
All right, take another right.

1043
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,700
Still see him?

1044
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,000
He's heading to the bayou.
Take a left here.

1045
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,700
Good, good, good.

1046
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,200
Take it easy, Doug.
He's dead ahead of you.

1047
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,100
Okay, okay, okay.

1048
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,800
He's slowing down, coming 
to a fence. Do you see it?

1049
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,500
Yeah, I see it.

1050
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,300
Doug, if you're gonna leave 
the Hummer, take the backpack.

1051
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,700
It's the power source for the rig.

1052
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,500
It's the power source for the rig.

1053
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,000
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1054
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,200
Yeah, we can hear you.
We can hear you.

1055
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,500
All right.

1056
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,400
What's he doing now?

1057
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,100
He's pulled around the back of the building.

1058
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,800
Looks like a bomb went off.

1059
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,500
Really? We see an intact structure here.

1060
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,400
- No damage?
- No, none.

1061
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,500
Looks like a vehicle's inside.

1062
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,500
An ambulance. You see that?

1063
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,500
No. Nothing.

1064
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,600
See anything?

1065
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,400
He's dead ahead of you.

1066
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,400
Doug, he's pulling Minuti out of the car.

1067
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,600
Where?

1068
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,700
All right, now pan to the right.
Pan to the right.

1069
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,100
- More right.
- You got him.

1070
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,700
Yeah, he's dragging him out of the car.

1071
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,100
Do you see him?

1072
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,500
- Yeah.
- Yes. Right in front of you.

1073
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,400
Boost the audio for me.

1074
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,000
Audio boosted.

1075
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,000
Turn around.
Turn around behind you.

1076
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,800
- Larry?
- Pan back to the right.

1077
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,800
- You've got him now.
- Where is he?

1078
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,000
He's being dragged on the concrete.

1079
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,900
Larry!

1080
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,200
What's that sound?

1081
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,700
What's the sound?

1082
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,500
He's pouring some kind of 
accelerant over Agent Minuti.

1083
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,900
I think it's the diesel fuel,
like at the ferry.

1084
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,600
He's waking up.

1085
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,900
Brace yourselves. I think
you're about to witness a murder.

1088
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,300
If we hadn't sent him there,
he wouldn't be dead now.

1089
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,200
No, he was already dead from the ferry.
We just changed how he died.

1090
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,300
We don't know that.

1091
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,800
He could've been standing
right next to you,

1092
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,000
right until we sent that note.

1093
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,300
You'd need a branching multiple 
universe for that to happen.

1094
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,200
Oh, come on. We can't change anything.

1095
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,600
We didn't change anything.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

1096
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,700
I'll tell you what we did.

1097
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,600
The suspect used a stolen Blazer
to case the dock.

1098
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:17,700
So now he has a truck big enough
to drive a bomb onto the ferry.

1099
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,300
Now Larry shows up, right?

1100
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,700
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield.

1101
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,400
- You want a mask?
- No. No, I'm good, thanks.

1102
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Larry puts bullet holes
through the windshield,

1103
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:32,000
leaves blood all over the back seat,
so now our bomber needs a new truck,

1104
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,500
you understand? Claire's truck.

1105
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,700
You hungry?

1106
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah, we changed one thing,

1107
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,800
but by changing one thing,
we didn't change anything.

1108
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,600
What's on TV?

1109
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,700
Hey, hey, hey, we got a name.

1110
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,100
- Carroll Oerstadt.
- What?

1111
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,100
- Who is that?
- Owner of that bait camp Doug found.

1112
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,300
Truck registration,
airboat registration, match.

1113
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,500
And another property.

1114
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,600
5874 Mullie Ave., Ninth Ward, New Orleans.

1115
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,900
- Is this a he or a she?
- It's a he. Let's go.

1116
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,400
Clear!

1117
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,700
Testing, one, two, three, four.

1118
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,000
Testing, one, two, three, four.

1119
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:47,700
ATF New Orleans, conducting
interview with Carroll Oerstadt.

1120
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:51,400
ATF New Orleans, conducting
interview with Carroll Oerstadt.

1121
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,000
You've waived your right
to counsel, right?

1122
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,900
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

1123
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,400
I'm fascinated with your precision.

1124
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,200
It's not very often we see that level
of expertise around here,

1125
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,700
and if it's all right with you,
I'd like to use this interview

1126
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,500
to educate my colleagues
in law enforcement.

1127
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,200
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Good.

1128
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,700
Let's talk about motive.

1129
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,400
Why would you use explosives
against the US Navy?

1130
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:24,200
- Correction, sir. US Government.
- US Government.

1131
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,300
It says here that you tried
to enlist in the Marines.

1132
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,200
You were rejected.
You tried to enlist in the Army,

1133
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,400
you were rejected again.

1134
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,800
Why do you think they did that?

1135
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,600
Because they don't want patriots.

1136
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,400
The military no longer recognizes
commitment and purpose.

1137
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,400
They thought I was overcommitted
and psychologically unstable.

1138
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,300
They didn't want to understand
my value.

1139
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,800
They understand it now.

1140
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,400
I believe so. Yes, sir.

1141
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,400
- You're ATF, right?
- Yes, I am.

1142
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,700
- Got a smoke?
- No, I don't. But I can get you one.

1143
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,300
- Would you like one?
- Yes.

1144
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,200
Okay. Anything you want to say,
just talk into the mike.

1145
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,500
A man can always use more alcohol,
tobacco and firearms.

1146
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,700
I can think of one more thing.

1147
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,500
It's like the Revolutionary War,
you know what I mean?

1148
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,700
One man's terrorist is 
another man's patriot, isn't it?

1149
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,500
- Yeah?
- Exactly.

1150
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,200
- Yeah.
- You get it.

1151
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,400
- This wasn't about revenge.
- What was it about?

1152
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,600
Destiny.

1153
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,200
Destiny?

1154
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,100
You've been asking me
about my motives.

1155
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,700
- Right. Right.
- My methods.

1156
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,800
They're all connected.

1157
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,900
Everything's connected.

1158
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,300
Okay.
How was Claire Kuchever connected?

1159
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,900
I needed a car.

1160
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,500
- And that's it?
- No, well, something

1161
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,600
- that couldn't be traced back to me.
- Right.

1162
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,500
I had one ready till that cop showed up.

1163
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,800
That cop was a federal agent.

1164
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,200
Lawrence Minuti. My partner.
You shot him.

1165
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,300
He... I was about to burn him
and he was waking up, you know?

1166
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,000
I mean, I'm not cruel.

1167
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:15,600
Well, why didn't you do that
for Claire Kuchever?

1168
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:22,800
Well, because I needed her
to look like a ferry victim,

1169
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,100
- and a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1170
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,300
- and a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1171
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,700
I went to her house
on the pretense of buying her car.

1172
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,000
I took her from behind, taped her mouth
and threw a hood over her head.

1173
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,100
Then?

1174
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,300
I bound her wrists and her ankles
and I drove her back to my place.

1175
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,200
I loaded the device into her car

1176
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,800
and then I soaked her
with the gasoline.

1177
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Jesus.

1178
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,200
And?

1179
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,800
I think you know
what happened after that.

1180
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,800
No, I don't know. I want you to tell me.
You gotta talk.

1181
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,000
I mean, you know, come on, hero.
What happened after that?

1182
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,200
I'll tell you what happened after that.

1183
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:52,800
You killed 543 people.
How do you feel about that?

1184
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,500
I think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning.

1185
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,600
Sometimes a little human collateral
is the cost of freedom.

1186
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,600
To me,
those people were war casualties,

1187
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,600
but to you, they're just evidence.

1188
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:14,100
That'll do. We got him.

1189
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,200
What'd you say?

1190
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,200
You think you know what's coming?
You don't have a clue.

1191
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,300
I know where you're going.

1192
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:25,300
I know you're gonna be away
for a long time. I know that.

1193
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,800
- This case will never even go to trial.
- No?

1194
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,400
- 'Cause I seen what's coming.
- Did... Have you? What?

1195
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,400
What is in this glass?
You've seen what's coming, huh?

1196
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,500
Okay, what's coming? You tell me.

1197
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,200
I told you earlier I have a destiny,

1198
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,600
a purpose.

1199
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,400
Satan reasons like man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1200
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,500
Well, I prostrate myself before a world
that's going to hell in a handbag,

1201
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,700
'cause in all eternity,
I am here and I will be remembered.

1202
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,400
That's destiny.

1203
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,900
A bomb has a destiny,

1204
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,500
a predetermined fate
set by the hand of its creator.

1205
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,900
And anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed.

1206
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,400
Anyone who tries to stop it
from happening will cause it to happen.

1207
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,400
And that's what you don't understand.

1208
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,300
We're not here to coexist.
I'm here to win.

1209
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,500
So you'd better have
some divine intervention, buddy.

1210
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,400
You're gonna need it.

1211
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,300
You'd better have some K-Y.
You're gonna need it.

1212
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,300
What am I supposed to do?

1213
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,000
- We're shutting you down.
- What?

1214
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,500
Yeah, we got what we need.

1215
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,100
The forensics, the suspect,
a confession. We're done.

1216
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,700
Sir, perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime.

1217
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,300
- The ferry bombing.
- Right. He's right.

1218
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,600
I mean, we can't just
go on the confession alone.

1219
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,900
We need an airtight case.
We need to collect more evidence.

1220
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,300
Well, collecting evidence
would've been fine, Agent Carly.

1221
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,900
- You took it a little further than that.
- Agent Carlin. Carlin.

1222
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,100
My name is Carlin, not Carly.

1223
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,800
We had protocols in place.
There's strict protocols.

1224
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,600
And then you had to push it,
and now an agent's dead.

1225
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,000
Sir, by one theory,
that already happened.

1226
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:16,300
We're done. Power it down.
Pack it up. On to the next case.

1227
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,800
- What about Claire?
- What...

1228
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,400
Lookit, charging Oerstadt
in the Kuchever murder

1229
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,100
is gonna raise too many questions
about how we obtained the evidence.

1230
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,600
I understand that, sir,
but what about Claire?

1231
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,800
Are we just gonna drop the case?

1232
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,300
We got him on the ferry bombing,
we got him on killing a federal agent.

1233
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,700
- That's enough to get him the needle.
- I cannot accept that, sir.

1234
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,300
Well, you know, I don't give a rat's ass
what you can accept.

1235
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,800
- She doesn't matter.
- He's gonna kill her.

1236
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,600
- In 12 hours, he's gonna kill her.
- He killed her four days ago.

1237
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,400
You were at the funeral.
What's wrong with you?

1238
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,900
It had to happen.

1239
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,400
I delayed turning in my report
till we caught the guy.

1240
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,800
Hey, mission accomplished.

1241
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,400
This is a victory, Doug.

1242
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,500
Hey. Now, my job is closure.

1243
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,100
Your job is to help facilitate
that closure.

1244
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,500
Then you tell me,
what do I tell her father?

1245
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,700
We caught the son of a bitch.

1246
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,900
We can't save the victims.

1247
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,300
It's not our job to make 
the relatives feel better.

1248
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:23,900
We lose everything that we care about.
Those are your words.

1249
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,900
Doug, it's not your fault
that Claire dies.

1250
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,400
Yeah, that's one theory.

1251
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,800
Lieutenant Junior Grade Dianne Kerry.

1252
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,000
Martin Kyle.

1253
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,900
Commander Francis Lacey, retired.

1254
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,200
Elaine Lacey.

1255
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,000
Chief Petty Officer Darren McAndrews.

1256
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,900
Lorraine McAndrews.

1258
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,000
Electronics Technician Lisa Melville.

1259
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,400
Chaplain Rabbi Benjamin Mendelsson.

1261
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,000
Denny? It's Doug.

1262
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,800
Well, I can't say
I wasn't expecting this call.

1263
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,100
Look, you know what happens
if you try this.

1264
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,800
We both know what happens if I don't.

1265
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:33,200
Well, not a lot of guinea pigs volunteer
to die in the name of science.

1266
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,800
Well, then we have to make sure

1267
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,200
I end up somewhere
besides the morgue.

1268
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,200
Can you help me?

1269
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,000
I'll see you when you get here.

1270
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Doug?

1271
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:59,700
Do me a favor.
When you finish, turn off the lights.

1272
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,600
You do that one more time,
you set off every alarm in the joint.

1273
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,100
Can't take it.

1274
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,800
Gotta keep the mass
as low as possible.

1275
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,000
You gotta take everything off.

1276
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,800
- You can keep your underwear on.
- Thank you very much.

1277
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,100
Thought you said you didn't believe
in changing the past.

1278
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,100
Right. Well, I also believe in God.

1279
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,600
Just don't tell anyone.

1280
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,900
- I'm gonna tell everybody.
- Yeah?

1281
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,900
You know, when I open up the throttle
on this thing...

1282
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:59,400
Yeah, I know. EM field, flatline. I got it.

1283
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,500
Thing of it is,
no matter how clever we think we are,

1284
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,200
the most probable outcome
of our little experiment

1285
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:09,000
is that four and a half days ago
you get a call from the coroner's office.

1286
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,300
Hey, Agent Carlin,
I want you to come down here.

1287
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,200
There's something you should see.

1288
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,300
And next thing you know,
you're standing over a corpse

1289
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,800
and it's you.

1290
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:23,500
Well, you can be wrong a million times.
You only gotta be right once.

1291
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,900
Besides, I think I'd remember
if that happened, right?

1292
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,100
So I gotta face out toward you?

1293
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,000
Yeah, face out.
Just like the note, only bigger.

1294
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,700
- You ready?
- No.

1295
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,300
You don't have to do this.

1296
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,900
What if I already have?

1297
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:43,800
Right.

1298
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,200
Doug?

1299
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,300
Doug?

1300
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,100
Hey. Hello?

1301
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,300
- You okay in there?
- Yeah.

1302
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,300
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

1303
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,000
I'm beside myself.

1304
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,600
Am I still here?

1305
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,000
For now. You ready?

1306
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,600
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- All right.

1307
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,600
Looking forward to walking up to you
four days ago

1308
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,800
and blowing your mind, though.

1309
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,300
Well, if that happens,
maybe you can tell me

1310
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,800
what it's like to meet your younger self.

1311
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,700
All right, I'll let you know.

1312
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,500
All right, remember, the ferry blows
at 10:50 on Fat Tuesday, okay?

1313
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,500
Yeah.

1314
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,200
Here we go.

1315
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,500
See you yesterday.

1316
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,000
God willing.

1317
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:05,900
Good, good.

1318
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,400
- You don't have to do this.
- Hello?

1319
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,500
Maybe I already have.

1320
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,200
Maybe I already have.

1321
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,300
- What the hell?
- All right, hold on, everybody.

1322
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,200
The reserve generators should kick in.
Nobody move.

1323
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,100
That was interesting.

1325
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,200
- Doctor!
- Who the hell is that?

1326
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,100
Where'd he come from?

1327
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,900
All right, let's get him into Trauma.
Trauma 2, Trauma 2!

1328
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,800
This is weird.

1329
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,100
- Defib.
- Clear!

1330
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,400
Recharge it again.

1331
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,500
Clear!

1332
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,800
- Recharge to 300.
- Charging.

1333
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,500
Clear!

1334
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,700
Resume CPR. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

1335
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,400
...thirty-four degrees.

1336
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,000
Forty-nine was our low 
temperature at the airport.

1337
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,500
Gonna be at that or just 
maybe above that for tonight.

1338
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,300
Let me show you why.
Look, the winds are starting,

1339
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:56,000
- a few of them come back.
- I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

1340
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,300
- Whoa!
- I'm a federal agent.

1341
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,800
I need your keys. I need a vehicle.

1342
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,500
There's keys in the truck there.

1343
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,600
Which one? Right here?
Put your hands down.

1344
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,900
Hands on the table.
Hold your donut. Hands right there.

1345
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,000
Water it.

1347
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,800
This might be a metaphor
for existence itself.

1348
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:41,300
A fish struggles instinctively
against an almost formless antagonist.

1349
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,300
The fish is a largemouth bass.

1350
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,700
Here's the news at 8:30.

1351
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,900
Federal officials are still baffled
by the massive blackout

1352
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,900
that darkened the entire eastern half
of the country early this morning.

1354
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,100
Hey!

1356
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,400
Jesus.

1358
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,600
Wait a minute.
Hey, it's okay. Wait a minute!

1359
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,500
Listen. Claire!

1360
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,500
I'm a federal agent. Hang on, hang on.

1361
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,000
All right, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1362
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,600
I'm a federal agent. It's okay. It's okay.

1363
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,600
You're safe. You're all right, okay?

1364
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,900
I'm a federal agent. You're safe.
You're safe. Look at me. Come here.

1365
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,300
You're safe. He's gone. All right?

1366
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,200
- Get me out of here!
- All right. All right.

1367
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,000
Get me out of here!

1368
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,900
It's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

1369
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:10,300
- Get me out of here.
- All right, let me get your feet.

1370
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,100
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.

1371
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,300
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

1372
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,800
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

1373
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,300
All right.

1374
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,800
How'd you know
there'd be keys in this truck?

1375
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,700
That's a good question. I didn't know.

1376
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,400
- He's a terrorist?
- Yeah.

1377
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:53,000
His name is Carroll Oerstadt.
I'm a part of a special surveillance unit.

1378
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,600
We've been tracking him.

1379
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:59,000
He's planning on blowing up
the Canal Street Ferry today at 10:50.

1380
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,200
- So we're going to the police?
- No, it's too complicated.

1381
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,500
By the time we get them up to speed,
the ferry will be gone.

1382
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,300
We gotta go straight to the Algiers dock.

1383
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,800
I don't think you're gonna make it.
You're losing too much blood.

1384
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,300
No, I gotta make it. I only got an hour
and 40 minutes to catch up to this guy.

1385
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,900
What if you don't make it?
What happens then?

1386
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,900
If I don't make it...

1387
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,400
What?

1388
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,500
Your house is on the way.

1389
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,300
We'll go by your house,
and I'll get cleaned up.

1390
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,200
- I'll drop you off. All right?
- All right.

1391
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,800
Hey, Ginger.

1392
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,400
She hates strangers.

1393
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,800
You need anything?

1394
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,800
You get cleaned up.
I'll take care of this.

1395
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:44,300
- You sure? I could bind that for you.
- No, I'm sure. You go ahead.

1396
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,000
I'm gonna need to borrow
one of your boyfriend's jackets, though.

1397
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,200
Sure.

1398
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,500
Hey, listen.

1399
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,200
- You shouldn't wear that.
- What?

1400
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,600
Why don't you put on a different one?

1401
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,800
The blue and white one. Anything.
It's just...

1402
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:46,900
Just trust me.

1403
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:51,200
The victim wore a dress like that
and it wouldn't be good.

1404
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,500
- Okay.
- Trust me.

1405
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,500
All right, I'll go change.
I'll be right out.

1406
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,800
Stop right there!
Don't move!

1407
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,000
Don't move. I'm calling the police.

1408
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,800
- I am the police.
- No, you're not.

1409
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,300
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not!

1410
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:20,100
You didn't ask me any questions.
You didn't take a statement.

1411
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,600
And you knew where my house was,
what's in my closet.

1412
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:27,900
- Who are you?
- I'm Doug Carlin. I'm an ATF agent.

1413
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,700
I'm part of a special surveillance 
unit that's been tracking the man

1414
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,500
- who was trying to kill you.
- How do I know that?

1415
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,200
I had a hood over my head.
You could be him.

1416
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:35,300
Just think about it, Claire.

1417
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,100
Look at my face.
You scratched the man's face.

1418
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,000
Do I have a scratch on my face?

1419
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,900
- You scratched him, didn't you?
- Get on the floor.

1420
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,600
Now! Get on the floor!

1421
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,400
All the way!

1423
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,700
ATF New Orleans, Agent Donnelly.

1424
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,000
Yes, is there an Agent Douglas 
Carlin working out of that branch?

1425
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,600
Yes, there is, but he's not here right now.

1426
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,700
Would you like to leave a message?

1427
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,800
Can you describe him for me, please?

1428
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,700
How tall, skin color.

1429
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,400
I don't know. He's 6'3, 
black, not bad-looking.

1430
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:19,800
Okay, have him call me back

1431
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:23,400
at 877-504-8423.

1432
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,100
Okay, wait. My phone pad's empty.

1433
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,600
All right, got it.

1434
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,200
Hello?

1435
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,600
Get up.

1436
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,100
Are you gonna tell me the truth?

1437
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:48,400
Are you gonna tell me why you're
here, why this is happening

1438
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:51,200
and none of it makes sense?
None of it.

1439
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,700
What if you had to tell someone
the most important thing in the world,

1440
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,000
but you knew they'd never believe you?

1441
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,100
What would you do?

1442
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,200
I'd try.

1443
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,200
You never know what someone might believe.

1444
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:17,900
I don't understand what's...
What's happening.

1446
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,200
I gotta hurry up and get down there.

1447
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,000
Why are you the only one
who can stop him?

1448
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:49,000
Well, because I'm the only one
that knows his plan.

1449
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,800
I'm the only one that knows
where he's gonna be

1450
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,500
and exactly what he's gonna do.

1451
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,300
How do you know that?

1452
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,900
I mean, how'd you know
those things about me?

1453
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,000
Well, for the sake of argument,

1454
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,600
let's just say that the government
has a special device

1455
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:05,600
that allows me to know what's 
gonna happen ahead of time.

1456
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,400
Then how come you didn't know
I was gonna pull a gun on you?

1457
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:11,000
I did. No, I didn't.

1459
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:16,900
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, it's good.

1460
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,600
One second.

1461
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,700
- I think that's gonna stay. Is that okay?
- Yeah, it's great.

1462
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:29,800
Okay.

1463
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:35,500
- All right. I'm not very good at this.
- You're very good.

1464
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,900
What's the matter?

1465
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,200
Jesus.

1466
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,700
I haven't changed a thing.

1467
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:02,200
I gotta go. And you gotta 
go with me. Come on.

1468
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,500
What?

1469
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,500
- I thought you said I was safe now.
- I was wrong. I was wrong.

1470
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,300
You gotta go with me now. Right now.

1472
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,700
Wait, wait, wait! Don't answer it.

1473
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,300
Don't answer it. I'll prove it to you.

1474
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,500
That's your friend Beth calling.

1475
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,000
Let the machine pick it up.
She's gonna say,

1476
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:21,700
Hi, Claire. It's Beth. Are you there?
I'm sorry to call you so early,

1477
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,900
but when you didn't call me 
last night, I got worried.

1478
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,100
Claire? Hi, it's Beth. Are you there?

1479
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,600
I'm sorry to call you so early,

1480
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,800
but you said you were gonna 
call me when you got home,

1481
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,600
and when you didn't,
I started to get worried.

1482
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,400
- Beth, is this a joke?
- Oh, hey, hey! No.

1483
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,300
Like I said, I was just worried
about you, that's all.

1484
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,400
I can't talk right now.
Someone's here. I'll call you later.

1485
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,500
Claire...

1486
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,800
Believe me, the only one
you're gonna be safe with is me.

1487
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,600
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1489
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:51,900
I don't understand.

1490
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,600
Why not just call the police
and have them arrest him at the dock?

1491
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,500
He'll set the bomb off
right there on the spot.

1492
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,100
He can't know he's been compromised

1493
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,200
until it's too late for him
to do anything about it.

1494
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:05,100
He'll set the timer, walk away 
on foot, get on his motorcycle

1495
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:08,000
and ride to the Crescent City 
Bridge to watch.

1496
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,800
Okay, then what? You defuse the bomb?

1497
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,100
Then I defuse the bomb.

1498
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,500
There's my truck.

1500
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,000
- All these people.
- There he is.

1501
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,400
Where?

1502
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,600
You see the military jacket
coming this way?

1503
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,400
It's just what you said.

1504
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:39,700
All right, you see 
those officers behind you?

1505
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,900
- Yeah.
- When the ferry pulls off,

1506
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:44,500
I want you to tell them 
about the bomb, all right?

1507
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,000
- They'll believe me?
- They better believe you.

1508
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,400
- Come on, they'll arrest me.
- They won't arrest you.

1509
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,100
They'll take you into custody.
You'll be fine. That's a good thing.

1510
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:54,900
Don't turn around.

1511
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:02,700
Doug...

1512
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,100
Be careful.

1513
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,900
Your attention, please.

1514
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,500
Passengers are not allowed 
on the car deck

1515
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:47,300
when the ferry is in motion.

1516
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,400
Sir! Sir.

1517
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,100
Excuse me, sir, you're gonna
have to move to the upper deck.

1518
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,800
- Passengers aren't allowed here.
- Okay.

1519
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,400
Can't believe it.
They're right on time.

1520
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,900
Let's get these boys to their party.

1521
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,400
Mama!

1523
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,100
Excuse me, sir? Sir!

1524
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,600
There's no passengers allowed
on the car deck during transit.

1525
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,100
No passengers allowed, sir.

1527
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,700
Let's go! Let's go!

1531
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,100
It's destiny, Oerstadt.

1532
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,200
Satan reasons like a man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1533
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,400
What did you say?

1534
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:30,100
I'm saying it's gonna take a little 
divine intervention here, buddy.

1535
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,800
I'm coming out.

1536
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,500
What'd you say?

1537
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,500
I thought you were a patriot.

1538
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,800
Oh, I am.

1539
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,300
Patriotism requires sacrifice.

1540
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:55,100
- I'm willing to sacrifice.
- Yeah? Who? Her? Me?

1541
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,800
You're willing to sacrifice 
others, but not yourself.

1542
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:02,300
The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed
with the blood of patriots and tyrants.

1543
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,500
Right.

1544
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:08,400
Sometimes a little human collateral
is the cost of freedom, isn't it?

1545
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,400
Who are you, Oerstadt?

1546
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,700
Who are you?

1547
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,600
It's not supposed to be this way.

1549
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,100
You all right?

1550
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,200
- I killed him.
- No, you didn't. I did.

1551
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:03,100
It's 10:48 on Fat Tuesday, Mardi Gras.

1552
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,800
Now let's go back in time to 1964.

1553
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:08,100
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not.

1554
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:10,600
on 105.3 FM, the heart of New Orleans.

1555
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:12,600
Hit the gas.

1556
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,200
Hit the gas!

1557
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,500
Put your hands in the air and
step out of the vehicle now!

1558
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,600
We get out now, everybody dies.

1559
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:31,300
You have until the count of three!

1560
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:32,400
Hit it.

1561
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,600
One...

1566
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:49,700
But my daughter's on that ferry.
Please. Please.

1567
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:53,100
Oh, God, my daughter!

1568
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,000
Chrissie!

1569
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:10,900
Chrissie!

1570
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,400
- Oh, Chrissie! Chrissie!
- It's my mom!

1571
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:14,600
Mom!

1572
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:23,900
Ma'am? We're gonna need you
to stay right here.

1573
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,100
Someone's on the way over
to take a statement

1574
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,600
and ask you some questions, okay?

1575
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,700
- Bobby.
- Doug.

1576
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,200
- How you doing?
- All right.

1577
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,800
Got a live one over here.
Pulled her out of the drink.

1578
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,300
Somehow involved in all of this.

1579
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,200
Okay.

1580
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,800
- How you doing?
- Doug?

1581
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,300
That's right.

1582
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:23,600
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1583
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:29,900
Have we met?

1584
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:34,500
Yeah. Yeah, we have.

1585
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,000
It's okay. Come on.

1586
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,200
Come on.

1587
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,100
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1588
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,800
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1589
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:03,800
Okay. I'll get you warmed up.

1592
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:15,100
What is it?

1593
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,200
What is it?

1594
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,500
Doug.

1595
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:30,300
What if you had to tell someone
the most important thing in the world,

1596
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,100
but you knew they'd never believe you?

1597
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,700
I'd try.

1598
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:46,600
No.
