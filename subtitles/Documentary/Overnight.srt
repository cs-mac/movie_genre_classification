1
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,931
<i>- This is the best.
- All right.</i>

2
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,432
<i>- I fucking love this.
- Okay.</i>

3
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,167
<i>- This feels so fucking good.
- All right.</i>

4
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,835
<i>I fucking love fucking you.</i>

5
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,736
<i>Okay, shh.</i>

6
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:41,104
<i>Shh. It's okay.</i>

7
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:42,905
<i>Sorry, was I saying
"fucking" too much?</i>

8
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:45,741
<i>No, it's fine.</i>
<i>It's good. I like it.</i>
<i>Just keep it down, okay?</i>

9
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:46,842
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

10
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:48,810
<i>Okay.</i>

11
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:50,645
<i>Tell me I have a big dick.
You've got a big dick, sweetie.</i>

12
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:51,779
<i>Yeah. Say, giant.</i>

13
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:54,148
You've got a giant dick,
sweetie, and I love it.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,215
- Yeah.
- I love it.

15
00:00:55,217 --> 00:00:56,683
- Yeah.
- Circles, please.

16
00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:58,651
- Okay.
- Circles.

17
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,153
- There we go. Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

18
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:02,587
Bigger circles, baby.
Bigger circles.

19
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,121
I feel like I'm giving
big circles right now.

20
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:05,922
- Shh.
- Okay.

21
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:07,490
- Shh. Shh.
- Okay.

22
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:08,457
- Okay?
- Okay.

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,060
Okay. I'm good.
Are you good? You good?

24
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:13,995
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah. Let's do this.

25
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:15,477
- Great.
- Okay.

26
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,133
Okay.

27
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,506
He's awake.

28
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:29,074
- Okay, hurry up.
- Okay.

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,210
Ah. There's still time.

30
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:36,178
- Oh, my God.
- I can come. There's still time for me.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,345
- Honey, he's awake.
- No, no, no.

32
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,946
- He's awake!
- I'm coming!

33
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,647
Mama!

34
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:42,281
Whoa!

35
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:44,082
- Hey, buddy!
- -It smells weird.

36
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:45,349
- It does smell weird?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:47,117
- Okay. Let's go, let's go.
- All right.

38
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,525
Do you know
where RJ's summer pants are?

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,195
I have to put
an outfit on RJ. Where...

40
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,129
My summer pants?

41
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,464
Yeah, I'm looking
for your summer pants, buddy.

42
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,133
Emily.

43
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:12,301
We really should have
labeled the boxes.

44
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:14,636
I didn't realize that
we had this much stuff.

45
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:17,705
All right. Well, I guess he's just
gonna fry to death out there

46
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:20,374
'cause all we have is
like wintry, fleecy stuff.

47
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:23,143
I mean, I feel like we could
get rid of half this shit.

48
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:25,912
Yeah, well, you know.
Come on.

49
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,213
It's LA, dude.

50
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,647
It's every day sunshine.

51
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,783
Are you wearing that
to a child's birthday party?

52
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,487
- Oh, come on.
- It's little crazy at work.

53
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,355
I really want to get
a jump on things.

54
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:39,189
Really?

55
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,391
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Is that cool?

56
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,593
Honey.

57
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,696
I thought this was gonna be
like our chance to meet people.

58
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:47,763
Just this one time.

59
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:50,265
I mean, you go to work
and you talk to people.

60
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,666
- Honey.
- I don't talk to people.

61
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:53,434
- And it's weird.
- Alex...

62
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:54,568
I know.

63
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,102
- Like, I'm a grown-up person...
- -I know.

64
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:57,803
- ...like, going and...
- -I know.

65
00:02:57,805 --> 00:03:01,139
Am I supposed to just ask other
grownups if they want to be friends?

66
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,440
You could.

67
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,308
- You could start there.
- Sweetie, stop.

68
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,876
- You could.
- That's crazy.

69
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,143
It's not crazy.

70
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,445
I... Seriously, am I...
Am I seven years old?

71
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,679
You're not seven years old.

72
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,182
How do you not worry
about this stuff?

73
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:17,884
'Cause I don't need
anybody else.

74
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:20,219
I got everything I need
under this roof.

75
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:23,121
Well, that's
a nice thing to say.

76
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:24,822
Yeah, it's true.

77
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,692
All right. Well...

78
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:33,795
Good luck with the summer pants.

79
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,129
Stop saying summer pants.

80
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,463
It's your... It's your word.

81
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,598
No, it's not.
You started saying it first.

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,534
No. I think
they're called shorts.

83
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:47,638
Ah, why did I cut those off into shorts.
What am I doing?

84
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:50,840
My son looks like an idiot.

85
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,383
All right, fuck you, too.

86
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:10,253
Hey, bud.

87
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,287
You having fun?

88
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,822
- Not really.
- You wanna go home?

89
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,223
But I just got here.

90
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,290
- What?
- Hi!

91
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,592
- Hey.
- Hey, handsome boys.

92
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,560
- Hi.
- You came.

93
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,842
Look what I got.

94
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:25,695
What's in here?

95
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:27,196
- Oh, my God.
- Gummy worms.

96
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:29,831
- Gummy worms!
- Oh, jeez.

97
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,365
- See?
- Of course.

98
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,799
Look at that, huh?

99
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
Hi.

100
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:35,467
Hi.

101
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,202
Thank you for coming.

102
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:41,738
I know, I was just at work. I was feeling very guilty,
I wasn't getting any work done, so...

103
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,107
- I came to play.
- That's really nice.

104
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:46,409
- Really nice.
- Thanks.

105
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,710
Oh, my gosh.

106
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:51,846
That's what I'm talking about.
Gummy worms and kids, huh?

107
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:53,480
It's like chumming
the ocean for sharks.

108
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,347
- You're a genius.
- Yeah.

109
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:58,449
Hey, buddy.

110
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,417
Hold on. What's...
What's going on?

111
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,252
- Who's, um...
- I don't know.

112
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:03,319
What is this guy...

113
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,687
- Why...
- I don't know.

114
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,989
- Why is he talking to RJ?
- I don't know.

115
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:08,690
- Should you go talk to him?
- Should I?

116
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,024
- Maybe?
- I don't know.

117
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:11,592
I mean,
if he's gonna...

118
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,727
Oh, here he comes.
He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming.

119
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,861
- Hello.
- Hi.

120
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,362
- How are you?
- -Good.

121
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,197
Is that boy yours over there?

122
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,164
Yeah.

123
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,932
Well, I'm glad I caught this.

124
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,235
This, my friend, is a pest that
wreaks havoc in little boys' bellies.

125
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:27,037
I don't know where he got it from,
but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

126
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,505
Oh.

127
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,874
Well, thank you.
That would've been terrible if he ate it.

128
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,075
Yeah.

129
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:34,243
My son Max is
on a strict vegan diet.

130
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,245
- Oh.
- And a cleanse.

131
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:39,247
Just kidding. I'm Kurt.

132
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,716
- Hey, I'm Alex. This is Emily, my wife.
- Emily.

133
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,551
Emily, Alex, pleasure.
How are you?

134
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:45,653
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

135
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,857
So you guys part
of the birthday party or...

136
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,793
Oh, no, no.
This is our usual park.
We come here every day.

137
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:54,327
Oh, cool.

138
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,128
How about you? I haven't seen you in
the neighborhood You new around here?

139
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,230
Yeah, we just moved here
from Seattle.

140
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,965
- Two week in.
- Two weeks.

141
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:01,333
Wow. Well, welcome.

142
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:03,335
You guys picked the
coolest area in Los Angeles.

143
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:04,703
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

144
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,838
You know, we heard
that this is where

145
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,373
the younger people
with kids were living.

146
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,874
- This park's fucking fantastic.
- Uh-huh.

147
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,176
You've got two oyster bars.
One of which is the shit.

148
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:14,777
- That's great.
- Shops...

149
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,246
My wife and I moved here
about two years ago. We love it.

150
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:18,747
- Wow.
- Cool. Awesome.

151
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:19,948
That's great.

152
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,249
Wow.

153
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:23,417
Max has really taken
a shine to your boy.

154
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,353
He's very discerning,
doesn't make friends easily.

155
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:28,388
- RJ is actually the same way.
- Yeah.

156
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,555
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

157
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,877
Where's he going
to school in the fall?

158
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,658
Um...

159
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,727
Have you guys taken
your tours yet?

160
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,828
- Tours?
- Touring the schools?

161
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,964
Yeah.
Go around, look at them.

162
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,932
Okay. Well, I get a little
bit crazy about that stuff.

163
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,867
Yeah, another...
It's all coming up.

164
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,269
Just as long as you get
your applications in early, you'll be fine.

165
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,937
If you need a letter
of recommendation,

166
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,606
I'm sort of the mayor of this area,
so I can absolutely help you.

167
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:51,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

168
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:52,974
- Thanks.
- -Cool. Well...

169
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:55,942
- Emelia.
- Ah. Ooh.

170
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:59,145
- Alexander.
- All right.

171
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:00,813
So cool, you guys.

172
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:02,381
- This is so cool. Welcome.
- Yeah.

173
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:03,348
- Great.
- Great.

174
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,382
- Great people.
- All right.

175
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:05,449
All right. See you.

176
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,716
- Bye.
- See you.

177
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,585
You know,
we have more to discuss.

178
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:11,286
Tonight is our regular
pizza night.

179
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:13,821
We could turn it into a
"welcome to the neighborhood" get-together.

180
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:16,323
I can give you the one on one on
the schools in the area and...

181
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,924
It could be fun.

182
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:19,859
- Huh.
- -I'm just throwing it out there.

183
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:23,362
Uh, yeah, I mean, that's really nice,
but you shouldn't feel obligated.

184
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:24,863
- Obligated-shmobligated.
- -No.

185
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:27,732
Our boys seem to love each other
and we love making new friends.

186
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:29,100
It's not an obligation.
It's fun...

187
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:31,302
- You know, yes. Yeah.
- I...

188
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:33,704
That actually sounds like
a lot of fun, right?

189
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,272
Yeah. Sure.

190
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,540
And Alex was just talking this morning
about wanting to make new friends.

191
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,642
- Get out of here.
- -Mm-hmm.

192
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:43,511
Great. Well, why don't you come over at like
5:00, 5:30? We're at 1983 Cameron Court.

193
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,812
- Done. Thank you.
- Awesome.

194
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,213
- Awesome. Great.
- That's really nice.

195
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,114
- See you there.
- And listen, do not bring anything.

196
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:50,516
Just bring yourselves.
We have everything covered, okay? No cheating.

197
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:52,584
Going to Whole Foods now,
any dietary restrictions?

198
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:53,751
- I don't think so.
- Screw it.

199
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,086
You guys,
I'm so excited. Yay!

200
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:57,487
All right.

201
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,555
- See you later. Kurt.
- -Bye, buddy.

202
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:02,291
Wow, he seems cool.

203
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,960
Best case scenario,
I think we just made our first new friends.

204
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:05,961
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

205
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,062
Worst case?

206
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:09,964
We have a boring night
and we go home early.

207
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,536
- Whoa.
- Oh, wow.

208
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,471
That's a pretty nice house.

209
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:21,605
Up, please.

210
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:24,474
Oh, sweetie,
it's only a little bit further.

211
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:25,708
- Here. Will you take that?
- Yeah.

212
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,377
Okay. Come here.
Come here.

213
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,512
Want a little bit of a...

214
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:38,618
What have you been eating?
What's in your belly?

215
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,952
- What the fuck, hun?
- -Food!

216
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:40,919
Food?

217
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,401
- Honey.
- Yeah.

218
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,188
What?

219
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,058
This is Two-Buck Chuck.
We can't bring this to the dinner party.

220
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,426
Why?

221
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,327
Why? 'Cause it's two bucks.

222
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,829
It's what we had. I didn't think
it was gonna make a difference.

223
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:57,165
This is like what
19-year-olds cook with.

224
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,007
Oh, sweetie.
It's fine.

225
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:02,269
- It's fine, right?
- It's kind of a lame move.

226
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:06,172
I... I think what you're doing
right now is kind of a lame move.

227
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,542
- Hello!
- -Hey.

228
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,377
Welcome, new friends.
I'm Charlotte.

229
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,644
- Hi.
- You must be Alex.

230
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,712
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Okay. Thank you.

231
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,880
I'm just gonna kiss
your cheeks. Mmm.

232
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:18,747
Okay.

233
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,081
- And you must be Emily.
- Yes.

234
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,216
- Beauty! Whoo!
- Well, thank you.

235
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:23,517
Thank you for that.

236
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,051
Let that kid down.
We'll have them run free here.

237
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:26,886
All right. There we go.

238
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:31,056
Hello, sweet pea. Do you wanna
eat pizza until your belly explodes?

239
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,578
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

240
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:38,328
Oh, I know someone who's been
waiting to play with him all day long.

241
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,696
- Come on in, please.
- -Thank you.

242
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,664
Um, here you go.

243
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,798
This is from
a farm up north.

244
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,633
- It's our friend's farm.
- Wow!

245
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:46,768
Yeah, that's why there's no label,
'cause they recycle the bottles.

246
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,804
- Oh. Okay.
- So... It's organic.

247
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,640
Great. Wow.
Well, thank you so much, Alex.

248
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,008
- Great.
- Come on in.

249
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,477
The boys are just
finishing their homework.

250
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,978
I'm gonna get you
with my horse!

251
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,612
I'm gonna get you
with my horse!

252
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:01,580
All right, last one.
Last one.

253
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,682
<i>"Vamos a la biblioteca."</i>

254
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,517
<i>Biblioteca!</i>

255
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,318
- Right. Hey.
- -Hey.

256
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,752
<i>Bienvenudos,</i> guys.

257
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:11,520
<i>- Ciao.</i>
- Hey.

258
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,054
Kurt is speaking Spanish
with Max

259
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:16,457
in anticipation for some work
we're gonna be doing in Ecuador.

260
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,658
Oh, wow!
That's amazing.

261
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,259
Mm-hmm. But with me

262
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,661
- it's mostly French.
- Uh-huh.

263
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,995
You... So, you...
French and Spanish?

264
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,497
- Does that ever get confusing for him?
- No.

265
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,632
- Do the two...
- Keeps him on his toes.

266
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:31,301
I don't know if you guys noticed, but we've got a
seriously delicious situation developing here.

267
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:32,535
- Oh, yeah.
- Mmm, yum!

268
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:35,237
- You guys look great.
- Oh, thanks.

269
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,339
Hey, thank you again
for inviting us.

270
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,406
Oh, yeah.

271
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:39,707
Your house is gorgeous,
by the way.

272
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,508
- Thank you.
- It's beautiful.

273
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,378
I'm proud to say that Kurt designed
and rebuilt the entire thing himself.

274
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,579
Well...

275
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,280
It was just an ugly box
when we bought it.

276
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,248
Holy cow!

277
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,917
I actually based the entire design on Charlotte's
childhood home in the south of France.

278
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,720
Wow. So is that what you do?
You're an architect?

279
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:00,655
I've... I've lived
many lives, Alex.

280
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:06,293
I've been born, died and resurrected so many times,
I can't even tell you, but...

281
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:08,061
Can I show you
what my passion is now?

282
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:09,395
I'm really excited about it.

283
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:10,529
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

284
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:11,863
Then we'll do pizza.

285
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:19,636
Here, drink it.

286
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:23,739
- Yeah?
- Yeah, drink it, taste it.

287
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,174
- How does that taste?
- Oh. It's... It's really good.

288
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:29,043
Are you familiar with desalinization
through reverse osmosis?

289
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:30,843
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

290
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,344
- You are.
- -Um...

291
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:35,447
Remind me again
what, what it is.

292
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,283
So, that water that you're drinking
was processed through a filtering system

293
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:41,786
that I've been developing for the
past ten years. My own personal system.

294
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:44,522
What's wrong with a...
Like a normal filter?

295
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:48,759
They only last about 36 hours. After that
you're basically drinking liquid cancer.

296
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,694
- Mmm.
- But with my system,

297
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:55,231
we're essentially taking spoiled lemons
and making sweet, sweet lemonade.

298
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,133
Like that water that you're drinking
right there, that was initially sewage.

299
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,134
Pretty amazing, right?

300
00:11:59,136 --> 00:11:59,934
- Mmm.
- Oh.

301
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:02,770
Yeah.
So you see how far...

302
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:05,172
- Oh, no. Oh, no. Alex...
- Oh-oh.

303
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,941
Alex. Alex, it's beyond clean.
I would not give you disgusting water.

304
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:09,709
- He's just joking.
- I know he's kidding.

305
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,210
No, it's so good.

306
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:13,145
- Well, thank you.
- It's really good.

307
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:14,980
We already have our system set up in
some of the poorest parts of the world.

308
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:17,749
- Like your Cubas, your Northern Pakistans...
- Wow.

309
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,550
Your Central Republic
of Africas.

310
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:20,851
We're taking this bitch
village to village.

311
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:22,853
- Oh, my God, just...
- Before you can...

312
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,722
Sometimes the only way
to shut him is to kiss him.

313
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:27,956
That's not true.
Is that true?

314
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,891
- No, I mean...
- I stop talking.

315
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:31,592
I'm so proud of you, darling.

316
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,260
- I stop. I stop.
- I'm fucking hungry.

317
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:34,461
Okay.

318
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,628
Are you hungry?
I'm sure you are.

319
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,197
Are you guys fucking hungry?

320
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:39,719
- Sure.
- Yeah.

321
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,971
One more piece of pizza
for old tubby over here.

322
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:49,439
Oh...

323
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:51,474
Seriously, buddy, you don't
have to barf to show us you like the food.

324
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:53,342
Honey, he might have a point there.
I don't know.

325
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:55,477
Jesus, I feel like
I'm on<i> Intervention</i> or something.

326
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,046
Just let him have one more piece.
He's a growing boy.

327
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,848
- Thank you, Charlotte.
- You're welcome.

328
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,916
The pizza is yucky.

329
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:04,684
Doesn't look like
you thought it was yucky.

330
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,652
It's so good, you know what
it makes me think about?

331
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,387
What?

332
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,658
Isn't he the funniest?

333
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,326
You know what?

334
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,828
- Hold on, I just wanna say one thing.
- He's very funny.

335
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,497
I wanna say one thing.

336
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:23,300
You know, one of our main
worries coming here was

337
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,403
that we wouldn't be able to meet
new people or make new friends.

338
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,271
Um...

339
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:33,174
And I have to say that
tonight you guys really put that to bed.

340
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:34,708
- And, and, and...
- It's true.

341
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,910
- It is true.
- It's true. He's... Yeah.

342
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:40,947
- And I just wanna say, thank you for having us in your beautiful home.
- Thank you.

343
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:43,349
- Glad we could be of service. Cheers.
- So, thank you.

344
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:47,386
And, you know what,
speaking of being put to bed.

345
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:50,622
Yeah, I think we're hitting
the wall here energy-wise.

346
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,457
- Yeah, it's close.
- Yeah.

347
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,026
- It's gonna be all like the squirt's rules from here on out.
- Yeah.

348
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:57,194
RJ, are you ready
to say goodbye to Max?

349
00:13:57,196 --> 00:14:00,463
Only in America do we let
children dictate when the night is over.

350
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,266
Why don't we put the kids to
bed upstairs and continue down here?

351
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,201
Carry him home later,
once we're done.

352
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:07,602
- Yeah.
- What do you think?

353
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:08,736
This is a French house.

354
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:09,903
Yeah, it's a French house.

355
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:11,437
- Oh.
- I don't...

356
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:13,005
Well, we... No, we...
We'll just get out of your hair.

357
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,906
- We want you to stay.
- -It's fine.

358
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:16,841
We want it. We want it.

359
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:19,810
- I mean...
- Is that what...

360
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,578
- Yes.
- Settled then. All right.

361
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,446
I'm not done
with you two yet.

362
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:24,880
And as for you two kids.

363
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:28,183
You come with me upstairs
because I have got a surprise for you.

364
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:29,417
Do you like surprises?

365
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:30,951
- Me!
- Yes!

366
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,120
Give me 20 minutes
and I will give you parental bliss.

367
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:36,655
Come on, sit down.

368
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:37,989
- Wait for me!
- -I...

369
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,724
- What do you think?
- I mean...

370
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:43,060
...why not?

371
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:21,223
Can't sleep.

372
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:31,365
Kurt's got it. Just give it a second.
Trust me on this.

373
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,083
- Night night.
- Good night.

374
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,327
Un-fucking-believable.

375
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:14,398
Pretty amazing people,
huh, babe?

376
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,934
Best case scenario?

377
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:20,669
I love you.

378
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,697
Shh. Night night.

379
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,066
Sleep tight, boys.

380
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:04,471
You are a man
of many talents.

381
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:05,638
I am.

382
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,973
- I love you so much.
- Love you so much.

383
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,243
- So, Charlotte...
- You're the best.

384
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:16,080
You know, I'm realizing as we're sitting
here that we've been together all night

385
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,381
and I haven't yet asked you
what you...

386
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:19,282
- Oh, yeah.
- What you're up to these days?

387
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:21,083
Charlotte's between things
at the moment.

388
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:22,451
- Yeah. I am.
- Okay.

389
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:24,953
I mean, right now
my main job is mom.

390
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:27,655
Ah, most important job of all.
I know exactly what you're talking about.

391
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:28,989
Well, thank you Alex.
Thank you.

392
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:30,724
What do you...
What do you mean by that?

393
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,592
Oh. I just...
No, I just mean, like...

394
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:36,995
You know, I very much respect the mom job
because I've been at home with RJ and...

395
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:38,930
- Oh, really?
- -Um...

396
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,432
Yeah. I mean, I meant it as a compliment to,
you know, all the moms out there.

397
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,233
Yes, yes.

398
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:47,069
It's beautiful that you're making those
sacrifices so that Emily can pursue her career.

399
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,703
- Yeah.
- Oh, thanks.

400
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:52,606
But you need to find ways
to nurture your soul at the same time.

401
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,173
Oh.

402
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,341
And how do you do that, babe?

403
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,110
I have my hobbies.

404
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,645
Charlotte's working part time
as a masseuse.

405
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,746
Oh.

406
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,380
- Well, I'm dabbling.
- Yeah.

407
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:07,383
- That's cool.
- But, you know what? She's actually...

408
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:10,819
She's more than that.
Um, she's a fabulous actress.

409
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:13,054
- Really?
- Now, that is cool.

410
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,889
That's so nuts.

411
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:17,958
I swear to God, right when
I walked in here that's exactly...

412
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,726
Like I looked at you
and I thought,

413
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,894
"She's so beautiful, she must be
an actress or a model or something."

414
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,028
Oh, thank you.
You did?

415
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,195
And I was right!

416
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:26,163
I mean I haven't done it
in a long time.

417
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:27,898
- That's crazy.
- -Thank you.

418
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,468
It's hard because her French
agent is not here, so it's a little bit...

419
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,735
It is hard.

420
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,436
- We've never met a real actress before.
- We don't...

421
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,904
- Is there...
- You've never met an actor before?

422
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,405
- No!
- No. I don't think so.

423
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,540
I think this is our...
Yes, it's... It's our first...

424
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:43,476
- Is there anything that we might be able to see you in maybe?
- Yes! Yeah!

425
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:46,479
Um... No, we don't
have any...

426
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:50,249
- You do.
- I see... I think somebody might be giving it away.

427
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:58,923
- We're movie buffs.
- Yeah. We watch...

428
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,424
We've probably seen it, so...

429
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:01,925
I'm grabbing it.

430
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,192
- Yes!
- Yay.

431
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:06,161
See, this is truly
exciting for us. So...

432
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,762
Really, thank you.

433
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:10,231
I mean, I hope you're
not gonna be disappointed.

434
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,699
- Well, I don't think that's possible.
- No.

435
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:14,301
What are you talking about?
This is great stuff!

436
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:19,138
Fasten your seat belts.

437
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,208
We're really proud
of Charlotte's work in this one.

438
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,620
<i>So I think
if we just begin...</i>

439
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:39,521
<i>- Yeah?
- ...by opening your shirt. Do you mind?</i>

440
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,122
<i>- No. I don't.
- With me, right?</i>

441
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,623
<i>- It's all very simple, right?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

442
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,758
<i>- We just unbutton your shirt, right?
- Yeah.</i>

443
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,559
<i>- You could do it anywhere. Really.
- Okay.</i>

444
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,928
<i>- You could do it in a restaurant, at home, right?
- Yeah.</i>

445
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,298
<i>Okay, and if you wanna just bring
your breasts out for me, right?</i>

446
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,836
<i>And if you wanna start by massaging in some circular motions.
- Yeah?</i>

447
00:19:57,838 --> 00:20:05,838
<i>You wanna take your flanges or breast shields and
you just wanna place them right on your nipples.</i>

448
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:09,112
<i>Get just the perfect
latch there, right?</i>

449
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:12,148
<i>- Then you'll turn your machine on...
- Yeah.</i>

450
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,150
<i>And it will just start
sucking, right?</i>

451
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:18,986
<i>You wanna really...
See, if you don't feel...</i>

452
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:22,088
Well. You get the picture.

453
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,892
But I am proud to say that this
DVD was included with all the breast pumps

454
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:30,161
that this company sold
from 2005 to 2008.

455
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,329
That was a great plain breast pump.
You guys keep it.

456
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,198
- Oh, thanks.
- -It's a gift. Keep it.

457
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,500
So we'll take it
home with us?

458
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,568
Yeah. It's a gift.

459
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,836
- Watch it at your own leisure.
- -Thanks.

460
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:46,006
It was awesome.

461
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:47,540
Oh, please.
Thank you.

462
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,542
You looked very beautiful in it.

463
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:51,577
I mean, it's...
I tried to stay natural.

464
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:52,744
Huh.

465
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,512
It... It was very natural.

466
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,680
Wow. Well...

467
00:20:56,682 --> 00:20:58,581
Thank you, Alex.
I really appreciate that.

468
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,451
You know what? I've got the
perfect thing for this moment, right now.

469
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:04,519
Sweetie, would you get them
some more red wine?

470
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:06,621
- I'm gonna get something from upstairs.
- Okay. Yeah.

471
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:09,190
You guys, just chill.
Sweetie?

472
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,192
I'm gonna get some wine.
We have no more wine.

473
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:13,427
- Okay, that sounds like a great idea.
- Okay.

474
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,668
What?

475
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:25,537
Honey.

476
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:28,806
This is California. Maybe this
is what dinner parties are like.

477
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:30,607
How am I supposed to know?

478
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,542
I mean, up until then
it was fine.

479
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,243
- Like they were great, right?
- What was great?

480
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,912
- Kurt was playing music...
- They were great or her breasts were great?

481
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:39,613
Oh, please.

482
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:41,414
- I love your boobs.
- Oh, stop.

483
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,249
- I love your boobs very much.
- Stop.

484
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:47,186
Twelve months of breast feeding a child
has completely decimated my breasts.

485
00:21:47,188 --> 00:21:52,557
I worship them. I worship them like
they're two little Jesuses on your chest...

486
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,292
- Hey!
- -Hey.

487
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:57,595
I just checked on the boys.
They're just so cute.

488
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:58,429
Oh, great.

489
00:21:58,431 --> 00:21:59,930
They look like little brothers.

490
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:03,633
I mean, I'm so happy
to know that Max has a new buddy.

491
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:06,502
You guys smoke pot, right?

492
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:08,376
- No.
- Yeah.

493
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:16,943
Whoa!

494
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:18,744
Holy...
Holy cow!

495
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:22,179
- Wow!
- -Whoa!

496
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:25,682
See, I don't know if he knows
how to do it, the thing we...

497
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:27,816
Are you gonna
give it a shot?

498
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:34,454
Oh, honey.

499
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,060
You did it!

500
00:23:32,835 --> 00:23:34,000
Come here.

501
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:35,067
Can't see shit, man.

502
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:36,334
Here take my hand.

503
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:37,535
- You're all right?
- -Yeah.

504
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:38,836
- Hit your head?
- -No.

505
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:39,937
Okay, come here.

506
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:42,806
All right.

507
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:44,741
- Whoa.
- This is what I wanted to show you.

508
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:46,876
Is this like your
office or something?

509
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:49,044
I guess
you could say that. Here.

510
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:53,781
- Oh, wow!
- All this...

511
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:58,351
This is, uh,
how I keep my sanity.

512
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:03,154
Painting first entered my life
when I was around RJ and Max's age.

513
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:06,524
What started out as dipping
my fingers in the tips of the, uh,

514
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:08,825
acrylics blossomed
into all this.

515
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:15,429
- My refuge. It's how I can truly express myself.
- Huh.

516
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:21,667
Is that...
Is that what I think it is?

517
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,602
Very perceptive of you.

518
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:26,704
- That's...
- You can say it.

519
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,473
- A butt hole?
- -Yeah.

520
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:32,575
This series is called Portals.

521
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:35,177
Each of them painted from life.

522
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:38,246
I was lucky enough to have some of
my best friends donate the time as models.

523
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:40,728
Even Charlotte's
up here somewhere.

524
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:45,685
Fifty bucks if you can guess
which one's mine.

525
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:48,788
Butt hole?

526
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:51,723
Oh, well.

527
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,125
That one.

528
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,727
That's amazing.

529
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,395
Really? Is that...
That's... Huh. That's yours?

530
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,163
- That's me.
- Oh, great.

531
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,898
- That's me.
- That's great.

532
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,220
Do you paint?

533
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:07,970
- Yeah. No.
- -Hmm.

534
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,672
I always wanted to, though, because
I always felt like, you know...

535
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:13,707
I always felt
like I could.

536
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:14,474
Yeah.

537
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,442
Um, like I feel like
if I did it,

538
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:18,510
it would be, um, really...

539
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:20,511
Great.

540
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:21,845
- No question.
- Yeah.

541
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:24,647
- Do you think...
- I think there's never...

542
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,683
- Never an excuse not to try this.
- Yeah?

543
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,618
'Cause these are amazing.

544
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,187
I think you could do it. And if you ever want,
you can borrow some of my acrylics.

545
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:35,156
- Really?
- I got everything here.
You can come paint with me.

546
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,757
I can come here
and paint with you?

547
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,726
Bring RJ over, let him play upstairs,
we could sit out here and paint.

548
00:25:39,728 --> 00:25:42,328
You know what,
I'm gonna start painting.

549
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,762
I think I'm gonna
start painting.

550
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:45,530
- You are painting. You are painting.
- I'm gonna...

551
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:46,697
I'm gonna be a painter.

552
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,832
You are a painter.
You're great.

553
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,501
I feel like I just, like,
made a decision.

554
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:53,169
- Really?
- Yeah.

555
00:25:53,171 --> 00:25:55,037
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.

556
00:25:56,506 --> 00:26:01,242
Oh, my God,
this house is just amazing!

557
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:04,078
I mean, I'm...
I'm lost already.

558
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,712
You'll get used to it.

559
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,813
- This is my bedroom.
- Okay.

560
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:11,116
Wow!

561
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,751
Whoa!

562
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:18,254
Oh, my God!

563
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:23,792
These cookies are

564
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:27,962
so incredible right now.

565
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:30,097
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

566
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:33,266
I love these cookies.

567
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,134
You know, you can't
find them in France.

568
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:36,601
No.

569
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:39,470
And there's so many
ways to eat them.

570
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,872
Mmm. So many tasty combinations.

571
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:49,144
You know, I never thought
that I would be surrounded by boys.

572
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:53,548
Hmm. I know the feeling.

573
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,283
- Don't get me wrong.
- Mmm-hmm.

574
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,518
I love it.
I think it's great.

575
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,886
I just think that it can be

576
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:04,089
just downright kind of
nasty sometimes. Like...

577
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:09,893
I really find myself
craving feminine energy.

578
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,964
What's this area?

579
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,800
This is just another
creative spot in the place.

580
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,069
- Um, it's a photography zone.
- Oh, cool.

581
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:25,005
It's where I take all the pictures
of the models who come in to, uh...

582
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:27,340
The people that pose for the...

583
00:27:27,342 --> 00:27:30,609
Yeah, they come in,
take the photos, print the photos.

584
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,344
I can blow them up
to any size I want,

585
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,913
'cause as you can see,
it's extremely detailed.

586
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:36,748
- You just paint based off of the photos?
- Yeah.

587
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,783
- That makes sense, yeah.
- Yeah.

588
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,385
Or I'll have them come in
and take pictures of me.

589
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:42,853
Oh, right, when you...

590
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:44,888
Yeah, a lot of them
are self portraits.

591
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:51,159
You want my advice, Emily?

592
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:52,460
Yeah.

593
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,963
You need to create
your own space.

594
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:58,998
One that is only yours.

595
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:03,301
- Mine, is this bedroom.
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:06,743
And Kurt's okay with that?
He's okay with all the girly stuff in here?

597
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:08,737
Ah, no, no, no, no.

598
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:11,239
This isn't Kurt's bedroom
at all.

599
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,773
No. This is<i> my</i> bedroom.

600
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:16,342
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just assumed that you guys were...

601
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,011
It's totally fine, you know.

602
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:23,015
It, it all started with him taking too
much time in the bathroom and then

603
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:26,618
I couldn't sleep with
his breathing noises but it's,

604
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,253
it's all for the best.
I love it.

605
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:30,387
- You love it?
- Mmm.

606
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,823
So you sleep in here alone?

607
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:37,325
This bedroom is mine.
It's only mine.

608
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:39,060
Mm-hmm.

609
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:42,463
And there are things that I do in my
bedroom that no one needs to know about.

610
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,367
You know you've got
a really great look.

611
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:51,003
- Uh...
- Anybody ever tell you that?

612
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:53,171
No.

613
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:55,573
You gotta a really neat thing
going on.

614
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:57,508
Mind if I snap a couple?

615
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,909
Um...

616
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:02,078
I think I might
need some direction or...

617
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,560
You don't. Just do whatever
you were just doing. It was great.

618
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:06,801
- Really?
- Yeah.

619
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:08,415
That's great. Relax.

620
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,083
- Like that?
- Yeah.

621
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,451
- Wait.
- Okay.

622
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,255
Your shirt's kind of blending in with the backdrop.
Would you take it off, please?

623
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,737
- My shirt?
- Yeah

624
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,859
All right.

625
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:29,063
You know, I would put money
on my husband just being

626
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,065
passed out on the floor
right now.

627
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:35,268
He usually has a bit of trouble
keeping it together when he smokes weed.

628
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,336
Oh, he seemed fine to me.

629
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:40,138
We'll see.

630
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,206
- One time in college...
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:46,576
...he thought that he was breathing
out of his ears and he had a panic attack.

632
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,578
Be careful. Careful.

633
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,946
I'm serious.
He did that.

634
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:51,013
- Like that?
- That's great, yeah.

635
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:52,647
That feels weird, like...

636
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:55,016
But you know what,
it's weird in real life, it's great on camera.

637
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:56,717
Yeah. You're looking for...

638
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,918
...Hey!

639
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,419
- Oh, hey, guys. Hi.
- -Hey!

640
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:00,620
Hey.

641
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:02,488
- Um, what's up?
- -See?

642
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,890
I told you that he was gonna...
It's okay. Don't worry.

643
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:06,224
- What's up?
- Hey.

644
00:30:06,226 --> 00:30:07,858
What are you...

645
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,160
- What are you guys...
- What we were doing was
just getting to the good part.

646
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:12,962
You were getting to the good part?
What does that mean?

647
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:14,396
Oh, it's okay.
It's just painting.

648
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,866
Yeah, hun, did you know
that Kurt was a painter?

649
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:19,634
- No!
- Painted all these beautiful paintings. Yeah.

650
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:20,935
I didn't know that.

651
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,304
And, uh, he's a
photographer too, which is...

652
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:24,772
Why were you on the ground?

653
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:28,175
There's nothing to worry about, Emily.
We were just free styling.

654
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:30,657
- We got into a mood and just went with it.
- Yeah.

655
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:32,678
You're ridiculous.

656
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,845
Hey.

657
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:35,379
I've got a proposal to make.

658
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:39,916
My proposal's this.

659
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:44,286
That swimming pool out there has about 10,000
gallons of the freshest filtered water imaginable.

660
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:47,188
You can drink it.
It's got healing powers.

661
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,525
Now I think we all need to get in that pool
and let the fucking healing begin.

662
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,361
- I mean, who's with me? What do you guys think?
- I am with you.

663
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:57,330
- Come on!
- Come on, guys! Let's go!

664
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:58,812
- Come on.
- Okay.

665
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:00,399
Hey!

666
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,507
Whoa!

667
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,342
Whoa!

668
00:31:12,344 --> 00:31:14,177
Oh, whoa!

669
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,611
I'm coming, baby.

670
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:16,845
Come on, you guys.

671
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,179
- Normally, we would...
- -Yeah.

672
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:19,680
We forgot to bring
our suits with us.

673
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:21,514
No suits in the house,
<i>au naturel.</i>

674
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,150
Oh, my...

675
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:27,118
- Okay.
- -Feels so good.

676
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,987
You've got good form
on that, um...

677
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,256
I don't know.

678
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,157
- There's nothing to discuss. House rules.
- Um...

679
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,692
All right, we'll probably come in.
We, we just need to, like...

680
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:38,959
- Take a minute.
- Um...

681
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,393
Just... We just need
to take a minute.

682
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:43,162
We're gonna have
a conversation, super quick.

683
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,164
Okay, look. Listen,

684
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,699
I'm like super fucked up
right now.

685
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:48,800
I know.

686
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:50,234
- Are you fucked up?
- Yeah.

687
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:51,969
Come in here.

688
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:55,539
I... I need to talk to
you about something serious.

689
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,908
What? What's going on?

690
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,310
I can't go skinny dipping
with them.

691
00:32:00,312 --> 00:32:03,079
Why? I think it'll be
very exciting,

692
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:06,482
to be in the water with
Charlotte's ta-tas.

693
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:08,444
That's not what
I'm talking about and you know it.

694
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:13,688
I... You know, I can't... You know what...
You know what I'm talking about.

695
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,356
Oh, oh-oh-oh.

696
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:16,918
- Well...
- Honey.

697
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:23,381
How many times do I have
to reassure you about that?

698
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:27,298
Come on, guys.

699
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,133
This isn't the G8 Summit.

700
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:34,603
It wouldn't be so bad if we just
have to see his giant goddamn horse cock.

701
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,245
- You know?
- It's pretty big.

702
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:38,906
It's really, really big.

703
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,274
- Listen.
- Okay.

704
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:45,111
Listen,
if you're uncomfortable,

705
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:49,281
I will absolutely
follow your lead.

706
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:50,982
Okay.

707
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:53,551
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

708
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:55,152
Well, I'm not going to.

709
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,588
So, we talked and, um...

710
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,491
We don't wanna disrespect
your house rules, but...

711
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:03,792
We are not French.

712
00:33:03,794 --> 00:33:05,727
- No.
- So we've never done this before...

713
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:09,430
- Ever.
- And we, we're just hoping that underwear is...

714
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:11,198
Because that's as good
as we can...

715
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,500
Yeah. So we hope, we hope
that that's okay with you guys.

716
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:18,203
Absolutely, as long as
it's negotiable.

717
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:23,007
What are you doing?

718
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:25,121
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

719
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:26,622
- I'm fine.
- Should we race?

720
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:27,756
Go.

721
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,935
I feel weird.
Who's pool is this?

722
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:44,269
All right,
that's a joke.

723
00:34:45,804 --> 00:34:47,237
I don't know
if that's...

724
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:51,374
I'm okay! I'm okay!

725
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:53,976
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa! Whoa, buddy.

726
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:55,711
Overboard. Over...

727
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:57,579
- Alex!
- Charlotte, help me.

728
00:34:57,581 --> 00:35:00,782
I've got you, Alex.
I've got you. Come.

729
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,686
I've got you.
I've got you, Alex.

730
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,955
It's okay. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

731
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:10,356
I've got you, Alex.

732
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,624
- Honey, are you...
- Oh, God.

733
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:14,092
Everything is gonna be fine.

734
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:15,293
Are you okay?

735
00:35:15,295 --> 00:35:17,361
God. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

736
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:19,463
- It's okay. Don't worry. It's fine.
- I'm so sorry.

737
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:22,933
Hey. Hey, stop that nonsense. You think it's the
first time somebody has yacked near the pool?

738
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:24,067
No, it's not.

739
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:26,436
Honey, you wanna
go home, honey?

740
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,971
No. I wanna stay here forever.

741
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:32,507
Are you sure, honey?
I think you kinda almost died in the pool.

742
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:35,276
I ruined everything.
I don't wanna be a party pooper.

743
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:36,777
No, you didn't.

744
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:38,678
No, he's right.
He doesn't wanna be a party pooper.

745
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,579
You know what?
I've got the perfect thing for you.

746
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:42,647
We're gonna get you cleaned up
and calmed down, okay?

747
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:44,930
- Yeah.
- Let's get him up, let's get him up over here.

748
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:47,217
Oh, thanks, man.

749
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:50,153
Oh, sweetie. Are you sure, are
you sure that's a good idea?

750
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:51,621
Yeah, puke and rally.

751
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,623
- Remember?
- Right.

752
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:58,626
Puke and rally was our slogan
in college. First year, puke and rally.

753
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:02,562
That's my guy, everybody.
Mr. Puke and Rally.

754
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:06,465
Just do us a favor, okay?
And if you're...

755
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:12,270
Listen to your body, and if you're starting to feel
like you might throw up again just let us all know.

756
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:13,304
- Okay.
- -Okay?

757
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,472
Okay. I will listen
to my body.

758
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:16,972
Thanks, honey.

759
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,240
Hey, can I say something?

760
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,542
Something's been bothering me.
I don't, I don't mean to offend you,

761
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:24,104
I only say this
out of concern.

762
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:26,592
What's with
the whole nudity thing?

763
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:30,549
Yeah. I, I hope
it's not because of us, is it?

764
00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:33,351
Oh, no, no, no.
You guys are great.

765
00:36:33,353 --> 00:36:35,052
- Okay.
- What is it, man?

766
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:38,021
I just feel like there's some
kind of a weird judgment going on.

767
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:39,455
No, there is no judgment.

768
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:40,823
No judgment at all.

769
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,457
No. It's just, uh...

770
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,826
It's my problem.

771
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,928
- I... No.
- It is.

772
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,396
I wouldn't call it a problem.

773
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:51,197
Honey, you don't have
to cover for me.

774
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,934
It's not a problem,
it's just that we're not totally comfortable.

775
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:56,902
It's not her problem.
Okay. It's...

776
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:59,638
- You don't have to do this.
- No, it's me. I have a body issue.

777
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,040
- Honey, you don't...
- Why wouldn't I do this?

778
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:04,075
- I don't... I just...
- What?

779
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:05,409
We don't know, you know.

780
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,078
We don't know what?
We don't know where we are?

781
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,746
I know where I am.
I'm in a hot tub.

782
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:13,249
- I do know that, too.
- And I'm in with these wonderful people.

783
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:16,418
And why not say
I have a body issue?

784
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,487
I just say...
You just say the words, you know?

785
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:23,657
- What's the issue?
- Yeah.

786
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:29,429
I have an abnormally small dick.

787
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:36,302
- I have an abnormally small dick!
- Okay, uh-huh.

788
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:39,104
- Sweetheart...
- I do. It's...

789
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,773
- As long as I can remember.
- -Hey...

790
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:43,241
Tiny dick. There it is.

791
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:44,809
That's okay, man.

792
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:46,944
Is it Kurt? Really?

793
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,815
I've seen your dick, man. I don't think
you know what I'm talking about.

794
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,250
Okay?

795
00:37:55,252 --> 00:37:56,951
No, no...

796
00:37:56,953 --> 00:38:01,221
Well, Alex, what Kurt means to
say is that you're in a safe place.

797
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,723
You can talk to us.

798
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:08,227
Honey, you know
that it doesn't mean anything to me.

799
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:09,494
It doesn't matter to me.

800
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,396
Oh, right, 'cause
the circles, right?

801
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:16,633
I make circles, everything is okay.
It's like I have a big old ding dong.

802
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:21,570
I've... All I have to do
is take it and move it around in circles,

803
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:23,939
and it's like
it's like that big.

804
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,407
- Honey.
- Is that...

805
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:28,342
- Honey...
- Right? That's what this is about, right?

806
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,878
Because of circles
all our problems are solved.

807
00:38:35,715 --> 00:38:37,882
Sorry, guys. I'm...

808
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,351
Hey, Alex?

809
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,419
- What?
- There's nothing to be sorry about.

810
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,187
- We all love you.
- We do.

811
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,470
You don't have
to hold this anymore.

812
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:51,992
You know,

813
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:56,395
I didn't even know it was small
until middle school.

814
00:38:57,196 --> 00:38:58,629
Like...

815
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:05,401
In PE class I would just see
guys changing and I would...

816
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:07,936
Like I knew something was wrong.

817
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,971
But I didn't...

818
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,239
Like I asked my parents
about it and they were like,

819
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:17,676
"Well, you'll hit puberty
and it will grow."

820
00:39:17,678 --> 00:39:18,843
You know?

821
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:22,646
But it just... It didn't.
It never did. It never grew.

822
00:39:22,648 --> 00:39:27,483
So I still have this,
like, dick from middle school

823
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:30,952
on my body.

824
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:43,931
I'm so goddamn
proud of you right now.

825
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:54,271
You have a spark in you.

826
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:57,040
I saw it the first time I laid eyes on you,
all right? You've got a...

827
00:39:57,042 --> 00:40:01,176
It's like you have a blinding aura of goodness
and love surrounding you at all times.

828
00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:03,111
- It fucking follows you around.
- Oh, come on.

829
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:06,280
I'm not just waxing your car here, man.
You've got something special.

830
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,682
You need to share
with the world.

831
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,616
- Okay.
- See that girl over there?

832
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,952
She loves you for who you are,
with every sense of her being.

833
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:17,088
You guys are gonna grow old
and die together on a porch somewhere.

834
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,522
I mean, it's big.

835
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:19,589
Yeah.

836
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,757
And there is a wild card
in the situation too.

837
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:24,693
If I know my wife,
I can tell when she likes someone

838
00:40:24,695 --> 00:40:27,195
- and she thinks you're the bee's knees.
- Really?

839
00:40:27,197 --> 00:40:29,997
Yeah, everybody...
You're loved.

840
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:32,866
I want you to stop moping
around like a little bitch,

841
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:38,771
you take that thing, you own it, you get the fuck out
there and you show me what the fuck you're made out of.

842
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,109
You're a stud!
You're a stud horse, Alex.

843
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,344
- Don't you ever forget that.
- Okay.

844
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:47,511
- All right?
- Okay.

845
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:50,247
- I'm serious.
- Yeah. I'm a stud horse.

846
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:51,982
You're a stud horse.

847
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:55,452
Ladies and ladies, can I have
your full attention, please?

848
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,387
Whoo!

849
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:01,257
Girls, get the biggest towel you got, 'cause
your pussies are about to be dripping wet.

850
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:07,161
Prepare yourselves
to bear witness to the beautiful,

851
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:09,897
the lovely, the one, the only...

852
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,299
Alex!

853
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:48,626
Woo-hoo!

854
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:56,265
Yes, yes, yes!

855
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:07,775
Whoo!

856
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:09,076
Oh, my God!

857
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,610
- Yes!
- Yes!

858
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,111
That was fucking fun!

859
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,579
Thank you! Thanks!

860
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:15,413
Whoo!

861
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:17,180
Your husband
is a really great man.

862
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:21,883
Yes! Whoo!

863
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:25,852
Whoo!

864
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,641
I feel like I just gave
birth to myself.

865
00:42:55,677 --> 00:42:56,810
And...

866
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,612
- Honey...
- Yeah?

867
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:05,016
I am very happy for you

868
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:11,221
that you were able to have your little,
you know, like, breakthrough over there,

869
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:15,024
but I think we've reached
that point in the evening

870
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:20,261
where we should leave
before anything crazy happens.

871
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:23,564
- What are you talking about? We can't leave.
- Sweetie...

872
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:28,001
I'm just telling you
this because I don't think

873
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:30,370
that you'll firing on
all cylinders right now.

874
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:35,074
I'm not only firing on all cylinders, I am
firing on cylinders I didn't even know I had.

875
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:39,611
Honey, I'm pretty sure that
we have moved from, uh,

876
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:44,848
free wheeling, sort of California vibe
to more of a swinger vibe.

877
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,916
That's what it feels like to me.

878
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:52,020
Oh! No, I... I don't...
think so at all, like...

879
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,655
I mean, I, I...

880
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:57,157
I really went through
something over there.

881
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,293
Feel like more confident
than I've ever felt in my entire life.

882
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:03,861
It's... It's... It's...

883
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:07,097
It feels so good, hun.

884
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:10,500
Well, I mean, of course,
you're feeling good right now.

885
00:44:10,502 --> 00:44:13,069
You're drunk and you're stoned.

886
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:15,137
Well, you're drunk
and stoned, too.

887
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:21,275
I am drunk and stoned, but I am not the one
who was dancing around with my pants off.

888
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:24,244
Well, there you go.
Maybe that's the problem.
Maybe that's what you should do.

889
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:28,648
- Excuse me?
- Maybe you should get naked.

890
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:34,019
Alex, I don't really think that this is
a box you want to open right now.

891
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:40,091
Okay, what I'm saying is I...
I love my dick.

892
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:44,361
- Okay.
- Do you understand how big a deal it is for me to say that?

893
00:44:44,363 --> 00:44:47,196
- Okay.
- Like I really feel that. Like I love it.

894
00:44:49,032 --> 00:44:51,099
I mean, Kurt

895
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:56,003
brought me to this place where I can actually say
something like that, and that's, that's huge!

896
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:59,172
You think I want to leave
this place right now?

897
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:01,307
That's crazy. I mean,
I feel like this is

898
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:06,311
so good for our sex life,
for our everything.

899
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,679
Emily...

900
00:45:08,681 --> 00:45:10,981
I am expanding tonight.

901
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:16,218
Maybe you should expand too.
It might be good for you.

902
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,488
We're out, guys.
Looks like we're gonna need a booze run.

903
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,122
Emily, you wanna come with?

904
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,891
- Yeah.
- -I know a place that's open all night.

905
00:45:24,893 --> 00:45:26,058
Okay.

906
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,527
Will you get me
something brown and hardcore?

907
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:31,829
I think I'm going for the hard stuff now.
It's that time of night.

908
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,708
Char, there's like five
bottles of whiskey back there.

909
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,776
Yeah. I know.

910
00:45:50,244 --> 00:45:51,677
Are you coming?

911
00:45:57,316 --> 00:46:00,284
We're in our most downward
facing dog style positions.

912
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:03,487
Somehow she's able to reach
around and do it from the back.

913
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:06,189
- I mean, that is an extremely flexible woman.
- No doubt.

914
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:09,458
Yeah, I could only last three or
four minutes before I lost it completely.

915
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,962
It was like her pussy
was grabbing me.

916
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:15,897
I hate to throw her
under the bus.

917
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,832
- You've never seen anything like it before.
- Oh, my God!

918
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:22,335
I feel like crazy, nasty sex is a mandatory
class at French college or something.

919
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,203
- Whoa!
- I mean...

920
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:26,938
There's nothing
we haven't tried.

921
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,375
Charlotte, why am
I driving your car?

922
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:34,810
Oh! I don't know how to drive.

923
00:46:34,812 --> 00:46:35,844
Oh.

924
00:46:37,413 --> 00:46:40,247
- Are you gonna tell me where we're going?
- It's a secret.

925
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,652
- Now, you're like me. You're a married man.
- Oh, yeah!

926
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:48,320
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, totally.

927
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:51,523
It's like that expression,
"Show me a guy with a beautiful wife,

928
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:53,992
I'll show you a guy who's tired
to making love to her."

929
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:56,314
I think what I'm trying
to say is that...

930
00:46:57,762 --> 00:47:01,765
I mean, isn't it okay for us
to fantasize at this stage

931
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:05,968
in our lives and relationships?
I mean, aren't we entitled to a little bit of that?

932
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:08,069
Yeah.

933
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:10,838
It's okay for you to want to
think about doing other things

934
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,106
and in some cases,

935
00:47:13,108 --> 00:47:15,548
consider doing those things.

936
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:17,408
Right.

937
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:19,209
You know.

938
00:47:20,744 --> 00:47:22,978
- You only live once.
- Yeah.

939
00:47:29,618 --> 00:47:30,985
This way.

940
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:08,719
OK. I've got something
to show you.

941
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:11,921
All you've gotta do
is look through here.

942
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,724
I'll be quick.

943
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,229
Charlotte, you're not gonna tell me
what the fuck is going on right now?

944
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,265
Shh! Don't ruin the surprise.

945
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,000
What surprise?

946
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:27,601
Charlotte, where are you going?

947
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,371
This is pretty weird.

948
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:33,806
Charlotte? Charlotte?

949
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:39,711
Are you fucking...
Are you kidding me?

950
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:42,046
Charlotte? Charlotte?

951
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,442
I-I knew you wouldn't come if
I had told you where we were going.

952
00:49:56,444 --> 00:49:58,377
I'm kind of out of my mind
right now, Charlotte.

953
00:49:58,379 --> 00:50:02,080
I mean, that was... That was...
That was nuts, what happened in there, right?

954
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,949
Try being married for ten years,
and then you'll tell me what's nuts.

955
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:10,087
That doesn't make any sense to me.
I've seen you guys together.
You have insane sex chemistry.

956
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:11,988
I wish.

957
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,023
I mean...

958
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:17,592
- Does Kurt know about this?
- No.

959
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:19,026
Why should he?

960
00:50:20,328 --> 00:50:22,829
It wouldn't change anything.

961
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:24,711
Anyway, it's a bummer, 'cause...

962
00:50:25,598 --> 00:50:30,300
Kurt has a lot to offer.
As I'm sure, you saw.

963
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:31,534
Yeah.

964
00:50:32,669 --> 00:50:35,470
You know I'm the only guy
Emily's ever been with?

965
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:37,438
- No shit?
- Yeah.

966
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,741
I mean, I guess she's satisfied. I mean, she says
she has everything she needs under one roof, so...

967
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:44,710
What?

968
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:46,478
- Come on. You're not...
- What?

969
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:49,413
Well, it's just, you know...

970
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:55,584
Well, a woman is always gonna
wonder what's going on next to her.

971
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:58,420
They're just sometimes
scared to admit it.

972
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,522
Scared to open that
delicious little box.

973
00:51:03,091 --> 00:51:05,959
What took so long?
Was the journey a success?

974
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:11,430
Yeah. The place I usually go to was closed,
so, we had to bounce around a bit.

975
00:51:11,432 --> 00:51:13,832
All right.
Did you get the stuff?

976
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:16,034
- Yeah, I did.
- Let's see.

977
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:18,803
- Hey.
- Hi.

978
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:20,337
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

979
00:51:21,138 --> 00:51:23,038
- Honey. Honey.
- What?

980
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,641
- There's some seriously weird shit just went down out there.
- What now?

981
00:51:26,643 --> 00:51:28,776
What do you... What do you mean,
"What now?"

982
00:51:28,778 --> 00:51:33,046
I mean, you think everything's
weird tonight. So, what now?

983
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,516
- I don't think everything's weird tonight.
- You know what?

984
00:51:36,518 --> 00:51:38,718
- You brought me to California, okay?
- Uh-huh.

985
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,854
So I'm trying to make the best
of it and you're just shitting all over it.

986
00:51:41,856 --> 00:51:43,188
- Alex.
- What?

987
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,190
Alex, you're really being
kind of a dick right now.

988
00:51:45,192 --> 00:51:47,125
I'm trying...

989
00:51:47,127 --> 00:51:48,559
<i>Daddy, Mama!</i>

990
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:50,494
You know what?
Don't worry about it. I'll get it.

991
00:51:50,496 --> 00:51:52,662
- Okay.
- -Daddy will get that.

992
00:51:52,664 --> 00:51:54,030
- You sure?
- Yeah.

993
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:56,165
All right. You go boy!

994
00:51:56,167 --> 00:52:00,268
Hey, if it's Max who's crying and he doesn't
remember you, just remind him who you are.

995
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:03,136
Emily, can I get
you a stiff one?

996
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:07,072
Please.

997
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:31,228
Oh, my God!

998
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,662
Is everything okay?

999
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:36,132
Yeah. Yes.
It's fine.

1000
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:38,033
Can I talk to you?

1001
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:40,435
Mm-hmm. Of course.

1002
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:42,635
Come and sit on my bed.

1003
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:46,604
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1004
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:47,905
Okay.

1005
00:52:47,907 --> 00:52:49,106
Right now?

1006
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:51,207
Huh.

1007
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,976
This is, uh...
You got a couch and a...

1008
00:52:53,978 --> 00:52:57,745
Like a love seat type thing,
I think that's... It must be handy...

1009
00:52:59,414 --> 00:53:00,781
Yeah, yeah.

1010
00:53:00,783 --> 00:53:05,485
You know, depending
on what mood you're in, I guess, for...

1011
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:09,989
For reading a novel or something,
I would imagine it's really cozy.

1012
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:12,257
Yeah, and you're wearing
the perfect outfit.

1013
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:13,992
This cozy robe.

1014
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:15,927
That's right.

1015
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:18,729
And these ones here, they just
came to me in a dream one night.

1016
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:20,664
What happened was like,
I woke up one morning

1017
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:24,467
- and bam, a voice fucking yelling in my ears.
- Kurt...

1018
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:31,507
- Yes, ma'am?
- I don't wanna talk about your paintings any more.

1019
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:34,343
- What do you wanna talk about?
- I wanna talk about you.

1020
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,511
And I wanna talk
about your wife.

1021
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,714
And I wanna talk about
what is going on here.

1022
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,716
Okay.

1023
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:43,583
What do you do?

1024
00:53:43,585 --> 00:53:47,753
You are a salesman
of water filters?

1025
00:53:47,755 --> 00:53:50,522
And you can somehow
afford this house doing that?

1026
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:53,691
Or do you make all this money
selling these paintings?

1027
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:57,528
Which, Kurt, I've gotta say,
what are they?

1028
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,162
Are they supposed to be
close-ups of assholes or what?

1029
00:53:59,164 --> 00:54:01,731
That's so funny. Both you and
your husband got that immediately.

1030
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:02,832
Huh.

1031
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:05,568
I feel like I need to clear
some things up for you.

1032
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:09,905
Yes. Please do.
Clarity sounds just great to me.

1033
00:54:09,907 --> 00:54:12,941
In some places, Nordic places,

1034
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:16,477
where the winters are cold
and long and it gets dark early,

1035
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:19,479
people like to
masturbate to this.

1036
00:54:20,314 --> 00:54:22,748
And not only this,

1037
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,752
but lots of the titles that we have
available on our<i> Mommy's Milk</i> series.

1038
00:54:38,665 --> 00:54:44,168
<i>I'm here to present you the
new Breast Pumpadella 2000.</i>

1039
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:49,205
You know, I can see in Kurt's
eyes that he really enjoys both of you.

1040
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,674
Especially you.

1041
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:53,116
- Yeah?
- Mm.

1042
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,411
I think you're gonna
be his new buddy.

1043
00:54:56,413 --> 00:54:59,347
- That's great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1044
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:01,882
Emily and I are gonna
be buddies too.

1045
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:03,250
Don't you think so?

1046
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:06,453
Yeah.
I mean, I hope so.

1047
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:09,656
I'm sorry if she's like...

1048
00:55:09,658 --> 00:55:12,191
- Like tight or something.
- Mm-hmm.

1049
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:14,159
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes, a little bit.

1050
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:15,493
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1051
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:19,362
I mean, I've been
encouraging her to loosen up.

1052
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:20,663
Yeah.

1053
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:22,765
- But there's only so much you can do, you know.
- Yeah.

1054
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:25,567
- Yeah, I can totally understand that.
- Yeah.

1055
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:26,668
Yeah.

1056
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:29,003
But, uh...

1057
00:55:29,005 --> 00:55:31,105
Yeah, 'cause
I really like her.

1058
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:32,239
Oh, cool!

1059
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:34,841
That's great.

1060
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:41,446
- I really like her.
- Cool, cool, cool. Yeah. Yeah.

1061
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:44,815
- Well...
- And I like you too, Alex.

1062
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:46,449
Yeah. Thanks.

1063
00:55:47,918 --> 00:55:49,985
- Do you like me?
- Yeah.

1064
00:55:51,354 --> 00:55:53,487
Yeah. I mean, you know...

1065
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:00,692
- Do you find me attractive?
- Yeah.

1066
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,193
- Yeah?
- Sure, yeah.

1067
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,628
- Really?
- Yeah.

1068
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:08,865
Of course. I mean,
you're very attractive.

1069
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,901
Do you think that, um,

1070
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:17,372
if we weren't already married,
that I could be someone, uh,

1071
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,073
with whom you'd wanna have sex?

1072
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,112
Uh, well...

1073
00:56:27,614 --> 00:56:28,714
Yes.

1074
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:33,384
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm?

1075
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:38,921
But, you know, we can't, so...

1076
00:56:39,756 --> 00:56:40,889
Mm.

1077
00:56:43,592 --> 00:56:47,794
<i>The milk is then filtered
from the breast shield</i>

1078
00:56:48,328 --> 00:56:50,796
<i>into the retainer.</i>

1079
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:53,865
<i>What we have produced,
so beautiful.</i>

1080
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:58,201
<i>Nurturing milk</i>

1081
00:56:58,203 --> 00:57:01,170
<i>for the little baby to enjoy.</i>

1082
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:03,338
- Kurt...
- <i>Ah, Sun Tzu.</i>

1083
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,773
This is pretty fucked up.

1084
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:10,978
Come on, Emily. The internet's a
vast sea of depravity. You know that.

1085
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,681
What we're producing simply fulfills a
niche without anybody getting hurt.

1086
00:57:14,683 --> 00:57:17,750
- No harm, no foul...
- So you're telling me

1087
00:57:17,752 --> 00:57:23,655
that there are hundreds
of strange Nordic men masturbating

1088
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:26,124
to your wife and
you have no problem with that?

1089
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:27,891
No, I don't.

1090
00:57:30,227 --> 00:57:34,663
And Charlotte has
no problem with that?

1091
00:57:34,665 --> 00:57:37,985
Something tells me you would know that
Charlotte doesn't have a problem with that.

1092
00:57:41,402 --> 00:57:43,069
We're buddies.

1093
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:46,305
- Yeah, yeah. We're buddies.
- So, we can't...

1094
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:48,140
- We're buddies.
- Yeah.

1095
00:57:48,142 --> 00:57:50,475
- We're buddies.
- We're buddies.

1096
00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:57,981
Whoo!

1097
00:57:57,983 --> 00:58:02,585
- You are tense, sweetheart. You're really tense.
- I know, I-I...

1098
00:58:02,587 --> 00:58:04,653
- I thought we wanted to loosen up.
- Sorry.

1099
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:06,621
Yeah, no, I do,
I want to loosen up,

1100
00:58:06,623 --> 00:58:09,890
but I guess I'm just wondering
what loosen up means

1101
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,025
at this point.

1102
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,593
It's just a friends' kiss.

1103
00:58:14,595 --> 00:58:17,228
- It's just a friends' kiss?
- Mm-hmm.

1104
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,362
It's just a friends' kiss.

1105
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:20,230
- It's just a friends' kiss.
- Yeah.

1106
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:24,666
Hello? Guys?

1107
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:26,701
Alex?

1108
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:31,805
- Honey?
- Guys?

1109
00:58:33,073 --> 00:58:34,640
Alex?

1110
00:58:34,642 --> 00:58:37,042
Oh! That's the spot.

1111
00:58:37,044 --> 00:58:39,944
- What did that sound like to you?
- Don't know.

1112
00:58:44,915 --> 00:58:46,981
- Oh, there they are.
- Oh, hey, honey!

1113
00:58:51,386 --> 00:58:55,355
I just want to say, I think you're right.
I think there is something weird going on here.

1114
00:58:55,357 --> 00:59:00,326
Oh, yeah, no shit. I have seen
that woman give massages before.

1115
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,328
What?

1116
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:07,765
Alex, she gave some random guy
a fucking hand job at the massage parlor.

1117
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:11,001
You guys went to a massage parlor?
When did you do that?

1118
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:12,283
I can't even... Just...

1119
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,871
Were you gonna let her
touch you down there?

1120
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:18,840
Honey! Absolutely not.
I was just saying that I think you're right.

1121
00:59:18,842 --> 00:59:21,142
I think they do wanna,
like, swing with us or something,

1122
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:23,844
and that is pretty crazy.

1123
00:59:23,846 --> 00:59:26,646
Well, lucky you. See?
You got your expansion now, right?

1124
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:29,115
- This is what you wanted all night!
- That's not what I meant by expansion.

1125
00:59:29,117 --> 00:59:31,383
I was talking about
getting crazy with friends

1126
00:59:31,385 --> 00:59:33,418
and meeting new people
and having fun

1127
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,520
and maybe getting drunk
or whatever.

1128
00:59:35,522 --> 00:59:37,755
I didn't mean, like,
fucking-other-people expansion.

1129
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,190
That's not what I...

1130
00:59:40,192 --> 00:59:42,258
But you can't tell me you
wouldn't have liked it, okay?

1131
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,294
- I can't... I mean, that's irrelevant.
- I don't think it is.

1132
00:59:45,296 --> 00:59:47,296
- Yes, it is.
- I don't think that that's irrelevant at all.

1133
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:49,898
- Why not?
- Stop! Let's just be brutally honest here for a second.

1134
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,299
- Okay.
- Okay?

1135
00:59:51,301 --> 00:59:56,037
Ooh! What would have happened
if she had grabbed for your cock

1136
00:59:57,739 --> 01:00:00,574
and I hadn't of been there, huh?

1137
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:02,275
I wouldn't have allowed it.

1138
01:00:02,277 --> 01:00:04,777
Because you wouldn't have
liked it if she had done it?

1139
01:00:04,779 --> 01:00:08,147
Because I'm married to you,
I wouldn't have allowed it. It's simple, so...

1140
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:10,082
Oh, my God,
isn't that the perfect answer?

1141
01:00:10,084 --> 01:00:12,384
Well, I don't know,
maybe it is the perfect answer.

1142
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:17,287
That tells me, that tells me... What you just
said tells me that the desire is still there.

1143
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:22,258
That tells me that a part of you thinks about
what it would be like to be with other women.

1144
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,126
Come on!
I mean... Honey...

1145
01:00:24,128 --> 01:00:29,364
Oh, my God!
Not that I think you would act on it.
I mean, I trust you, I do,

1146
01:00:29,366 --> 01:00:31,766
I really do.
I really...

1147
01:00:31,768 --> 01:00:34,268
I really trust you,
but I think it just...

1148
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:40,107
It bothers me so much that that curiosity
is there and it may never go away.

1149
01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:43,943
It just might always live...
live there.

1150
01:00:43,945 --> 01:00:46,612
Curi... I never said
I was curious.

1151
01:00:48,915 --> 01:00:51,016
Honey, I never said
I was curious.

1152
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:56,354
Oh, wait a second.

1153
01:00:58,223 --> 01:00:59,590
- I'm really tired.
- Oh!

1154
01:00:59,592 --> 01:01:01,291
- I'm feeling really tired.
- Oh! No, no, no.

1155
01:01:01,293 --> 01:01:03,026
- Let's just get out...
This is not the time for...
- No, no, no...

1156
01:01:03,028 --> 01:01:05,261
This is actually
about you, isn't it?

1157
01:01:05,263 --> 01:01:07,763
- Honey, let's just get out of here.
- This is about you.

1158
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:12,067
This isn't about me, this is about you.
You've been putting it all on me all night.

1159
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:14,169
- What?
- You're the one

1160
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,871
that's been thinking
about this, isn't it?

1161
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:21,674
The moment he whipped that thing out,
you haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

1162
01:01:21,676 --> 01:01:24,543
- You're curious...
- Maybe I am curious, okay?

1163
01:01:24,545 --> 01:01:26,611
- Oh, really? Really?
- Maybe I am.

1164
01:01:26,613 --> 01:01:29,013
I feel that it's weird

1165
01:01:29,015 --> 01:01:31,575
that we have to jerk off
next to each other come.

1166
01:01:33,851 --> 01:01:40,289
And I really think that it sucks that
you lust after another woman's breasts

1167
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:44,726
This is a real thing and I don't
think that we can deny it.

1168
01:01:44,728 --> 01:01:48,429
I think that you think
about other women

1169
01:01:48,431 --> 01:01:53,200
and I think about other men.

1170
01:01:59,506 --> 01:02:00,973
- Alex?
- Do you wanna fuck my wife?

1171
01:02:00,975 --> 01:02:03,642
- Stop it, Alex!
- I'm not gonna stop it. I want to know.

1172
01:02:03,644 --> 01:02:04,976
Do you wanna fuck my wife?

1173
01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:07,011
Because I'm telling you,
she wants to fuck you.

1174
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:08,645
- Oh!
- She does.

1175
01:02:08,647 --> 01:02:11,547
- I think you're a little off-base here, Alex.
- You think I'm off-base?

1176
01:02:11,549 --> 01:02:13,181
- Are you serious?
- -Yeah.

1177
01:02:13,183 --> 01:02:14,348
Kurt!

1178
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:17,517
Tell me, why did you show us
your dick down at the pool?

1179
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:19,185
- Okay.
- Your giant cock!

1180
01:02:19,187 --> 01:02:23,022
Why did you show that to us?
Why did you show my wife your big dick?

1181
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:27,693
And then why did you have
me stand next to you with my tiny dick?

1182
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:30,128
Do you think
I'm an idiot?

1183
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,598
And what? What does this mean?
I get Charlotte now? So me and Charlotte?

1184
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,366
- Is that cool?
- -Alex! No!

1185
01:02:35,368 --> 01:02:39,002
Is that why you showed us that
weird video of you showing your tits to us?

1186
01:02:39,004 --> 01:02:41,637
- We like you both very much.
- Is that what this is?

1187
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:43,972
But we didn't want
this to be weird.

1188
01:02:43,974 --> 01:02:46,407
Oh, you didn't want
it to be weird.

1189
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:48,242
- No.
- Oh, okay.

1190
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:53,713
My mistake because, you're right,
this isn't weird. This is fine, so...

1191
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:57,416
Now that it's not weird, honey, why don't you lay down?
You have to take your clothes off.

1192
01:02:57,418 --> 01:03:00,252
- What do you want? Missionary? Let's do it right here. Kurt?
- You know...

1193
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:03,588
Why don't you get out your big
old cock and just shove it right in her?

1194
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:05,222
- That's enough.
- How about that?

1195
01:03:05,224 --> 01:03:07,190
- That's enough.
- You don't have to do circles anymore, hun,

1196
01:03:07,192 --> 01:03:09,592
- because it's big. We've all seen it.
- He doesn't want her, Alex!

1197
01:03:09,594 --> 01:03:10,993
He wants you!

1198
01:03:16,432 --> 01:03:17,432
What?

1199
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:19,265
He wants you.

1200
01:03:21,568 --> 01:03:23,569
Oh!

1201
01:03:23,571 --> 01:03:28,373
We still love each other very, very much,
but we've been together for a long time and

1202
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:31,508
things have changed.

1203
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:37,413
I don't know why, but, you know, step by step,
Kurt's desire for me just disappeared and, uh,

1204
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:40,883
he seemed to want something
that I-I couldn't give him.

1205
01:03:40,885 --> 01:03:47,456
When he saw you this morning at the playground,
he saw sweetness on your faces and

1206
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,891
he thought that maybe
this could be the solution.

1207
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:52,160
For both of us.

1208
01:03:56,631 --> 01:03:59,165
Isn't there like a web community
for something like this?

1209
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:01,000
No, we've never
done this before.

1210
01:04:01,002 --> 01:04:02,534
- Could have fooled us.
- Yeah.

1211
01:04:02,536 --> 01:04:05,236
Then you think that we're
doing a smooth job of this?

1212
01:04:05,238 --> 01:04:06,971
Does it look like we
do this all the time?

1213
01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:08,605
- Yeah.
- Kind of.

1214
01:04:08,607 --> 01:04:09,973
It's our first time.

1215
01:04:10,908 --> 01:04:12,942
It's just a total mistake.

1216
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:22,250
It just doesn't
make any sense.

1217
01:04:22,252 --> 01:04:27,288
It's obvious that
you love each other so much.

1218
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:28,489
Yeah.

1219
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:32,092
She's my best friend.
We just don't have a love life.

1220
01:04:32,094 --> 01:04:34,627
- Yeah.
- We stay together for everything else.

1221
01:04:34,629 --> 01:04:38,230
Max, the house,
the water filter company.

1222
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:43,802
I'm sorry, I feel like a dick.

1223
01:04:43,804 --> 01:04:45,870
- Why do you feel like a dick?
- Well...

1224
01:04:45,872 --> 01:04:50,373
You're not a dick.
You're not, you know, you just didn't know.

1225
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,441
You got excited.

1226
01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:56,523
And I wasn't putting my dick next to your dick to,
like, do anything, I was just dancing with you, man.

1227
01:04:57,312 --> 01:04:59,179
All right, thanks.

1228
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:02,849
Think about this.
Less than 24 hours ago,

1229
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:05,518
we were a park together
as complete strangers.

1230
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,453
- That's true.
- It is.

1231
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:09,321
Now we're here
and you're in one of my robes.

1232
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,126
- You have so many robes, by the way.
- -I know.

1233
01:05:15,128 --> 01:05:17,027
- We got them in bulk.
- There's enough for all of us.

1234
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:18,762
- How many did you buy?
- 12.

1235
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:21,397
- 12 robes?
- I got a 12-pack of robes.

1236
01:05:27,404 --> 01:05:29,937
- Oh, my God!
- -That was a good one.

1237
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,709
Hey, Charlotte. Tell us how...
How did you lose your virginity?

1238
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:40,446
I feel like you would have been
like on an island in southern France

1239
01:05:40,448 --> 01:05:45,483
with a pencil thin mustachioed
aristocrat or something.

1240
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:48,052
Look at you,
Why do you stereotype so much?

1241
01:05:48,054 --> 01:05:49,787
Because I'm racist.

1242
01:05:49,789 --> 01:05:53,890
Exactly. Well, you're not that far,
but it was a farm boy.

1243
01:05:53,892 --> 01:05:55,591
On an island
in southern France?

1244
01:05:55,593 --> 01:05:57,960
- On an island, in the south of France.
- Are you serious?

1245
01:05:57,962 --> 01:05:59,428
- Yeah...
- So I totally got it right.

1246
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:02,697
What about you, Emily?
How did you lose your virginity?

1247
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:04,131
Um...

1248
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:10,703
Alex is the first,
uh, person...

1249
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,371
Person I ever slept with.

1250
01:06:12,373 --> 01:06:14,005
He was your farm boy.

1251
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:15,506
- I'm your farm boy.
- He was my farm boy.

1252
01:06:15,508 --> 01:06:18,675
- I am a farm boy.
- He still is my farm boy.

1253
01:06:18,677 --> 01:06:22,145
- Are you my... You're my, kind of like my farm boy?
- Mm-hmm.

1254
01:06:22,147 --> 01:06:25,148
He'll always be me farm boy.

1255
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,383
Where would you want to go
anywhere in the world?

1256
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:30,319
You know, I really wanna see...
I've never been to Thailand.

1257
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:32,454
- I've gone.
- -I hear they have beautiful beaches.

1258
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:35,457
Did you guys ever see that movie
<i>The Beach</i> with Leonardo...

1259
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:38,460
- I love that movie...
- Oh, that makes me not wanna go to Thailand.

1260
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,729
- They shot it there, right?
- Yeah, they did.

1261
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:44,498
- That's all I have to say.
- Can I say something that is so weird?

1262
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,200
Can I just say something, and not to keep
bringing up, like kicking a dead horse here?

1263
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:49,901
- Yeah.
- But...

1264
01:06:49,903 --> 01:06:54,538
The whole water filter thing came
from watching the movie<i> The Beach.</i>

1265
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,006
What?

1266
01:06:56,008 --> 01:06:59,075
- I said, "Why can't they drink water like we can?
- Whoa!

1267
01:06:59,077 --> 01:07:00,810
From<i> The Beach?</i>

1268
01:07:00,812 --> 01:07:02,311
- That movie?
- -What does he say?

1269
01:07:02,313 --> 01:07:04,179
And I just brought
that movie up?

1270
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:06,014
- Too weird.
- That's so crazy.

1271
01:07:06,016 --> 01:07:08,116
- Guys, I think this night was sort of meant to be.
- That's like...

1272
01:07:08,118 --> 01:07:11,519
- There's a lot of synchronicity.
- Our stars right now are a constellation.

1273
01:07:11,521 --> 01:07:13,354
- I know...
- Yes.

1274
01:07:13,356 --> 01:07:14,822
What would our
constellation be called?

1275
01:07:14,824 --> 01:07:16,590
Oh, shit!
What time is it?

1276
01:07:16,592 --> 01:07:18,658
I have my phone.

1277
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,393
- What? 4:00? 5:00?
- 4:00?

1278
01:07:20,395 --> 01:07:22,194
You guys!

1279
01:07:22,196 --> 01:07:24,262
- It's almost 6:00 a.m.
- -What?

1280
01:07:24,264 --> 01:07:27,064
All right.
This has been fun.

1281
01:07:27,899 --> 01:07:30,033
- I have to work today.
- -Oh, God.

1282
01:07:30,035 --> 01:07:32,068
I have to go to work today.

1283
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:34,636
I know, we gotta go.

1284
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:36,070
Really, time to go.

1285
01:07:36,072 --> 01:07:38,138
So, this is it.
We're gonna call it?

1286
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,507
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah.

1287
01:07:40,509 --> 01:07:44,477
Uh, that can't be the
last time we get together.

1288
01:07:44,479 --> 01:07:49,415
- Oh, no way! We'll... We'll do something.
- Yeah.

1289
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:53,518
Hm, yeah, certainly
the strangest night of my life.

1290
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,188
But it's also been
very... expanding.

1291
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:00,857
Yeah. I feel good.
I mean, I'm exhausted,

1292
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:02,258
but I feel good.

1293
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,193
- Yeah, me too.
- Mm. Me three.

1294
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:08,062
Count me in.

1295
01:08:09,597 --> 01:08:10,930
All right.

1296
01:08:10,932 --> 01:08:12,765
Good night.
Thank you.

1297
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:14,466
Thank you very much.

1298
01:08:14,468 --> 01:08:16,734
- You... you... I'm sorry.
- Emily?

1299
01:08:16,736 --> 01:08:19,670
- So many hugs.
- Yeah, I know. You're welcome.

1300
01:08:19,672 --> 01:08:21,405
- Hey, group hug.
- Yes.

1301
01:08:21,407 --> 01:08:22,539
Okay.

1302
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,540
Hmm.

1303
01:08:25,742 --> 01:08:26,942
Hmm.

1304
01:08:26,944 --> 01:08:28,076
- Thank you.
- -This is nice.

1305
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:30,211
Mmm. It's really nice.

1306
01:08:33,713 --> 01:08:34,813
It's nice.

1307
01:10:57,056 --> 01:10:59,089
Mommy!

1308
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:00,523
Mommy!

1309
01:11:00,525 --> 01:11:02,024
Shit!
Under the covers!

1310
01:11:02,026 --> 01:11:04,159
- Mommy?
- -Oh, hey, guys, hey!

1311
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:06,427
Wow! Morning!
How'd you guys sleep, huh?

1312
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,362
- Hey, who wants breakfast?
- -Me!

1313
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,629
Let's go.
I'll get it for you.

1314
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:10,863
Come on,
it's a beautiful day.

1315
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:12,798
Were you guys wrestling?

1316
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,966
- Fuck!
- -Yeah, we were just wrestling.

1317
01:11:14,968 --> 01:11:16,801
- Who won?
- It was a tie.

1318
01:11:20,872 --> 01:11:22,172
God! Get your...

1319
01:11:22,174 --> 01:11:24,741
Get dressed! Get dressed!
Get dressed! Get...

1320
01:11:59,504 --> 01:12:02,872
<i>- Medium dogs are pussies.
- No, I saw the other day...</i>

1321
01:12:02,874 --> 01:12:04,740
<i>Okay.</i>

1322
01:12:04,742 --> 01:12:07,542
But earlier today, did you not
see the schnauzer that was here earlier?

1323
01:12:07,544 --> 01:12:08,910
- Yeah.
- You know what a...

1324
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:10,678
- Yeah, I like...
- His hair, it's hypoallergenic.

1325
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,881
I enjoy a good schnauzer
every now and again.

1326
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:16,083
Yeah, but I think that could be fun.
They're not small...

1327
01:12:16,085 --> 01:12:17,584
But are you hearing...

1328
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:20,186
Are you hearing me when
I say if you're gonna get a dog,

1329
01:12:20,188 --> 01:12:22,054
you should get<i> a</i> dog.

1330
01:12:22,056 --> 01:12:23,789
- Go big or go home.
- Yes.

1331
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:26,091
I want RJ to grow
up with a big dog.

1332
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:29,094
Oh, my gosh, do you see them?
Oh, shit! Holy...

1333
01:12:29,096 --> 01:12:30,595
...Okay.

1334
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:32,730
- Do you think it's time to do this?
- I guess so.

1335
01:12:32,732 --> 01:12:35,599
- Should we go say hi?
- I mean, it was inevitable, right, so...

1336
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,100
- Do they see us?
- Now they did.

1337
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,901
- Yeah, all right.
- Get up.

1338
01:12:38,903 --> 01:12:40,469
- Hey, guys...
- -Hey!

1339
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:43,305
You don't write, you don't call,
you're breaking my heart.

1340
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:44,939
Sorry, I'm just kidding,
dumb joke.

1341
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:46,173
- How are ya?
- Good.

1342
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:47,774
- Good. Yeah.
- How are you guys?

1343
01:12:47,776 --> 01:12:49,975
- Oh, it's good, it's really...
- We're in therapy.

1344
01:12:52,311 --> 01:12:53,544
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1345
01:12:53,546 --> 01:12:55,045
Sorry to be the one to
cut the crap here, but...

1346
01:12:55,047 --> 01:12:57,714
Basically we've decided
to give the marriage another chance.

1347
01:12:57,716 --> 01:12:59,882
- Mm-hmm.
- We've been able to sort through a ton of stuff.

1348
01:12:59,884 --> 01:13:02,251
- That sounds great.
- We've got you guys to thank for that.

1349
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,686
- Yeah.
- Without that experience we'd be lost, really.

1350
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:09,323
Really. Thank you, you walked
us down the aisle to this moment.

1351
01:13:09,325 --> 01:13:12,025
- It was a crazy experience.
- Uh-huh.

1352
01:13:12,027 --> 01:13:14,360
- But it was, you know...
- Yeah.

1353
01:13:14,362 --> 01:13:16,628
- It was valuable.
- Yes.

1354
01:13:19,598 --> 01:13:21,799
- It's good to see you guys.
- Thank you, you too.

1355
01:13:21,801 --> 01:13:24,701
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you've changed something in your face.

1356
01:13:24,703 --> 01:13:27,403
- You know, it wasn't very California.
- -Yeah.

1357
01:13:27,405 --> 01:13:30,806
- After a while, I was like,
I don't see anyone else doing this.
- Right.

1358
01:13:30,808 --> 01:13:33,909
- Maybe I should stop, so...
- -Right.

1359
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:37,345
You know, I was planning
on calling you guys. I, you know...

1360
01:13:37,347 --> 01:13:39,714
I was thinking about that.
I just wasn't quite

1361
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,617
sure what to say.

1362
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:46,586
- So...
- Don't worry about it.

1363
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:47,954
We should grab dinner
or something.

1364
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:48,955
- Totally.
- You know?

1365
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,723
Yeah, we should, maybe
at your house this time.

1366
01:13:50,725 --> 01:13:53,092
Yeah, you could come,
or we could go to a restaurant this time?

1367
01:13:53,094 --> 01:13:55,427
- We found some great places.
- Totally. Yeah.

1368
