00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
<i>In 1964, Granada Television brought together
a group of 7-year-olds</i>

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,950
<i>from all over the country
and from all walks of life.</i>

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to work
in Woolworth's.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,090
I read
the<i> Financial Times.</i>

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>They talked about their dreams, their
ambitions, and their fears for the future.</i>

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,100
Everything flew up in the air
and that all landed on my head.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,150
<i>For nearly half a century,
in a unique groundbreaking series of films,</i>

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,160
<i>we have followed their lives
every seven years.</i>

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
<i>They are now 56.</i>

10
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:51,163
<i>Lynn, Sue and Jackie grew up
in London's East End</i>

11
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:52,614
<i>and were friends
at school.</i>

12
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,335
In this school,

13
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,670
we do metalwork
and woodwork

14
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:00,740
and the boys
do cookery.

15
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:04,110
All you girls want to do
is walk out, get married,

16
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:07,079
have babies and push
a pram down the street

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,049
with a fag hanging out
the side of your mouth.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,818
I think that we all
could have gone

19
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,886
any way that we wanted to
at the time

20
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:16,522
within our
capabilities.

21
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,324
But we only had
a limited choice anyway.

22
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:19,558
Truth be told...

23
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,993
we didn't have the choice
or private education

24
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:24,397
because they couldn't have
afforded it anyway.

25
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:27,898
Our lives are changing
far too much.

26
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,201
All of us.

27
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:32,137
To be honest, when you look
at the 7-year-old us,

28
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:34,340
it's difficult to believe
it is us.

29
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,475
I've got to say, girls,

30
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:38,810
I wanted to work
in Woolworth's.

31
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:42,281
I'm glad you said that, 'cause
everyone thinks it was me.

32
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:44,716
Sometimes we go out and play
nasty with the boys

33
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:47,152
and sometimes we go out
and argue with the boys.

34
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:50,889
I don't think I'll get married
too early.

35
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,192
I'd like to have
a full life first.

36
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,827
Marriage means a different thing
to me.

37
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,496
I've still got my ideals
about marriage.

38
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:58,929
I don't know
what it's all about.

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,302
<i>Sue was 24
when she married Billy</i>

40
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:06,171
<i>and they had two children,
William and Katherine.</i>

41
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:08,106
I think that
to get married young,

42
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,107
there must be things
that you miss.

43
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:14,211
You must miss that crucial stage
of being yourself,

44
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,148
because the minute you
get married,

45
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:18,950
you're no longer a single being,
you're a partnership,

46
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,019
and that should be
the idea behind it.

47
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,425
<i>By the time Sue was 35,
she was divorced.</i>

48
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,592
I've never sat down
and thought,

49
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:31,463
"What was it?
Was it this, was it that?"

50
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:33,464
I just knew
it wasn't working.

51
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:36,702
There have been relationships
when I could have settled,

52
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,804
but they didn't feel
quite right.

53
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:42,374
So I've always come away
and pulled away

54
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:46,445
and just waited until
the right one come along.

55
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:48,613

61

You're lazy?

71
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:29,654
I am completely,
absolutely lazy.

72
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:31,958
Anything you want me
to do?

73
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:36,195
What about the romance
of getting married?

74
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:40,432
Yeah, I mean,
I do admit it would be a nice party

75
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:44,569
and I quite relish the idea
of having everyone round

76
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,872
and having a good old drink
and a celebration.

77
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,574
But I can have
a party anytime.

78
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,478
Who are you on the phone to?

79
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,347
Never you mind.

80
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:58,982
When I got married,
the primary reason was because

81
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,853
I wanted to have a child.

82
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:02,454
The two to me went together.

83
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:06,491
Have you and Glen thought
of having your own child?

84
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:08,326
Glen would have
made a great dad.

85
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:12,297
When we first got together,
he sort of asked me

86
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,398
if we could have a family
and all that,

87
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,735
but I felt that I was past it,
to be honest.

88
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:20,872
I mean, I had two teenagers and didn't want
to do that again.

89
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:23,208
But he's loved
bringing them up.

90
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,278
Last time we talked about
a bit of tension in that area.

91
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,749
No, I think that was
probably just the age they were

92
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,485
and every family goes
through that.

93
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:35,720
There was nothing in particular,
I don't think.

94
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,956
It's just the whole part
of growing up, really.

95
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,958
Wasn't easy being
a single mother, was it?

96
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,228
No, it wasn't.

97
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:44,563
I look back on it now
and I'm just amazed

98
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,999
at how I got through it,
you know.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,802
What was
the toughest part of it?

100
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:53,571
Probably a combination of not having
enough money to do what you want

101
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:56,641
and being alone and scared
when things happen

102
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:59,944
and things go wrong, which they
always do when you've got kids.

103
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:02,747
You've got no one there
to turn to, you know,

104
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:04,617
to talk about things
like that.

105
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,184
And you had to work.

106
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:08,086
Yeah, but I was always
only part-time,

107
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,055
so that I could fit it
around school.

108
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,223
So who was
the biggest help to you

109
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,725
during this whole
single-parent...?

110
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:17,028
There's no doubt at all,
without my mum and dad,

111
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,463
I would never have survived it.

112
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:19,831
They were brilliant.

113
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:22,501
They were really good.
They mean the world to the kids

114
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:25,771
and they used to look
after them.

115
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:28,841
Always be there if something happened
and I had to go somewhere.

116
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:31,408
Yeah, nice, ain't they?

117
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:33,444
And how
are they doing now?

118
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:35,413
Yeah, they're fine.

119
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:36,648
Dad's 80 now.

120
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:37,982
And mum's 78.

121
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:42,987
I think I'm so lucky that
they're still reasonably active.

122
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:44,790
There you go.

123
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,792
That's lovely, that one,
isn't it?

124
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:48,994
I've still got Katherine
with me

125
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,862
because she hasn't found
anywhere else to go.

126
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:55,466
I mean, I'm sure she would
love to leave me,

127
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,069
but I love it,
the fact that she's here.

128
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,172
We go shopping
and do girlie things.

129
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:03,374
Do each other's hair
and things like that,

130
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,442
so I would miss her,
but I know

131
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,845
that she needs to get out
and move on.

132
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,314
Only had to have one filling.

133
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,583
That's about the only thing
that I had done.

134
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,852
What about William?

135
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:16,487
Well, he went
to Australia for a year.

136
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,456
And he never settled back in,
being independent.

137
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,960
I think it was too much.

138
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,028
Plus his room here
was far too small.

139
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:26,799
And his computer was bigger
than the room, you know.

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,367
So, um...

141
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,201
Yes, he's renting.

142
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:33,271
It's just so hard for him to
be able to afford something,

143
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:36,107
so in the future, your kids
are going to be with you

144
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,908
for a long, long time.

145
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:41,513
But a lot of my work is involved
in making bookings

146
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,948
and dealing with
hotels abroad.

147
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,785
<i>At 21, Sue worked
for a travel agent.</i>

148
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:51,823
<i>At 35, part-time
for a building society.</i>

149
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:54,391
Everything's changed for me
because I'm now

150
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:57,461
supporting myself a lot more
than I was, say, a year ago.

151
00:06:57,462 --> 00:07:01,766
<i>At 42, she went back to work
full-time,</i>

post-graduate program.</i>

156
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,881
Do you like
the responsibility?

157
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,816
Yeah, I love
the responsibility.

158
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,651
I think I was born
for the responsibility.

159
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,886
I'm now sort of
the coordinator

160
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:24,956
of the entire program.

161
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:28,759
So, sort of "Marge in charge,"
really, of the LLM.

162
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,396
It's like my baby, really.

163
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:35,833
You know, I've nurtured it from its
small beginnings into what it is now.

164
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:39,037
Thank you very much.
See you at graduation, yeah?

165
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,672
I really do enjoy it.

166
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,307
I get up of a morning

167
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:46,144
and I don't ever think, "oh,
I can't face going to work."

168
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:49,281
But that happens to a lot of
people, so I'm lucky, really.

169
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,749
Someone's having trouble
downloading this attachment

170
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,418
so I'll take this down
for them.

171
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,687
Sue, you've got
a lot of responsibility.

172
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:58,055
Is there stress
attached to it?

173
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:59,624
Sometimes. I mean,

174
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,860
some parts of the year
are busier than others,

175
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,595
and you've got deadlines
to meet.

176
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,230
But then, in a way,
that's good,

177
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,331
because it keeps you
on your toes, you know.

178
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:08,633
Never get bored.

179
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:12,704
Where does the life of my
respectable, middle-class mother

180
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,240
overlap with
a working-class slapper

181
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,975
who leaves her illegitimate
child on a church doorstep?

182
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:20,278
- She was not!
- You don't know!

183
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,014
She was young and frail...

184
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:27,586
It started not long after
the last program with Tony,

185
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:30,954
my neighbor, and he belonged
to the group.

186
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:33,091
And I said,
"Oh, I've been wishing

187
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:35,494
I could do dramas for years,"
you know,

188
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:38,362
since I was at school,
and he said, "Come along."

189
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:43,968
♪ That's the time you must
keep on trying ♪

190
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:46,437
♪ Smile ♪

191
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,574
♪ What's the use of crying... ♪

192
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,708
To stand on the stage
and sing

193
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,312
and have people, hopefully,
appreciate it, hopefully,

194
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:57,949
you know, but there's still
that little nervous thing,

195
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,251
the butterflies in your stomach
when you're waiting

196
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:02,119
for the curtains to open
and, you know,

197
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,588
it's a buzz, really.

198
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,793
Realistically, this is the point
you really do have to consider.

199
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:10,194
You can't do two modules
that are taught

200
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,795
at the same time, obviously.

201
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:14,199
When I get on the stage to speak
to 500 students,

202
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,334
some people would find that
very daunting.

203
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:19,336
But I actually don't

204
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,374
because I think if you know they
can never ask you something

205
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,875
you don't know the answer to,

206
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:26,711
then I think that helps build
your confidence.

207
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:28,712
And I'm not exactly shy,
am I?

208
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:29,981
It always takes one, you see.

209
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:32,132
Once you get one,
other people tend to ask.

210
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,055
You never went
to university and now

211
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:40,359
you're right in the middle of
a huge university machine.

212
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,394
I suppose I should count
my blessings

213
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,296
that I'm actually in
a university,

214
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:46,129
having not done it myself,
yeah.

215
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,100
Looking at it,
do you wish you had had that opportunity?

216
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,970
Not really.
It's the same as anything.

217
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,873
Why look back and say, "I wish
I did this or had done that"?

218
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:58,475
I've had a good career.
At least I'll have my own home.

219
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:00,378
Which is a new thing
for my family.

220
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,581
My mom and dad are obviously
still in Council Place.

221
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:06,250
I'll never be a rich pensioner;
I'll never be able

222
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,787
to travel the world once
I retire, I'm afraid,

223
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,989
but as long as I can keep
the house warm

224
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,325
and we can feed ourselves,
that will be fine.

225
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:19,330
I don't like the big boys
hitting us

226
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:24,101
and the prefects
sending us out for nothing.

227
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:27,305
<i>When he was 7,
Paul was in care</i>

228
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:30,173
<i>in a children's home
in London.</i>

229
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:33,544
Were you happy at
the children's home in England?

230
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:36,648
We didn't mind that, really,
because we didn't know

231
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,418
what was going on
'cause we were a bit young.

232
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,019
Well, as far as I know,
my mother and father...

233
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,355
Well, they separated
originally, I think.

234
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:47,759
And they eventually
got divorced.

235
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,394
I went to the boarding school
for one year

236
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:52,663
and then we emigrated
to Australia.

237
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:56,134
<i>Paul settled with his father
and stepmother</i>

238
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:58,103
<i>in a suburb of Melbourne.</i>

239
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:01,105
Would you like to get
married, Paul?

240
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:03,640
Tell me why not.

241
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:05,777
I don't like like, um...

242
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:09,047
Say you had a wife.

243
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:13,518
Like, say you had to eat
what they cooked you.

244
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,855
And say I don't like greens.
Well, I don't.

245
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:21,360
I know I'd prefer
to be alone, really.

246
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,861
I can't say I don't want
to get married,

247
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,097
'cause I think I do, but I want
to be happily married,

248
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:29,267
and not before
when I'm not sure.

249
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,802
What was it that you
fell in love with?

250
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:33,004
What is it about him?

251
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,072
His helplessness,
I suppose.

252
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:36,807
Just the motherly instinct
in me,

253
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,409
to pick him up
and cuddle him.

254
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,979
He's also very good-looking,
I think,

255
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,880
but he doesn't agree with me.

256
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:46,350
In the summer, he's got this
cute little bum in shorts.

257
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,385
I mean, I can tell
quite a few stories,

258
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:50,889
but the one that really
irritates me the most is,

259
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,692
when we have an argument,
he says, "That's it, leave me."

260
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,927
I say, "Fine, all right,
I will one day."

261
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:58,262
We had our 20th wedding
anniversary

262
00:11:58,263 --> 00:11:59,697
just before Christmas.

263
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,633
Which is
the life sentence.

264
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,101
And one reckons that we
should be out of jail by now.

265
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,303
To a certain extent,
we started thinking,

266
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:08,440
well, do we really know
each other now?

267
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,241
Because you just get in
the humdrum

268
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:14,077
of going to work,
coming back home.

269
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:15,345
Running kids here...

270
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:16,648
Kids here and there.

271
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,182
I don't think you mean to be,

272
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:20,685
probably stop thinking
about each other a lot.

273
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:23,688
It's still the last
person you want to see at night

274
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,856
before you go to sleep
and the first person

275
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:27,625
you want to see
when you wake up.

276
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:30,762
Do you still like to
cuddle and love and all that?

277
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:34,565
Yeah, but not in public.

278
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,567
No. Yes.

279
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,903
But is
the chemistry still there?

280
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:41,505
Yes.

281
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:42,941
You don't sound sure.

282
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,109
Well, we like
to keep it private.

283
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,812
I had to wait
for the answer.

284
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:51,349
I find it hard to express
emotion most of the time.

285
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,385
Although I'm getting on top of
that more now, you know.

286
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,688
Just the simple things
to say to Susan.

287
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,724
"I love you,"
something like that.

288
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,961
I mean, I can tell you
about it,

289
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:06,264
but I really haven't been able
to say it

290
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,965
to Sue, you know.

291
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:11,068
I did end up having to get
a bit of help.

292
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:14,339
It wasn't directly due
to our relationship.

293
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,008
It started at work,
unfortunately.

294
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,243
Which brought
my self-esteem down,

295
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:21,746
which tended to affect
everything else.

296
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,249
I know the lack of confidence
is there.

297
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,618
It still applies to me.

298
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,052
But I don't dwell on it.

299
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,488
It's there, and I have
to put up with it.

300
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:32,323
I just think you take on

301
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,859
a little bit more of
each other's personality.

302
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,762
'Cause whenever I was decisive
and made a decision and said,

303
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,364
"Let's do this," because Paul,

304
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,499
not that he couldn't make
the decision

305
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,001
but he had all these questions
to ask, and I used to think,

306
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:47,105
"Oh, stop asking questions,"
and I suppose now I start to question myself,

307
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:49,606
"maybe he should
ask the questions."

308
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,644
So it is that bit of living
with the other personality.

309
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:55,580
I was going to be
a policeman

310
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:58,649
but I thought how hard it would
be to join in.

311
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,353
I was going to be
a phys-ed teacher,

312
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,022
but one of the teachers
told me that

313
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,591
you had to get up
into university.

314
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,094
<i>As a young man,</i>

315
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:13,230
<i>Paul spent many years
in the building trade</i>

316
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:17,000
<i>and then moved on
into factory work.</i>

317
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:19,970
Okay, the question was,
Gracie Fields' sang...

318
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:22,773
"In the what
in the Moonlight?"

319
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,275
It's a retirement village
with independent living.

320
00:14:25,276 --> 00:14:29,346
And then it's got
assisted living in the hostel,

321
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:30,849
which is mainly
where I work.

322
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,051
It's got six letters.
Gracie Fields sang...

323
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:36,053
They have their own laundry.
It's a complete unit.

324
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:37,522
They have their own
lockup garage.

325
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:40,759
So there's a couple
of parcels there...

326
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,094
And that's why Paul's there.

327
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:45,663
I call him "the man about
the house" at work,

328
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,566
because he changes
light globes.

329
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,500
Problems with your taps,
they go check it out.

330
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,769
Cleans the gutterings,
fixes squeaky doors,

331
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,906
'cause the village is now
25 years old.

332
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,941
So the maintenance is starting
to gather.

333
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:58,877
How are you doing
up there, Paul?

334
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,345
When the job came up,
I said to Susan

335
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:03,581
that if there was
any problem at all

336
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:06,082
with us working together,
then I'd leave.

337
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:10,288
But so far we've found it
really quite good.

338
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,557
- Hi, Lola, how are you?
- I'm good, Paul.

339
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,591
I've probably always been

340
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:17,762
a little bit more relaxed
around older people, probably.

341
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,999
Always liked older people as I
was growing up, funny enough.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,103
<i>By the time they were 28,
Paul and Sue had two children,</i>

343
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:28,706
<i>Katie and Robert.</i>

344
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:31,241
<i>Katie did well at school</i>

345
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:34,579
<i>and went on to university,
the first person</i>

346
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,914
<i>in her entire family
ever to do so.</i>

347
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:42,153
<i>Robert trained
as a car mechanic.</i>

348
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:46,923
<i>He met his wife Stacey
when they were teenagers</i>

349
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:50,260
<i>and now they have
five children.</i>

350
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:52,897
So there's Lucas,
who is 9.

351
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,331
Then there's Ryan,

352
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:59,303
who is about to turn 7
at the end of this month.

353
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:01,672
Then there's Haley, who's just
turned 5.

354
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:04,008
And she'll start school
in the new year.

355
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,677
Then there's Shane,
known as Shane-o,

356
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:08,946
and he is 3 this week.

357
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,716
He's the joker out of
the lot of them.

358
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:14,418
If he does something
and you laugh,

359
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,288
he'll laugh with you,
and he loves a joke.

360
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:21,525
And then there's little Troy
that's 12 weeks old.

361
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,094
I look back at my grandmother

362
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:25,663
and I've taken some wonderful
lessons from her.

363
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:29,234
Grandma made us all feel that we
were her special number one,

364
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:33,037
but I think that's the secret
to being a grandparent is to

365
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:36,707
make every child feel that they
have someone that they

366
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,544
can relax with,
be themselves with.

367
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:43,581
Grandparents now have a really
huge part to play

368
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:45,115
in their parents' lives because

369
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:47,185
the pressure's on them
to work so much,

370
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:51,992
and grandparents fill that hole
of mum not being home every day.

371
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:58,863
I've already made them, so there
they are for the kiddies.

372
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:01,566
And your Rich likes
fairy bread.

373
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,869
Get some spoilers
and snakes in there.

374
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,038
♪ Happy birthday,
dear Shannon ♪

375
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,273
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

376
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:13,711
Not you!

377
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:16,880
It's a real struggle
for them, financially.

378
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:19,917
But at the same time, like all
young kids, there's areas

379
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:23,321
we look at and go,
"We didn't have that."

380
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,557
I've got 23 threepenny pieces,

381
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,294
and I don't know how many
ha'penny pieces I've got now.

382
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:33,831
Look, there's a whole
stack of duckies over there.

383
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:35,734
None of our kids have got
credit cards.

384
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:39,104
They don't live
a credit life, yet.

385
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,839
They try and pay as they go,

386
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,140
which is what we've
always thought,

387
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:45,877
and that's kept our head
above water, just.

388
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:49,746
We always thought if we were
unemployed or out of work,

389
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:52,617
if you own your house,
you've got a huge buffer.

390
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,685
And Robert's
of the same belief.

391
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:58,889
<i>In their 20s,
Paul and Sue sold up,</i>

392
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,193
<i>bought an old van, and traveled
across Australia.</i>

393
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:06,062
We were close together,
because we really got

394
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:09,301
to know each other and relied
on each other so much.

395
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:14,138
One of the most important
things we ever did

396
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:16,174
with our children,
we spent time with them,

397
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:19,142
and particularly when
you've got holidays.

398
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:22,013
You know, go camping with them.

399
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:24,983
Well, we went over
to visit Katie,

400
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:28,753
because she was working up in the top
end of Yorkshire on a community farm.

401
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,087
We were missing her.

402
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:32,822
We just didn't want
to tell her that.

403
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:35,592
Well, they miss you
when you're away.

404
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:36,994
Do you miss them?

405
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:40,165
I didn't miss them, like,
God, I wanna be around them,

406
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,167
but I thought about them a lot
and appreciated them a lot,

407
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,601
which is probably good.

408
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:47,338
So are the three of you
getting on well?

409
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,472
Yeah, most of the time.

410
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,041
As long as we're not
in the car.

411
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,408
Getting lost.

412
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:52,944
We're atrocious
in the car.

413
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,179
But other than that,
we're good.

414
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,412
It is good.

415
00:18:56,413 --> 00:19:00,584
When we were in London,
we went to Greenwich.

416
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:03,053
It was built as a maritime
retirement village, almost,

417
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:06,189
for the sailors from
the Napoleonic Wars,

418
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,525
so that was all
really interesting

419
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:11,128
because we work in
retirement villages.

420
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,063
These buildings here were built

421
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:15,565
before Australia was even
discovered.

422
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,333
So that's pretty amazing.

423
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:20,838
Katie was in awe of it
because

424
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,206
in her degree,
she did art history,

425
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,243
so she just loved it.

426
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,445
What does "university" mean?

427
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:31,116
Are you going to try and point
your grandchildren into education?

428
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:32,783
You want them to have

429
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:34,885
a good education
no matter what they do.

430
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:36,754
Better
than you had, maybe?

431
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,622
But that's my fault,
really.

432
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,991
I mean, I just didn't
work hard enough, I guess.

433
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,960
You hope the school systems
have changed

434
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:45,162
to encourage kids to go on,
because one thing

435
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,464
you can't take away from people
is an education.

436
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:51,101
I mean, the one thing
my daughter's taught me

437
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,537
is that it doesn't
matter what you do,

438
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:57,007
there's room for all of us,
even to the point

439
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,444
if you don't work, you're still
teaching us something.

440
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,246
You're teaching
other people to care.

441
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:06,283
How are you dealing
with getting old?

442
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:09,485
I don't think
you really notice it.

443
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:11,554
You still think
you're the same.

444
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,724
Maybe when you try
to do something

445
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:17,027
physically too quickly
and pull a muscle,

446
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:19,898
that just reminds you
that you're getting older.

447
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:24,502
Are you fearful of
the future of disability

448
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:26,536
or unable to do things?

449
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:28,673
You hope that you're
going to be

450
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:32,810
one of the fortunate ones
and not get ill in any way.

451
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,946
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello, Paul.

452
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:40,150
Maybe where I work
may have helped that recently

453
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,386
because people just tend to

454
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:44,923
get on with their lives
no matter what.

455
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:48,559
And then that's the one
with the palace.

456
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,328
You got a nice shot
of the bin, there.

457
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:53,097
That one's good.
You're getting better.

458
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:54,465
Shut up.

459
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:57,900
Do you measure your life
in terms of success

460
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:59,770
and failure in any sense?

461
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:01,305
I don't really.

462
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:05,309
I suppose the success is that
we're sitting here together

463
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,745
and that we haven't had
tragedy happen to us.

464
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:11,748
It's just about getting on
with life

465
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:14,017
and then enjoy
our grandchildren,

466
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:17,287
our children, and our friends,
you know.

467
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,357
Yeah. Our goals
of life have never...

468
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:22,225
And then work
just gets in the way.

469
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,661
Well, we pretend we've
got swords

470
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:27,831
and we make the noise
of the swords fighting,

471
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,967
and then once we get stabbed,
we go, "aaaah!"

472
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:33,771
<i>Neil grew up in
a Liverpool suburb</i>

473
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:36,240
<i>and had dreams
of going to Oxford</i>

474
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,008
<i>but didn't get in.</i>

475
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,946
<i>Instead, he went
to Aberdeen University,</i>

476
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:44,715
<i>but dropped out
after the first term.</i>

477
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:48,351
<i>At 21, Neil was working
on a building site</i>

478
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:51,187
<i>and living in a squat.</i>

479
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:53,890
I would like to be somebody in
a position of importance,

480
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:56,494
and I've always thought it,
but I don't think I'm

481
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,264
the right sort of person
to carry the responsibility

482
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:01,431
for whatever it is...
I always thought,

483
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:05,636
well, I'd love to be possibly
in politics

484
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:08,874
or something like this.

485
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:13,244
<i>At 28,
we found Neil homeless,</i>

486
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:16,414
<i>wandering around
the west coast of Scotland.</i>

487
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:19,049
If the money runs out,
then for a few days,

488
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,119
there's nowhere to go to
and that's all you can do.

489
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,122
I simply have to find
the warmest shed I can find.

490
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:29,993
<i>At 35, he was living
in a Council estate</i>

491
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:32,495
<i>on the most northerly part
of Britain,</i>

492
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:34,098
<i>the Shetland Islands.</i>

493
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:38,202
And what would you like
to be doing, say in seven years?

494
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:42,371
I can think of all kinds
of things I'd like to be doing.

495
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:45,876
The real question is, what am I
likely to be doing?

496
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:48,646
What are you likely
to be doing?

497
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,581
That's a horrible question.

498
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:51,814
Um...

499
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:54,051
I tend to think the most likely
answer is that

500
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:56,852
I'll be wandering homeless
around the streets of London.

501
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:05,062
Can I just point out some of
the considerable disadvantages?

502
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:06,764
First of all...

503
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,766
<i>At 42, Neil had moved
to London</i>

504
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:13,803
<i>and was a Liberal Democrat
on Hackney Council.</i>

505
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:17,074
While I was in Shetland,
I felt very strongly

506
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:19,042
that I should become
involved in politics.

507
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,543
Simply because I felt

508
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:23,112
I was not achieving anything
in the ways I really wanted to.

509
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:27,350
<i>By 49, Neil had left London.</i>

510
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:29,485
<i>Moved to Cumbria
in the northwest of England,</i>

511
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:31,789
<i>and was a Liberal Democrat
member</i>

512
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,658
<i>of his local district council.</i>

513
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,828
It was a committee decision,
a majority decision.

514
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:39,929
His own group on
the Establishment Committee

515
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,532
agreed with the decision.

516
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,700
Councilor Hughes?

517
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:47,871
The Councilor Cook has
reconsidered his opinion

518
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:50,674
he ventured at that meeting.

519
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:54,977
Here we are in the center

520
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:57,681
of the ward I represent
on the council.

521
00:23:57,682 --> 00:23:59,817
These are
our public toilets.

522
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:04,187
I can assure you that no more
fierce battle has been fought,

523
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:06,389
either on the playing fields
or indeed

524
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,625
on the battlefields
of England, to save

525
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:11,027
what might appear to be
a comparatively

526
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:12,897
insignificant
local amenity.

527
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:17,869
It sounds vaguely comic,
but presumably it's not to you.

528
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,703
But when you live
in a small community,

529
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:22,674
you become very proud,
rightly, of the facilities here.

530
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,841
And people are willing to play
a part

531
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:27,610
in helping to keep them going,
but they don't want

532
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:30,380
to be ignored, they don't want
to be marginalized.

533
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:33,484
My strength is being able
to keep going, really.

534
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,352
My weakness is not being able

535
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:37,920
to take any positive course
of action.

536
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:41,492
No formal education can prepare
anybody for life.

537
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:43,994
Only life can prepare you
for what comes.

538
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:45,929
And sooner or later,
you're going

539
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,931
to have to cross
certain barriers.

540
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:51,601
There are a few things
I would like to say.

541
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:54,571
And the first thing to say is,
there's been

542
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:57,341
tremendous good will
toward the series.

543
00:24:57,342 --> 00:25:01,879
But I'm also aware that I'm
not the only participant

544
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,449
who wants to set the record
straight in a number of ways.

545
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,552
For so many millions of people,

546
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:11,321
I'm here wearing my heart
on my sleeve.

547
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:14,125
And they think they know
absolutely everything about me.

548
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,994
There were countless people
writing me, saying,

549
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:18,995
"I know exactly how
you feel."

550
00:25:18,996 --> 00:25:20,898
And actually,
from those letters,

551
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,600
I would say none of them,
not a single one of them,

552
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,402
knew exactly how
I was feeling.

553
00:25:25,403 --> 00:25:27,603
I've got a great deal of respect
for the Liberal Democrats,

554
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:29,607
but I think that I won't
vote for them this time...

555
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:33,476
Here in Cumbria,
I'm really glad to be doing

556
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:36,045
what I do to be representing
people

557
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:37,781
at local political level.

558
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:40,217
But in one sense I'm doing that

559
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:43,286
because it's the only way I've
been able to make any money.

560
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:47,457
I get a derisory amount of money
for being a councilor.

561
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:51,462
I do enjoy the work, but I've
been completely unsuccessful

562
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:54,631
in trying to find a paid career
of any kind.

563
00:25:54,632 --> 00:26:00,036
I have always wanted to write
as a career

564
00:26:00,037 --> 00:26:03,740
and indeed have written
huge amounts.

565
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:07,744
And ironically, despite
appearing in this program

566
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:10,380
so frequently, nobody
has ever shown

567
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:13,016
any serious interest in any
of the work I do.

568
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:16,052
And believe me, it's a great
deal more important to me

569
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:18,889
than anything I can say
on the television screen.

570
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,825
Even if somebody sent it back
to me and said,

571
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:24,829
"Well, I read it,
and it's rubbish, actually,"

572
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,330
that would be very demoralizing,

573
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,832
but at least some interaction
would have taken place.

574
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:33,570
There's hardly a day goes by
when I don't write.

575
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:36,373
That's a great gift,
isn't it?

576
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:41,011
It is, but it shouldn't be
a sort of masturbation

577
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:43,647
about which nobody else
knows anything.

578
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:47,551
Neil Hughes is
the Liberal Democrat candidate.

579
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:51,488
I and the Liberal Democrats want
to see a just and fair society.

580
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:57,494
In 2006, I was invited to go to
Australia to give a talk,

581
00:26:57,495 --> 00:27:00,496
and the chap
who introduced me said,

582
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:04,266
"Neil is clearly such a
profoundly motivated politician

583
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:07,604
that we can all expect to see
him as Prime Minister

584
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,139
of the United Kingdom."

585
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,541
This wasn't a joke, I assure you

586
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,341
he said this
with absolute seriousness.

587
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:17,081
Now, it was ludicrous,
but this is how wildly skewed

588
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:19,350
the perceptions have become.

589
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,953
Do you think I would
really have been

590
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:25,054
invited to Australia if they
were aware that I was someone

591
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:28,024
who lives on a few quid a week
benefit and has

592
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:31,195
as much chance of changing the
future of the United Kingdom

593
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,363
as...

594
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:35,898
I don't know,
someone who's serving

595
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:37,634
a lifetime jail sentence?

596
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:46,909
Yes, I'd say
I believed in God.

597
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,978
Are you religious?

598
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:52,183
Well, I go to church with
my parents on Sundays.

599
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:55,585
I don't know even now whether I
do believe in God or not.

600
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,389
I've thought an awful lot
about it, actually.

601
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,689
And I still don't know.

602
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,092
And how has he been
treating you?

603
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:06,464
Well, I said to somebody last
week that I preferred

604
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:08,764
the Old Testament
to the New Testament.

605
00:28:08,765 --> 00:28:13,169
Because in the Old Testament,
God is very unpredictable.

606
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,507
And that's, I think,
how I've seen Him in my life.

607
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,709
And Doreen as well...

608
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,314
I was first a lay reader
in London.

609
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:26,850
After completing
a little more training,

610
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,520
I was relicensed by
the bishop of Carlisle.

611
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:32,188
Well, good morning.

612
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,791
Welcome to our service today.

613
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:38,094
Just a couple of notices first.

614
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:40,330
If you haven't already
been told,

615
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:43,500
the proposed pet show
is, unfortunately, cancelled.

616
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,769
I'm the lay minister.

617
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,806
I'm licensed to carry out
quite a number of functions.

618
00:28:49,807 --> 00:28:55,079
That includes leading services, preaching,
taking part in the readings,

619
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,380
helping to distribute
the communion, and so on.

620
00:28:57,381 --> 00:29:00,485
In fact, I can do more or less
everything a priest can do.

621
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:08,492
To what extent
am I a good model for others?

622
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:10,561
I don't know.
On the other hand,

623
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:13,831
I am angry that so many doors
have been closed,

624
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:16,667
not just for me,
but for so many people.

625
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:18,968
I do feel nobody's
listening out there.

626
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:21,271
There seem to be
few currents

627
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:25,176
that are encouraging people to
stand up for their rights,

628
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:27,977
not just their strict
legal rights,

629
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:30,414
but their rights
to be human.

630
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:35,418
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

631
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:39,590
I'm not unappreciative of
the honor it's been

632
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:42,592
to be able to serve
the church,

633
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:45,161
to be able
to serve my community,

634
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:48,231
and I want to make that
absolutely clear.

635
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:53,236
And it's true, I think it was Albert
Camus who said that life is what happens

636
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:54,937
while you're waiting for
something else.

637
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:58,475
But it's not the sort of place
where someone

638
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:02,079
who wants to change society
is best employed.

639
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,815
I would have thought
that was pretty obvious.

640
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:09,753
In the winter, if you live in the country,
it was just all wet

641
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:13,059
and there wouldn't be anything
for miles around.

642
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:18,562
We're a very quiet village.

643
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:21,732
There's always room for more
activity and for more people

644
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,167
being involved, but I think
we do fairly well

645
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:27,571
as a diversity of groups.

646
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:31,007
They're still trying to
persuade me to go in.

647
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:33,577
Apparently Alan has cried off
at the last minute,

648
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,012
so there's just
the two of them.

649
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:38,148
I think it was Pascal, the great
philosopher and mathematician,

650
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:42,285
who said that if a man can live
happily in his own living room

651
00:30:42,286 --> 00:30:46,022
most of his life, then he's achieved
the utmost philosophical breakthrough,

652
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:48,291
and philosophically speaking,
that's true, but I can't.

653
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,460
You stick me in my living room
for one hour on my own

654
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,395
and I want to be out
doing something.

655
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:54,130
I want to be out
changing things.

656
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:58,002
I have always had
a nervous complaint.

657
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:00,637
I've had it since I was 16.

658
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,306
It was responsible for my
leaving university

659
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:05,876
and for some of my difficulties
with work.

660
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:08,245
Do you worry about
your sanity?

661
00:31:11,182 --> 00:31:12,716
Um...

662
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,652
Other people sometimes
worry about it.

663
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,323
Like who?

664
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:24,227
As I said, I sometimes can

665
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:26,463
be found behaving in...

666
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,631
in an erratic fashion.

667
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:30,734
Sometimes I get very frustrated.

668
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,136
Very angry.

669
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,603
For no apparent reason.

670
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:36,473
For a reason which won't be apparent
to other people around me.

671
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:38,140
I don't see any way out.

672
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:41,145
I've thought of everything
I possibly could.

673
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:43,947
It seemed to me for a long time
that getting a reliable job

674
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:46,248
and a nice place to live
would be the solution.

675
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,485
Well, I haven't succeeded.

676
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:51,321
I can't see any immediate future
at all.

677
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:52,956
Although there have been times

678
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:54,991
in my life
when I've been suicidal,

679
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:57,861
that wasn't one of them.

680
00:31:57,862 --> 00:32:00,996
So there have been
worse than...

681
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:03,233
Yes, but it's not for
this program

682
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:05,034
to expose my private feelings,

683
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:07,170
and yet many people feel
it has.

684
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:08,871
Ultimately.

685
00:32:08,872 --> 00:32:12,575
Although this time round,
I've been far more candid

686
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:17,051
than I perhaps ever have
in the past.

687
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:24,287
My formal contact with
the psychiatric establishment

688
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:29,591
belongs mostly to my mid
and later teens

689
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:32,027
and a short period
of my early 20s.

690
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:35,098
But I soon came
to the opinion

691
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:38,569
that I could help myself
far better

692
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,571
than those who were
purporting to help me.

693
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:46,543
But I was aware even then that a
lot of the therapeutic technique

694
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:49,780
is about leading people
to exactly this conclusion,

695
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:51,447
if it's done well.

696
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:54,650
So I'm not going down the line
of criticizing

697
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,485
the medical establishment.

698
00:32:56,486 --> 00:33:01,992
But did you refuse to go
into any sort of treatment?

699
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:07,063
No, I did have contact.

700
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:09,933
But then you
discontinued it.

701
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,601
Yes.

702
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:14,638
Do you still think
that was wise?

703
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:17,713
Yes.

704
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,348
Are you scared
of getting old?

705
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:26,950
Yeah, I don't want to live
to be that old.

706
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:29,186
I think if I can reach
something like 70

707
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:30,652
or 75 in reasonable health,

708
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:32,525
that will be quite enough
for me.

709
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:36,493
When I get married,

710
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,629
I don't want to have
any children,

711
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,565
because they're always doing
naughty things

712
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:45,835
and making
the whole house untidy.

713
00:33:45,836 --> 00:33:52,141
I always told myself that I
would never have children.

714
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:54,311
Why?

715
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:57,414
Because...

716
00:33:57,415 --> 00:34:01,651
Well, because children inherit
something from their parents.

717
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:05,688
And even if my wife were
the most high-spirited

718
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:08,257
and ordinary and normal
of people,

719
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:11,561
the child would still stand
a very fair chance

720
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:16,199
of being not totally full
of happiness

721
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,769
because of what he or she will
have inherited from me.

722
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,339
Have you ever really had

723
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,375
a romantic emotional
relationship?

724
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:27,677
Oh, I've had several,

725
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:31,415
but the fact that I'm living
alone still

726
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:35,755
obviously betrays the fact that
none of them has endured.

727
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:41,890
Is there a reason
for that?

728
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:47,164
Relationships always involve
two people.

729
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:49,733
But the string of
failures,

730
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,702
does that tell us something?

731
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:53,803
Well, I'm sure it does.

732
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:56,372
Any fool can see that.

733
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:58,709
I'm not saying you're a fool.

734
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,744
What does it tell us?

735
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,144
It tells you what you like.

736
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:05,048
It tells you that I haven't been
successful in relationships.

737
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:08,052
It may tell you that I'm
intolerant.

738
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:11,655
But it more likely tells you
that I don't have

739
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:15,157
the capacity for making
a relationship work.

740
00:35:15,158 --> 00:35:18,428
But I must stress again
that it does take two.

741
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:23,767
I have never walked out of any
relationship with anyone.

742
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,137
It sounds like ghostly
colored people.

743
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:29,405
'Cause you think of
a purple person

744
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:32,874
with red eyes
and yellow feet.

745
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:36,745
You can't really think of what
they really look like.

746
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:39,849
I find it hard to believe
that I was ever like that,

747
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,350
but there's the evidence.

748
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:44,954
Probably when I was 7, I just
lived in a wonderful world

749
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:47,256
where everything
was a sensation.

750
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:51,561
I could be happy and I could be
miserable the next minute.

751
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:55,097
What makes you happy?

752
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:58,635
"Happy"
is a difficult word.

753
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,003
How many people are happy?

754
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:03,338
Perhaps we're most happy
when we're not aware of it

755
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:08,278
and enjoying a relaxed meal
with some friends.

756
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,745
Just being with friends.

757
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:11,847
I think the few weekends
in the year

758
00:36:11,848 --> 00:36:14,151
when I'm lucky to be able to
go and stay

759
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:17,186
with some of my long-term friends,
I'm really happy.

760
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:19,321
I can think of hardly
anything better

761
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:21,157
than walking across
the fields

762
00:36:21,158 --> 00:36:25,160
when we just chat about the
things we're both interested in

763
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:28,664
and our aspirations, and I think
that's the noblest

764
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:32,334
and in many ways most satisfying
of relationships

765
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:34,037
you can possibly have.

766
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:36,673
How it would be if we lived
next-door to each other

767
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,841
I don't know,
it might be very different.

768
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:41,711
Maybe the joy in some
relationships is that

769
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:44,314
you see some people only
infrequently.

770
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,615
I don't think you ought to go
to university

771
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:48,385
if you want to be
an astronaut.

772
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,053
Watch this.

773
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:53,789
<i>Peter and Neil
were childhood friends</i>

774
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,191
<i>growing up in Liverpool.</i>

775
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:58,128
<i>Peter went
to a comprehensive school</i>

776
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:02,465
<i>and went on to get a history
degree from London University.</i>

777
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:05,602
I would like to think that
democracy is here to stay.

778
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:07,470
Perhaps we haven't got
full democracy.

779
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,671
In fact, we probably haven't,
but...

780
00:37:09,672 --> 00:37:11,207
It's a pretty good system.

781
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,343
Are you surprised by the
way England's being governed?

782
00:37:14,344 --> 00:37:16,745
I'm not surprised with
the people who govern it

783
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:18,716
at the moment right now.

784
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:22,586
I've even stopped being amazed.

785
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:26,088
Why?

786
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:29,425
Well, I don't want to get
dragged into party politics,

787
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:32,262
but basically this is the most
incompetent,

788
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:34,731
uncaring bloody shower
we've ever had.

789
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:36,399
<i>After "28 Up,"</i>

790
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,769
<i>Peter decided not to continue
in the film.</i>

791
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,338
Why did you pull out?

792
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:48,912
I pulled out because of...

793
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,879
the responses

794
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,282
and the reactions

795
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:58,687
that my participation drew
in the weeks afterwards.

796
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:01,959
Particularly in
the tabloid press.

797
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,260
They decided they were
going to portray me

798
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:09,198
as the angry young rad
in Thatcher's England.

799
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,434
Well, it's just the principle,
that's all there is to it.

800
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:14,905
I think I was articulating
at the time

801
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:18,707
what a lot of people of my age
and my background were thinking.

802
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,309
And I was an easy target.

803
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,845
They're part of it.
They perpetuate it.

804
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:28,218
But I was absolutely taken back,
completely, genuinely shocked,

805
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,686
at what I saw as
the level of malice

806
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:33,490
and ill-will
directed towards me.

807
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:36,593
Until you've experienced it
yourself,

808
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:41,731
you can't begin to appreciate
how it feels.

809
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:46,401
So now you're back.
So why did you come back?

810
00:38:46,402 --> 00:38:49,939
I feel a lot happier
with myself.

811
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,575
Happier in my own skin.

812
00:38:52,576 --> 00:38:55,343
And then secondly,
more specifically,

813
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:58,747
because I want to promote
the music and the band I'm in.

814
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:02,485
♪ It was a ghost town ♪

815
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:04,419
And what are you called?

816
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,689
We're called
the Good Intentions.

817
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,894
♪ But when he hit that bank... ♪

818
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:13,896
I'd always played
in rock bands.

819
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:17,267
Some of them
spectacularly bad bands.

820
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:20,336
What really got me into
this music

821
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:23,740
was being exposed to
the music of Graham Parsons,

822
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:27,610
'cause way back in the day,
I was a big Elvis Costello fan.

823
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:30,479
And I read an interview with him
in which he said, "if you think

824
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,749
I'm a good songwriter,
listen to Graham Parsons."

825
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,517
It was almost like an epiphany.

826
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:35,985
It was like I was hearing

827
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,722
the music I'd been waiting to
hear all my life.

828
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:45,193
Once, Caroline Sheffield said
she loved me.

829
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:48,331
And I'm going to marry...
many...

830
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:50,566
marry her when I grow up.

831
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,836
Doesn't appeal to me at all
at the moment,

832
00:39:52,837 --> 00:39:54,803
but I mean, what,
I'm just gone 20.

833
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:57,807
Haven't even been abroad yet
in my life.

834
00:39:57,808 --> 00:40:00,843
There's no way I'm going to
get settled down.

835
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:02,912
So, Paul, what do you want
to do?

836
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:07,216
Do you just want me and Peter to record
what we're doing and you'll work round it?

837
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:09,485
We were working in an office
together

838
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:11,387
when we joined
the office band

839
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:13,856
and that's how we got
to know each other.

840
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:16,758
So, Gabby, was it
love at first sight?

841
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:19,361
Well, I had a sneaking suspicion
that Pete liked me

842
00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:22,365
because he was really rude and
sarcastic to me all the time,

843
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,867
so I thought, "I think he's
probably quite keen."

844
00:40:24,868 --> 00:40:26,335
You know that's not true.

845
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:32,108
And you've always played
together since then?

846
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:33,577
Yeah, more or less.

847
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:36,478
We probably stopped for a while
when the kids were little.

848
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:42,251
Our boy is 19,
our daughter's 16.

849
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:44,053
And how
are they doing?

850
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:45,421
Great. Doing really good.

851
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:47,023
They're doing remarkably well.

852
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:49,992
Our son is in his first year
at university.

853
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:54,364
And our daughter is coming up
to her GCSEs.

854
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,104
Once you have your own kids,
you have this huge realization

855
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:04,640
of how your own parents
felt about you

856
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:06,343
and what they did for you.

857
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:09,044
What's the greatest gift
a parent can give a child?

858
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:12,448
It's their unstinting love
and support and their time.

859
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:15,852
Their time because I think
children value that

860
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:17,320
more than anything.

861
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:20,423
Unconditionally,
you giving them your time.

862
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,825
Well, if I can't be
an astronaut,

863
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:26,528
I'd like to be a Bridewell
sergeant in the police force,

864
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:27,930
like my dad is.

865
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:32,135
So are you under pressure
to get a job?

866
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:34,269
Yeah, I suspect I am
from my parents.

867
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,604
Keep dropping hints.

868
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:39,274
Teachers are undervalued
and underrated.

869
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:41,577
And the system's
beginning to crumble.

870
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:45,481
You know, people outside of it
don't realize that, but it is.

871
00:41:45,482 --> 00:41:47,850
And it's...
it's very disillusioning.

872
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:53,722
I left teaching not long after
that program.

873
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:57,559
And it was actually nothing
to do with the program.

874
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,196
That was a misunderstanding
at the time,

875
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:03,966
I think, which took hold
in the press.

876
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:07,202
I'd been planning to leave
teaching anyway.

877
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:08,805
And I just didn't see

878
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:11,608
a long-term future in it
for myself.

879
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:14,510
And I thought I had been honest
with myself about that

880
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:17,178
and honest to the kids I was
teaching at the time

881
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:18,981
and move on
to something else.

882
00:42:18,982 --> 00:42:22,619
<i>After teaching,
Peter studied law</i>

883
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,921
<i>and joined
the civil service.</i>

884
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:28,524
<i>Gabby also works there.</i>

885
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:34,329
Civil service, despite changes
currently taking place,

886
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,568
is still comparatively
a pretty decent employer.

887
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:43,106
What area of
the civil service are you in?

888
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:46,108
Department of Work
and Pensions.

889
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:49,945
I've changed the key...
an<i> F</i> sharp, sorry about that.

890
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:53,015
When Pete writes,
he often wants to share that

891
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:57,220
and at a fairly early stage talk
about what he's writing.

892
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:00,088
And if it's no good,
I have to tell him.

893
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:02,724
And that's quite difficult,
isn't it?

894
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:04,126
I'm sure it is, yeah.

So when we started work

897
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:16,271
Pete said to me, "I've got 120
song ideas to go through,"

898
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:19,675
and I said, "But of those 120,
we need to get it down

901
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,314
How do you take
criticism?

902
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:29,117
Well, I think I take it
better than I used to.

903
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:31,220
That's not setting the bar
very high, though.

904
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:32,622
No.

905

What have been for you
the best times?

906
00:43:35,158 --> 00:43:38,394
Tommy Smith scoring
the second goal in Rome.

907
00:43:38,395 --> 00:43:39,861
Definitely.

908
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:41,430
One of the all-times.

909
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:45,233
Which game was that?

910
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:49,704
That was the European Cup final,
1977.

911
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:51,941
That's still up there,
by the way.

912
00:43:51,942 --> 00:43:53,610

913

Getting married

two children

917

moments in my life.

What do you want

919

anymore ♪

924
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:36,885
I hesitate to say I think I have
made my mark now,

925
00:44:36,886 --> 00:44:39,488
because that sounds
horrendously vain.

926
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:45,727
But I've created a body of work
of which I feel very proud.

927
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:50,666
I feel I've achieved something
of lasting value.

928
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:54,070
And in the last two
or three years,

929
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:58,006
we have begun to become
reasonably successful

930
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:00,776
in terms of
critical responses.

931
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:06,182
We were voted the U.K.'s
Americana Act of the Year

932
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:10,287
at the British
Country Music Awards.

933
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:12,889
From time to time,
like anybody else,

934
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,258
I look back and think,
"I wish I hadn't done that,

935
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:20,662
I wish I'd done that
differently," but I don't think

936
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:23,166
really life is there
to be regretted.

937
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:28,738
Life is there to be lived, and I
feel the most important thing

938
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:30,372
is to feel that by and large

939
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:32,374
you haven't
compromised too much

940
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,477
and that you've
moved your life on

941
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:36,288
where you want
your life to go.

942
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:49,358
I would like to get married
when I grow up.

943
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,861
Well, I don't know
what sort of boy,

944
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:57,399
but I think one that...

945
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,169
That's not got a lot of money,

946
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,606
but has got some money,
not a lot.

947
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:07,943
<i>Jackie grew up
in London's East End.</i>

948
00:46:07,944 --> 00:46:10,179
Have you got
any boyfriends?

949
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:16,852
That's personal, isn't it?

950
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:20,590
<i>By the time she was 21,
Jackie had married Mick</i>

951
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:23,660
<i>and moved to the outskirts
of London.</i>

952
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:26,095
<i>She and Mick had decided
early on</i>

953
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:28,865
<i>that they didn't want
to have children.</i>

954
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:32,869
Basically, I would say that
would be far too selfish.

955
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:38,207
<i>By 35, she was divorced.</i>

956
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:43,245
We decided ourselves, I mean,
just between the two of us.

957
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:46,916
We knew it wasn't going
any further.

958
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:49,184
We both knew, I think,
at the end of the day,

959
00:46:49,185 --> 00:46:51,320
we would be happier
leading our own lives.

960
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:54,457
Oh...

961
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,325
And this one on, oh, yeah.

962
00:46:56,326 --> 00:46:58,861
Here we go.

963
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:01,831
Had a brief but very sweet
relationship,

964
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:04,334
the result of which
was Charlie.

965
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:08,937
I don't really want
Charlie to be an only.

966
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:12,008
I'd love him to
have brothers and sisters.

967
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:14,610
But not necessarily
loads of them.

968
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:16,278
One would do, actually.

969
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:19,048
Right, Charlie, there's yours.

970
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:22,684
Ooh!
Please eat it all up.

971
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:24,086
Oh!

972
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:26,055
And, James.

973
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:27,689
Thanks, Mum.

974
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,425
Good boy.

975
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:32,827
And last but not least...

976
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:35,097
You going to eat
that one for me?

977
00:47:35,098 --> 00:47:38,733
<i>After her relationship with
Charlie's father ended,</i>

978
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:42,338
<i>she met Ian, and they moved
to Scotland and had two sons.</i>

979
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,407
James.

980
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:47,410
<i>By 42, they had split up.</i>

981
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,714
Lee.

982
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:54,517
Go and get 'em!

983
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:58,086
<i>At 49, despite the split,
the family were living</i>

984
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:01,423
<i>in the same area
of Scotland.</i>

985
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:06,528
<i>Seven years later,
they're still there.</i>

986
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:11,032
So tell me
who lives where.

987
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:14,269
Um, Lee will be here
until October.

988
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,905
James is here

989
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:18,140
until he moves in with
his girlfriend,

990
00:48:18,141 --> 00:48:20,242
which I'm hoping
won't be too long.

991
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:23,412
Charlie's actually
already moved out

992
00:48:23,413 --> 00:48:25,081
because of his dad.

993
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:27,649
Or their dad,
I should say.

994
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:31,887
Um, because Ian's been
diagnosed with cancer.

995
00:48:31,888 --> 00:48:37,132
And it's stage four,
so it's quite advanced.

996
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:44,432
The strange part about this is,

997
00:48:44,433 --> 00:48:47,470
his mother has also got
cancer as well.

998
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:48,870
Your grandmother?

999
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:50,639
Their grandmother.

1000
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,443
Come on, swans!

1001
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:54,943
She's brilliant.

1002
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:58,247
If I could have chosen
a mother-in-law,

1003
00:48:58,248 --> 00:49:00,249
she was the one
I would have chosen.

1004
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,785
She's great for me,
she's absolutely brilliant with the children.

1005
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:07,122
And she's just always there when
I need her to be.

1006
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:09,358
She's terminal.

1007
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,861
How long has she got?

1008
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:13,461
Don't know.

1009
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:17,899
They don't know how long.

1010
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:23,805
I think they're talking months
rather than years.

1011
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:25,374
And to have mother and son

1012
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:29,077
suffering the same sort of thing
is very difficult.

1013
00:49:29,078 --> 00:49:32,081
She doesn't want us
to be sorry

1014
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:34,716
and be sad, she wants us
to go on and live our lives

1015
00:49:34,717 --> 00:49:37,419
and it's not stopped her
from trying to live her life.

1016
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:42,291
It seems to have been
one thing after another.

1017
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:45,193
My stepmom died,
my brother-in-law died,

1018
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,296
my sister's died.

1019
00:49:47,297 --> 00:49:49,332
She wasn't 50.

1020
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,635
She'd actually gone downstairs
and made herself a cup of tea

1021
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:54,903
and collapsed on her way back up
to her bedroom

1022
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:57,907
with a major brain hemorrhage.

1023
00:49:57,908 --> 00:50:02,979
So, boys, how is your
mother handling all this?

1024
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,646
Uh, in her stride.

1025
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:07,448
Nothing seems to be getting
to her.

1026
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:10,153
She's always been
a strong woman.

1027
00:50:10,154 --> 00:50:12,787
She will be upset, but she won't
let us see it.

1028
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:15,224
She's always a brave face
in front of us,

1029
00:50:15,225 --> 00:50:17,325
and then when she's alone
or with her friends,

1030
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:19,294
that's when she
gets the sadness out.

1031
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:22,899
This is a period when
the four of you feel close?

1032
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,200
All: Mm-hmm.

1033
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:26,802
Got to be there for each other
in things like this.

1034
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:29,972
Actually, I would say
in the last six months,

1035
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:34,610
they've all suddenly seemed to
have gotten maturity.

1036
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:38,247
My mum, 'cause she got
five girls,

1037
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:40,316
she has seven years bad luck.

1038
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:42,584
That's why she's got five girls.

1039
00:50:42,585 --> 00:50:45,120
Two club sandwiches
on brown bread,

1040
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:46,921
one Hilton burger with cheese.

1041
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:49,224
Yes, chef.

1042
00:50:49,225 --> 00:50:53,461
<i>Charlie is a sous chef
in a nearby hotel.</i>

1043
00:50:53,462 --> 00:50:57,767
<i>And James works part-time
as a security guard</i>

1044
00:50:57,768 --> 00:50:59,202
<i>in a local supermarket.</i>

1045
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:01,803
Check two aisles up
from your current location.

1046
00:51:01,804 --> 00:51:05,441
I expect my baby in December.

1047
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:07,809
We're still young, obviously,
so it's a bit

1048
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,613
of a shock, but I am excited
about it.

1049
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:12,280
How old are you now?

1050
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,615
19, coming on 20.

1051
00:51:13,616 --> 00:51:16,751
Are you excited
to be a gran?

1052
00:51:16,752 --> 00:51:18,186
Couldn't bear that.

1053
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:20,323
She doesn't like
being called "granny."

1054
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:23,559
No, I will be "gran,"
not "granny," thank you.

1055
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,028
Not nappy full now,
please, madam.

1056
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:28,997
Oh, look at the face.

1057
00:51:28,998 --> 00:51:31,466
Well, since you were here
recently,

1058
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:34,169
we've had a new addition
to the family.

1059
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,204
Her name is Mia.

1060
00:51:36,205 --> 00:51:40,508
Mia was born
on the 21st of November.

1061
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:44,646
And unfortunately, on the 18th
of November, her granddad,

1062
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,381
Ian, the boys' dad,

1063
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:50,151
was severely injured
in a road traffic accident.

1064
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:54,557
He subsequently died
of those injuries.

1065
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:57,124
Unfortunately, he never regained
consciousness

1066
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:59,762
so he never even met her.

1067
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:03,999
But he took a photo of her
in his coffin, and I dare say

1068
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,369
he's looking down and saying,
"Ha, I got away with it.

1069
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,920
I've not got all those nights."

1070
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,343
I'm due to go into the Army
on the 17th of October,

1071
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:16,778
where I'll learn to become
a medic.

1072
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:18,646
I can't stop him now.

1073
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:20,548
He's 18, he can do what
he likes.

1074
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:22,517
He can sign on
without my approval.

1075
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:25,287
But it's a chance he takes,
and he knows that there's

1076
00:52:25,288 --> 00:52:27,389
a possibility
that he won't come home.

1077
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,224
At the end of the day,
you're a soldier

1078
00:52:29,225 --> 00:52:31,193
and going to war is part
of being a soldier

1079
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:32,660
and that's what
you got to do.

1080
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:36,131
I want you to do it, but it's
not going to stop me worrying.

1081
00:52:36,132 --> 00:52:39,536
You know that.
You know that.

1082
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:43,206
I took a year off when
I had Charlie

1083
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:45,774
and the state kept me
for that year.

1084
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:48,443
But I went back to work,
and although,

1085
00:52:48,444 --> 00:52:51,512
to be honest, by the time
I pay everything out,

1086
00:52:51,513 --> 00:52:55,117
I'm not actually that much
better off, but I feel better.

1087
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:57,986
James, you watch,
you're catching up to him.

1088
00:52:57,987 --> 00:52:59,454
Go on, Lee.

1089
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:02,758
I was working up here
until very recently.

1090
00:53:02,759 --> 00:53:06,461
But then discovered that I've
got rheumatoid arthritis.

1091
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:10,566
So at the moment,
that's put work on hold.

1092
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:13,369
Misty, come on then.

1093
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:18,274
For every one good day I have,
I can have two bad.

1094
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:22,245
Which means I can't get out
of bed very well.

1095
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:24,378
It takes me two, three hours
to get ready.

1096
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:26,115
The poor,

1097
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:29,418
if you don't help them, they'll
sort of die, wouldn't they?

1098
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:33,021
<i>Jackie has been living
on disability benefits</i>

1099
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:35,090
<i>for over 14 years.</i>

1100
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:37,360
I don't cope financially.

1101
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:40,028
Without my mother-in-law
stepping in to fill the gap,

1102
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:42,331
I wouldn't be coping.

1103
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:45,100
It's really hard to explain
to anyone

1104
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:46,802
who's not had to do it.

1105
00:53:46,803 --> 00:53:48,604
You get to a point where,

1106
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:51,439
either that bill doesn't get
paid or your children don't eat;

1107
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,844
so, obviously,
your children eat.

1108
00:53:55,844 --> 00:53:59,113
So, looking
at the world of cutbacks,

1109
00:53:59,114 --> 00:54:01,816
how is this affecting you?

1110
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:06,021
I, along with probably millions
of other people in this country,

1111
00:54:06,022 --> 00:54:08,923
have had my benefits reviewed.

1112
00:54:08,924 --> 00:54:12,528
And they sent me for a medical

1113
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:16,532
and have come back and told me
I'm fit to work.

1114
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:19,367
Which is a bit of a shock.

1115
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:23,604
What job can I do?
I can't use my hands.

1116
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:25,407
I can't sit for long.

1117
00:54:25,408 --> 00:54:29,711
I can't stand for long.
I can't walk very far.

1118
00:54:29,712 --> 00:54:36,686
I don't know how they expect
anybody to employ me.

1119
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:39,655
Because I couldn't guarantee
being there five days a week.

1120
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:44,626
I mean, I'm lucky inasmuch
as I've got three sons

1121
00:54:44,627 --> 00:54:47,762
all working,
whilst James here has got

1122
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:51,066
Mia and a family of his own.

1123
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:54,669
Charlie and Lee don't,
so they help me out.

1124
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,607
They have to.

1125
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:01,477
By all means,
cut the benefits.

1126
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:03,812
But you've got people out there
that are healthy

1127
00:55:03,813 --> 00:55:07,515
and are milking the system.

1128
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:10,986
And they're not touching them.
They're getting away with it.

1129
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:16,024
If David Cameron can find me
a job, then I'll go to work.

1130
00:55:16,025 --> 00:55:20,461
You tell him to come get me
a job and I'll do it.

1131
00:55:20,462 --> 00:55:25,133
I know he loves her
and he loves her.

1132
00:55:25,134 --> 00:55:27,436
I don't, I love him.

1133
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:31,939
I'd like to be able
to have a happy family.

1134
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,477
I mean, I know it's not possible
to be happy all the time,

1135
00:55:35,478 --> 00:55:37,646
but as much of the time
as possible.

1136
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:40,082
What about your own life?

1137
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,818
What about relationships
for you?

1138
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:44,921
I would like
a relationship.

1139
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:47,423
I've been trying
for the last five years

1140
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:49,724
to build up a social life
of my own.

1141
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:54,229
Because I knew
that this time would come.

1142
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,698
I've been using the Internet,

1143
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:00,202
which is interesting,
to say the least.

1144
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:02,204
Is it scary?

1145
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:04,206
I mean, some people

1146
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:07,209
have obviously
had bad experiences with it.

1147
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,780
There was a chap
that we filmed when we were

1148
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:14,381
looking at you and Liz...
what happened to him?

1149
00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:16,684
He decided
he needed space.

1150
00:56:16,685 --> 00:56:18,820
So I gave him that space.

1151
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:21,756
So that was a bit of
a disaster.

1152
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:23,992
But that's the way

1153
00:56:23,993 --> 00:56:28,162
of relationships... sometimes
they work, sometimes they don't.

1154
00:56:28,163 --> 00:56:31,200
What are you
looking for in a fella?

1155
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:34,537
Pulse would be nice.

1156
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:39,675
♪ If I said that I love you
and you know it's true ♪

1157
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:43,512
You look great,
you seem optimistic.

1158
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:46,280
Yeah, no, I am.

1159
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:48,983
My glass is always half full,
never half empty.

1160
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:55,890
And that's the way it will
continue to be, I hope.

1161
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:58,727
Life's too short

1162
00:56:58,728 --> 00:57:02,631
and you just have to try and go
on the best you can.

1163
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:05,969
And I think my life
is going to be good.

1164
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,620
What sort of things
do you do?

1165
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:27,823
Ride, swim,
play tennis.

1166
00:57:27,824 --> 00:57:31,225
Ping-pong.

1167
00:57:31,226 --> 00:57:33,561
And I might play croquet.

1168
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:35,430
Things like that.

1169
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:38,733
I don't think my father wants me
to be a farmer.

1170
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:40,803
My youngest brother's
the deaf one,

1171
00:57:40,804 --> 00:57:43,905
if he can't do anything else,
he can probably run a farm.

1172
00:57:43,906 --> 00:57:47,876
I thought that you and I were
both in the film as being

1173
00:57:47,877 --> 00:57:50,945
rural, in the sense that
your family

1174
00:57:50,946 --> 00:57:53,648
had some big connections

1175
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:56,285
to sort of rural Scotland.

1176
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:59,320
I think also,
when we were 21,

1177
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:02,390
I remember having to go
to some reunion somewhere,

1178
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:05,894
and I remember you just
stuck out as being

1179
00:58:05,895 --> 00:58:09,597
the one person that I had more
in common with

1180
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:11,069
and spoke to the most.

1181
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:17,204
We'd been e-mailing
each other

1182
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:19,508
since forty-something...

1183
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,378
It was one night,
I think it was quite late,

1184
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:25,213
and I just threw a line at Nick,
I said,

1185
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:26,782
"I'm going to bed now.

1186
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:30,553
Perhaps you and I ought to do
a double act on the sofa."

1187
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:37,158
I mean...

1188
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,394
And he wrote back some
funny message.

1189
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:41,662
No wonder!
I would, wouldn't I?

1190
00:58:41,663 --> 00:58:44,399
When I leave the school,

1191
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,068
I'm down for Heathfield
and Southover Manor.

1192
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:52,374
And then maybe I may want
to go to an university,

1193
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,041
but I don't know
which one yet.

1194
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:56,445
My home life
wasn't very easy then.

1195
00:58:56,446 --> 00:59:00,215
I'd been sent off to boarding
school when I was quite young.

1196
00:59:00,216 --> 00:59:02,584
My parents' marriage
was breaking up.

1197
00:59:02,585 --> 00:59:04,419
And like
a lot of children,

1198
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,122
I think you feel that you take
the blame

1199
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:08,823
for why they've broken up.

1200
00:59:08,824 --> 00:59:12,727
That's just the way it was,
and I hated the two years

1201
00:59:12,728 --> 00:59:15,898
I was away at this first
boarding school, and I think

1202
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:17,899
that was probably
what changed me.

1203
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,669
Well, I hated boarding school,
too, with a passion.

1204
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,504
I was forced to grow,
I didn't choose it.

1205
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:26,374
I definitely got some messages
that said,

1206
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:28,577
"You're going to be
in trouble

1207
00:59:28,578 --> 00:59:32,713
if you don't do well,"
and so on.

1208
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:34,483
But you don't regret it.

1209
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:37,718
And you wouldn't have
the life you have now.

1210
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:41,823
Hey, I'm grateful for it,
but it was very uncomfortable.

1211
00:59:41,824 --> 00:59:44,459
I was never one
to push myself forward.

1212
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,561
And nobody else
was pushing.

1213
00:59:46,562 --> 00:59:47,995
And no one else
pushed me.

1214
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:51,934
I left school when I was 16.
I went to Paris.

1215
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:55,370
I went to secretarial college
and got a job.

1216
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:59,274
What made you decide to
leave school and go to Paris?

1217
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:02,144
Well, I just wasn't interested
in school

1218
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:04,079
and just wanted to get away.

1219
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,914
If you had had no choice

1220
01:00:05,915 --> 01:00:09,151
but to get out there and support
yourself,

1221
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:10,885
the chances would
have been greater

1222
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:13,021
that you would have forced
yourself to do it.

1223
01:00:13,022 --> 01:00:17,024
Yeah, that's possibly true,
but at the age of...

1224
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:20,863
11, 12, 13, are you really
aware of that?

1225
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:24,265
Now, that's
a very telling question.

1226
01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:27,102
In my world, you betcha.

1227
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:30,405
When I grow up,
I'd like to find out

1228
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:33,140
all about the moon and all that.

1229
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,510
And I said I was interested
in physics and chemistry,

1230
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,012
I'm not going
to do that here.

1231
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:40,649
<i>At 14, Nick was away
at boarding school.</i>

1232
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,400
<i>At 21, reading physics
at Oxford.</i>

1233
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:48,456
<i>His road to Oxford started
in a one-room village school.</i>

1234
01:00:48,457 --> 01:00:49,858
My father was here.

1235
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:52,126
A long time ago, he must be
somewhere in these pictures.

1236
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:54,863
I remember distinctly
coming here one day

1237
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:57,566
and I'd missed a day
for some reason

1238
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,702
and they'd been talking about
something to do with aeroplanes.

1239
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:02,903
And the teacher said,
"We missed you

1240
01:01:02,904 --> 01:01:05,640
because you would have known
about aeroplanes."

1241
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:08,376
I knew nothing about aeroplanes,
but I thought,

1242
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,579
"Oh, I know about aeroplanes,
do I?"

1243
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,381
So then I went off
and read about aeroplanes.

1244
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:15,850
That could easily have been
the start of,

1245
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:17,619
"I want to go
to the moon."

1246
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,821
I think she planted
that idea in me.

1247
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:22,395
Do you have
a girlfriend?

1248
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:28,097
I don't want to answer that.

1249
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:32,700
I don't want to answer
those kind of questions.

1250
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:35,771
I thought that one would
come up,

1251
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:39,173
because when I was doing
the other one, somebody said,

1252
01:01:39,174 --> 01:01:41,443
"What do you think about girls?"

1253
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:43,378
And I said, "I don't answer
questions like that."

1254
01:01:43,379 --> 01:01:44,878
Is that the reason
you're asking it?

1255
01:01:44,879 --> 01:01:47,082
The best answer would be to say

1256
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,084
that I don't answer questions
like that.

1257
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:52,820
You know, it was what I said
when I was 7,

1258
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:55,090
and it's still
the most sensible,

1259
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:57,425
but what about them?

1260
01:01:57,426 --> 01:02:01,896
If you'd been somebody who
had had fixed ideas

1261
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:04,566
of a woman's role in marriage
that meant

1262
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:07,468
dinner on the table
at 6:00 every evening...

1263
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,671
Didn't I tell you
about that?

1264
01:02:09,672 --> 01:02:14,943
<i>By 28, Nick had married Jackie,
a fellow student from Oxford.</i>

1265
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:19,414
<i>They had a son, Adam.
By 42, they were divorced.</i>

1266
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:21,849
What I've concluded, and
I've talked to other people

1267
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,485
about this
who've gone through it...

1268
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:27,055
I'm not sure if they feel it as strongly
as I did, but it was like a death.

1269
01:02:27,056 --> 01:02:30,524
Anything could happen.
We could easily drift apart.

1270
01:02:30,525 --> 01:02:32,260
There are so many pressures...

1271
01:02:32,261 --> 01:02:35,329
If your spouse died,
you could look back and think,

1272
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,999
"well, it was wonderful
while it lasted."

1273
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,936
But in a divorce,
you can't look back and say,

1274
01:02:42,937 --> 01:02:44,939
"these are all happy memories."

1275
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,041
Hey!

1276
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:52,347
Cryss is my new wife.

1277
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:55,249
I don't mean to be superficial,
but I think

1278
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,320
she's the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

1279
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:00,055
Is he sexy?

1280
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:01,223
Oh, man.

1281
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:07,561
Absolutely.

1282
01:03:07,562 --> 01:03:11,032
Didn't you have fun
with that one?

1283
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:14,736
I always need to learn
patience and...

1284
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:17,037
What do I need to learn?

1285
01:03:17,038 --> 01:03:18,840
Shall I get out my list?

1286
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:20,575
Yeah, we need the list.

1287
01:03:20,576 --> 01:03:22,044
Go on.

1288
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:23,378
Um...

1289
01:03:23,379 --> 01:03:27,615
Tell me, do you have
any boyfriends, Suzy?

1290
01:03:27,616 --> 01:03:29,249
Um...

1291
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,485
Yes.

1292
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:32,620
Tell me about him.

1293
01:03:32,621 --> 01:03:34,923
But he lives off in Scotland

1294
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:38,360
and I think he's 13.

1295
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:41,699
Have you got
any boyfriends, Suzy?

1296
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:48,975
What is your attitude
towards marriage for yourself?

1297
01:03:52,975 --> 01:03:55,077
I haven't given it
a lot of thought,

1298
01:03:55,078 --> 01:03:57,378
because I'm very, very
cynical about it.

1299
01:03:57,379 --> 01:04:00,849
When I last saw you
at 21, you were nervous,

1300
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:03,751
you were chain-smoking,
you were uptight,

1301
01:04:03,752 --> 01:04:05,385
and now you seem happy?

1302
01:04:05,386 --> 01:04:08,856
What's happened to you over
these last seven years?

1303
01:04:08,857 --> 01:04:11,425
I suppose Rupert.

1304
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:13,428
I'll give you some credit.

1305
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:17,664
I'm now chain-smoking.

1306
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:22,503
I think you can't just walk
through a marriage

1307
01:04:22,504 --> 01:04:25,340
and think once you get married,
it's all going to be

1308
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:26,907
roses and everything forever.

1309
01:04:26,908 --> 01:04:29,678
It's very hard to actually say
what it is

1310
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,314
that goes on
between a couple.

1311
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:35,115
It's either there
or it's not.

1312
01:04:35,116 --> 01:04:38,720
Any marriage
has its ups and downs.

1313
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:42,157
But somehow,
whether it's through luck

1314
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:46,593
or determination, we've
worked through

1315
01:04:46,594 --> 01:04:48,600
the difficult times.

1316
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:58,039
One of my favorite
places in Oxford,

1317
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,075
Merton Chapel.

1318
01:05:01,076 --> 01:05:03,678
Here's this lovely top part
of the cross.

1319
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,782
And there was going to be
the main part of the cross.

1320
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:10,117
This is one of the places
in England

1321
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,620
that just is tremendously
important to me.

1322
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:15,390
After I left the Dales,
this was where I spent

1323
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:18,227
the next six years,
and then I went to America.

1324
01:05:18,228 --> 01:05:22,229
Look, isn't this beautiful?
This is Mob Quad.

1325
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,932
I believe that it's
a historical fact

1326
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:29,003
that quite a lot students were
massacred in the middle ages.

1327
01:05:29,004 --> 01:05:31,840
When I came here, I thought I'd
died and gone to heaven.

1328
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:33,274
But I was under an awful lot

1329
01:05:33,275 --> 01:05:35,778
of stress
all the time I was here

1330
01:05:35,779 --> 01:05:38,680
trying to succeed in this place
as well.

1331
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:42,416
So this was my staircase
in my first year

1332
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:44,751
and also in my third year.

1333
01:05:44,752 --> 01:05:47,756
There was this fellow
who lived in the room nextdoor to me

1334
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:49,457
and he came in one day
to tell me some story.

1335
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,892
And on his way out, he said, "Do you know,

1336
01:05:51,893 --> 01:05:55,329
I don't associate intelligence
with your accent."

1337
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:57,399
It would seem really ridiculous

1338
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,568
to any of my friends
who watch this if I said,

1339
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:03,037
"Christ, aren't I
a great success?

1340
01:06:03,038 --> 01:06:04,039
Look at me!"

1341
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,807
You know, what success?

1342
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:10,945
<i>By the time he was 28,
Nick had emigrated to America.</i>

1343
01:06:10,946 --> 01:06:13,814
<i>He was doing research
into nuclear fusion</i>

1344
01:06:13,815 --> 01:06:18,019
<i>at the University
of Wisconsin.</i>

1345
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,155
If you'd been offered

1346
01:06:20,156 --> 01:06:22,957
a similar type of job
over here...

1347
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,459
In a heartbeat.

1348
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,361
You would have stayed.

1349
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:28,762
In a heartbeat.

1350
01:06:28,763 --> 01:06:33,168
I mean, I dreamed of getting
a university job over here.

1351
01:06:33,169 --> 01:06:36,905
Maggie Thatcher was squeezing
the universities

1352
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:40,175
like crazy at that very moment
in time.

1353
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:43,778
And it was the worst time to be
working in a university

1354
01:06:43,779 --> 01:06:45,379
in generations.

1355
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,582
England doesn't seem
to concern itself

1356
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:52,820
with training people like me
and wanting them around.

1357
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:56,091
There doesn't seem to be
a sense of urgency

1358
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:59,994
or a strong will to have people
developing technology

1359
01:06:59,995 --> 01:07:02,530
to help keep the country going.

1360
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:05,700
The fusion reaction
gives off energy and produces

1361
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:08,870
the power that would
be turned into electrical...

1362
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:11,338
I was on a mission, you know,

1363
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:15,577
to get extremely cheap, clean,
plentiful electricity.

1364
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:18,479
So nuclear fusion looked like
it was going to do that.

1365
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,550
But even then, they were saying
"it's 20 years away."

1366
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:25,220
I would say absolutely not
in my lifetime.

1367
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:28,122
It was kind of heartbreaking.

1368
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:32,260
So I had to find
something else to do.

1369
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:36,331
So the area that I'm looking at
is this times this.

1370
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:39,133
When I go into a classroom
full of undergraduates,

1371
01:07:39,134 --> 01:07:41,702
I try and explain to them
why they might want

1372
01:07:41,703 --> 01:07:43,470
to try and do it.

1373
01:07:43,471 --> 01:07:45,439
That's my attempt to open
a little door for them.

1374
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,512
<i>Nick is a professor
of electrical engineering.</i>

1375
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:54,048
My ambition as a scientist
is to be

1376
01:07:54,049 --> 01:07:56,617
more famous for doing science
than for being in this film.

1377
01:07:56,618 --> 01:07:59,068
Unfortunately, Michael,
it's not going to happen.

1378
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:04,763
When I get married,
I'd like to have two children.

1379
01:08:07,763 --> 01:08:10,865
I'm not very
children-minded at the moment.

1380
01:08:10,866 --> 01:08:14,102
I don't know
if I ever will be.

1381
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:16,303
What do you think
about them?

1382
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,372
Well, I don't like babies.

1383
01:08:18,373 --> 01:08:24,646
<i>At 28, Suzy had two sons...
Thomas and Oliver.</i>

1384
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:26,180
Come catch it.

1385
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:30,419
<i>By the time she was 35, she
also had a daughter, Laura.</i>

1386
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,655
Mummy? Laura wants you.

1387
01:08:33,656 --> 01:08:36,090
We were lucky.

1388
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:41,495
We had a very good family unit
with them growing up.

1389
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:43,331
And that meant an awful lot
to me,

1390
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,265
that I was able to do that
for them,

1391
01:08:45,266 --> 01:08:47,068
'cause I never had it
for myself.

1392
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:50,003
And you've done it, you've been
tremendously successful at it.

1393
01:08:50,004 --> 01:08:52,274
Well, see, that's my problem.

1394
01:08:52,275 --> 01:08:55,242
I don't think of myself
as being...

1395
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:58,846
I just do my best and do
what I can for them.

1396
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:02,650
Did all your children

1397
01:09:02,651 --> 01:09:04,752
go to university
or your daughter did?

1398
01:09:04,753 --> 01:09:08,957
Yes, and my son did,
the eldest one.

1399
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,958
Hello.

1400
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:15,596
I haven't had a successful
career, but I do feel fulfilled.
