1
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,506
Welcome.

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,145
I have heard many things about you.

3
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:47,745
I came to meet a child
called Hwang Seon Ah.

4
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:51,335
Is it true that she is here?

5
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:53,845
Yes, she is.

6
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,385
How is she doing?

7
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:03,365
She has recently been very shocked to find out that
former Headmaster Hwang Moo Song is not her real father.

8
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:08,526
However, isn't everything in the process
of returning back to it's place?

9
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:14,445
Moorim Association is hoping
you'll find your daughter

10
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:20,405
as well as the key to Cheon Ui Joo that
Hwang Moo Song hid within the school

11
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:25,936
in order for everything to
return to its original state.

12
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:34,076
Please let me meet Yeong.

13
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:38,745
<i>Do you really think the barrier
Hwang Moo Song erected</i>

14
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:42,285
<i>is there solely to protect you?</i>

15
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:44,665
<i>Everything leading to the
Headmaster's departure</i>

16
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,846
<i>was well planned by your father.</i>

17
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:54,205
<i>I won't avoid it.</i>

18
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:58,646
<i>In my own way, I'm going to fight, head on.</i>

19
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:06,946
<i>Moorim School - Episode 15 -</i>

20
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:14,175
What are you doing, Yoon Si Woo?

21
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,756
Do you remember me?

22
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:26,895
Oh, you at that time...

23
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:31,675
If you're going to go to Seon
Ah, please give her more time.

24
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:35,115
She is very confused right now.

25
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:41,115
Even if you are her real dad, if you meet her
before the headmaster commotion is dealt with,

26
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:42,735
you will only make things harder for her.

27
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:45,625
Yoon Si Woo! You are crossing the line.

28
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:47,955
What qualifies you to say such things?

29
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:51,106
I am speaking as her friend.

30
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:58,876
If you are her father, I believe
that you will understand.

31
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:04,635
Alright.

32
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:06,896
I will do so.

33
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:17,576
What is it?

34
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:26,736
Don't be shocked and listen.

35
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:31,466
Your real father came here to see you.

36
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:36,076
What?

37
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:41,145
If you're not ready, no one will
force you to meet him immediately.

38
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:45,765
He also seems to have
understood that you need time.

39
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:50,555
If the man I've thought was my father

40
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:55,396
and I've lived with
wasn't really my father,

41
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:04,545
but could everything he said to
me during that time been true?

42
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:09,135
I really don't know what's true anymore.

43
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:12,105
You should know best.

44
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:18,436
The fact that the love and care of the Headmaster
for you all of this time wasn't a lie.

45
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:33,536
I'm sorry, but today will be difficult.

46
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:38,316
Alright.

47
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:46,696
I guess I only thought too much of myself.

48
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:55,656
When Yeong's feelings are
ready, then I will return.

49
00:04:57,376 --> 00:05:01,936
But can I ask you something?

50
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:12,275
How come you are here with
people from the Shanghai Group?

51
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:13,775
What do you mean?

52
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:19,876
Not long ago, Chairman Wang orchestrated the
kidnapping of a fellow student called Sim Soon Deok.

53
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:26,735
It was an incident stemming from
mistaking her with Seon Ah.

54
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:30,095
Although he said it was to let
Seon Ah know the truth, but

55
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,776
there are many aspects that
make it very doubtful.

56
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:37,145
Could you have known about that?

57
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,146
Right now,

58
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:43,295
I can't really understand
what you're talking about.

59
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:50,936
Chairman Wang said that Headmaster Hwang set fire
to the house and kidnapped Seon Ah that day.

60
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,205
However, I think differently.

61
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:59,205
Can I ask what your opinion is?

62
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:02,326
The headmaster said he
went to save his friend

63
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:05,586
but he was too late.

64
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,766
I think what he said was true.

65
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,486
Yes.

66
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:18,316
It could be.

67
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:35,655
<i>If it's too hard by yourself, tell me.</i>

68
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:39,135
<i>You can share everything with me.
After all,</i>

69
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:41,516
<i>I'm your daughter.</i>

70
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:49,295
<i>I thought I could understand
everything about my dad,</i>

71
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:51,365
<i>but I didn't even ask Dad directly,</i>

72
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:56,375
<i>while looking into his
eyes, what the truth is.</i>

73
00:06:56,376 --> 00:07:00,235
<i>Did you really kill my real father and
make me live in a lie all this time?</i>

74
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:04,536
<i>- Seon Ah... - I never want to
see someone like you again.</i>

75
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:13,655
<i>Dad... Right now, I</i>

76
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:17,075
<i>really don't like this
hateful image of myself</i>

77
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:23,496
<i>who is suspicious and resentful.</i>

78
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:34,706
What did you discuss with that student?

79
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:41,065
<i>I think Chairman Wang is
the destructive force.</i>

80
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:44,585
<i>His goal is the Cheon Ui Joo.</i>

81
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:50,026
<i>He doesn't even hide his intentions and
will do whatever it takes to get it.</i>

82
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:54,106
<i>Did you know all those things?</i>

83
00:07:56,326 --> 00:08:00,666
He was just being concerned, as a friend.

84
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,335
You arrived.

85
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:23,516
Did you know I was coming?

86
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:26,736
Please come inside.

87
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:33,956
You know what is the Cheon
Ui Joo key, don't you?

88
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:47,286
Eighteen years ago, were you there?

89
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:56,365
I don't know who they were, but

90
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:59,725
I only know that those people
were after the Cheon Ui Joo.

91
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:04,706
I did not come here to blame you
or make you repent for anything.

92
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:10,286
Please tell me everything about that day.

93
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:19,785
I am sorry, but I cannot
take you to Shanghai.

94
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:23,786
I told the Chairman you
were planning to leave.

95
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:27,375
He couldn't have welcomed that.

96
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:29,755
- Yes, so now it would... - Do not

97
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:31,295
tell me to calm down.

98
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:35,416
If anything like Soon
Deok's kidnapping happens,

99
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,556
I will not remain still.

100
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,635
Keep that in mind.

101
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:50,636
I will never be fooled again like that.

102
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:57,565
As I was leaving with the
child, I was attacked by them.

103
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:02,606
And unfortunately lost the
child in the process.

104
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:05,775
I kept thinking he would've died
in the burning house anyway

105
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,495
that it's not my fault

106
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:10,916
and I should just forget it but then

107
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,885
- But?
- He was found in the woods and saved.

108
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:21,835
That child is in that
school with Soon Deok.

109
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:27,366
I guess this is a case of fate
eventually returning like this.

110
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:31,016
What do you mean?

111
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:35,376
This child... is in the school?

112
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:39,905
Didn't you come here being
aware of everything?

113
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:46,895
Yoon Si Woo... haven't you
heard everything from him?

114
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,506
Is it really the child that
you rescued from the fire?

115
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:55,286
Are you saying it is Yoon Si Woo?

116
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:03,345
<i>The people back then who
set the house on fire,</i>

117
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:07,515
<i>are looking for that child
and are watching you.</i>

118
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:11,355
<i>If you don't want to suffer any
consequences from that event,</i>

119
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:15,026
<i>please don't tell this story to anyone.</i>

120
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,366
I still don't understand
everything about my dad.

121
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:33,706
Still, the day that I
will see my dad again,

122
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:41,836
I think I shouldn't let him see me as weak.

123
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:45,785
I will ask this to my real dad,

124
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:49,176
why is he with people
from the Shanghai Group?

125
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,756
I want to see you, Dad.

126
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,546
Are you okay?

127
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,006
Are you okay?

128
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,055
Your skills are indeed
quite underdeveloped.

129
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:31,576
Who's next? Go Sang Man.

130
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:35,336
- Go Sang Man?- Y-yes?

131
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,096
I'll do it.

You said because we've been fighting with
our bare hands or with wooden swords,

143
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:58,516
no one could feel true
panic or fear, right?

144

You were wrong.

145
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:02,605
What was I wrong about?

146
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:09,135
What we learned here isn't terrorizing
people with knives or weapons.

147
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:13,255
You can feel that once you take one
step outside of the school anyway.

148
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:16,545
So what is the greatest fear

149
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:19,925
that you experienced in this school?

150
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,985
Overcoming people without having
real skills, like you do,

151
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:29,456
your never ending greed
that has mercy for none...

152
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:36,185
That scares you?

153
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:39,176
Those rotten thoughts...

154
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:45,006
Right now, how I want to make you
feel powerless exactly like you do..

155
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:52,306
Right now, I'm most scared of how I feel.

156
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:59,305
You could do something about it,

157
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:04,296
but you won't, is that what you are saying?

158
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:12,776
Please don't hurt my friends anymore.

159
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,645
This is my last warning.

171
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,906
Father. It's Chi Ang.

172
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:34,765
Please tell me everything.

173
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:42,766
I need to know all you
know and planning to do.

174
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:50,845
What did you just say?

175
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:55,236
I asked if Yoon is alive.

176
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:01,005
Right...

177
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:05,075
He's under Chairman Wang's protection now.

178
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:10,495
Could Yoon have joined forces with him?

179
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,835
If Yoon is on the same
side as Chariman Wang,

180
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:17,355
and if they know that you
know that Yoon is alive,

181
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:19,325
irreversible events will occur.

182
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:24,646
I need to meet Yoon and
tell him everything myself.

183
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:30,045
I'm positive Wang Hao
is scheming something.

184
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:36,416
It's dangerous for you to meet him alone.
I will gather some people for you.

185
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:47,435
That is one of the three missing key
parts that were lost 18 years ago.

186
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:51,315
The one that Hwang Seon Ah had
is probably with Hwang Moo Song.

187
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:55,866
And the other is probably
with Chae Yoon's lost son.

188
00:17:56,636 --> 00:18:02,056
Is this the real reason why
you sent me to that school?

189
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:05,246
Yes.

190
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:09,306
Did you think I would help you?

191
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:12,636
I am a businessman.

192
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,376
I will not spend money, time or resources

193
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:23,026
on people I don't think will succeed.
I believe in you.

194
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:28,475
You believe in me?

195
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:31,245
Don't look back if you're going
after something you want.

196
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:36,625
Also, remember the promise I made.

197
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:42,035
If I receive something, I will give
something at least as valuable in return.

198
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:48,285
I didn't come here for this give-take talk.
I'm here for the truth.

199
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:53,775
Tell me something that could truly
make me feel I need to help you.

200
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:55,456
Sincerity?

201
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:01,835
You still talk like a young child.

202
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,445
With such a desperate mind, I came here.

203
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:08,706
It means, that's how much you are wavering.

204
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:19,525
When I was little, you told me this.

205
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:25,255
Even if I fall, I should survive
and thrive, like a lion cub.

206
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:31,646
You said that's how fathers
should raise their children.

207
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:37,066
If this time, I don't do
what you're asking me to do,

208
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,526
what will become of me?

209
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:42,636
And...

210
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:47,816
what about Mom?

211
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:52,716
What do you think?

212
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:57,985
This isn't just for my personal gain.

213
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:02,385
It's dangerous, but it
absolutely has to be done.

214
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:09,336
More importantly, it's for the sake of
you, your mom and our whole family!

215
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:17,425
If you don't believe me, I will bring your mother
back to China right now. That is, in your own words,

216
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:20,186
it's not a reward, but my true feelings.

217
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:26,845
I didn't cause the incident
from eighteen years ago.

218
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:32,066
I didn't know about the key to
the Cheon Ui Joo back then.

219
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:38,435
I heard about it three years ago.

220
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,715
Is that true?

221
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,566
Yeah.

222
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:50,566
It's because of Soon Deok.

223
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:58,166
I love Soon Deok.

224
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:01,485
Love, you say?

225
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:07,116
I'm won't neglect someone
I love, unlike you.

226
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:12,485
I will definitely make that person happy.

227
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,556
Happiness, you say?

228
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,986
That's overrated.

229
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:24,915
Those who want happiness can't have power.

230
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,536
Because they get too entangled in emotion.

231
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:31,786
You.

232
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:36,196
Didn't you want to become powerful?

233
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:43,415
Do you really know nothing
about Yoon's son?

234
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,866
If you know the whereabouts
of the last part of the key,

235
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:53,035
it's an opportunity to erect
the Moorim Association again.

236
00:21:53,036 --> 00:21:57,745
If we join forces now, it's
not too late to have a shot.

237
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,475
I don't want to have a shot at anything.

238
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:05,915
For this to end without anyone
getting hurt is what I want.

239
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:13,456
Do you, by chance, know the
whereabouts of Yoon's son?

240
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:25,585
Not that long ago, Yoon Si
Woo entered the school.

241
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:30,985
It was a coincidence that the child
was brought to the school by Seon Ah.

242
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:32,946
Yoon Si Woo?

243
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:40,395
The child who used energy
control at the Tournament?

244
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:42,275
I have to hurry and go back to the school.

245
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:45,465
To do that, I need to see Yoo Di.

246
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:52,105
First, we need to meet Chae Yoon
without Chairman Wang knowing.

247
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:56,726
You need to be very careful.
I will send some people.

248
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,105
You're here?

249
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:19,165
Dad, what is all this?

250
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,626
Sit over there.

251
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:30,885
I know you want to go back to school,

252
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:36,026
my answer is... this.

253
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:44,075
Dad, I can't just go like this.

254
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:44,956
Soon Deok.

255
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:50,075
Before I hear a complete
explanation, I'm not going anywhere.

256
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:53,815
Why exactly are you going this far?

257
00:23:53,816 --> 00:24:01,816
Is it really because of
Moorim that you can't see?

258
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:10,246
Actually, it involves Yoon Si Woo.

259
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:32,425
Hwang Seon Ah.

260
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:34,066
I'm sorry.

261
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,106
And...

262
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:41,526
thanks.

263
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,025
The one who is thankful is me.

264
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:54,265
Thank you, Seon Ah. For
coming out of that room.

265
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:58,716
You know you were the one
who helped me do it.

266
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:10,115
I, too, wanted to get the key.

267
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:12,086
It's true.

268
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:19,505
But I saw what they did, got a grip
and saved that kid from the fire.

269
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:23,836
I was told my life would be in
danger if I stay with that child, so

270
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:28,175
I thought he died.

271
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:30,945
No, I thought I killed him.

272
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:38,896
So that's why I had no choice but to leave that
child alone in that bed of leaves and run away.

273
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:43,795
That's impossible.

274
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:48,125
Back then, I hurt my
eyes with their attacks

275
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:53,516
and with that thought I paid
back for my sins, but...

276
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,965
By any chance, that child...

277
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:02,106
Yes.

278
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:06,456
Yoon Si Woo is the very child.

279
00:26:10,196 --> 00:26:15,706
This child survived and is going
to the same school as you.

280
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:25,635
You're lying. Dad, Si Woo... Si Woo...

281
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:31,255
I know he is dear to your heart.

282
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:35,635
I know very well that you went
back to school because of him.

283
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:40,425
Thus I can't hide this from you anymore.

284
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:45,326
That cannot be. Do you know how
Si Woo has lived up to now?

285
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:50,395
You should have looked for him! You
should have gone to see if he was alive.

286
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,955
Or try to find out why all that happened!

287
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:57,815
Even if it was later, you
should have looked into it!

288
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:05,105
I was just so afraid that the ones after
Cheon Ui Joo would be hunting me.

289
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:09,945
With my damaged eyes, I could only think about the
need to get you and leave as soon as possible.

290
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:14,625
I needed to live somehow because of you.

291
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:17,506
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

292
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,006
In the end,

293
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,706
it was because of me.

294
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:29,866
The very reason that Si
Woo was like that...

295
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:36,016
was me.

296
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:33,536
Did you have a nightmare again?

297
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:39,585
The dream about the kid in the fire.

298
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:41,716
When did you come here?

299
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:48,696
You called me.

300

Chi Ang is back in Korea?

319
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,166
Yes.

320
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:35,965
From now on everything depends on him.

I've made sure he cannot be swayed,

324
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,825
so don't worry and go help him.

325
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:52,156
Yes.

326
00:30:57,496 --> 00:30:58,956
Yes.

327
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:06,146
I understand.

328
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:13,126

330
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:32,586
Father...

331
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:34,696
I believe in you,

332
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:38,486
because you are my son.

333
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:01,616
Seon Ah!

334
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:08,135
- Shannon! - Are you better now?

335
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:12,435
It must have been so hard
for you guys all this time.

336
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:14,865
It couldn't have been harder
than what you went through.

337
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:19,815
I am so sorry about the Headmaster.
I was rash and stupid.

338
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:22,485
Since Hwang Seon Ah is
back in business too,

339
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:27,676
they should watch out. Let's
be strong till the end!

340

One, two, three, fighting!

Yoon Si Woo.

342
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:22,145
What is it? Did anything happen?

343
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:26,975
I think Soon Deok left this behind.

344
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:28,255
Soon Deok came here?

345
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:33,326
I seriously don't understand
what she's trying to say.

346

347

<i>or how should I start.</i>

348
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:52,375

I need to say to you</i>

349
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:55,076

353

That's correct.

Thank you.

400
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,756
Yes.

401
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,285
I'll be there in a moment.

<i>He doesn't hide or hold back

406
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,115
Yes, sir.

407
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:57,795

408
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:58,965
Yes.

409
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:03,295
That's good. I have something to tell you.

410
00:40:03,296 --> 00:40:09,906
Can we meet now? But don't tell anybody.

411
00:40:10,846 --> 00:40:14,356
Yes, I understand. Where do I go?

412
00:40:21,906 --> 00:40:25,045
<i>Chi Ang. Your father came.</i>

413
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:29,756
He said we'd be able to go to China soon.

414
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:38,325
That's great! If you were to go, you should've
gone earlier. What took him so long?

415
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:42,845
Nothing bad is going on with you, right?

416
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:46,045
Here you go again. There's nothing wrong.

417

<i>Of course.</i>

I will take you to the airport.

421
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,595
Don't worry, I can go by myself.

422
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:58,636
I will go with you.

423
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:01,335
Go first.

424
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:07,955
Start to think about what you
want to do and to eat with me.

425
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:09,855
I'll soon be there too.

426
00:41:09,856 --> 00:41:11,746
<i>I will do that.</i>

427
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:13,626
Mom.

428
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:15,095
Yeah?

429
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:21,396
If you go to China, you
will be happy, right?

430
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:28,396
You always said you wanted to move there.

431

If you're also coming, there's
nothing else I could hope for.

He's coming.

464
00:44:25,136 --> 00:44:27,376
Tell them to start.

465
00:44:34,736 --> 00:44:37,316
Chae Yoon will soon arrive.

466
00:45:21,746 --> 00:45:25,986
What should I do? Should I
keep following that car?

467
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:31,505
<i>I have something to tell you.
Can we meet now?</i>

468
00:45:31,506 --> 00:45:34,305
<i>If anything happens to me...</i>

469
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:38,105
<i>Will you keep scaring me
like this before you leave?</i>

470
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:43,315
<i>Can we meet now?</i>

471
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:45,755
<i>Can you come to Moorim headquarters?
It's urgent.</i>

472
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:49,486
<i>Don't tell anybody anything.
No one must find out.</i>

473
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:53,426
Yeong, Joon!

474
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:18,485
<i>Yoon, please take care of the key.</i>

475
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:22,415
<i>You cannot leave like this. I will
find the destructive force with you.</i>

476
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:27,715
<i>Your friend and partner, Hwang Moo Song...</i>

477
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:29,415
<i>What?</i>

478
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:32,356
<i>Don't trust him too much.</i>

479
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:49,456
It's already started.

480
00:46:51,516 --> 00:46:57,696
Didn't you start everything
eighteen years ago?

481
00:47:02,596 --> 00:47:04,475
<i>Who are you?</i>

482
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:07,615
<i>I am the Chairman to
Shanghai Group, Wang Hao.</i>

483
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:15,616
<i>I know very well that you
are the destructive force.</i>

484
00:47:15,656 --> 00:47:21,315
<i>I also know that now neither you nor
the Moorim Association has any power.</i>

485
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:23,295
<i>So what?</i>

486
00:47:23,296 --> 00:47:25,896
<i>I came here to negotiate.</i>

487
00:47:30,426 --> 00:47:36,885
<i>You want to negotiate with someone
who is on the verge of death?</i>

488
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:40,995
<i>Didn't you want to save your
life through the Cheon Ui Joo?</i>

489
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:45,966
<i>I can help you with that.</i>

490
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:54,246
<i>Give one of the parts of the Cheon Ui
Joo that you stole that day to me.</i>

491
00:48:00,386 --> 00:48:04,125
Did you find the last part of the key?

492
00:48:04,126 --> 00:48:06,095
How could someone so impatient

493
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:11,156
not have found the other part until now?

494
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:18,105
There should be no problems
with Chae Yoon, right?

495
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:22,525
Since I called him, he should
be in the headquarter's

496
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:25,875
meeting room waiting for me.

497
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:29,676
Hwang Moo Song is now done for.

498
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:37,156
Where is the third part?

499
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:58,096
<i>Trust me and hang on for just a while.</i>

500
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,966
Moo Song!

501
00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:53,266
Wake up, Moo Song!

502
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:04,986
Here.

503
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,626
I'm sorry.

504
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:21,435
I really needed to say this.

505
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:23,846
I misunderstood you.

506
00:51:25,046 --> 00:51:27,825
I should've trusted you and
come to find you earlier.

507
00:51:27,826 --> 00:51:30,845
Eighteen years ago...

508
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:35,765
And even now... I didn't
protect you like this.

509
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:38,236
It's not your fault.

510
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:51,455
Yeong, Yeong is alive.

511
00:51:51,456 --> 00:51:53,045
I know.

512
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:54,946
Also...

513
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:02,735
That's enough. Right now.

514
00:52:02,736 --> 00:52:04,476
Joon...

515
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:12,636
Joon is... alive.

516
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:23,385
Yoon Si Woo... Joon went to our school.

517
00:52:23,386 --> 00:52:29,686
He is... your son.

518
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:37,356
He resembles you quite a bit.

519
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:42,986
Yoon Si Woo?

520
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:48,726
I thought I could go back to see Seon Ah.

521
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:52,235
Let's go to Seon Ah.

522
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:57,316
Let's go back to the kids and
please don't lose consciousness.

523
00:53:05,186 --> 00:53:10,666
Yoon, the key Yeong has...

524
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:14,986
is in the school.

525
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:27,595
<i>The barrier...</i>

526
00:53:27,596 --> 00:53:33,486
<i>The headmaster surely hid part of
the key here, inside the school.</i>

527
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:37,126
<i>Let's find the Cheon Ui Joo.</i>

528
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:39,845
<i>Us?</i>

529
00:53:39,846 --> 00:53:42,975
<i>We have to protect what the
Headmaster was protecting.</i>

530
00:53:42,976 --> 00:53:46,956
<i>The school, the ones we love...</i>

531
00:53:48,126 --> 00:53:49,576
<i>and</i>

532
00:53:52,056 --> 00:53:53,956
<i>ourselves.</i>

533
00:54:10,066 --> 00:54:13,625
<i>There was nothing wrong with the barrier.</i>

534
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:16,376
<i>But, why now?</i>

535
00:54:20,096 --> 00:54:25,086
<i>By chance... Nothing
happened to Dad, right?</i>

536
00:54:34,686 --> 00:54:37,346
<i>Hwang Moo Song disappeared.</i>

537
00:54:38,986 --> 00:54:40,685
- What?<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

538
00:54:40,686 --> 00:54:43,306
We're looking for him right now.

539
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:56,485
What did you just say?

540
00:54:56,486 --> 00:54:59,245
Yoon Si Woo is Chae Yoon's son?!

541
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:04,565
What have you been doing in that school?

542
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:08,315
I... I will look into it.

543
00:55:08,316 --> 00:55:10,985
<i>If you leave Yoon Si Woo to me...</i>

544
00:55:10,986 --> 00:55:13,385
It's fine. I'll call you later.

545
00:55:13,386 --> 00:55:15,975
Did you meet Chae Yoon yesterday?

546
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:20,885
No. But I'm still looking for him.

547
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:25,996
We've been fooled by Hwang Moo Song.
I can't find Chae Yoon either.

548
00:55:39,876 --> 00:55:44,165
My Son. Don't do this and
go back with me, huh?

549
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:48,115
No. I promised Dad.

550
00:55:48,116 --> 00:55:53,136
If this promise is because of me...

551
00:55:55,636 --> 00:55:57,665
Don't worry about me, Mom.

552
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:59,726
Chi Ang.

553
00:56:10,796 --> 00:56:14,725
Mom, if you go to China,

I found the last part of the key.

578
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:19,345
Where is it?

579
00:58:19,346 --> 00:58:23,335
With that kid you fought
at the Moorim Tournament.

580
00:58:23,336 --> 00:58:24,495
Yoon Si Woo?

581
00:58:24,496 --> 00:58:28,525
Yoon Si Woo is Chae Yoon's son.

582
00:58:28,526 --> 00:58:34,156
That kid has the last part
of the key for certain.

583
00:58:48,646 --> 00:58:52,845
If it's him, leave it to me.

584
00:58:52,846 --> 00:58:58,276
I will for sure get that key.

585
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:13,286
Seon Ah come out, Professor
Beop Gong is strange.

586
00:59:19,076 --> 00:59:21,616
What are you doing here right now?

587
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:28,275
You knew it all along.
Where is Yoon Si Woo!

588
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:30,885
How can you let him have the
key to the Cheon Ui Joo?

589
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:33,725
Why are you looking in this room?

590
00:59:33,726 --> 00:59:38,296
It's because Yoon Si Woo
is your little brother!

591
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:42,785
Now not even the school is safe?

592
00:59:42,786 --> 00:59:45,915
We've followed you since
you were our professor,

593
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:51,675
but if you are going to abandon
that, we will not hold back either.

594
00:59:51,676 --> 00:59:52,606
What?

595
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:57,656
We won't watch you destroy
this school anymore..

596
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:01,075
The Headmaster is back!

597
01:00:01,076 --> 01:00:03,375
The Headmaster came back!

598
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:04,966
What?

599
01:00:13,756 --> 01:00:15,666
Dad!

600
01:00:20,436 --> 01:00:24,486
Chae Yoon. Why are you
with Headmaster Hwang?

601
01:00:26,986 --> 01:00:28,526
Dad.

602
01:01:13,246 --> 01:01:16,225
<i>If I wondered about what you said.</i>

603
01:01:16,226 --> 01:01:20,635
<i>You wanted to know if I had space
for Soon Deok in my world.</i>

604
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:24,345
<i>There is no such place.</i>

605
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:28,756
<i>Because she is my world.</i>

606
01:01:29,796 --> 01:01:33,325
<i>I have to find Soon Deok's happiness.</i>

607
01:01:33,326 --> 01:01:36,635
<i>I'm not really sure but,</i>

608
01:01:36,636 --> 01:01:42,316
<i>I can be happy in her world.</i>

609
01:01:55,116 --> 01:01:55,926
Wang Chi Ang.

610
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:59,346
Soon Deok... what about Soon Deok?

611
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:04,935
She left.

612
01:02:04,936 --> 01:02:06,956
Where to?

613
01:02:08,146 --> 01:02:10,886
I don't know yet.

614
01:02:14,756 --> 01:02:20,576
The necklace that Soon Deok
had, you gave it to her, right?

615
01:02:21,726 --> 01:02:26,646
Is it really a part of the key?

01:02:27,856 --> 01:02:28,556
Is it?

617
01:02:28,557 --> 01:02:32,895
How do you know it? How much do you know?

618
01:02:32,896 --> 01:02:38,475
Everything. What's going on between
you and Seon Ah. All of it!

619
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:39,805
So your Dad too...

620
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:42,725
Yeah. My Dad knows everything.

621
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:48,185
Because of you, Soon Deok is in danger.
Because of the necklace you gave her!

622
01:02:48,186 --> 01:02:50,255
Does she know this?

623
01:02:50,256 --> 01:02:55,925
Do you want Soon Deok to be
happy by being in danger?

624
01:02:55,926 --> 01:02:57,445
Why would she be in danger?

625
01:02:57,446 --> 01:03:03,185
Because of whom is Seon Deok in danger? Do
you have the qualifications to say this?

626
01:03:03,186 --> 01:03:04,906
Qualifications?

627
01:03:09,516 --> 01:03:12,436
I was always somewhere in
the background with you.

628
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:16,315
Soon Deok always looked
at you and only you.

629
01:03:16,316 --> 01:03:21,655
But now... Soon Deok left.

630
01:03:21,656 --> 01:03:26,495
What in the world did you say to Soon Deok?

631
01:03:26,496 --> 01:03:32,166
If Soon Deok gets hurt or if
something happens to Soon Deok...

632
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,496
I won't stay still.

633
01:03:38,886 --> 01:03:41,736
Even if you are a friend or not.

634
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:48,126
You are not a friend to me anymore.
