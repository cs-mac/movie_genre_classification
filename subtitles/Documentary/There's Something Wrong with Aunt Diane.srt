{10992}{11034}Thank you.
{11612}{11676}Hey, Doris.|This is Chris Flynn.
{11681}{11742}I have a 7:00 p.m.|interview with Mr. Keller.
{11745}{11804}I'm, uh, running|about 30 minutes late.
{11806}{11845}I was wondering if you could...
{11865}{11939}Hello? Hello?
{11949}{11998}I'm not gonna make this.
{13192}{13240}Excuse me, sir.|Do you have a pay phone?
{13530}{13616}Uh, this one's not working. Do you|have another phone I could use?
{13624}{13665}Long distance?
{13697}{13757}What isn't long distance|from here, right?
{13760}{13806}You cuttin' wise|with me, son?
{13808}{13871}No, sir, I'm just...|I'm runnin' behind...
{13874}{13927}and I really need|to make a call.
{13955}{14014}Well, that'n there|is my only phone.
{14049}{14082}Right.
{14125}{14220}Well, uh, the highway's|really jammed up.
{14222}{14276}Do you know of another|route heading south?
{14279}{14331}- No.|- No.
{14505}{14576}Why is this Bear Mountain Road|dotted like this?
{14578}{14641}- Dirt.|- Dirt road?
{14644}{14716}'Fraid they ain't got around|to pavin' it yet.
{14719}{14810}It looks like it runs into the highway|about 15, 20 miles. Is that right?
{14830}{14863}If you say so.
{14909}{14942}It could work.
{14950}{15011}Thank you very much.|You take care, okay?
{15316}{15395}You're the one|gonna need to take care.
{17516}{17565}We just got nailed, man!
{17567}{17603}- Jesus Christ!|- Shit!
{17605}{17683}- Goddamn drunken hillbilly!|- Hey. Hey, you all right?
{17707}{17777}I'm so sorry.|I just...
{17778}{17807}- Jesus.|- I was just comin' around the bend.
{17810}{17894}- I didn't even see... I got distracted.|- My God, you could've died!
{17896}{17939}- Are you guys all okay?|- Yeah, yeah. You wanna sit down?
{17942}{17980}You might be in shock.
{17983}{18028}What were you doing|driving so goddamn fast?
{18030}{18057}All right, all right.
{18068}{18104}Why was your truck parked|in the middle of the road?
{18107}{18148}Because we blew out|our tires, asshole!
{18150}{18235}- I'll pay for whatever damage was done.|- That's my mom's car!
{18238}{18294}All right, Frannie.|The man said he'd pay for...
{18297}{18363}Oh, looks like you killed|my bike here too.
{18365}{18443}I'm sorry. I...|How did you blow out your tires?
{18445}{18499}Someone left some barbed wire|in the middle of the road.
{18502}{18550}I can't believe someone|just dropped it there.
{18553}{18597}Nobody dropped anything.
{18642}{18707}I just found this tied to a tree.|Somebody did this.
{18709}{18750}Southern hospitality at its finest.
{18752}{18826}- Redneck assholes.|- I'm gonna try and find a phone.
{18829}{18885}I think I saw a gas station|like a couple miles back.
{18887}{18923}I'm gonna come with you.
{18944}{19000}There is no phone.|I was just there.
{18978}{19060}Why don't we just wait for|someone else to come along?
{19061}{19095}What, like Speed Racer here?
{19097}{19131}I'm not going anywhere.
{19134}{19219}Okay, you guys go, and|we'll just stay here, Francine.
{19221}{19272}- And get high.|- Yeah. So what?
{19275}{19339}- Careful. They don't like stoners.|- Who are you calling a stoner?
{19342}{19406}- Your mom.|- Hey, what's your name?
{19424}{19451}Chris Flynn.
{19475}{19512}You hurt, Chris Flynn?
{19531}{19584}- No, I'm fine.|- Good.
{19635}{19686}- 'Cause you're the mule.|- Oh, no.
{19689}{19779}You know, I can carry that. You just|had the whole car accident thing.
{19781}{19832}Yeah, we'll just stay here|and maybe get hit again.
{19834}{19891}- Are you guys sure you're cool?|- Yeah.
{19896}{19949}Yeah, we'll be just fine.|Thank you.
{19953}{20035}- Mess you up.|- Yeah, smoke it up there, uh, Skippy.
{20048}{20123}- Yeah, have fun.|- I don't fuckin'believe this.
{20183}{20224}Your mom's gonna kick your ass.
{20289}{20352}God, I cannot get out of my head|what just happened.
{20354}{20443}- Are you sure you're all right? Yeah?|- Yeah. I'm fine.
{20445}{20494}What are you guys|doing out here?
{20496}{20569}Uh, uh, oh, camping.|Uh, I don't know. Actually, we're lost.
{20580}{20665}You know, a lot of people say who have been|through similar traumatic experiences...
{20667}{20777}that the following moments kind of feel|like you're moving kind of in slow motion.
{20782}{20829}- Do you feel like that?|- No.
{20831}{20934}I should tell you that my voice|is fairly low and normal speed.
{21050}{21084}Pretty good.
{21234}{21284}Where'd you get this?
{21286}{21355}Um, I got it out of my|dad's room, actually.
{21393}{21435}You can finish it.
{21541}{21599}I can't believe|they called us stoners.
{21601}{21632}Dickheads.
{21691}{21735}Are you sure|you know where we're going?
{21737}{21786}Yeah. There was a map|at the gas station.
{21810}{21850}Oh, I'm so tired already.
{21852}{21913}I'm starving,|and I'm being eaten by ants.
{21939}{21985}Are there any on my back?
{21987}{22078}No, nothing there.|Oh, hey-ho! I call it. Uh, squirrel.
{22081}{22152}- Well, you said you were hungry, Carly.|- I don't think it's a squirrel.
{22154}{22231}- It's a mink.|- Really? How do you know?
{22233}{22277}Probably ran over it.
{22289}{22385}In medical school, they make you work on|animal cadavers before you get to the real thing.
{22388}{22420}It's a mink.
{22485}{22516}It's a mink?
{22533}{22578}I need to be in Raleigh by 7:00.
{22611}{22651}Better get a move-on, then.
{22678}{22738}You know, we should've|just taken her to New York.
{22740}{22824}No. You know how she loves|this outdoor stuff.
{22826}{22859}Yeah.
{22875}{22943}If you ask me, though,|nature sucks.
{22959}{23063}Well, the next time she gets dumped,|we'll take her to New York.
{23157}{23199}Drop your pants.
{23216}{23246}What?
{23248}{23290}When do people|always show up, Evan?
{23292}{23335}What are we doing?
{23366}{23434}Consider it an experiment|in probability theory.
{23449}{23482}Really?
{23584}{23615}I love you.
{23616}{23649}I know.
{23664}{23742}Now get them|trousers off, boy. Don't be a sissy.
{23744}{23783}All right.
{23856}{23950}You know, I've been thinking|about this whole wedding thing...
{23954}{24011}and I think we should|take a trip down to Mexico.
{24012}{24072}I'm talking about a long weekend...
{24076}{24190}margaritas, the two of us|on a beach alone, sunset.
{24211}{24297}And, you know,|I'm talking about just, just eloping.
{24299}{24394}- You know what I mean?|- Uh, wait a second.
{24396}{24441}You wanna know what I think?
{24444}{24478}Yes, please.
{24481}{24561}I think if you ever|want to get in my pants again,
{24563}{24590}Affirmative.
{24592}{24656}This is the last time|you use the "E" word.
{24658}{24728}Okay? Okay.
{24731}{24779}Yeah, it's a disgusting word.
{24825}{24860}Hey, guys, hold on.
{24934}{24983}Hey, is anyone up there?
{25039}{25070}Hello!
{25098}{25190}- There must be people nearby.|- Anyone up there?
{25215}{25258}Somebody had to start it.
{25281}{25317}Let's keep moving.
{25394}{25425}Hello?
{25552}{25580}Freaky.
{25703}{25762}Oh, look at this.|It's fucked!
{25794}{25866}Nothing. Nothing.
{25955}{26003}Hey, did you find|anything to eat?
{26005}{26067}They took all my Power Bars.
{26068}{26135}Um, no.
{26136}{26188}No. Sorry.
{26312}{26403}Damn it. Scott and Carly|took all our friggin' sunscreen.
{26461}{26514}Does he have any good CD's?
{26547}{26639}Mmm. Definitely not.
{26768}{26827}You know, I think this guy|must be some kind of doctor.
{26829}{26924}Maybe we could get him to write us|some prescriptions when he gets back.
{26943}{26989}He doesn't have|any smokes either.
{26991}{27026}Almost out.
{27246}{27277}Evan?
{27572}{27633}Evan? Where are you?
{27674}{27713}Hey, baby,|what are you doing?
{27715}{27782}I'm just... amusing myself.
{27848}{27899}You, uh, getting|anything there, chatty?
{27902}{27955}No, nothing.|I'm gonna miss this thing.
{27957}{27996}Why didn't you just fly?
{27998}{28056}I put all of my money|into that car back there.
{28059}{28181}Okay, forget eloping, but there is an idea we|should discuss about the band for our wedding.
{28183}{28287}I think we should hire a... you know,|a Frank Sinatra-type, uh, lead singer...
{28289}{28356}as opposed to|a James Brown-type lead singer...
{28358}{28425}because, you know, really, let's be|honest, there's only one James Brown...
{28427}{28519}and, you know, a faux James Brown|is really quite intolerable.
{28612}{28697}Evan? Where are you?
{28704}{28755}You pissing or something?
{28904}{28934}Evan?
{29676}{29755}You know, plus he'd be grinding his hips,|and my grandmother would be...
{29769}{29900}yes, revolted but also strangely fascinated|in a completely disturbing way...
{29902}{29940}and, um...
{30016}{30049}Baby?
{30122}{30190}Carly, I wa...|I was kidding.
{30192}{30222}Carly?
{30357}{30387}Evan?
{31043}{31116}Sweetheart?|Hey, guys, hold up!
{31131}{31204}Guys, hold up|for a second, all right?
{31251}{31306}Baby, seriously,|this isn't funny.
{31363}{31394}Jesus God!
{31395}{31425}Baby!
{31482}{31558}- I...|- Oh, I'm so sorry.
{31560}{31627}I could've killed you, woman.|I'm-I'm extremely dangerous.
{31629}{31693}You wanna know|why I love you so much?
{31695}{31742}Because you're so fun|to play with.
{31744}{31795}Is that why you love me?
{31803}{31842}- That really scared me, baby.|- I'm sorry.
{31844}{31902}That really scared me.|Would you not do that?
{31903}{31936}Hello!
{32032}{32067}Hello!
{32167}{32250}There's, uh, nothing|like stating the obvious, huh?
{32304}{32355}Hey, baby, look at this.
{32377}{32466}Hey, Carly, I think this would be good time|for you to confront your fear of...
{32468}{32538}Don't!|Okay, that is not funny.
{32540}{32580}Look who's scared now.
{32692}{32739}- Sorry.|- Whatever.
{32757}{32812}Just get me to a motel room...
{32814}{32852}run me a very hot bath...
{32854}{32955}and be prepared to provide me|with a lot of orgasms.
{32985}{33025}I think they need to be alone.
{33027}{33088}What do you expect?|They just got engaged.
{33090}{33153}They're happy.|It's a hard thing to find.
{33156}{33184}Yeah.
{33210}{33259}- Got it?|- Limber tongue. Got it.
{33261}{33307}You're stupid.
{33560}{33607}Maybe we shouldn't|have left Francine and Evan.
{33610}{33652}Don't worry. They're fine.
{33680}{33752}- You guys okay?|- Super.
{33856}{33905}Well, wait, guys.|This road isn't on here.
{33907}{33995}That's because you don't have|the Redneck World Atlas.
{34033}{34076}I think we've just been saved, kids.
{34079}{34119}Can I get a...
{34347}{34389}Make this quick.
{34415}{34466}Actually, maybe we|should keep walking.
{34468}{34530}What? The next house is gonna have|a white picket fence?
{34543}{34586}Yeah, if there is|a next house.
{34670}{34718}- Hey.|- What?
{35151}{35185}Hello?
{35211}{35267}All right, this isn't right.
{35283}{35312}Hello?
{35465}{35514}Hello? Anybody home?
{35593}{35643}- Whoa, baby! Could you... Shh!
{35673}{35711}Hey, hey, what are you doing?
{35736}{35799}I was gonna see if they had a phone.|You guys can wait out here if you want.
{35801}{35863}You can't just go barging|into someone's house like that.
{35865}{35914}Yeah, 'cause, you know,|I'm just thinkin'...
{35911}{35972}West Virginia, trespassing...|not a great combination.
{35974}{36014}Look, I need to pee.
{36051}{36117}Well, I need to remind you|of a little movie called Deliverance.
{36203}{36287}Guys, we got two wrecked cars.|I mean, we really need a phone.
{36494}{36526}Hello?
{36550}{36583}Hello?
{36609}{36642}Carly.
{36795}{36828}Hello?
{37214}{37247}What the fuck?
{37249}{37316}Let's just do what we gotta do|and get out of here.
{37413}{37479}Hey, I am not sensing a phone here.
{37492}{37527}Hello!
{37565}{37605}Okay, who lives here?
{37611}{37672}I don't know, but can you|help me find a bathroom?
{37685}{37732}Baby, I think|this is the bathroom.
{37850}{37879}Fuck.
{37918}{37968}Oh, my God.|Look at this place.
{38001}{38053}Seriously, guys,|I think we should go.
{38055}{38092}Help me find the bathroom.|Then we'll go.
{38094}{38149}Baby, what if this place|belongs to some kind of cult?
{38152}{38208}I read in Newsweek how|economically depressed places...
{38211}{38295}are like breeding grounds for|all kinds of apocalyptic visionaries.
{38297}{38386}Order of the Solar Temple, Church of|the Lamb of God, the Chijon family.
{38388}{38446}- Remember them?|- Hey, brainiac!
{38520}{38590}All right.|Maybe that door.
{38831}{38857}Christ!
{38860}{38947}- You okay?|- It's just a paddle. It's all right.
{39154}{39198}God, look at this place.
{39219}{39291}Yeah. It's like|the garage sale from hell.
{39293}{39323}Jesus.
{39404}{39447}Can you believe this?
{39542}{39599}Jesus, these guys|are ripping people off.
{39652}{39736}I mean, this is like|$30,000 worth of stuff.
{39804}{39839}Chris.
{39854}{39895}We should leave.
{39968}{40007}This is kind of creepy.
{40122}{40165}- Yeah, this is it.|- Okay. Be quick.
{40167}{40228}- Okay!|- All right? Two minutes.
{40230}{40285}All right?|I'll be here.
{42988}{43037}Guys, guys, check this out.
{43075}{43106}Oh, no.
{43197}{43270}Oh, God. Oh, God.|Scott. Scott!
{43272}{43335}Scott, we have to go now!
{43373}{43427}- Jess! Jessie!|- Jess!
{43428}{43482}- Hey! Guys, what is it?|- We need to get back to your friends.
{43484}{43561}- What about a phone?|- There is no phone. Shit!
{43632}{43693}There's a back door.|I saw a back door. Come on.
{43696}{43730}Go, go!
{43768}{43864}- Okay, hurry. Shit! No!|- Shit!
{43877}{43997}Scott! Scott!|It's not gonna budge! Come on!
{52946}{52979}Go.

{53731}{53816}Go! Go!
{53818}{53864}- Go! Go!|- Go! Go! Go! Go!
{53869}{53917}- Go, you guys! Run!
{53959}{54005}- Go quickly.|- Come on.
{54202}{54250}- Where are they going?|- I don't know.
{54287}{54338}Jesus, did that|really just happen?
{54356}{54417}Do you think Evan's okay?
{54483}{54549}- Please.|- I can't. I can't.
{54571}{54611}Carly, come on!|Get up!
{54613}{54658}You didn't see what|they did to Francine!
{54661}{54766}- You didn't see what we saw!|- Carly! Carly! Sweet pea!
{54768}{54827}Look at me. We are gonna|get out of this, I swear to you.
{54829}{54905}We are. Okay? We're gonna find a road.|We're gonna get to a town.
{54907}{55029}And we're going home.|We're gonna get married. All right?
{55032}{55097}And we are never|going into the woods again.
{55140}{55188}- All right?|- We gotta go.
{55191}{55244}- Come on. This way!|- Let's go! Come on!
{55613}{55660}What is this?
{55912}{55941}Jesus.
{56005}{56045}All these people.
{56094}{56181}Baby. Fuck.
{56325}{56372}How can they do this?|I don't understand.
{56376}{56472}- How'd they get away with this?|- Oh, my God. All these people.
{56474}{56568}Maybe one of them still runs.|Look for keys.
{56570}{56616}None of these cars|are gonna run.
{56618}{56716}Come on. Look at them.|Oh, fuck.
{56888}{56940}Get down! Get down!
