<i>DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: Our Earth</i>

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,811
<i>is the only known planet
that sustains life.</i>

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,456
<i>And it does so in abundance.</i>

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,319
<i>I have been fortunate enough
over the years</i>

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,759
<i>to travel to some of the most
extraordinary and remote places on Earth</i>

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,359
<i>to find and film animals.</i>

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,818
This is the biggest flower in the world.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,639
The blue whale!

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,735
It's the biggest creature
that exists on the planet!

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,639
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: The sheer number
and variety of animals and plants</i>

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,334
<i>is astonishing.</i>

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,039
<i>Estimates of the number
of different species</i>

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,816
<i>vary from six million
to a hundred million.</i>

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,719
Nobody knows exactly how many different
kinds of animals there are here.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,399
Wherever you look, there's life.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,679
<i>There are often a multitude
of variations on a single pattern.</i>

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,331
<i>Nearly 200 different kinds of monkeys,
for example.</i>

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,217
<i>And 315 humming birds,</i>

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,331
<i>nearly a thousand bats.</i>

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,535
<i>And beetles, at least 350 thousand
species of them.</i>

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,697
<i>Not to mention a quarter of a million
different kinds of flowering plants.</i>

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,399
<i>The variety is astounding.</i>

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,049
(CHUCKLES)

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,292
(CHIRPING)

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,279
<i>Even in this one small English woodland,
you might see four or five</i>

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,896
<i>different kinds of finches.</i>

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,492
<i>Why should there be
such a dazzling variety?</i>

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,690
<i>And how can we make sense of
such a huge range of living organisms?</i>

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,879
Two hundred years ago,

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,898
a man was born who was to explain
this astonishing diversity of life.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,519
In doing so, he revolutionised the way
in which we see the world

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,879
and our place in it.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,940
His name was Charles Darwin.

34
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,659
This book, The Holy Bible, explains how
this wonderful diversity came about.

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,418
On the third day, after the creation
of the world, God created plants.

36
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,799
On the fifth day, fish and birds,

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,454
and then, on the sixth day,
mammals and finally, man.

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,319
That explanation
was believed, literally,

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,639
by, pretty well, the whole of
Western Europe for the best part

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,892
of 2,000 years.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,778
And generations of painters
pictured it for the faithful.

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,879
This version was painted in Italy
in the 16th century.

43
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,439
Here is God in the Garden of Eden,

44
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,091
which is now filled
with all kinds of animals.

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,535
Here he is pulling Adam
out of the Earth

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,079
and here creating the first woman
by putting Adam to sleep,

47
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,608
and then taking one of his ribs
and extracting Eve from his side.

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,648
And she comes out assisted
by two angels.

49
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,059
And when God had finished,
he said to Adam and Eve,

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,079
"Be fruitful and multiply
and replenish the Earth and subdue it,

51
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,079
"and have dominion over the fish of
the sea and over the fowl of the air,

52
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,539
"and over every living thing
that moveth upon the Earth".

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,119
That made it clear
that according to the Bible

54
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,011
humanity could exploit the natural world
as they wished.

55
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,999
<i>This view of mankind's superiority
still stood when, in 1831,</i>

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,857
<i>a British surveying ship, the Beagle,
set off on a voyage around the world.</i>

57
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,879
<i>On board, as a companion to the captain,</i>

58
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,736
<i>was the 22-year-old Charles Darwin.</i>

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,459
<i>They crossed the Atlantic and
made landfall on the coast of Brazil.</i>

60
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,759
<i>There, the sheer abundance
of tropical nature</i>

61
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,479
<i>astonishes the newcomer,</i>

62
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,999
<i>as I discovered when I retraced
Darwin's steps, 30 years ago,</i>

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,936
<i>for a television series
about the diversity of nature.</i>

64
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,079
<i>Darwin, as a boy, had been
a fanatical collector of insects.</i>

65
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,777
<i>And here, he was enthralled
almost to the point of ecstasy.</i>

66
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,959
In one day, in a small area,

67
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,499
he discovered
69 different species of beetle.

68
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,079
As he wrote in his journal,
"It's enough to disturb the composure

69
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,559
"of the entomologist's mind
to contemplate the future dimension

70
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,176
"of a complete catalogue".

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,176
<i>They went south, rounded Cape Horn,
and so reached the Pacific.</i>

72
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,839
<i>And then, in September 1835,</i>

73
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,639
<i>after they had been away
for almost four years,</i>

74
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,179
<i>they landed on the little-known islands
of the Galapagos.</i>

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,814
<i>Here, they found creatures that existed
nowhere else in the world.</i>

76
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,894
<i>Cormorants that had lost
the power of flight.</i>

77
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,338
<i>Lizards that swam out through the surf
to graze on the bottom of the sea.</i>

78
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,119
<i>Darwin, who had studied botany
and geology at Cambridge university,</i>

79
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,339
<i>collected specimens
of the animals and plants.</i>

80
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,239
<i>And as usual, when he went ashore
to investigate,</i>

81
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,731
<i>described what he found in his journal.</i>

82
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,368
"My servant and self were landed
a few miles to the northeast,

83
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,571
"in order that I might examine
the district mentioned above

84
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,479
"as resembling chimneys".
Volcanic chimneys, presumably.

85
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,359
"The comparison would have been
more exact if I had said

86
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,999
"the iron furnaces near Wolverhampton".

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,252
(CHUCKLES)

88
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,999
<i>The British resident in the Galapagos
claimed that he knew</i>

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,759
<i>from the shape
of a giant tortoise's shell</i>

90
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,171
<i>which island it had come from.</i>

91
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,359
<i>If it had a rounded front,
it came from a well-watered island</i>

92
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,693
<i>where it fed on lush ground plants.</i>

93
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,559
<i>Whereas one from a drier island
had a peak at the front,</i>

94
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,177
<i>which enabled it to reach up
to higher vegetation.</i>

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,159
<i>Were these tortoises,
each on their separate islands,</i>

96
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,879
<i>different species?</i>

97
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,419
<i>And if so, was each one
a separate act of divine creation?</i>

98
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,479
The differences that Darwin had noticed
amongst these Galapagos animals,

99
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,719
were, of course, all tiny.

100
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,559
But if they could develop, wasn't it
possible that over the thousands

101
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,359
or millions of years, a whole series
of such differences might add up

102
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,737
to one revolutionary change?

103
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,177
<i>On his voyage home, Darwin
had time to ponder on these things.</i>

104
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,479
<i>Could it be that species
were not fixed for all time,</i>

105
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,210
<i>but could, in fact, slowly change?</i>

106
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,199
<i>On his return,
he sorted out his specimens</i>

107
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,679
<i>and sent them off to relevant experts</i>

108
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,058
<i>so that each
could be identified and classified.</i>

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,335
<i>Most of the mammal bones and fossils
he sent to Richard Owen.</i>

110
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,199
<i>Owen was one of the most brilliant
zoologists of his time.</i>

111
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,759
<i>He was the first to recognise dinosaurs,</i>

112
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
<i>and indeed had invented their very name.</i>

113
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,319
<i>And he would later become
the creator and first director</i>

114
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,890
<i>of the Natural History Museum in London.</i>

115
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,839
<i>Many of the specimens
that Darwin collected</i>

116
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,359
<i>are still preserved and treasured here</i>

117
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,650
<i>among the 70 million other specimens
housed in the museum that Owen founded.</i>

118
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,970
And here is one of them.

119
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,039
It's obviously the lower jaw
of some great animal,

120
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,639
and when Darwin discovered it, it had
bits of skin and hair attached to it

121
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,119
so at first it was thought to be the
remains of some unknown living species.

122
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,359
But now we know that it is a species
that was extinct for some 10,000 years,

123
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,691
a giant ground sloth.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,919
Owen examined it in great detail

125
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,159
and eventually described it and
gave it the name of Mylodon darwinii

126
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,730
in honour of its discoverer.

127
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,079
But that mutual respect
between two great men of science

128
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,616
was not to last.

129
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,719
<i>Soon after his return from his voyage,</i>

130
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,417
<i>Darwin made his home here in Down House
in Kent.</i>

131
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,399
<i>Here, he wrote an account of his travels</i>

132
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,479
<i>and worked on detailed
scientific treatises</i>

133
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,690
<i>about corals and barnacles and the
geology and fossils of South America.</i>

134
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,519
But he also pondered deeply
on what he had seen in the Galapagos

135
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,009
and elsewhere.

136
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,380
Maybe species were not fixed.

137
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,639
Every day, he took a walk
in this small spinney

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,654
that he had planted
at the end of his garden.

139
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,079
And it was here that he came to ponder
on the problems of natural history

140
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,719
including that mystery of mysteries:

141
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,008
how could one species turn into another?

142
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,879
He noted that most, if not all, animals
produce many more young

143
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,735
than live to breed themselves.

144
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,399
<i>This female blue tit, for example,</i>

145
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,098
<i>may well lay a dozen eggs a year,
perhaps 50 or so in her lifetime.</i>

146
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,759
<i>Yet only two of her chicks need to
survive and breed themselves</i>

147
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,332
<i>to maintain the numbers
of the blue tit population.</i>

148
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,159
<i>Those survivors, of course,
are likely to be the healthiest</i>

149
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,049
<i>and best-suited
to their particular environment.</i>

150
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,119
<i>Their characteristics
are then inherited</i>

151
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,359
<i>so perhaps over many generations,</i>

152
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,959
<i>and particularly if there are
environmental changes,</i>

153
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,973
<i>species may well change.</i>

154
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,999
Only the fittest survive.

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,695
And that was the key.

156
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,970
He called the process natural selection.

157
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,492
(BIRDSONG)

158
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,279
That would explain the differences
that he had noted in the finches

159
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,738
that he had brought back
from the Galapagos.

160
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,337
They were very similar
except for their beaks.

161
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,599
This one has a very thin, delicate beak,

162
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,239
which it uses to catch insects.

163
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,639
This one, on the other hand,
which came from an environment

164
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,559
where there were a lot of nuts,
has a big, heavy beak,

165
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,016
which enables it to crack them.

166
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,679
So maybe, over the vastness
of geological time,

167
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,173
and particularly if species were
invading new environments,

168
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,530
those changes would amount
to very radical changes indeed.

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,217
<i>Darwin drew a sketch in one
of his notebooks to illustrate his idea,</i>

170
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,879
<i>showing how a single ancestral species</i>

171
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,213
<i>might give rise
to several different ones,</i>

172
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,769
<i>and then wrote above it a tentative,
"I think".</i>

173
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,009
<i>Now he had to prove his theory.</i>

174
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,439
And he spent years gathering
abundant and convincing evidence.

175
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,896
He was an extraordinary letter writer.

176
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,799
He wrote as many as a dozen
letters a day

177
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,098
to scientists and naturalists
all over the world.

178
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,599
<i>He also realised that when people had
first started domesticating animals</i>

179
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,218
<i>they had been doing experiments for him
for centuries.</i>

180
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,488
<i>All domestic dogs are descended from
a single ancestral species, the wolf.</i>

181
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,999
<i>Dog breeders select those pups</i>

182
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,319
<i>that have the characteristics
that happen to please them.</i>

183
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,159
<i>Nature, of course,
selects those young animals</i>

184
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,159
<i>that are best suited
to a particular environment.</i>

185
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,079
<i>But the process is essentially the same.</i>

186
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,858
<i>And in both cases,
it has produced astonishing variety.</i>

187
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,959
In effect,
many of these different breeds

188
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,599
could be considered different species,

189
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,839
because they do not, indeed,
they cannot interbreed.

190
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,079
<i>For purely mechanical reasons,</i>

191
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,936
<i>there's no way in which a Pekingese
can mate with a Great Dane.</i>

192
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,559
Of course, it's true that,
if you used artificial insemination,

193
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,119
you could get crosses between
almost any of these breeds.

194
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,999
but that's because human beings
have been selecting between dogs

195
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,279
for only a few centuries.

196
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,399
Nature has been selecting
between animals for millions of years,

197
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,719
tens of millions,
even hundreds of millions of years.

198
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,879
<i>So what might have started out
as we would consider to be breeds,</i>

199
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,850
<i>have now become so different
they are species.</i>

200
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,519
<i>Darwin, sitting in Down House,</i>

201
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,639
<i>wrote to pigeon fanciers
and rabbit breeders</i>

202
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,691
<i>asking all kinds of detailed questions
about their methods and results.</i>

203
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,079
<i>He himself, being a country gentleman</i>

204
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,439
<i>and running an estate,
knew about breeding horses</i>

205
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
<i>and sheep and cattle.</i>

206
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,818
<i>He also conducted careful experiments
with plants in his greenhouse.</i>

207
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,319
<i>But Darwin knew that the idea
that species could appear</i>

208
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,799
<i>without divine intervention
would appall society in general.</i>

209
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,479
<i>And it was also contrary to the beliefs
of his wife, Emma,</i>

210
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,399
<i>who was a devout Christian.</i>

211
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,815
<i>Perhaps for that reason, he was keen to
keep the focus of his work scientific.</i>

212
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,059
<i>He made a point of not being drawn
in public about his religious beliefs.</i>

213
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,488
<i>But in the latter part of his life
he withdrew from attending church.</i>

214
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,239
On Sundays, he would escort Emma
and the children here

215
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,399
to the parish church in Down,

216
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,839
but while they went into the service,
he remained outside

217
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,013
and went for a walk
in the country lanes.

218
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,959
Perhaps because he feared his theory
would cause outrage in some quarters,

219
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,499
he delayed publishing it
year after year after year.

220
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,528
But he wrote a long abstract of it.

221
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,054
And then, on July 5th 1844,
he wrote this letter to his wife.

222
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,610
"My dear Emma, I have just finished
this sketch of my species theory".

223
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,417
Some sketch. It was 240 pages long.

224
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,639
"I therefore write this,
in case of my sudden death,

225
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,610
"that you will devote 400
to its publication".

226
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,879
He then goes on to list
his various naturalist friends,

227
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,258
who would be asked to edit it
and check it,

228
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,736
and he ends the letter, charmingly,

229
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,336
"My dear wife,
yours affectionately, C. R. Darwin".

230
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,119
<i>He continued to accumulate evidence
and refine his theory</i>

231
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,339
<i>for the next 14 years.</i>

232
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,969
<i>But then his hand was forced.</i>

233
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,218
In June 1858, 22 years after he got back
from the Galapagos,

234
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,039
here in his study in Down,
he received a package

235
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,328
from a naturalist who was working
in what is now Indonesia.

236
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,529
<i>His name was Alfred Russel Wallace.</i>

237
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,799
<i>He had been corresponding with Darwin
for some years.</i>

238
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,759
<i>But this package was different.</i>

239
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,599
<i>It contained an essay that set out
exactly the same idea as Darwin's...</i>

240
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,251
<i>of evolution by natural selection.</i>

241
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,319
<i>The idea had come to Wallace
as he lay in his hut</i>

242
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,459
<i>semi-delirious in a malarial fever.</i>

243
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,119
<i>But although his idea of natural
selection was the same as Darwin's,</i>

244
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,039
<i>he had not spent 20 years gathering
the mountain of evidence to support it,</i>

245
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,292
<i>as Darwin had done.</i>

246
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,650
<i>But whose idea was it?</i>

247
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,479
<i>In the end, the senior members
of the Linnean Society</i>

248
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,599
<i>decided that the fairest thing
was for a brief outline</i>

249
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,679
<i>of the theory from each of them
to be read out one after the other,</i>

250
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,492
<i>at a meeting of the society here
in Burlington House, in London.</i>

251
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,559
<i>The Linnean, then, as now,
was the place where scientists studying</i>

252
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,439
<i>the natural world held regular meetings</i>

253
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,616
<i>to present and discuss papers
about their observations and thoughts.</i>

254
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,919
The one held on July 1 st 1858

255
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,759
was attended by only about 30 people.

256
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,639
Neither of the authors were present.

257
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,479
Wallace was 10,000 miles away
in the East Indies.

258
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,199
And Darwin was ill and devastated
by the death, a few days earlier,

259
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,159
of his infant son.

260
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,538
So he was still at his home in Kent.

261
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,679
As a consequence, the two papers
had to be read by the secretary.

262
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,617
And as far as we can tell, they made
very little impression on anyone.

263
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,976
<i>Darwin spent the next year
writing out his theory in detail.</i>

264
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,279
<i>Then he sent the manuscript
to his publisher,John Murray,</i>

265
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,199
<i>whose firm, then as now,
had offices in Albermarle Street,</i>

266
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,039
<i>just off Piccadilly, in London.</i>

267
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,879
Murray was the great publisher
of his day,

268
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,439
and dealt with the works of Jane Austen
and Lord Byron

269
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,535
whose first editions
still line these office walls.

270
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,639
Darwin regarded his work
as simply a summary,

271
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,999
but, even so, it's 400 pages.

272
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,051
It was published on November 24th 1859.

273
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,839
This is not a first edition,
more's the pity.

274
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,079
First editions are worth, literally,
hundreds of thousands of pounds.

275
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,574
This is a sixth edition. My copy,
which I bought as a boy,

276
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,895
at 18, I notice, and it cost me
the princely sum of one shilling.

277
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,879
The first edition, of 1,250 copies
sold out immediately.

278
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,639
and it went for a reprint, and then
another reprint and another reprint.

279
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,199
It's a book that contains very few
technical terms.

280
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,055
It's easily understood by anybody.

281
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,519
And, predictably, it caused an outrage,

282
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,933
not only throughout this country,
but indeed all the civilised world.

283
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,689
<i>What scandalised people most, it seems,</i>

284
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,799
<i>was the implication that human beings
were not specially created by God</i>

285
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,976
<i>as the book of Genesis stated, but were
descended from ape-like ancestors.</i>

286
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,898
<i>A notion that provided a lot of scope
for cartoonists.</i>

287
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,239
<i>The leaders of the Church,
headed by Samuel Wilberforce,</i>

288
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,479
<i>the Bishop of Oxford, attacked it
on the grounds that it demoted God</i>

289
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,768
<i>and contradicted the story of creation
as told by the Bible.</i>

290
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,319
<i>"That Mr Darwin should have wandered</i>

291
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,359
<i>"from this broad highway
of Nature's works</i>

292
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,331
<i>"into the jungle of fanciful assumption
is no small evil. "</i>

293
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,079
<i>"I have read your book
with more pain than pleasure.</i>

294
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,839
<i>"It is the frenzied inspiration
of the inhaler of mephitic gas. "</i>

295
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,217
<i>"Fails utterly. "</i>

296
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,519
<i>Darwin's theory implied that life
had originated in simple forms</i>

297
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,999
<i>and had then become
more and more complex.</i>

298
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,719
<i>He knew perfectly well
that the whole idea of evolution</i>

299
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,176
<i>raised a lot of questions.</i>

300
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,359
<i>In fact, some of those questions
would not be answered</i>

301
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,439
<i>until comparatively recently.</i>

302
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,559
<i>But in his own time, many distinguished
scientists raised what seemed to be</i>

303
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,016
<i>insuperable difficulties.</i>

304
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,732
And foremost among them
was Richard Owen,

305
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,239
the man who, 20 years earlier,
had named the extinct ground sloth

306
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,537
in honour of Darwin.

307
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,519
Over the years, the two men
had developed a deep personal dislike

308
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,978
of one another,
and had quarrelled frequently.

309
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,239
It wasn't that Owen thought
that the story of the Garden of Eden

310
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,133
was literally correct, but nonetheless
he was a deeply religious man.

311
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,799
<i>He had, after all,
ensured that his museum,</i>

312
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,519
<i>which would display
the wonders of creation,</i>

313
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,479
<i>echoed, in its design,
the great Christian cathedrals</i>

314
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,732
<i>of mediaeval Europe.</i>

315
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,519
<i>And Owen knew about
the diversity of life.</i>

316
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,319
<i>Indeed, he had spent
his whole career cataloguing it.</i>

317
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,814
<i>But even so, he refused to believe
that a species could change over time.</i>

318
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,279
<i>He, and other pioneer
Victorian geologists,</i>

319
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,479
<i>as they established
their comparatively new science,</i>

320
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,839
<i>recognised that the outlines
of the history of life</i>

321
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,776
<i>could be deduced by examining
the land around them.</i>

322
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,319
Look at these rocks
in Northern Scotland.

323
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,359
We know from fossils that were
associated with them

324
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,851
that they are very ancient.

325
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,239
And they are sandstones.

326
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,559
Compacted sand that was laid down
at the bottom of the sea

327
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,733
layer upon layer upon layer.

328
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,140
But look how many layers there are.

329
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,839
<i>Clearly, those at the top must have been
laid down after those beneath them.</i>

330
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,879
<i>So, as you descend from layer to layer,</i>

331
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,814
<i>you are, in effect, going back in time.</i>

332
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,679
<i>So a fossil species,
if it comes from a particular layer,</i>

333
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,319
<i>is of a particular age.</i>

334
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,399
<i>And if you can recognise each one,
then you can begin to piece together</i>

335
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,970
<i>the outlines of life's history.</i>

336
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,839
My krafta.

337
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,839
<i>The ability to identify fossils and
place them in their geological time zone</i>

338
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,970
<i>was still an essential skill when
I was at university a century later.</i>

339
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,159
We worked our way through drawers,
like these,

340
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,039
which are full of fossils
of one sort or another.

341
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,199
But none of them had labels.

342
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,639
Only numbers.

343
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,689
So you were expected to be able
to pick up one

344
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,599
and say, "Yes, that's a belemnite".

345
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,639
Actually which belemnite it is,
I can't remember now.

346
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,799
And when you came to
your practical exam,

347
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,199
your examiners would produce
one of these and say,

348
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,319
"Okay, what's that?"

349
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,479
And you either knew or you didn't.

350
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,239
And the way you knew was because of all
the work you did in drawers like these,

351
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,492
hour after hour.

352
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,039
<i>Owen did not deny the sequence in which
all these different species appeared,</i>

353
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,419
<i>but he believed that each was separate,
each divinely created.</i>

354
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,839
<i>Darwin's theory, however, required
that there should be connections,</i>

355
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,573
<i>not just between similar species,
but between the great animal groups.</i>

356
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,719
If fishes and reptiles
and birds and mammals

357
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,799
had all evolved from one another, then
surely there must be intermediate forms

358
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,291
between those great groups.

359
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,679
And they were missing.

360
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,159
<i>And then, just two years after the
publication of The Origin of Species,</i>

361
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:26,054
Richard Owen himself purchased the most
astonishing fossil for his museum.

362
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,919
<i>It had been found
in this limestone quarry in Bavaria.</i>

363
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,719
<i>The stone here splits into flat,
smooth leaves</i>

364
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,610
<i>that have been used as roofing tiles
since Roman times.</i>

365
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,399
<i>Most are blank, but occasionally,
when you split them apart,</i>

366
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,892
<i>they reveal a shrimp or a fish.</i>

367
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,719
It's almost impossible to resist
the temptation of pulling down

368
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,519
almost every boulder you see
and then opening it like a book.

369
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,079
to look at each unopened page
to see whether, maybe,

370
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,333
it contains yet another fossil.

371
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,171
<i>But this fossil
was something unprecedented.</i>

372
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,639
<i>It is still one of the greatest
of the treasures that are stored</i>

373
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,256
<i>in the Natural History Museum.</i>

374
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,519
And this is it.

375
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,359
It's called Archaeopteryx.

376
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,011
It has unmistakable feathers
on its wings

377
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,451
and down its tail.

378
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,079
So Owen had no hesitation
in calling it a bird.

379
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,319
But it was unlike any other bird
that anyone knew of,

380
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,239
because it had claws
on the front of its wings,

381
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,399
and as was later discovered, it didn't
have a beak but jaws with teeth in it,

382
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,893
and a line of bones
supporting its tail.

383
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,298
So it was part reptile, part bird.

384
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,937
Here was the link between those two
great groups that was no longer missing.

385
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,488
Gosh, you really can see
the filaments there.

386
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,339
<i>Other examples of the same creature
show its feathers even more clearly.</i>

387
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,719
<i>We know from the bones
of the Archaeopteryx</i>

388
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,119
<i>that it was at best a very poor flyer.</i>

389
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,559
<i>So, it's not surprising
that eventually it was superseded</i>

390
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,620
<i>by more modern, more efficient birds.</i>

391
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,599
And that's the fate of these links
between great groups.

392
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,239
Eventually, they become extinct.

393
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,839
And the only way we know they existed

394
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,490
is from their fossilized remains.

395
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,359
Even so, there is a bird alive today
that illustrates the link

396
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,535
between modern birds and reptiles.

397
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,359
<i>The hoatzin nests in the swamps
of tropical South America.</i>

398
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,319
<i>There are caiman in the water beneath,
ready to snap up any chick</i>

399
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,959
<i>that might fall from its nest.</i>

400
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,159
<i>So, an ability to hold on tight
is very valuable.</i>

401
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,970
<i>And the nestlings have
a very interesting way of doing that.</i>

402
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,216
<i>The young still have claws on the front
of their wings as Archaeopteryx did.</i>

403
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,119
<i>Here is vivid evidence that the wings
of birds are modified forelegs</i>

404
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,009
<i>and once had toes with claws on them.</i>

405
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,399
<i>There's another creature alive today
that represents a link</i>

406
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,239
<i>between the great animal groups.</i>

407
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,639
<i>A descendant of a group of reptiles</i>

408
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,199
<i>that took a different
evolutionary course</i>

409
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,659
<i>and evolved not feathers but fur,
the platypus.</i>

410
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,759
When specimens of this creature
first reached Europe from Australia

411
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,811
at the very end of the 18th century,
people refused to believe their eyes.

412
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,239
They said it was a hoax.

413
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,759
Bits and pieces of different creatures
rather crudely sewn together.

414
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,959
And, yet, in a way,
those early sceptics were right.

415
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,239
<i>The platypus is the most extraordinary
mixture of different animals.</i>

416
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,039
<i>It's part mammal and part reptile.</i>

417
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,772
<i>And so it can give us some idea of
how the first mammals developed.</i>

418
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,679
<i>When it comes to breed,</i>

419
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,159
<i>it does something that separates it
from all other mammals except one.</i>

420
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,369
<i>In its nest, deep in the burrow,
it lays eggs.</i>

421
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,119
It's this that links the platypus
with the reptiles.

422
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,899
This that entitles it to be regarded
as the most primitive living mammal.

423
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,679
<i>So, the links between
the great animal groups</i>

424
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,812
<i>are not, in fact, missing, but exist
both as fossils and as living animals.</i>

425
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,199
Although the fossil record
provides an answer

426
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,599
to the problem of missing links,
it also posed a major problem.

427
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,599
It started very abruptly.

428
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,719
The earliest known fossils
in Darwin's time

429
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,319
came from a formation
called the Cambrian.

430
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,759
And there were two main kinds.

431
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,679
These, which look like fretsaw blades
and are called graptolite,

432
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,458
and these, like giant wood lice,
which are called trilobites.

433
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,039
Could it really be
that life on Earth started

434
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,816
with creatures as complex as these?

435
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,212
As a boy,
I was a passionate collector of fossils.

436
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,639
I grew up in the city of Leicester,

437
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,079
and I knew that in this area,
not far from the city,

438
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,959
called Charnwood forest,

439
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,599
there were the oldest rocks
in the world.

440
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,159
Older even than the Cambrian.

441
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,919
So, therefore, by definition,
they would be without fossils.

442
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,369
There was no point in me looking
for fossils in these ancient rocks.

443
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,439
There were, it's true,

444
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,970
very rarely, some rather odd shapes
in these rocks, like this one here.

445
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,519
But they were dismissed as being
some kind of mechanical aberration.

446
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,199
I mean, after all,
how could there be anything living

447
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,658
in these extremely ancient rocks?

448
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,119
And then, in 1957,

449
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:11,399
a schoolboy with rather more patience
and perspicacity than I had

450
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,599
found something really remarkable.

451
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,616
<i>And undeniably
the remains of a living creature.</i>

452
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,639
And here it is in Leicester museum,

453
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,959
where it's been brought
for safe-keeping.

454
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,479
It's called Charnia.

455
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,639
Who could doubt that this
is the impression of a living organism?

456
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,258
It has a central stem,
branches on either side.

457
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,679
In fact, it seems to have been
something like the sea pens

458
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,978
that today grow on coral reefs.

459
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,719
Since its discovery,
a whole range of organisms

460
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,039
have been found in rocks
of this extreme age.

461
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,879
Not only here in the Charnwood forest

462
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,735
but in many other
different parts of the world.

463
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,879
<i>Fossil hunters searching these rocks
in the Ediacara Hills of Australia</i>

464
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,929
<i>had also been discovering
other strange shapes.</i>

465
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,359
At first, many scientists refused
to believe that these faint impressions

466
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,359
were the remains of jellyfish.

467
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,919
But, by now, enough specimens
have been discovered

468
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,095
to make quite sure that,
that indeed is what they are.

469
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,279
<i>So, now we know
that life did not begin suddenly</i>

470
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,692
<i>with those complex animals
of the Cambrian.</i>

471
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,879
<i>It started much, much earlier,
first with simple microscopic forms,</i>

472
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,439
<i>which eventually became bigger, but
which were still so soft and delicate</i>

473
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,410
<i>that they only very rarely
left any mark in the rocks.</i>

474
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,559
<i>The question of the age of the Earth</i>

475
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,733
<i>posed another problem
for Darwin's theory.</i>

476
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,999
In the 17th century, an Irish bishop
had used the genealogies

477
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,799
recorded in the Bible
that lead back to Adam

478
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,239
to work out that the week of Creation

479
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,799
must have taken place
in the year 4004 B.C.

480
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,319
That may seem to us to be
a very naive way of doing things,

481
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,731
but what other method was there anyway?

482
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,119
<i>The Victorian geologists
had already concluded</i>

483
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,199
<i>that the Earth must be
millions of years old.</i>

484
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,817
<i>But how many millions, no one could say.</i>

485
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,799
<i>Then, less than 50 years
after the publication ofThe Origin,</i>

486
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,599
<i>a discovery was made in what seemed
a totally disconnected branch of science</i>

487
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,660
<i>that would ultimately
provide the answer.</i>

488
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,959
<i>A Polish woman working in Paris,
Marie Curie,</i>

489
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,119
<i>discovered that some rocks
contained an element called uranium</i>

490
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,899
<i>that decays over time at a steady rate
through a process called radiation.</i>

491
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,599
<i>Today, a century after she made
her extraordinary discovery,</i>

492
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,639
<i>the method of dating
by measuring changes in radioactivity</i>

493
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,608
<i>has become greatly refined.</i>

494
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,519
<i>This is a sample taken from those
very ancient rocks in Charnwood forest.</i>

495
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,239
<i>And these tiny crystals
are revealed to be</i>

496
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,759
<i>562 million years old.</i>

497
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,799
<i>That provides more than enough time
for natural selection</i>

498
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,079
<i>to produce the procession of fossils</i>

499
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,971
<i>that eventually leads to the
living animals and plants we know today.</i>

500
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,839
But there was another objection.

501
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,439
If all animals within a group
have a common origin,

502
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,759
how is it that some kinds of animals
are distributed

503
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
throughout the continents of the world
except for Antarctica?

504
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,319
How is it that, for example,
frogs in Europe and Africa

505
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,559
are also found here in South America
on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean?

506
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,119
Bearing in mind
that frogs have permeable skins

507
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,373
and can't survive in sea water.

508
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,279
Darwin himself had
a couple of suggestions.

509
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,119
One was that they might
have floated across accidentally

510
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,599
on rafts of vegetation.

511
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,399
And the other is that maybe there were
land bridges between the continents.

512
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,336
But even he was not convinced
by either explanation.

513
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,519
Even as late as 1947,

514
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,279
when I was a geology student
here at Cambridge,

515
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,039
there was no convincing explanation.

516
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,799
It's true that back in 1912,
a German geologist had suggested

517
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,239
that at one time
in the very remote distant past,

518
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,359
all the continents of the Earth
that we know today

519
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,679
were grouped together
to form one huge supercontinent.

520
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,334
And that over time this broke up
and the pieces drifted apart.

521
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,098
That would have provided an answer.

522
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,599
But when I asked the professor of
geology here, who was lecturing to us,

523
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,159
why he didn't tell us about that
in his lectures,

524
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,959
he replied rather loftily, I must say,

525
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,599
"When you can demonstrate to me
that there is a force on Earth

526
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,439
"that can move the continents
by a millimetre, I will consider it.

527
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,172
"But until then, the idea
is sheer moonshine, dear boy".

528
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,679
<i>But then in the 1960s, it became
possible to map the seafloor in detail</i>

529
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,519
<i>and it was discovered not only
that the continents have shifted</i>

530
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,479
<i>in just the way that
the German geologist had suggested</i>

531
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,050
<i>but that they were still moving.</i>

532
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,759
<i>New rock wells up from
deep below the Earth's crust</i>

533
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,239
<i>and flows away on either side
of the mid-ocean ridges,</i>

534
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,696
<i>carrying the continents with it.</i>

535
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,719
<i>Amphibians had originally evolved
on this supercontinent</i>

536
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,839
<i>and had then travelled on each
of its various fragments</i>

537
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,969
<i>as they drifted apart. Problem solved.</i>

538
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,319
Perhaps, the biggest problem of all
for most people

539
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,039
was the argument put forward
for the existence of God

540
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,639
at the beginning of the 19th century

541
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,919
by an Anglican clergyman
called William Paley.

542
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,279
He said, supposing you were walking
in the countryside

543
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,119
and you picked up something like this.

544
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:57,809
You would know from looking at it that
it had been designed to tell the time.

545
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,839
There must, therefore, be a designer.

546
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,559
And the same argument
would apply if you looked

547
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,599
at one of the intricate structures
found in nature, such as the human eye.

548
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,651
And the only designer of the human eye
could be God.

549
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,999
Anti-evolutionists maintain
that the eye would only work

550
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,599
if it was complete in all its details.

551
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,439
Darwin, on the other hand,
argued that the eye had developed

552
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,799
becoming increasingly complex
over a long period of time.

553
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,239
That would only work
if each stage of development

554
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,079
was an improvement on the previous one.

555
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,599
And today, we know enough
about the animal kingdom

556
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,217
to know that is indeed the case.

557
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,119
<i>Some very simple animals have nothing
more than light-sensitive spots</i>

558
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,039
<i>that enable them to tell the difference
between light and dark.</i>

559
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,519
<i>But if a patch of such spots formed
even the shallowest of pits,</i>

560
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,811
<i>one edge of the pit would throw a shadow
and so reveal the direction of light.</i>

561
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,199
<i>If the pit got deeper
and started to close,</i>

562
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,373
<i>then light would form a blurred image.</i>

563
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,239
<i>Mucus secreted by the cells
would bend the light and focus it.</i>

564
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,839
<i>If this mucus hardened,
it would form a proper lens</i>

565
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,218
<i>and transmit a brighter
and clearer image.</i>

566
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,319
<i>All these different
fully functional stages</i>

567
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,132
<i>at different levels of complexity
are found in living animals today.</i>

568
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,972
<i>This single-celled creature has
one of those light-sensitive spots.</i>

569
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,839
<i>Flatworms have a small pit
containing light spots</i>

570
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,138
<i>so they can detect the shadow
of a predator.</i>

571
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,730
<i>A snail's blurry vision is good enough
to enable it to find its way to food.</i>

572
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,639
<i>And the octopus has an eye
with a proper lens</i>

573
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,608
<i>and can see as much detail as we can.</i>

574
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,879
<i>So the structure of the human eye
does not demand the assistance</i>

575
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,799
<i>of a supernatural designer.</i>

576
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,599
<i>It can have evolved gradually,</i>

577
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,639
<i>with each stage
bringing a real advantage</i>

578
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,496
<i>as Darwin's theory demands.</i>

579
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,919
Natural selection, of course, requires
that an animal's characteristics

580
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,093
are handed from one generation
to the next.

581
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,919
<i>It's obvious that children
resemble their parents.</i>

582
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,719
<i>Anyone knows that.</i>

583
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,815
<i>But when you come to think of it,
how does that come about?</i>

584
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,639
In Darwin's time,
nobody had the faintest idea

585
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,079
about the mechanism or the rules
that govern that process.

586
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,879
Except, perhaps, for one man,

587
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,799
who was working in the city of Brno
in what is now the Czech Republic

588
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,519
at exactly the same time that Darwin
was writing his book in Kent.

589
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,773
That man's name was Gregor Mendel.

590
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,559
<i>He discovered the laws of inheritance
by breeding thousands of pea plants</i>

591
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,848
<i>and observing how they changed
from one generation to the next.</i>

592
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,959
<i>He found that while many characteristics
were passed down directly</i>

593
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,919
<i>from one generation to another,
others could actually skip a generation.</i>

594
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,012
<i>How could that happen?</i>

595
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,839
<i>Mendel explained this by suggesting
that each plant, each organism,</i>

596
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,039
<i>contained within it
factors which were responsible</i>

597
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,135
<i>for creating
those particular characteristics.</i>

598
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,759
<i>Today we call those things genes.</i>

599
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,839
<i>But nobody had any idea how they worked</i>

600
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,377
<i>until a hundred years
after Mendel's time.</i>

601
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,490
And then the answer
was discovered in Cambridge.

602
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,399
In 1953,
here in the Cavendish Laboratories,

603
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,519
two young researchers Francis Crick
and James Watson

604
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,739
were building models like this.

605
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,159
It was their way of thinking about
and investigating the structure

606
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:27,532
of a complex molecule that is found
in the genes of all animals, DNA.

607
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,699
The crucial bit are these chains
which encircle the rod.

608
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,519
And here is a second and entwined.

609
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,818
This is the double helix.

610
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,679
<i>The workings of the DNA molecule
are now understood in such detail</i>

611
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,695
<i>that we can demonstrate something
that is truly astounding.</i>

612
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,859
<i>A gene taken from one animal
can function in another.</i>

613
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,399
<i>The gene that causes a jellyfish
to be luminous, for example,</i>

614
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,735
<i>transplanted into a mouse,
will make that mouse luminous.</i>

615
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,559
<i>The genetic code
can also reveal relationships.</i>

616
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,759
<i>Even our law courts accept
that DNA fingerprinting</i>

617
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,889
<i>can establish whether a man
is the father of a particular child.</i>

618
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,999
<i>And it can also reveal
whether one kind of animal</i>

619
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,456
<i>is related to another.</i>

620
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,199
<i>It proves, for example, that kangaroos,
ground-living animals</i>

621
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,519
<i>that run with great leaps
are closely related to koalas,</i>

622
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,215
<i>that have taken to climbing trees.</i>

623
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,159
<i>That insect-eating shrews</i>

624
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,858
<i>have cousins that took to the air
in search of insects, bats.</i>

625
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,559
<i>And that one branch of the elephant
family, way back in geological history,</i>

626
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,496
<i>took to the water and became sea cows.</i>

627
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:19,279
So, 150 years after the publication
of Darwin's revolutionary book,

628
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,719
modern genetics has confirmed
its fundamental truth.

629
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,450
All life is related.

630
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,399
And it enables us to construct
with confidence the complex tree

631
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,359
that represents the history of life.

632
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:42,279
It began in the sea,
some 3,000 million years ago.

633
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,999
Complex chemical molecules
began to clump together

634
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,413
to form microscopic blobs, cells.

635
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,936
<i>These were the seeds from which
the tree of life developed.</i>

636
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,091
<i>They were able to split,
replicating themselves as bacteria do.</i>

637
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,613
<i>And as time passed,
they diversified into different groups.</i>

638
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,559
<i>Some remained attached to one another,
so that they formed chains.</i>

639
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,415
<i>We know them today as algae.</i>

640
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,239
<i>Others formed hollow balls,
which collapsed upon themselves,</i>

641
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,413
<i>creating a body with an internal cavity.</i>

642
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,048
<i>They were the first
multi-celled organisms.</i>

643
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,573
<i>Sponges are their direct descendants.</i>

644
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:35,732
<i>As more variations appeared, the tree
of life grew and became more diverse.</i>

645
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,279
<i>Some organisms became more mobile</i>

646
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,170
<i>and developed a mouth
that opened into a gut.</i>

647
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,934
<i>Others had bodies stiffened
by an internal rod.</i>

648
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,058
<i>They, understandably, developed
sense organs around their front end.</i>

649
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,719
<i>A related group had bodies that were
divided into segments,</i>

650
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,919
<i>with little projections on either side</i>

651
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,854
<i>that helped them to move around
on the sea floor.</i>

652
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,439
<i>Some of these segmented creatures
developed hard, protective skins</i>

653
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,851
<i>which gave their body some rigidity.</i>

654
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,856
<i>So now the seas were filled
with a great variety of animals.</i>

655
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,159
<i>And then, around 450 million years ago,
some of these armoured creatures</i>

656
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,539
<i>crawled up out of the water
and ventured onto land.</i>

657
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,559
<i>And here, the tree of life branched into
a multitude of different species</i>

658
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,370
<i>that exploited this new environment
in all kinds of ways.</i>

659
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,319
<i>One group of them developed
elongated flaps on their backs</i>

660
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,529
<i>which, over many generations,
eventually developed into wings.</i>

661
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,289
<i>The insects had arrived.</i>

662
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,039
<i>Life moved into the air</i>

663
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,930
<i>and diversified into myriad forms.</i>

664
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,759
<i>Meanwhile, back in the seas,</i>

665
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,359
<i>those creatures with the stiffening rod
in their bodies</i>

666
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,057
<i>had strengthened it
by encasing it in bone.</i>

667
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,889
<i>A skull developed, with a hinged jaw
that could grab and hold onto prey.</i>

668
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,519
<i>They grew bigger and developed fins
equipped with muscles</i>

669
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,137
<i>that enabled them to swim
with speed and power.</i>

670
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,413
<i>So fish now dominated
the waters of the world.</i>

671
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:34,929
<i>One group of them developed the ability
to gulp air from the water surface.</i>

672
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,919
<i>Their fleshy fins became
weight-supporting legs,</i>

673
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,039
<i>and 375 million years ago,
a few of these backboned creatures</i>

674
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,293
<i>followed the insects onto the land.</i>

675
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,599
<i>They were amphibians, with wet skins,</i>

676
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,919
<i>and they had to return to water
to lay their eggs.</i>

677
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,439
<i>But some of their descendants
evolved dry, scaly skins,</i>

678
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,411
<i>and broke their link with water
by laying eggs with watertight shells.</i>

679
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,079
<i>These creatures, the reptiles,
were the ancestors of today's</i>

680
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,016
<i>tortoises, snakes,
lizards and crocodiles.</i>

681
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,639
<i>And, of course, they included the group
that, back then,</i>

682
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,815
<i>came to dominate the land...
the dinosaurs.</i>

683
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,056
<i>But 65 million years ago,
a great disaster overtook the Earth.</i>

684
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,695
<i>Whatever its cause, a great proportion
of animals were exterminated.</i>

685
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,639
<i>All the dinosaurs disappeared,
except for one branch</i>

686
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,212
<i>whose scales had become
modified into feathers.</i>

687
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,239
<i>They were the birds.</i>

688
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,719
<i>While they spread through the skies,
a small, seemingly insignificant,</i>

689
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,372
<i>group of survivors began to increase
in numbers on the ground beneath.</i>

690
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,279
<i>These creatures differed
from their competitors</i>

691
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,659
<i>in that their bodies were warm
and insulated with coats of fur.</i>

692
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,359
<i>They were the first mammals.</i>

693
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,719
<i>With much of the land left vacant
after the great catastrophe,</i>

694
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,415
<i>they now had their chance.</i>

695
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,159
<i>Their warm, insulated bodies
enabled them to be active at all times,</i>

696
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,094
<i>at night as well as during the day.</i>

697
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,693
<i>And in all places,
from the Arctic to the tropics,</i>

698
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,879
<i>in water as well as on land,</i>

699
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,089
<i>on grassy plains and up in the trees.</i>

700
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,039
There can be no doubt about
our close relationship

701
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,319
to these chimpanzees.

702
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,679
Our bodies are so similar.

703
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,479
The proportions of our limbs
or our faces may differ,

704
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,494
but otherwise we are
very, very similar.

705
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,519
The arrangement of our internal organs,

706
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,399
the chemistry of our blood,

707
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,839
the way our bodies work,

708
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,639
all these are almost identical.

709
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,599
And DNA confirms that.

710
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,799
Indeed, we are as closely related
to chimpanzees

711
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,159
and the rest of the apes and monkeys,

712
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,292
as say, lions are to tigers
and to the rest of the cat family.

713
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,479
Suddenly, an image from our remote past
comes vividly to light,

714
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,839
the time when our distant ancestors,

715
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,559
in order to keep up
with the changing environment,

716
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,079
had to wade and keep their heads
above water in order to find food.

717
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,999
That crucial moment
when our far distant ancestors

718
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,839
took the step away from being apes

719
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,138
and a step towards humanity.

720
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,119
<i>The Natural History Museum is one of
the most important museums of its kind</i>

721
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,599
<i>in the world.</i>

722
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,239
<i>Richard Owen brought it into existence,
but, over a century later,</i>

723
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,919
<i>discoveries from
many branches of science</i>

724
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,439
<i>have shown that his belief
that species can never change</i>

725
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,058
<i>but always remain exactly the same
was mistaken.</i>

726
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:47,178
<i>It was Charles Darwin's profound
insights that have proved to be true.</i>

727
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,839
<i>And now, to mark
the 200th anniversary of his birth,</i>

728
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,839
<i>his statue is being taken
from its out-of-the-way location</i>

729
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,333
<i>to be placed centre stage
in the main hall.</i>

730
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,839
Darwin's great insight revolutionised
the way in which we see the world.

731
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,399
We now understand
why there are so many different species.

732
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,639
Why they are distributed
in the way they are around the world.

733
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,611
And why their bodies and our bodies
are shaped in the way that they are.

734
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,279
Because we understand
that bacteria evolve,

735
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,319
we can devise methods of dealing
with the diseases they cause.

736
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,799
And because we can disentangle
the complex relationships

737
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,999
between animals and plants
in a natural community,

738
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,359
we can foresee some of the consequences
when we start to interfere

739
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,930
with those communities.

740
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,839
But above all, Darwin has shown us
that we are not apart

741
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,479
from the natural world.

742
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,119
We do not have dominion over it.

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,459
to which indeed we are related.
