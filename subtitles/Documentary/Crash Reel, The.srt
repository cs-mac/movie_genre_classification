1
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,394
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,234
What?

3
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,209
Any real city, you walk, you know?

4
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,079
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,242
In L.A., nobody touches you.

6
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,254
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

7
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,628
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,689
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,897
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,098
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,976
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,010
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,910
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,074
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:43,144
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,656
And I'm gonna go look for it.

17
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,492
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,690
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,734
Why? It's not my fault!
It's her fault! She do this!

20
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,630
My fault?

21
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,634
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

22
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,670
My fault?

23
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,240
Stop in middle of street!
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,343
She "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,140
I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

26
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,307
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

27
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,852
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

28
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,922
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

29
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,012
Ma'am!

30
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,388
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

31
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,224
Officer, can you please write in your report how
shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!

32
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,424
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

33
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,839
All right. You've got to calm down.

34
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,747
Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.

35
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,581
Fuck you.

36
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,624
Hey, you okay?

37
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,987
I'm freezin'.

38
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,858
Shit. I heard it might snow.

39
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,262
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

40
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,062
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

41
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,864
Yeah, me too.

42
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,473
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

43
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,047
Hey, Bob.

44
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,961
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

45
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,836
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

46
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,541
What do you want?

47
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,786
Are you making insult at me?

48
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,788
Am I making insult "at" you?
Is that the closest you can come to English?

49
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,825
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.
- Oh, God, here we go.

50
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,292
I have right like you.
I have right to buy gun.

51
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,523
Not in my store, you don't!
Andy, get him outta here now!

52
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,792
- Go wait in the car.
- Now. Get out!

53
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,793
You're an ignorant man!

54
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,528
Yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country.

55
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,697
And I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

56
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,833
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

57
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,605
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

58
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,613
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

59
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,182
Okay.

60
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,585
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

61
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,750
And I am really hoping
for the money.

62
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,124
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

63
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,224
We got a lot of kinds.

64
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,735
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

65
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,363
flat nose, hollow points,
wide cutters,

66
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,943
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

67
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,810
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

68
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,116
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

69
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,789
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

70
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,099
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

71
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,672
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

72
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,709
You don't drink coffee
and I didn't want any.

73
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,507
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

74
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,674
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

75
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,752
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

76
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,083
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

77
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,179
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

78
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,758
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

79
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,294
You tell me.
When was the last time you met one

80
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,659
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

81
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,629
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

82
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,997
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

83
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,901
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

84
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,975
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

85
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,543
How much did you leave?

86
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,545
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

87
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,042
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

88
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,177
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

89
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,486
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

90
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,120
Okay, no more phone calls.
As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.

91
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,061
Okay?

92
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,866
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

93
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,665
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

94
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,739
- You see that?
- She's cold.

95
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,207
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

96
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,439
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

97
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,006
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

98
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,018
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

99
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,816
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

100
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,357
and her reaction
is blind fear?

101
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,949
Look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

102
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,394
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

103
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,400
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

104
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,471
We're the only two black faces surrounded by
a sea of over-caffeinated white people

105
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,302
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

106
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,970
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

107
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,274
'Cause we got guns?

108
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,281
You could be right.

109
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,483
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

110
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,319
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

111
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,657
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

112
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,289
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

113
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,941
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

114
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,374
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

115
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,343
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dawg.

116
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,314
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

117
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,910
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

118
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,113
Why the hell do you do that?

119
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,089
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

120
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,358
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

121
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,164
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

122
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,967
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

123
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,973
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

124
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,510
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

125
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,477
I got the Mercedes.

126
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,011
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

127
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,680
Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the
door, falls out dead.

128
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,587
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

129
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,489
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

130
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,653
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

131
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,357
Shot back in self-defense.

132
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:10,663
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

133
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,634
Find me a witness.

134
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,583
That is a nice gun.

135
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,251
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

136
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,225
And that's not Cindy.

137
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,126
That is a William Lewis.

138
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,200
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

139
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,642
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

140
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,316
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

141
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,413
Thank you.

142
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,468
You don't think reporters listen to police calls?

143
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,368
I need to talk to you
for a second.

144
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,709
You just give me a minute,
all right?

145
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,677
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,504
Yes, honey?

147
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,447
I want the locks changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,282
You want... Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

149
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,323
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

150
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,657
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

151
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,057
It's okay.
Just go to bed.

152
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,658
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

153
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,864
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
Is okay I go home now?

154
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,497
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

155
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,269
You're welcome. No problem.
Good night.

156
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,141
- Good night.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

157
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,343
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

158
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,783
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

159
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,082
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

160
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,487
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

161
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,288
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

162
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,623
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really?

163
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,028
And he's not gonna sell our key
to one of his gangbanger friends

164
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,498
- the moment he is out our door?
- We've had a tough night.

165
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,298
- It'd be best if you went upstairs...
- And wait for them to break in?

166
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,874
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

167
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:30,976
You lower your voice!

168
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,977
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

169
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,570
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

170
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,243
and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

171
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,946
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

172
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,319
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

173
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,622
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

174
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,222
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

175
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,356
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

176
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,397
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

177
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,898
I'm the goddamn
District Attorney of Los Angeles.

178
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,197
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

179
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,135
Fuck!

180
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,605
Why did these guys
have to be black?

181
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,371
I mean, why?

182
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,139
No matter how we spin this,

183
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,307
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

184
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,977
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

185
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,213
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

186
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:56,886
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

187
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,827
Bruce?

188
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,726
The firefighter.

189
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,802
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

190
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,030
He's Iraqi.

191
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,236
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

192
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,142
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

193
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,238
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

194
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,445
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

195
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,748
Give yourself a raise, will you?

196
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,489
It's been good
doing business with you.

197
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,729
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

198
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,461
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

199
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,470
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

200
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,474
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

201
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,878
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

202
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:54,112
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan, why don't you

203
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,780
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

204
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,949
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

205
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,856
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

206
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,760
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

207
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,763
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

208
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,561
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

209
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,250
<i>Bronson Avenue, Westwood</i>.

210
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,050
<i>Vehicle is described as a black</i>
<i>late-model Lincoln Navigator</i>.

211
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,684
<i>California plate</i>
<i>4 Peter Charles Ida 315</i>.

212
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,230
<i>Suspects are two black males,</i>
<i>approximately 20 years of age</i>.

213
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,663
That's not it.

214
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,842
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

215
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,675
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

216
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,051
They were doin' something.

217
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,765
Enthusiastic.

218
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,129
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

219
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,503
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license and registration.

220
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,769
No problem.

221
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,745
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

222
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,214
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

223
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,682
Okay.

224
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,018
How are you tonight, Officer?

225
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,025
Excellent.

226
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,558
Here you go.

227
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,926
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

228
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,404
Let's do it again right now.

229
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,273
Step outta the car, please, sir.

230
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,080
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

231
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,417
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

232
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,117
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

233
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,126
No, it's okay.

234
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,718
It's fine.

235
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,792
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

236
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,599
That's good. Right there.

237
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,866
Look at me.

238
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,711
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

239
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,977
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

240
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,380
I told you he doesn't drink.

241
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,687
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

242
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,387
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

243
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,863
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

244
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,163
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

245
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,272
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

246
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,170
Wait. We're only a block away from our house.

247
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,675
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

248
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,837
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

249
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,711
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

250
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,148
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

251
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,345
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

252
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,944
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

253
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,023
Put your hands...

254
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,922
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

255
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,654
You motherfucking pig!

256
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,289
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

257
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,128
Of course you know that.

258
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:06,067
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

259
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,969
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

260
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,803
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

261
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,969
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

262
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,377
Put your legs open.

263
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,610
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

264
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,212
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

265
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,451
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

266
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,457
He's clean.

267
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,863
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

268
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,066
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

269
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,330
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

270
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:44,568
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

271
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:51,174
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

272
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,148
You say you're a block from home.

273
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,621
We could use our discretion

274
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,749
and let you go with a warning,

275
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,127
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

276
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,833
What do you think
we should do, sir?

277
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,573
Look, we're sorry, and

278
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,208
we would appreciate if you would just
let us go with a warning, please.

279
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,518
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

280
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,719
I think we can let him go.
Don't you?

281
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,989
Yeah.

282
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,363
All right.

283
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,003
You can go.

284
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,845
You folks
drive safe now, huh?

285
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,450
Let's go, Tommy.

286
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,494
It won't close.

287
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:46,798
I can do that.

288
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,798
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

289
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,891
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

290
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,332
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

291
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,238
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

292
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,710
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

293
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,303
Farhad, it won't close.

294
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,353
Dorri, you should be at work.

295
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,891
Who are you calling?

296
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,629
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

297
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,731
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

298
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:35,210
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

299
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,144
And you just stood there!

300
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,948
And then you apologized to him?

301
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,953
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

302
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,491
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

303
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,358
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

304
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,331
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

305
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,231
than get your name in the paper.

306
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,463
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

307
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,369
that's exactly
what I was worried about right there.

308
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,535
Oh? You weren't afraid that
all your good friends at the studio

309
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,513
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

310
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,175
You need to calm down right now.

311
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:19,121
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

312
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,193
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

313
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,592
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

314
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,429
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

315
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,335
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

316
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:37,135
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching <i>The Cosby Show</i>.

317
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,336
At least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

318
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,606
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

319
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,808
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

320
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,784
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

321
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,617
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

322
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:56,251
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

323
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,697
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

324
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,027
You know, fuck you!

325
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,765
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

326
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,681
How's it goin'?

327
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,452
Okay.

328
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,687
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

329
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,559
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

330
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,657
There's no such thing
as monsters.

331
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,759
Ah, that's a good thing.

332
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,370
I heard a bang.

333
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,063
Like a truck bang?

334
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,265
Like a gun.

335
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,383
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

336
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,284
And there's not
too many guns around here.

337
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,057
How far can bullets go?

338
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,128
They go pretty far.

339
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,026
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

340
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,792
What if they don't?

341
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,666
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

342
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,432
You think we should move again?

343
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,974
I like it here.

344
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,068
Me too. But if that bullet
found out where we lived...

345
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,703
Oh, hold on.

346
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,305
What?

347
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,441
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

348
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,820
What?

349
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,684
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

350
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,349
Tell me.

351
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,661
Okay.

352
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,426
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

353
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,161
- Right.
- See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.

354
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,737
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

355
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,138
Okay.

356
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:30,510
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

357
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,640
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

358
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,845
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

359
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,320
She was flying?

360
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,051
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

361
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,787
Like I'm gonna believe
she's a fairy.

362
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,863
So she said, "I'll prove it."

363
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,558
So she reaches
into her backpack.

364
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,931
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

365
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,631
She ties it around my neck, and she tells me
that it's impenetrable.

366
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,004
You know what
impenetrable means?

367
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,974
It means that nothing
can go through it.

368
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,275
No bullets. Nothing.

369
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,248
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

370
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:11,311
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

371
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,358
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

372
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,418
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

373
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,293
And I forgot.

374
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,888
Can I touch it?

375
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,058
Sure, go ahead.

376
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,463
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

377
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,475
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

378
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,207
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

379
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,113
No, not anymore.

380
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,153
So what do you think?
You want it?

381
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,156
Okay, let's get outta here.

382
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,868
Okay.

383
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,512
Put your head up.

384
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,187
Okay. Is that too tight?

385
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,761
Do you feel anything at all?

386
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,263
Good. Then it's just right.

387
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,039
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

388
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,938
No, you leave it on
all the time.

389
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:44,413
Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

390
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,813
Okay?

391
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,651
Okay.

392
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,524
Okay. Good night, sweetie.

393
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,251
Good night.

394
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,002
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

395
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,170
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

396
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,540
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that."

397
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,103
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

398
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,649
"Hey, honky, how's business?"

399
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,718
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying."

400
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:59,620
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

401
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,453
And you think
there's a difference, don't you? Huh?

402
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,655
<i>Gonna buy me a rope</i>
<i>and lynch me a nigger</i>

403
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,960
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

404
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,627
<i>I'd shoot 'em dead first</i>
<i>but I done broke my trigger</i>

405
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,999
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

406
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,436
<i>Gonna get out my sheet</i>
<i>Put my hood on my head</i>

407
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,442
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

408
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,909
<i>Gonna string 'em up good</i>

409
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,809
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

410
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,609
<i>Then they'll be dead</i>

411
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,707
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that."

412
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,616
<i>Home of the brave</i>
<i>and the land of the free</i>

413
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,780
"Let's give the niggers
this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots

414
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,620
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

415
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,717
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

416
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,989
End of problem."

417
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,301
What the fuck was that, dawg?

418
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,849
- Holy shit!
- What?

419
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,513
Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

420
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,487
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

421
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,685
What part don't you understand?

422
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,627
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

423
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,033
Help me.

424
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,829
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

425
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,633
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

426
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,805
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

427
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,775
Oh, really? No shit!

428
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,939
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

429
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,017
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

430
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,312
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

431
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,287
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

432
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,084
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

433
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,285
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

434
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:48,627
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

435
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,191
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

436
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,929
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

437
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,836
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

438
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,841
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

439
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,304
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

440
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,375
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

441
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,856
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

442
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,019
I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.

443
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,563
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

444
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,462
He's been on the force for a long time.

445
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,728
Seventeen years.

446
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,064
And I do have to work here, sir.

447
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,605
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

448
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,676
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

449
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,575
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

450
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,477
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

451
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,380
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

452
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,420
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

453
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,682
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

454
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,190
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

455
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,989
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

456
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:55,998
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

457
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,365
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.

458
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,371
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

459
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,374
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

460
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,411
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

461
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:13,280
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

462
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,477
You wanna know what I heard?

463
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,980
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

464
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,217
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

465
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,089
Not him. You.
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

466
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,653
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

467
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,700
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

468
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,736
I wouldn't be either. Which is why
I understand your need for privacy.

469
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,604
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

470
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,836
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

471
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,971
And how easily
that can be taken away.

472
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,176
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

473
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:52,086
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,

474
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,092
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

475
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,492
of a personal nature.

476
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,767
Fuck.

477
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,132
Excuse me.

478
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,094
Excuse me. Sir?

479
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,465
You finished?

480
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,371
I replaced the lock.
But you got a real problem with that door.

481
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,943
You fix the lock?

482
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,208
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

483
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,716
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

484
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,982
What you need
is a new door.

485
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,523
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

486
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,093
Okay. How much?

487
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:07,130
I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

488
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:11,327
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

489
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,596
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

490
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,070
Then go and fix the fucking lock, you cheater.

491
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,938
You... You know what?

492
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,501
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

493
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,013
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

494
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,279
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

495
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,877
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

496
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,424
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

497
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,756
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

498
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,558
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

499
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,395
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

500
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,503
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

501
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,764
Come here! You fix my lock!

502
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,396
Fix the fucking lock!

503
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:00,573
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

504
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,552
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

505
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,487
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

506
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,889
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

507
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,223
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

508
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,320
You watch the Discovery Channel?

509
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,832
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

510
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,529
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a blue light

511
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,869
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

512
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:29,504
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

513
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,106
The next thing they show is some stupid
redneck in handcuffs

514
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,415
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

515
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,547
Sometimes the redneck is actually watching
the Discovery Channel

516
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,649
when they break in to arrest him.

517
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,993
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

518
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,842
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

519
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,138
No.

520
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,805
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

521
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,444
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

522
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,953
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

523
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,824
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

524
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,793
Don't.

525
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,991
Graham Waters.

526
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,366
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

527
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,808
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

528
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:35,241
Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

529
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:40,010
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

530
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,551
Okay, where were we?

531
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,121
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

532
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,089
Oh, shit!

533
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,251
Come on.

534
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:55,321
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

535
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,731
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

536
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,497
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

537
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,075
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

538
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,542
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

539
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,978
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

540
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,143
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

541
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,187
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

542
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,648
Okay. I was raised badly.

543
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,195
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

544
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,255
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

545
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,497
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

546
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,663
Neither one of those is Mexico.

547
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,241
Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is

548
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,801
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

549
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,973
and taught them all how
to park their cars on their lawns?

550
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,144
Pop, you okay?

551
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,273
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

552
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,548
I'm... Jesus.

553
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,145
I'm done now.

554
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,282
Give me a hand.

555
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,729
Wait a goddamn minute!

556
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,492
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

557
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,937
All right. Okay. Okay.

558
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,939
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

559
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,710
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

560
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,090
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

561
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,696
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,499
- They know each other?
- Sir.

563
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,732
It's a grudge thing?

564
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,774
Not as far as we can tell.

565
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,908
You think this is
racially motivated?

566
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,346
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

567
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,417
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

568
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,511
Waters. All right. Well, tell him
he speaks to no one but me.

569
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,785
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

570
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,792
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

571
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,456
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

572
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:53,466
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"

573
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,596
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

574
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,231
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

575
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,276
The man steals
from black people.

576
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,610
Only reason black people steal from their own
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

577
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:06,978
Oh, man, please.

578
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,451
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

579
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,114
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

580
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,623
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

581
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,856
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

582
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,195
What the fuck did you do to my car?

583
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,044
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

584
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,113
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

585
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,148
James wanted to take this to school.

586
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,945
But I don't want the kids to fight over it.

587
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,783
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

588
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:50,792
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

589
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,689
<i>Si, senora</i>.
No problem.

590
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,029
I'm startin' to understand now.

591
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:01,069
By your work, you're settin' an example
for our neighborhood.

592
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,639
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

593
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,142
Yeah, you laugh, man.

594
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:10,406
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

595
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,576
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

596
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,152
Wavin' down the bus.

597
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,744
Put your hand down, dawg!
Are you outta your mind?

598
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,256
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

599
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,622
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

600
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,661
You know why? 'Cause we just don't
do stuff like that no more.

601
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,391
You have no idea, do you?

602
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,991
You have no idea why they put them great big
windows on the sides of buses, do you?

603
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,627
- Why?
- One reason only.

604
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:39,106
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

605
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,574
I didn't know that.

606
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,647
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

607
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,715
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

608
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:49,183
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

609
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,584
I love hockey.

610
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,247
Cut! Print. Moving on.

611
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,483
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

612
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,923
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

613
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,687
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

614
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,163
Right on.

615
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,504
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

616
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,368
Yeah. Listen. I think
we need another take, buddy.

617
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,204
That looked
pretty terrific, man.

618
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,474
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

619
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,515
What do you mean?

620
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:23,074
Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,

621
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,953
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

622
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,526
No, I haven't noticed that.

623
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:34,620
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to
say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

624
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,064
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

625
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,463
Wait a minute.

626
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:43,130
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

627
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,240
Come on!

628
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,433
Is there a problem, Cam?

629
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,169
Excuse me?

630
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,576
Is there a problem, Cam?

631
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,011
No, we don't have a problem.

632
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,319
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying
is it's not his character.

633
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,019
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

634
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,928
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

635
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:15,101
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

636
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,141
Everybody back.
Let's do it one more time.

637
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,771
Jamal, um...

638
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,612
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

639
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,051
Hold for a minute, please.

640
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:35,353
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

641
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,325
Send him in.

642
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,729
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

643
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,995
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

644
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,696
I believe we spoke last night.

645
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,275
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

646
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,401
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

647
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,003
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

648
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,211
This doctor he's been seein'
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

649
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,811
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

650
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,948
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

651
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,754
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

652
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,795
- Really?
- No offense.

653
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,332
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

654
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:21,496
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

655
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:26,075
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

656
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,304
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

657
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:33,008
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

658
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,812
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

659
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,285
All right.
You know what I can't do?

660
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,184
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

661
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,658
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

662
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,490
It's time for you to go.

663
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,725
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

664
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,460
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

665
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,832
someone who may have been
given a helping hand,

666
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,735
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

667
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,899
Carol, I need security in my office!

668
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,068
You don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

669
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,739
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

670
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,873
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

671
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,815
Saved enough to start
his own company.

672
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,887
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

673
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,684
Paid 'em equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

674
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:18,659
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

675
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,627
Then the city council decides to give

676
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,996
minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

677
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,864
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

678
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,405
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything!

679
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:34,170
Not once does he blame your people.

680
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:37,770
I'm not asking you to help me.

681
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:42,215
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

682
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,651
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

683
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,053
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

684
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,091
Nothing.

685
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,126
Just a flick of your pen.

686
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,631
Your father sounds
like a good man.

687
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:59,862
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

688
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:04,440
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

689
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,477
Get him the hell outta my office.

690
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,482
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

691
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:19,214
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

692
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,984
He say he fix the lock.

693
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,685
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- <i>You're yelling again</i>.

694
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,694
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

695
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,162
Yes... Yes, I am.

696
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,892
Mom, are you all right?

697
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:34,265
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

698
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,871
Okay?

699
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,640
Look what they wrote.

700
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,711
They think we're Arab.

701
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:43,904
When did Persian become Arab?

702
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,847
I want his name. Yes.

703
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,542
Oh, my God.

704
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,712
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

705
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,187
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

706
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,090
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

707
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,219
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

708
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,095
Don't hang up! Shit!

709
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,031
Oh, thank God.

710
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,243
Mom?

711
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,247
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

712
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,806
Did you find your brother?

713
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,073
No, Mom.

714
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,083
I was doin' good.

715
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,853
I was... I was doin' real good.

716
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,965
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

717
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,841
It's okay.

718
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,382
Did you find your brother?

719
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,125
No, Mom.

720
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,987
Tell him to come home.

721
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:21,666
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

722
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,365
Okay, Mom.

723
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,976
Okay, baby.

724
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,702
Okay.

725
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,771
Okay.

726
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,319
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

727
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,918
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

728
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,925
That's lunch. One hour.

729
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,957
I tried to call.

730
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,189
Sounded like you're havin'
a bad day, huh?

731
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,594
Yeah.

732
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,900
What?

733
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,874
I got scared, Cam.

734
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:10,436
It's not like I haven't been
pulled over before. You know?

735
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,538
But not like that.

736
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,874
And, yes, I was a little drunk.

737
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:19,922
And I was mouthing off.

738
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,218
I'm sorry.

739
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,090
But when that man was
putting his hands on me...

740
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,891
I don't wanna talk about it.

741
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:31,331
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

742
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,297
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

743
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,570
But I was humiliated!

744
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,838
For you.

745
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,406
I just couldn't stand to see
that man take away your dignity.

746
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,543
Yeah. That's what happened.

747
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,680
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

748
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,553
I ain't doin' it.

749
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,184
You gonna walk away from me?

750
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,458
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

751
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,835
Mm-hmm.

752
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,340
I understand.

753
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,638
Thanks.

754
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:21,415
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

755
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,519
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

756
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,519
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

757
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:37,764
They said their man told you to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

758
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,794
Are you saying it's his fault?

759
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,542
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering any of this.

760
00:55:55,251 --> 00:56:00,348
No. This store is all we have.

761
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,565
I really am sorry.

762
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,293
What time
you must go to work?

763
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,662
Not until tonight.

764
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,904
Go home and sleep.

765
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,736
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

766
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,059
Hey.

767
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,271
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

768
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,569
Yeah, they told me.

769
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,474
I just wanted to say, good luck

770
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,410
and it was good ridin' with you.

771
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,175
You too.

772
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,451
Wait till you've been
on the job a few more years.

773
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,753
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

774
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:47,489
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

775
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:51,499
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

776
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,398
You have no idea.

777
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,933
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

778
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:02,875
Ready, amigo.

779
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,715
