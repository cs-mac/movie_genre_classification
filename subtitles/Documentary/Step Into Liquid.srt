00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,899
I'm Dana Brown, and I'm a surfer.
(Subtitle Revised by HchC)

2
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,652
This film isn't about a lifestyle,
it's about life...

3
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,736
where style's just an option.

4
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,155
Once you get the sand
in between your toes...

5
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,157
you can never leave the beach.

6
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,159
And once the surfing bug bit you--

7
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:10,578
You get bitten by that,
you can never leave.

8
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,415
Surfing is a 2,000-year-old pastime...

9
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,167
that's become
a multibillion-dollar industry.

10
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,628
Still, it's all about the wave.

11
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:23,381
Waves are this kind of
unifying force in the universe.

12
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:25,090
There's light waves,
sound waves...

13
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:29,636
and ocean waves are the only form
in which they're at a human scale.

14
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:32,972
They move at a speed
about as fast as we run.

15
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:35,348
They're in this beautiful medium,
the ocean.

16
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:38,602
All it takes is, you know,
just one wave--not even that.

17
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:40,603
One turn.

18
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,315
You know, just a moment
that keeps pulling you back...

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,650
to have another moment.

20
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,235
And it never ends.

21
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,113
It's a tribe of people
around the world...

22
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,115
that feed off of that energy.

23
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,742
It's not a part of this world.
You're stepping into liquid.

24
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:02,121
You're stepping off of concrete ground
and into an element...

25
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,874
that is always changing
and moving and surrounding you.

26
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,043
And it feels good.

27
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:20,020
Without question,
the best surfers in the world...

28
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:22,022
are dolphins.

29
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:25,525
Their zany neighbors, the seals,
place a strong second...

30
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,194
followed by
the perpetually mellow pelicans.

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,195
Humans, in comparison, suck...

32
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,864
because we need boards,
wax, wet suits...

33
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,160
we panic easy, and we're always

34
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:40,537
Somehow that doesn't stop us
because hell or high water...

35
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,748
we're out there.

36
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:46,292
Many of us have nothing in common
except this shared passion.

37
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:49,587
But each of us began
exactly the same way--

38
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,588
with that first wave.

39
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:55,300
I think I first stood up in about 1 947.

40
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:58,261
I rode it all the way in, and I went,
Uh-oh, I'm hooked.

41
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,263
Ran in the house--
Mom, you won't believe what I did!

42
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,474
My mom kinda--
You know-- Big deal.

43
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:09,562
The Teeny-Weeny Wahine Contest.

44
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:14,190
Okay, girls, get your wave count,
and most importantly, have fun.

45
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:17,860
It's not like soccer,
with all the moms yelling on the sides.

46
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:21,238
They're young and absolutely fearless.

47
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:24,783
They could take three gallons of water
up the schnozzle and not even blink.

48
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:28,119
Welcome to the mini-extreme.

49
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:31,998
It's really, really fun.
That's what I like about it.

50
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,999
You get to hang with your friends.

51
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,293
And I like the ocean,
so you get to be in it a lot.

52
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,002
It's kinda like you're flying.

53
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:05,984
- I don't like big waves, though.
- Yeah.

54
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,445
- Why?
- Because they scare me.

55
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:11,613
Not too big.
Like, maybe six foot?

56
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,534
Waves seem big
when you're four feet tall.

57
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:18,870
It's still big when you're an adult,
because it's a better story.

58
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,622
And finally, when you're old and alone,
it's never big...

59
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,624
because it's gi-mungous. 

60
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,711
However, there are those
who don't need to exaggerate...

61
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:32,131
a rare few with the talent and mind-set
to ride waves that defy description.

62
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,760
Big wave riding is like
an inner desire that you have...

63
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:41,056
to challenge the sea or to be
in harmony with the sea...

64
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,682
in its most dynamic moment.

65
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:48,145
About ten years ago,
Laird decided to escape the crowds.

66
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,563
So, with a few friends,
he set out to conquer a wave...

67
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,482
too big, too fast
and too dangerous to ride...

68
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:57,194
a wave that required
a new approach to surfing.

69
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,945
At a certain size...

70
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:02,323
it's almost impossible, or actually
impossible, to paddle into waves.

71
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,494
So they used the tow rope to kind of
pull themselves into these giant waves.

72
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:09,496
Can't catch a freight train
on a bicycle.

73
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:11,664
You have to match power with power.

74
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,875
Voila. Tow surfing is born.

75
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:48,445
If you measure Laird
by any standard today...

76
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:51,031
he's the greatest living surfer
in the world today.

77
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,159
No one can touch him
as far as performance...

78
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:57,703
innovation, imagination,
pure athleticism...

79
00:06:57,828 --> 00:07:01,205
and just absolutely
unquestionable courage.

80
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:07,503
When Laird drives, Dave Kalama surfs.

81
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:09,880
Dave's a former windsurfing champion...

82
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:12,507
but not nearly as well-known as Laird
in the surfing world...

83
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,343
which has caused some to portray him
as Laird's sidekick--

84
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:19,180
a lot like figuring Godzilla
is King Kong's second banana.

85
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,181
Dave Kalama and Laird--

86
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:25,059
anything that goes on in the ocean,
those two guys figured out...

87
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:28,229
before anyone was even interested
in most of this stuff.

88
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:31,731
And by the time everybody
starts to notice...

89
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:33,816
they're already really good at it.

90
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:41,823
While surfing gets the glory, the real
hero is whoever is driving the ski.

91
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:46,744
The ski tows the surfer into the wave,
shadows him during the entire ride...

92
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:48,746
always prepared in case of a wipeout.

93
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:52,749
Because with the jagged lava shoreline
only a couple hundred yards away...

94
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,835
surfing Pea'hi without the ski
would be near suicide.

95
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:02,049
One of the scariest things about Pea'hi
isn't actually riding it.

96
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,384
It's watching my friends ride it.

97
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,427
You're on the shoulder,
driving the ski...

98
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:11,098
going,
Come on! Faster! Come on!

99
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,266
You're worried for them
because if they eat it...

100
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,644
not only are they gonna
go through a heavy experience...

101
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,815
but now I gotta go in front of the next
wave and try and get 'em out of it.

102
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,953
If you've ever seen a dog
grab a rag doll...

103
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:40,873
and shake it in its teeth, where the
limbs are going every which way--

104
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,792
You feel like any more pressure...

105
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:48,003
and your arm could just
get ripped right off your body.

106
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,721
The engine faltered for just
an instant, but that's all it takes.

107
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:03,642
We're on it, because we don't want,
obviously, anybody to be harmed.

108
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:08,188
Yesterday we lost a ski in the process
of trying to rescue somebody.

109
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,065
We figure you can buy more skis,
but you can't buy people, so--

110
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:19,530
I came out of the barrel.
I hit what they call a phantom chop.

111
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,324
My knees and everything
kinda just buckled.

112
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:30,289
That's when I said, just relax...

113
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:33,292
take it on the head,
try to get pushed in...

114
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:36,295
get a little bit farther in,
wait for the rescue.

115
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:39,213
At that point I basically
experienced the joy...

116
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,675
of watching Laird and a couple
of my other friends...

117
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,386
catch, probably, some of
the better waves that I've ever seen.

118
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:57,029
What began simply as a way
to escape the crowds...

119
00:10:57,155 --> 00:11:00,324
has redefined the limits
of big wave surfing.

120
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:02,325
But for Laird and David...

121
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:05,494
tow-in surfing is only a part
of a much bigger picture.

122
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,579
Two foot to 20 foot...

123
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:09,998
the fun's the same for me.

124
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,417
All I'm looking for is a smile.

125
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,377
And just riding a wave
is what does it for me.

126
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:16,963
It's not necessarily the size.

127
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,798
The analogy is music.

128
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,718
You can have a jazz musician...

129
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,886
and a rock musician...

130
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,888
and a classical guitarist...

131
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:31,433
can all appreciate what that other guy
hears, but that's not his trip.

132
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:32,976
And surfing's the same way.

133
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:36,562
Because of the advanced culture
that the Hawaiians had...

134
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,940
they got really serious about
developing recreational time...

135
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,817
greater than almost any culture.

136
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:44,736
So surfing was born
out of pure recreation...

137
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,779
which means it's just purely for fun.

138
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,282
There's no standard that gets set,
like in other sports...

139
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,909
that you have to meet
or else fall behind.

140
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:56,079
I interviewed Timothy Leary,
and his thesis was...

141
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:59,623
that the highest destiny
of man on Earth...

142
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:03,627
was to live an aesthetic life
based on the dance...

143
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,629
and that surfers
had discovered this.

144
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:08,631
Out there as that was...

145
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:11,759
that helped me realize
what it was about surfing...

146
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:15,136
that was so worthwhile
that it made me feel good...

147
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,139
about a day that included a go-out.

148
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:21,600
The lifestyle of surfing
is unlike any other sport.

149
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:24,644
How many people do you know
that go and gaze at a tennis court?

150
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,814
Think about it. Ooh, I love
the surface of that tennis court.

151
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,399
They don't do that.

152
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,318
Think of any other sport
where they go and they look...

153
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:35,862
and people just sit and watch waves.

154
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,490
It doesn't matter if it's perfect waves
like we have in Hawaii...

155
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:40,408
or the Great Lakes.

156
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:47,288
Deep in America's heartland,
a thousand miles from any ocean...

157
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:49,957
is the surf city of Lake Michigan...

158
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,042
Sheboygan, Wisconsin...

159
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:54,419
a hotbed for freshwater surfers.

160
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:57,422
We're in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

161
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:01,384
We're kinda like in the center
of Lake Michigan, midway--

162
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,635
We're 50 miles north of Milwaukee...

163
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:06,638
and we're 50 miles south...

164
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:09,599
of the frozen tundra
of Lambeau Field in Green Bay.

165
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:12,101
There's a huge amount of water here.

166
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:14,520
What generates waves is this fetch...

167
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,729
or wind to travel distance over water.

168
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:19,732
We got lots of fetch here.
We get lots of waves.

169
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:22,985
You got a short window for waves,
usually six to eight hours sometimes...

170
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,238
and you gotta know where to go
and be there at the right time.

171
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:28,865
We need low-pressure systems
that move...

172
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,867
and if they're moving in fast
they create wind.

173
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:36,663
If we've got warm water and
20-mile-an-hour winds, we've got waves.

174
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,665
Waves are where you find 'em.

175
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,583
There's arguments
about where's best--

176
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,003
This doesn't match up with California.
Well--

177
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:14,862
I wouldn't put me in a national contest
or anything like that...

178
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:18,407
but I have as much fun as anybody else
and I like it as much.

179
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,453
Describing the surf scene in Sheboygan
comes down to two words.

180
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,539
The stoke is a global thing.

181
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:31,793
I don't think you can
measure the stoke...

182
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,211
in regions of bodies of water.

183
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:47,556
Good old Doc Beaton.

184
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,934
He's been styling in this lake
since 1 966.

185
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:53,937
He's the most stoked person
I've ever met.

186
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,777
We've got a tight-knit group of guys,
maybe a dozen guys.

187
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,779
We've all grown up together...

188
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,198
and as kids hung out at the beach.

189
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,201
Some of the guys went off to college,
some went off to Vietnam.

190
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,205
But guys came back
and married and raised families...

191
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,415
and we surfed through all of this.

192
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:20,875
We hit the water,
we hoot and holler for each other.

193
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,795
We surf for five hours, somebody'll
crack open a 1 2-pack of beer...

194
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,839
and we'll just lie about
the good rides we had.

195
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,843
Surfers are honest people,
except about surfing...

196
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:34,304
which is why every surf town
has a secret spot...

197
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,805
that has the best waves on the planet.

198
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,266
It's legendary
here on the Great Lakes...

199
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,770
and on a good south day it breaks like
Banzai Pipeline, north shore of Oahu.

200
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:46,606
We get barrels so big
it'll hide a Volkswagen.

201
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,780
Pipeline would not only
hide a Volkswagen...

202
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:58,824
it would probably stick it
right next to Jimmy Hoffa.

203
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,286
One of the most violent waves
on the planet.

204
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:06,664
But when it's on, it produces
one tremendous tube after another.

205
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,548
No one has ever
ridden this place better...

206
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,633
with more grace or guts...

207
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,677
than Mr. Pipeline, Gerry Lopez.

208
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:25,930
The waves out here, there's none
like 'em anywhere in the world.

209
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:30,017
I mean, talk about a challenge.
For a lifetime.

210
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,437
There's no place like Pipeline
where you can drive up...

211
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,523
park your car, walk down the beach,
sit there 50 yards away...

212
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,025
watch the best surfers in the world
get in the tube.

213
00:16:40,151 --> 00:16:43,653
The uniqueness of the wave
and the accessibility of the wave--

214
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,824
And it's been the consensual wave
by which all other waves are judged.

215
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,867
When it's on and the surfer's on,
there's no better show on Earth.

216
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,119
It's big, it's powerful, it's exciting...

217
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:56,581
it's really dangerous,
and you can feel that from the beach.

218
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:59,375
You can literally feel the waves
on the beach.

219
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,544
There's waves out here that...

220
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,379
are not meant to be ridden.

221
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:07,007
They're just gonna roll through and...

222
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:10,092
roll up everything
that's in their way.

223
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,178
At Pipe, it's not if, it's when.

224
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:16,347
If you're a Pipe surfer,
you're gonna get hurt-- it's a fact.

225
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:20,976
And you just pray that you
get injuries than can be fixed.

226
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:23,112
You're thinking, I'm gonna die.

227
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:27,116
Most times you don't.
I mean, guys have died here.

228
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:31,077
But it's so scary
at that moment that...

229
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,621
I don't know,
maybe you die a little.

230
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,596
Why take the risk?

231
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,640
Maybe it's for those moments
when the impossible is conquered...

232
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,226
and there's that satisfied joy
that connects the present...

233
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,770
with someone long forgotten...

234
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,771
a familiar face.

235
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:05,773
Meet your inner child.

236
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:09,485
He's a great kid, but not exactly
the guy your boss hired.

237
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,238
I think there is a legitimate criticism
to be made of surfers...

238
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:16,990
that when they're in the water
they're not being productive.

239
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:21,452
Surfers often can't escape
the stereotype of being a beach bum.

240
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,955
Their entire lives
they have to explain themselves.

241
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,459
When you talk about surfing,
the more you say, the worse off you are.

242
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,627
It's something that is very personal...

243
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,796
and it ends up sounding a little silly.

244
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,465
There's one particular surfer
who's turned silly...

245
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,301
into something downright heroic.

246
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:42,804
I was working at
this refried chicken place...

247
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:46,432
and my job was to strain the oil.

248
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:50,769
I was so confused as to which way to
turn the knobs and not to make a mess.

249
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:54,481
I would've happily left
after five minutes.

250
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:56,523
To have lasted eight hours there...

251
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:59,068
was the longest eight hours
I've ever experienced.

252
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:04,072
Dale Webster does not like
wasting time.

253
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:06,073
With mind-boggling dedication...

254
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:10,077
he has committed to a goal so simple
it would seem impossible.

255
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:14,705
Today was 9, 1 82 consecutive days...

256
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:16,874
a little over 25 years.

257
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm trying to surf...

258
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:22,212
to the year 2004...

259
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:27,467
and by then I'll be
up to 1 0,407 consecutive days.

260
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,678
If I can reach that goal, you can tell
that dreams can come true.

261
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:35,432
Every day,
rain or shine or tonsillitis...

262
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:38,517
Dale's out there,
mano a mano with the calendar.

263
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:41,686
In February 1 976...

264
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:43,730
there were five Sundays in a row...

265
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:47,233
and I saw that that won't happen again
until the year 2004.

266
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,654
So there was the challenge--
to surf every day...

267
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:55,782
until February has
that extra Sunday again.

268
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:59,702
He's kept everything on his pursuit.

269
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:03,789
It started out as a streak,
it went into a quest...

270
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,456
and now it's some sort of a mission.

271
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,376
I don't really know
what the mission is...

272
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,378
but the only worthwhile thing in life...

273
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:13,296
is to ride it to the end...

274
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:15,757
try to find out
the meaning of it all.

275
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:19,886
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Your family should come first.

276
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:21,970
Fortunately, my family knows...

277
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,139
that this is the best thing for me...

278
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:26,391
to keep doing this as long as I can.

279
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:29,394
Margo Webster has never
missed a single day of school...

280
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:31,395
in her entire life.

281
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,147
She has a unique understanding
of her father's quest.

282
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:37,525
It's just so much a part of his life...

283
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:40,403
that it's what keeps him going.

284
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:02,421
I try to catch
at least three waves a day.

285
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:06,216
Some days the waves are so big
and blowing out and tricky...

286
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,219
that getting three waves
takes almost three hours.

287
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:21,104
When Dale turns and bows
to the wave, he's giving thanks.

288
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:23,647
It's an ancient Hawaiian tradition.

289
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:27,150
What I was trying to do was
not surfing against anyone else...

290
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:29,611
but surfing against myself.

291
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:33,114
Because surfing is the ultimate
spontaneous involvement...

292
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,157
in a natural medium.

293
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,953
I am very proud of what he does.

294
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:43,289
I truly don't think he'll be
able to stop surfing every day...

295
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:46,292
because after he's gotten that far
I'm pretty sure he'll just feel...

296
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:50,962
Okay, well, I can surf for 30 years
in a row, or I can surf longer.

297
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:04,890
I come out of the water in a much
better mood than I do when I get in...

298
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,893
and if that somehow
translates into my life...

299
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:11,187
and I end up being a happier,
nicer person as a result...

300
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:14,774
then I guess you could argue
that surfing is good for society.

301
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:22,238
A society is made up of individuals.

302
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:23,906
So is surfing.

303
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:26,367
Many surfers search
for that perfect wave...

304
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:29,245
and to each one
it means something different.

305
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,706
The waves are kind of
the central pursuit...

306
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:35,165


307
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,837
they're just this kind of small cherry
on top of this much bigger cake.

308
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,922
They come from Ojai, California...

309
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,007
a cross between the James Gang
and the Marx Brothers.

310
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,510
They're the Malloys.
Chris is the eldest and the trailblazer.

311
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,012
In the middle is Keith, the quiet one.

312
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,556
Finally,
the youngest and biggest, Danny.

313
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,268
They're unique individuals who share
deep respect for their Irish ancestry.

314
00:23:57,393 --> 00:24:01,354
We did come from a certain place,
and only a hundred years ago...

315
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,397
my grandmother was on a boat.

316
00:24:03,523 --> 00:24:08,235
If she didn't sail,
we'd probably be in a field right now...

317
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:10,737
herding sheep or something like that.

318
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:13,073
So I think every single time...

319
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:16,075
we're suiting up and we're freezing
and looking around...

320
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,829
you can get a taste of what our
ancestors went through on a daily basis.

321
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:22,915
They're good boys, you know.

322
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,916
The Malloys are really--
They're good people.

323
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,584
There's honestly not a bad bone
in their body.

324
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,629
We go, Yeah, we're Irish,
and they just start laughing, you know.

325
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:35,966
It doesn't matter if you're 1 00% Irish.
If you're from America, you're American.

326
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:39,970
you know, to drink a Guinness...

327
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:44,558
to put on warm clothes and beanies...

328
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:47,143
and full suits and booties
and sit it out.

329
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,644
I mean, personally, I--

330
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:52,648
It's awesome to be
in this gnarly weather.

331
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:55,233
A rainstorm, to me, is fun, you know.

332
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:59,070
I had a lady come up...

333
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:03,072
and I'm pretty sure that she'd never
seen surfing before in her life.

334
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:06,451
She was amazed, and it was cool that
she appreciated it because she just--

335
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:10,788
She was with her family
and was so excited about it...

336
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:13,290
and was telling us she'd never
seen something like that...

337
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:15,125
and that we made it look easy.

338
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,335
To them, it's just this cold,
dark thing, and they're, like...

339
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:20,337
So you're goin' in today, are ya?

340
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:23,799
They kinda just wanna see it. They don't
really believe you're gonna do it.

341
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,925
They see you in
this weird rubber suit--

342
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:28,052
They can't believe
you're going out for fun.

343
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:29,637
Yeah, exactly.

344
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,099
I'm the first one
in my family to surf...

345
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:36,101
which kinda pisses off my dad...

346
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:38,478
'cause he used to be
always swimming.

347
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:42,815
So he's pissed off that surfing
wasn't in Ireland 40 years ago.

348
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,067
When you say,
I was in Ireland surfing'...

349
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,902
they smirk and they go, Oh, really?
You catch a couple of waves over there.

350
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:50,780
They don't realize
that the waves are perfect.

351
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:54,658
It doesn't happen that often,
and you really gotta wait for it...

352
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,493
but when it happens it happens.

353
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,416
These fast, hollow waves break
over a shallow rock bottom.

354
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:57,711
This spot's called Pampa, fittingly
named after a local insurance company.

355
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:16,227
The nastiest wave they found
was a place called Mullaghmore.

356
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,771
It turned out to be perfect to introduce
tow-in surfing to Donegal County.

357
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,233
These people had never seen
anything quite like this.

358
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,623
Ireland gets surf as good
as Indonesia, Tahiti or Australia...

359
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,208
just not as often.

360
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:46,752
Which works out well,
because it takes three days...

361
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:49,380
to regain feeling in your feet.

362
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:52,340
Keith got out of the water.
We'd surfed for two and a half hours.

363
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:55,009
He goes, I'm not very cold. 

364
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:59,054
He couldn't even move his lips.
His lips were completely numb.

365
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:04,726
Doesn't matter who you are-- come to
Ireland, you open up to people and talk.

366
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,727
They're stoked,
they just wanna make conversation.

367
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,938
The crack here is the good time.
Having a good time is the crack.

368
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,614
One of the few rare things in the world,
surfing can bring people together.

369
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:24,200
No matter what race, creed or color,
we're all under the one sky.

370
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:27,578
United we stand. We share the weather.
That's our band together.

371
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:29,580
We are the surfing tribe.

372
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:34,834
We're close to the border with Northern
Ireland, which is a different country.

373
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,505
In Northern Ireland there's quite
a divide between the two communities.

374
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,506
You've got Protestants and Catholics.

375
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:44,467
So what my brother does,
he brings Protestant children...

376
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:47,470
from a school in Northern Ireland
down to Bundoran.

377
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:50,306
The school here is obviously
predominantly Catholic children.

378
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:53,349
So you use a medium like surfing...

379
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:55,935
to bring them together
and let them bond.

380
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,937
Even though it's 1 5 miles north...

381
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,439
most of them have never
even been to this part of Ireland.

382
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:02,983
Together, once they
all got in the water...

383
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:06,111
there was absolutely
no separation between them.

384
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:11,156
They were just all laughing, screaming
and playing and cheering for each other.

385
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,285
It was like-- I don't know
if it hit us harder or them...

386
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:17,537
what was actually going on,
but it was beautiful.

387
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:22,499
He caught a wave,
turned around and goes...

388
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,043
That's the best thing
I've done all year. 

389
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:27,295
He was just pumped up,
so excited...

390
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,963
his hair was wet, there was snot
comin' out of his nose...

391
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:32,716
and he's beside a Catholic kid,
kid from town here.

392
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:35,636
It was a good buzz to see 'em.

393
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,804
One of the kids got on the beach
and looked at me.

394
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:40,347
He was really quiet,
but he got a good ride...

395
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:41,973
and he looked at me and said...

396
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:45,143
So, how much do these
surfin' boards cost, anyway?

397
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:47,395
And I could tell he was hooked.

398
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:50,898
I guarantee next year, when we
come back, he'll have his own board.

399
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,320
I didn't really know what
it was gonna be like today...

400
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:59,947
but whenever I came along
and I seen the big waves...

401
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,407
I just wanted
to get out there and surf.

402
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:06,911
I got up once on one of 'em.
That was wicked!

403
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:10,623
And I never surfed before.

404
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:13,334
And I'd like to try it again, so--

405
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:15,377
It looks like--

406
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:18,922
It looks hard on the TV,
but it's easy enough.

407
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:23,175
You can take yourself and just
go out there and do your best.

408
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:27,845
Recommend it to anybody
who wants to come surfin'.

409
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:37,062
Later, we were talking
to some local guys...

410
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:39,563
who were,
That was actually really heavy. 

411
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:42,608
A lot of these kids have never
been down to this part of Ireland.

412
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:45,569
They were Protestants
surfing with the Catholic kids.

413
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:49,072
The local guys watching it all,
it was a pretty big deal.

414
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,283
It was fun to be a part of.

415
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:54,160
For us it was easy,
and we had a blast.

416
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:06,545
In Hollywood, a happy ending for a surf
movie has the hero leaving the beach...

417
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:09,840
because he's wised up to
the importance of hard shoes.

418
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:13,175
Sometimes the crazed fool
decides to go for one last kick...

419
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,385
and drowns like a rat.

420
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:19,430
Somehow this subtle message of "Get out
of the water and put on your shoes'...

421
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:22,559
has been totally lost on real surfers.

422
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:25,227
Their names are legendary in surfing...

423
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:28,689
with a combined wave-riding experience
of over 1 50 years...

424
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,773
because real surfers never quit.

425
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:39,781
Every year they come to Costa Rica...

426
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:41,783
to stay at the vacation home
of Robert August.

427
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:45,494
Robert's a true believer in,
what goes around, comes around. 

428
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,038
In Hawaii,
they have the aloha spirit.

429
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:51,291
In Costa Rica, they have
the pura vida spirit--pure life.

430
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:55,502
We're only on this planet a little while.
Don't mess with it.

431
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:59,506
Enjoy it, spread a little cheer,
and then you're gone.

432
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:03,301
Robert was 1 8 when he rode
the perfect wave in The Endless Summer.

433
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:06,304
Amazingly, he seems
to have never stopped.

434
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:09,306
Those are the guys
that make surfing what it is.

435
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:12,809
Robert comes from a surfing family.
His father was a great surfer.

436
00:32:12,935 --> 00:32:17,313
He has a great heritage, and passed that
heritage and that stoke on to his son.

437
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:21,025
And then Robert's
passed it on to his son.

438
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,611
The family tradition
of what it represents carries on.

439
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:27,613
If you have surfed
for any period of time...

440
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:30,032
it can't go out of your mind.

441
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,034
And there's still that same
excitement when you paddle out...

442
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,037
'cause every wave you catch
is gonna be different...

443
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,039
and you might be in the spot
for the best wave of the day...

444
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,041
whether you're really smart or not.

445
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,628
You could just be sitting there
and look up and go, My God.!

446
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:47,296
It's coming to me! It's my wave!

447
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:49,840
What they lose up top
is gained in the middle...

448
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,967
but the talent remains.

449
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:55,262
The perfect example--
former U.S. champion Mark Martinson.

450
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:58,305
The first wave Mark caught,
it pulls into the tube...

451
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:02,225
and travels about 1 5 feet
right in front of me.

452
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:05,478
I'm thinking, Hey, man,
that guy's 55 years old or somethin'.

453
00:33:05,562 --> 00:33:07,480
I can't do that.

454
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:10,316
It's always surprising when
an apparent suicide attempt...

455
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,817
turns into a great wave.

456
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,820
That's experience.

457
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:17,029
The whole environment
is so alluring...

458
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:20,532
and it's one of, often,
great peace and happiness...

459
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,325
and, you know, giggles...

460
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,746
and the wonderful memory
that you come away with.

461
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,624
To me, that's the perfect wave.

462
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,876
Paul Strauch's style
set a standard for a generation.

463
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:35,420
Gerry Lopez still calls him his idol.

464
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,881
They're living out
their childhood dreams--

465
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:40,174
surfing and having fun.

466
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:43,844
Even though it was 40 years ago...

467
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:47,221
you can still paddle out together
and go surfing.

468
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:51,350
You can't go play football with
each other when you're our age.

469
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:53,977
You'd all be
in the hospital the next day...

470
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:55,687
in casts and stuff.

471
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:59,232
They won't break any bones,
but they will take a few shots.

472
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:01,567
Surfing is a selfish sport.

473
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:04,528
It's about you getting a really good wave.
Screw the other guy.

474
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:08,073
The same thing-- Hang out with old guys,
you're gonna look good.

475
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,288
Robert Weaver. Wingnut.

476
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:19,582
The nickname says it all.

477
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,459
His nonstop repartee...

478
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:25,128
masks a deep-seated admiration
for Robert, Paul and Mark.

479
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:28,381
They were his idols as a kid
and the reason he's a surfer.

480
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:32,260
It's their inspiration that has allowed
Wingnut to fulfill another need--

481
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:35,137
to constantly be
the center of attention.

482
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:40,850
They casually charge from
one adventure to another...

483
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:43,561
with a Zen-like confidence
that no matter what happens...

484
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:45,270
they're gonna enjoy themselves.

485
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:47,647
It's not the result of when
you get there.

486
00:34:47,773 --> 00:34:50,275
It's anything that can happen
along the way.

487
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:01,076
They take nothing for granted...

488
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:03,160
and they never forget
how lucky they are.

489
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:07,456
For them,
these are the good old days.

490
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,215
The first 20 years is just to figure out
if you're really interested or not.

491
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:20,842
And then the journey
doesn't really begin...

492
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,510
until the second 20.

493
00:35:24,304 --> 00:35:27,348
For those who started surfing
in the '50s, surfing has changed.

494
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:30,642
A rebellious subculture
has become mainstream.

495
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:34,353
When I started to surf,
there was maybe a thousand surfers...

496
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:38,941
and you kinda semi-almost knew
all the guys that surfed.

497
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,984
And then, in 1 959...

498
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:44,153
that whole thing happened
where the movie Gidget came out...

499
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:46,781
and the whole thing got commoditized.

500
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:49,949
It went from maybe 2,000 people...

501
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:52,827
to four million people
in three or four years.

502
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:56,664
It was like a Hula Hoop
that never went away.

503
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:58,665
And neither has Gidget.

504
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:02,669
Kathy Kohner was given that nickname
back in the '50s when she surfed Malibu.

505
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:06,505
She was just a teenager, and one of
the very few women surfing at the time.

506
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,508
Her father was inspired to write a novel
about her adventures...

507
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:11,509
and Hollywood soon followed.

508
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:14,679
Pop culture has been mixed up
with surfing ever since.

509
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,680
Gidget still lives near Malibu...

510
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:20,684
and over the last ten years has seen
an explosion in women's surfing.

511
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:23,311
It's no longer an insult
to surf like a girl.

512
00:36:23,437 --> 00:36:25,855
I always surfed like a girl.
That was just me.

513
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:29,692
I don't know if it's my personality,
my influences.

514
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:33,820
Each person can kinda bring
their own special flair to it.

515
00:36:33,904 --> 00:36:36,322
These girls are really good.

516
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:40,659
This ride alone represents
my entire lifetime of hanging five.

517
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:44,162
This kind of talent can wreak havoc
on the old male ego.

518
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:47,999
Sometimes the guys
get kinda agro'...

519
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:52,502
but those are the kind of people that
are just mad at the world anyway...

520
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,088
and they're gonna find a problem
with whoever's out there...

521
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,716
especially when a bunch of girls show up
and they probably surf better than them.

522
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:09,850
I love being with my friends
and being with family.

523
00:37:10,935 --> 00:37:12,644
Fortunately, for me...

524
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:16,731
most of my friends and family do surf,
and those are the best times I've spent.

525
00:37:21,277 --> 00:37:24,362
You're done. Once you're a surfer,
you're done, you're in.

526
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:28,365
You know? It's like the mob
or somethin'. You're not gettin' out.

527
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,369
Humor, more than anything,
defines a surfer.

528
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:34,371
Talent's fine,
but funny's a lot better.

529
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:37,874
Those that are too serious are treated
like Hare Krishnas at the airport.

530
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,918
Because after all,
why surf if you're not having fun?

531
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:45,922
And by keeping it light,
the heavy can be handled.

532
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:48,216
Everyone is on the same page.

533
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:52,469
We all enjoy the pure fact
of riding waves...

534
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,471
and being in the ocean.

535
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:57,849
No matter how you're doing it,
if it's on your stomach--

536
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:01,435
You know, it's just
the pure love of the ocean.

537
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:04,730
If I'm lyin' down, I'm gonna be surfin.
Standing up? Surfin.

538
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:08,107
Halfway standin' up,
kneelin' down, I don't care.

539
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:11,360
As long as I get in the water and surf,
it's gonna go down.

540
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:15,989
It's about showing other people how you
can collaborate with somebody else...

541
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:18,992
even though they're in a position

542
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:22,244
He's still willing to, like,
hey, you know-- You like to surf.

543
00:38:22,328 --> 00:38:25,247
Just the way if he was walkin'--
Let's continue to do this. 

544
00:38:25,331 --> 00:38:28,250
He's a Pisces. He's a fish.
He's supposed to be in the water.

545
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,752
That just tells everybody else,

546
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:35,172
He might be paralyzed,
but, hey, that gives me inspiration.

547
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:36,839
Let's go out there and do it. 

548
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,759
I was always into basketball
and all these sports...

549
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:43,054
but surfing now, the way I look at it,
it's a whole different way.

550
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:44,638
It's more spiritual.

551
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,766
I have a lot of burning sensation,
pain in my body...

552
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:51,269
but once I hit the water
I have no pain whatsoever.

553
00:38:51,353 --> 00:38:54,689
If I'm tight, my limbs are,
like, you know, tight...

554
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:58,358
as soon as I hit the water
everything's loose.

555
00:38:58,484 --> 00:39:00,360
I got a smile from ear to ear...

556
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:05,113
and it's like nothing--
nothing could compare to that.

557
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:10,951
To be such a top prospect
as an amateur...

558
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:13,955
to be just destined to become
a professional surfer...

559
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:18,124
and to have such a tragic accident
happen to him--

560
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,668
I broke my neck surfing
about five years ago.

561
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:22,670
Just pulled into a barrel.

562
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:25,131
When I was comin' out
the wave hit me in my back.

563
00:39:25,214 --> 00:39:29,133
I went head first and didn't have time
to put my arms in front of me.

564
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:33,179
I just hit the bottom and my whole body
went numb and tingly.

565
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:40,560
It's so hard for me to think
that there's just, like, that nerve--

566
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:45,147
It's broken-- It's one little nerve
that's broken right there...

567
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:47,691
and that's the whole thing
that connects--

568
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:51,528
I don't think I'd do so well.
You know?

569
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:55,406
Jesse called me up because he
was having a golf tournament...

570
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:58,658
to raise money for his foundation...

571
00:39:58,742 --> 00:40:03,537
and he also wanted to talk to me
about getting back in the water.

572
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:05,664
Rob's past the famous surf star.

573
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:08,500
He's, like, as a human being
no one really knows about--

574
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:11,711
He's just so special,
he's got the biggest heart.

575
00:40:11,837 --> 00:40:14,005
You know, I mean, I was honored.

576
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:17,508
And at the same time,
really kinda scared.

577
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:19,843
I was like, We're going.

578
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:22,846
I'm not nervous.
As long as I got you guys, we're fine. 

579
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:27,516
But they were all scared.
There's no need. No need.

580
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,892
It was crazy.

581
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:33,021
The first day we took him surfing
was just a complete unknown.

582
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,189
We did it.

583
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:47,908
This was just the beginning.

584
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,869
Soon, Jesse and Rob surfed
at every opportunity...

585
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:54,247
brother Josh, his nurse Sonny...

586
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:56,874
and support from old friends
like the Malloy brothers...

587
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,919
Jesse is back and he's charging.

588
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,547
For him, nothing's changed.

589
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,549
He wants to take off deep...

590
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:10,803
he wants to stay out
as long as he can.

591
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:14,264
I asked him, Would you rather
have it be big and stormy...

592
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,682
or like this-- nice and glassy?

593
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,684
And he's all, Bigger.

594
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,938
And regarding surfing with Rob...

595
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:26,941
since he's a goofy-foot,
he's been really biased...

596
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:29,568
about me taking off on rights.

597
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:33,738
You're not gonna convert me
to a goofy-footer just because you are.

598
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,781
- He's a goofy-foot too.
- Hey, don't knock goofy-foots, man.

599
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,575
So am I.

600
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:41,370
- He's surrounded.
- I'm the only regular-foot!

601
00:41:41,454 --> 00:41:44,081
Cooties. Goofy cooties.

602
00:41:44,164 --> 00:41:46,082
Thank you that I have Jesse...

603
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,085
and that I have what I have,
and everything I have--

604
00:41:49,169 --> 00:41:51,087
my friends, my family.

605
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,629
You know?

606
00:42:03,848 --> 00:42:07,476
Every time he surfs,
he calls us up and he's like...

607
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:10,603
Hey, Rob took me surfing, man.
That guy rules!

608
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,813
If there's anybody
who knows about ruling...

609
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:15,941
it's Kelly Slater,
the Michael Jordan of surfing.

610
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,694
While millions worldwide
think of him as a champion, a hero...

611
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:23,321
in his home country of the US
he represents one thing--

612
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:24,906
a surfer.

613
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:28,868
Surfing in the United States
is really unfairly stereotyped.

614
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:32,622
Fast Times at Ridgemont High
and the whole concept of Hey, dude...

615
00:42:32,747 --> 00:42:35,332
it really portrayed surfing
in a bad way.

616
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:38,334
I mean you can turn on
Sports center on ESPN--

617
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,338
I don't think I've ever seen
a surfer on ESPN, to be honest.

618
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:46,132
Yet you turn on Channel 9 News
in Australia...

619
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:50,928
the latest tournament in tennis or golf,
surfing's right there with it.

620
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:53,931
In Australia, surfing is like
the national pastime.

621
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:57,434
Everybody knows Kelly Slater,
and everybody knows the future.

622
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:05,357
I'm just hungry for results
and hungry for a world title...

623
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:08,151
and all the rest of it.

624
00:43:09,361 --> 00:43:12,697
Taj makes his living at the highest
level of surfing competition--

625
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:14,323
the World Cup Tour.

626
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:17,618
He's among an elite 44 who battle
nine months in eight countries...

627
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:19,327
for the world championship.

628
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:26,333
Taj qualified for the World Tour
when he was 1 5 years old.

629
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:28,335
He decided to
finish high school instead.

630
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,337
He became rookie of the year...

631
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,088
and the following season was runner-up
for the world championship.

632
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,090
Oh, I think Taj Burrow today...

633
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:37,759
is the epitome of modern surfing.

634
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:41,012
Taj Burrow, to me, is one
of the best surfers in the world.

635
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:45,516
He looks like the kind of guy that you'd
draw in your comic book-- Surfer Guy.

636
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,727
It's surprised me that Taj
hasn't won a world title yet.

637
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:50,728
He's such a talented surfer.

638
00:43:50,854 --> 00:43:54,023
He's the perfect example
of that future of pro surfing.

639
00:43:55,274 --> 00:43:58,443
Many think he has the potential
to be more than a future champion...

640
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:02,530
but the future of the sport,
the next step in surfing's evolution.

641
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:18,585
He's a national hero,
but definitely low maintenance.

642
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:22,047
His posse consists of
a dog named Reef.

643
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:29,178
Maybe this is normal
for an Aussie phenom...

644
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:31,179
named after
an American blues singer...

645
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:33,598
with a one-mutt posse
from Yallingup.

646
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,102
This is just perfect
because it's really quiet...

647
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:41,855
and the waves are really good
and it's not so crowded.

648
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:45,775
It's just a lot more
relaxing lifestyle...

649
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:50,237
than packing your bags and checking
into flights and checking into hotels.

650
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:52,280
I think it's the perfect balance.

651
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:57,868
Taj was born in Australia,
but his parents are both American.

652
00:44:57,952 --> 00:45:01,705
They came here in 1 970
looking for waves and never left.

653
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:06,167
I took him surfing when he was
one or two, on the nose of my board...

654
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:07,960
and rode a few waves
with him like that.

655
00:45:08,086 --> 00:45:09,545
That was really good.

656
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:11,839
But he didn't pick it up himself
until he was about seven.

657
00:45:11,964 --> 00:45:14,799
My dad tells everybody
he taught me to surf.

658
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:20,012
My parents both surf, so it was pretty
much inevitable I'd end up surfing.

659
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:23,473
It was kinda disappointing. I wanted
to teach him more about surfing.

660
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:27,643
He picked it up so quickly I didn't get
the pleasure of passing on my knowledge.

661
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:29,311
He was like, Whee!

662
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,114
Taj makes everything look easy.
Maybe too easy.

663
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,700
The best surfer doesn't always win.

664
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,952
The pro tour's just gotten better
and better, and they are addressing...

665
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,788
more of the creative approach
to surfing a wave...

666
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:53,207
which is great,
'cause Taj is quite creative.

667
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:56,960
Creativity is one of the most
magical things about surfing...

668
00:45:57,043 --> 00:45:59,336
and also one of
the most difficult to judge.

669
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,974
It's gonna take a long time
for us to really catch up to speed...

670
00:46:14,058 --> 00:46:15,976
with Taj's level.

671
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:18,602
Gonna take a while for the judges
to comprehend what he's doing...

672
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:23,232
because he is truly somebody that
doesn't compare to anybody else...

673
00:46:23,357 --> 00:46:25,817
as far as how many maneuvers
he packs in a wave...

674
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:29,112
how innovative he is
when he launches air.

675
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,619
Taj, by any measure,
is a great success.

676
00:46:37,703 --> 00:46:41,581
At 23 he's already been inducted
into Australia's Surfing Hall of Fame.

677
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:44,291
Still, without the world title
he's not satisfied.

678
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:46,710
The expectation of becoming
the next Kelly Slater...

679
00:46:46,794 --> 00:46:51,047
has turned that little monkey
on his back into a 500-pound gorilla.

680
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:54,508
You wanna compare Taj and Kelly,
there's only one huge difference--

681
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:56,843
Kelly's won six world titles...

682
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:58,761
and Taj has won none.

683
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:03,724
To compare great surfers
is like comparing artists.

684
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:07,436
Who's to say which one's
more aesthetically pleasing?

685
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:10,521
The cut-and-dry
has no place in liquid.

686
00:47:16,068 --> 00:47:17,944
Life is a matter of perception.

687
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,947
A 20-foot tube may be
the perfect wave to one person...

688
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,282
but to me it's a watery grave.

689
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:24,784
But perceptions change.

690
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:29,287
Mine did, in Tahiti, when it came to
the world of professional women surfers.

691
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:33,499
I thought they had a big chip
on their shoulders. I was dead wrong.

692
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,292
Even when

693
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:38,128
been traveling from ocean to ocean,
beach to beach for three months...

694
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:41,964
the first thing I wanna do when I
get home is go back to the beach.

695
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,133
That's the life of a pro surfer.

696
00:47:44,258 --> 00:47:48,011
It's a pleasure to go beyond
one dimension...

697
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:50,138
and being in a court and having lines...

698
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:53,975
and being able to come
into a rhythm with the ocean...

699
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,727
and not just
whoever you're surfing against.

700
00:47:56,852 --> 00:48:00,354
It's never been about who you're surfing
against, even though you wanna beat 'em.

701
00:48:01,773 --> 00:48:04,024
I'd say the best surfer in the world...

702
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:06,110
is the one having the most fun.

703
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:14,659
I notice a real difference
in the water...

704
00:48:14,784 --> 00:48:16,910
when I'm surfing with guys
as opposed to women...

705
00:48:17,036 --> 00:48:21,122
because the water is more filled with
estrogen as opposed to testosterone.

706
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:24,917
The girls love to have fun.
We can laugh at ourselves.

707
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:28,879
That was my biggest surprise.
These girls knew all about having fun.

708
00:48:32,674 --> 00:48:36,677
Remember that classic tomboy
that could beat you at all the sports...

709
00:48:36,803 --> 00:48:40,889
and then she grew up and was a beautiful
woman and could still beat you?

710
00:48:40,973 --> 00:48:43,892
Meet Layne Beachley,
five-time world champion.

711
00:48:48,729 --> 00:48:50,188
Then there's Rochelle Ballard.

712
00:48:50,314 --> 00:48:52,273
She stands five foot-one on land...

713
00:48:52,357 --> 00:48:56,151
but somehow seems to expand
to eight foot-six in the water.

714
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:01,740
The premier women's surfer
in big waves is Keala Kennelly.

715
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:07,286
She has the unbelievable knack of being
able to recite Caddy shack line by line.

716
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,538
Rochelle, Layne and Keala...

717
00:49:09,664 --> 00:49:12,291
are overqualified to be considered
one of the boys'...

718
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:14,292
so in the interest of fair play...

719
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:16,961
I decided I'd become
one of the girls.

720
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:20,005
It took me a while
to explain myself to the crew.

721
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,634
Surfing, for the last hundred years,
has been completely wrong.

722
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,803
Women were looked down on
if they wanted to surf.

723
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:29,013
Women weren't
welcomed into the club...

724
00:49:29,138 --> 00:49:32,140
where, in the original essence
of surfing, they were part of the club.

725
00:49:32,224 --> 00:49:34,475
So you gotta hand it to those women...

726
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,437
who have persevered in the pro scene...

727
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:42,566
especially women like Keala
and Rochelle and Layne...

728
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,567
who have actually made inroads
into the big wave scene...

729
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,528
which is a testosterone pit
if there ever was one.

730
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:50,239
The sacrifices they made,
it's paying off...

731
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:52,824
for the generation
coming up behind them.

732
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,086
Shallow and razor-sharp...

733
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,714
this coral reef creates one of the most
powerful waves on the planet...

734
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,718
legendary for its reward
and its punishment.

735
00:50:14,843 --> 00:50:17,011
Layne Beachley
almost drowned here.

736
00:50:17,095 --> 00:50:19,054
Keala Kennelly too.

737
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:22,058
But they've come back
to Teahupo'o...

738
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:25,101
which in Tahitian means
the end of the road. 

739
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:28,229
Even if you're scared...

740
00:50:28,313 --> 00:50:30,773
it just looks so nice
that you just wanna go.

741
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:35,986
Even professional surfers, they come
here, I can see fear on their face...

742
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:38,988
which is understandable
because it's some really heavy waves.

743
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:42,408
It's the only wave that has teeth.

744
00:51:21,107 --> 00:51:23,775
The ultimate ride for a surfer
is to get deep inside...

745
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:27,820
the breaking section of a wave--
the deeper the better.

746
00:51:27,946 --> 00:51:31,574
This is called getting locked
in the tube or riding the barrel.

747
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,910
Keala Kennelly has spent so much time
in the barrel...

748
00:51:35,036 --> 00:51:37,538
she's like a clown at the rodeo.

749
00:51:58,347 --> 00:52:01,099
Some men don't do what they do.

750
00:52:01,224 --> 00:52:04,435
And, well, it's--

751
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:06,645
I take my hat off.

752
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:10,524
I hope one day my daughter
can surf like them.

753
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:13,526
It's like falling in love.
You know?

754
00:52:13,651 --> 00:52:16,111
You don't know what the feeling is
until you've felt it.

755
00:52:16,237 --> 00:52:21,282
That's what being able to face
a challenge and to live a dream...

756
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:23,284
and to feel the energy...

757
00:52:23,368 --> 00:52:26,954
and to experience the beauty...

758
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,080
and to get spat out in glory.

759
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:35,503
Thanks to Layne, Rochelle
and Keala, it's official--

760
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:38,046
Tahiti is surfing paradise.

761
00:52:41,049 --> 00:52:44,468
But, of course, paradise
is actually a state of mind.

762
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:48,096
You might be somewhere where there isn't
a decent wave for a hundred miles...

763
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,183
and all you need is a little imagination
and a supertanker.

764
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,358
It begins where
the Atlantic Ocean ends.

765
00:53:01,483 --> 00:53:03,651
Fifteen miles wide
and 30 miles long...

766
00:53:03,735 --> 00:53:07,905
supertankers make this trip
from Galveston to Houston...

767
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,740
which in Texas means, Surfs up.!

768
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:13,201
We're chasing supertankers.

769
00:53:13,285 --> 00:53:15,953
I guess you'd call it
supertanker surfing.

770
00:53:16,037 --> 00:53:21,124
When I was a young kid
we used to ride ship waves...

771
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,876
about five miles from here
over on the shore.

772
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:27,504
A couple years back
a couple of us went out...

773
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,548
and started following the ships...

774
00:53:29,632 --> 00:53:32,342
and noticing some great places
to go surfing.

775
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:34,928
Nobody knows where we are. At the beach,
everybody knows where we are.

776
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:37,054
But out here we're on our own.

777
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,056
Every time there's good stories to tell.

778
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,058
There's a lot of variables.

779
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:43,184
It has to be low tide,
a little bit of wind.

780
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,521
It's nice to have a tanker by itself,
full speed ahead at about 1 3 knots.

781
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:51,233
The wave comes out of deep water
and just drags along in the shoal.

782
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,236
It's a difficult wave to ride,
but it goes forever.

783
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:58,072
I think you could probably ride one
for two or three miles, no bullshit.

784
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:25,554
You're gonna ride the wake of
a supertanker for two or three miles...

785
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,598
you'd better put aside
a good portion of the afternoon.

786
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,933
You're riding
two or three minutes at a time...

787
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,935
which is a whole different sport.

788
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,936
Particularly here in Texas.
The rides are really short.

789
00:54:35,062 --> 00:54:37,814
You're used to
two or three-second rides.

790
00:54:37,939 --> 00:54:40,190
The first 20 or 30 seconds

791
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:43,235
and then you're like,
My legs are starting to hurt. 

792
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:46,238
You could be eating a sandwich on it,
you'd still enjoy it.

793
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,831
We miss a wave, motor out in front
of the wave and drop 'em off again...

794
00:54:57,956 --> 00:55:00,291
because it just keeps breaking.

795
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:04,712
It'll be a set of maybe up to eight
waves that are real close together.

796
00:55:04,795 --> 00:55:10,424
So, fortunately, right after it there'll
be another wave and you just keep on--

797
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:13,468
keep on catchin' 'em until they
all make it out of the shoal area...

798
00:55:13,553 --> 00:55:15,471
and just play out altogether.

799
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:17,513
Then you gotta wait
on another tanker.

800
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:23,561
There's a lot of characters
in surfing...

801
00:55:23,644 --> 00:55:26,855
and these Texans
are on the top of the list.

802
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:30,817
But they can't hold a candle
to those wackos from Santa Cruz.

803
00:55:33,277 --> 00:55:36,946
They call these frigid, shark-infested
waters their playground.

804
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:39,366
They're a group of life long friends
famous in the water...

805
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:41,117
for their big-wave ability...

806
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:43,786
and infamous on land
for being slightly unhinged.

807
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:46,871
Collectively, they're called
the Maverick's Crew.

808
00:55:46,997 --> 00:55:49,457
I think the Maverick's Crew,
in general...

809
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:54,795
is one of the most messed-up
group of frickin' wild men--

810
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,630
They're nuts.

811
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:09,474
Santa Cruz has kind of been
a nickname kind of ground.

812
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,518
I don't think you're cool
unless you have one.

813
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,812
The nicknames come from who they are--
Barney's a barney.

814
00:56:14,896 --> 00:56:16,814
Flea, he's just a little guy...

815
00:56:16,897 --> 00:56:19,857
and he drops in on huge waves.

816
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:22,152
Skinny, he was always a skinny cat.

817
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:24,195
Unfortunately, he kinda grew up,
and he's big now.

818
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:28,282
But that's what happens.

819
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:31,033
Wasn't something I enjoyed,
being called the Condor.

820
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:34,411
My mom didn't want me to be a surfer--
No, surfers are slackers.

821
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:36,663
Dope-smokin' losers.
You're not gonna be one of those.

822
00:56:36,747 --> 00:56:41,000
They'd try to get me into sports, so I
was always doing it behind their back.

823
00:56:41,084 --> 00:56:44,003
I was sneaking out.
I had a board at my friend's house.

824
00:56:44,087 --> 00:56:46,338
I kept my board and wet suit
at a friend's house.

825
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:48,465
I'd come home from the beach.

826
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:51,176
I'd be all sun burnt and salty,
she'd taste my skin and go...

827
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,719
You-- You're grounded!

828
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:57,264
My father runs
a surf shop here in town.

829
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,268
Basically grew up in a surf shop
factory, shaping room.

830
00:57:01,393 --> 00:57:05,396
So I pretty much had surfing in my blood
since the moment I was crawling.

831
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,024
At this point in my life,
he's my best friend.

832
00:57:08,107 --> 00:57:10,817
It helps. That's the main thing,
especially for what we're doing...

833
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:12,819
is a partnership...

834
00:57:12,903 --> 00:57:15,405
to have that kind of security.

835
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,489
The Maverick's Crew has a reputation...

836
00:57:17,573 --> 00:57:20,825
as the best big wave,
paddle-in surfers in the world...

837
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,037
so it came as a surprise to many,
including themselves...

838
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:27,332
when they decided
to take up tow-in surfing.

839
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:31,543
Pete had a ski and said, Hey,
wanna do this? I'm, like, All right.

840
00:57:31,627 --> 00:57:35,672
We didn't know.
And now I realize, it's good stuff.

841
00:58:17,415 --> 00:58:19,374
Being new to tow-in surfing...

842
00:58:19,459 --> 00:58:21,877
the Maverick's Crew looks
to Maui and the Strapped Crew...

843
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:23,920
for ideas and guidance.

844
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,923
Everything that we've done
to lead up to it...

845
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,801
we've kinda taken from them--
bits and pieces.

846
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:31,802
They're legends, straight up.

847
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:34,805
The Maverick's Crew and the
Strapped Crew knew each other...

848
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,306
but because of the 2,500 miles
of ocean between them...

849
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:40,142
they'd never really had
an opportunity to surf together.

850
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:41,560
That was about to change.

851
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:45,605
I don't think the Maverick's guys
will have problems coming over here...

852
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,607
other than adjusting
to warm water...

853
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:51,235
and not having
to wear wet suits.

854
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,905
Our biggest problem is, we're going to
be really white and get sun burnt.

855
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,032
Regardless of their skin color...

856
00:58:57,157 --> 00:58:59,075
these two groups
had a lot in common.

857
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:04,663
I would say, like our group, they have
every personality defect in the book...

858
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:06,539
in their group as well.

859
00:59:06,665 --> 00:59:08,291
Perfect.

860
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,627
I appreciate their sick humor.

861
00:59:10,752 --> 00:59:12,586
They're a lot smaller
than I thought.

862
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,006
Laird's only 5'5 or something.
I thought he was 6'2.

863
00:59:19,176 --> 00:59:21,302
Eight of the world's best
big wave surfers...

864
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:24,304
together again for the first time.

865
00:59:24,388 --> 00:59:28,349
The type of conditions
we're capable of experiencing...

866
00:59:28,475 --> 00:59:31,143
at this break--you know,
this is the windiest spot on Earth.

867
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:50,743
Tow surfing has made
the once impossible ride able.

868
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:52,912
But even that has its limits.

869
00:59:53,037 --> 00:59:57,373
A tow board in winds like this
is almost impossible to ride.

870
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,376
That's the beauty
of living on Maui--

871
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:02,711
It's windy so often that if you don't
learn to take advantage of the wind...

872
01:00:02,837 --> 01:00:04,755
you're gonna be
a real sourpuss of a surfer...

873
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,716
because it's not that good
over here very often.

874
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:11,385
That's part of being here,
is being creative...

875
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:15,139
trying to come up with ways to use
the wind to incorporate surfing...

876
01:00:15,223 --> 01:00:17,349
but take advantage of the wind also.

877
01:00:17,433 --> 01:00:19,851
The foil boards that we're riding...

878
01:00:19,935 --> 01:00:22,437
are one way to take advantage of it.

879
01:00:22,562 --> 01:00:25,689
At first glance, the foil board looks
like some kind of practical joke.

880
01:00:25,815 --> 01:00:30,360
Laird assured us that the hydrofoil fin
makes the board glide above the water.

881
01:00:30,444 --> 01:00:34,197
I figured he meant it felt like
it was gliding above the water.

882
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,872
Even though you see it,
you can hardly believe it.

883
01:00:44,998 --> 01:00:48,250
Their feet strapped in snowboard boots
two feet above the water...

884
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:51,127
the wind hardly affected them at all.

885
01:00:52,254 --> 01:00:54,714
The history of the foil boards
from our group...

886
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:58,717
was Brad Nichol grabbing this thing
called an Air Chair...

887
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:00,760
and bringing it back from Maui.

888
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:03,763
You sit down on it.
We all went out and tried it.

889
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:06,057
And it was fun.

890
01:01:06,182 --> 01:01:10,143
Of course, Laird had to take it to the
next step, so he sawed the seat off...

891
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:12,395
and figured out how to stand on it.

892
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:15,565
Then, like everything, once you see
that something is possible...

893
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:17,608
then somebody else has to try it.

894
01:01:17,692 --> 01:01:20,235
That's the way it goes.

895
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:24,114
There's thousands and thousands
of surfboard shapers...

896
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:28,158
and there's one guy making this thing
that you can sit on...

897
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:31,203
and he doesn't even know
we're standing on them yet.

898
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:36,081
Laird and David spend as much time
in each other's garage...

899
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:39,751
refining the foil board's design
as they do riding it.

900
01:01:39,877 --> 01:01:42,796
They're an interesting cross
between surf gods...

901
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,923
and hobby geeks.

902
01:02:03,355 --> 01:02:05,273
The foil itself actually uses...

903
01:02:05,357 --> 01:02:07,817
the energy of the wave
under the water...

904
01:02:07,942 --> 01:02:10,277
touching a deeper source
of the wave.

905
01:02:10,361 --> 01:02:13,989
It's got a real cushiony, soft feeling,
almost like you're surfing on a cloud.

906
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:17,616
A magic carpet ride on a board...

907
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:21,912
that can ride both a ripple
and the biggest of waves.

908
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:25,248
The foil board's ability
to catch a wave early...

909
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:26,958
and cut through
the heaviest wind chop...

910
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:31,002
gives it the potential to ride a wave
over a hundred feet tall.

911
01:02:36,591 --> 01:02:39,510
I think when, actually, Laird
went to school at this place--

912
01:02:39,636 --> 01:02:41,512
They tore it down.
It's old now.

913
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:45,265
I think this is where they came up
with the idea for the hydrofoil.

914
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:48,351
It's pretty cool, you know.

915
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:51,062
See, they figured out it's better--

916
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:54,523
it's better to use it
in the water, though.

917
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:02,279
They stand on the edge
of a new frontier...

918
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,906
sharing a common pursuit
of happiness.

919
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,493
A pursuit that can bond
a father with his son...

920
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,536
and have the future
pushed by the past.

921
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,624
Jim and Alex Knost have gone
on many surf trips together...

922
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,626
but none of them quite like this.

923
01:03:18,835 --> 01:03:20,377
I had no choice...

924
01:03:20,503 --> 01:03:22,462
but to go over into a war...

925
01:03:22,547 --> 01:03:24,840
and into a war-torn country.

926
01:03:24,924 --> 01:03:28,218
Jim couldn't believe he was back.
It'd been a long time.

927
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:32,179
In the service,
I was a salvage diver.

928
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:34,181
Hard-hat salvage diver.

929
01:03:34,265 --> 01:03:37,893
So I got an opportunity
to see a lot of beautiful beaches...

930
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:40,478
and ride through some swells.

931
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:45,733
It was always my thought that these
swells had to be landing somewhere.

932
01:03:45,858 --> 01:03:48,818
It was those swells
that brought Jim back to Vietnam.

933
01:03:48,902 --> 01:03:50,820
With him, his son Alex.

934
01:03:50,904 --> 01:03:53,906
They were there for some adventure,
fun and surf.

935
01:03:55,449 --> 01:03:58,326
Being a communist country,
Vietnam has millions of laws...

936
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,411
except on the roadways.

937
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:10,003
An 800-mile white-knuckle
journey for surf.

938
01:04:10,837 --> 01:04:14,715
These guys look at the surfboards--
What the hell are those guys doin'?

939
01:04:17,134 --> 01:04:19,093
We looked everywhere for waves--

940
01:04:19,178 --> 01:04:22,722
out in the country, near cities,
even once next to a leper colony...

941
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:25,391
which was the only time
we were happy there was no surf.

942
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:28,393
The rest of the time,
the perfection mocked us.

943
01:04:28,477 --> 01:04:31,979
The beaches were dazzling,
but the South China Sea was a lake.

944
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:37,109
If there's no surf,
Alex begins to twitch a little bit.

945
01:04:37,234 --> 01:04:41,320
That's okay. He's not used to spending
that much time out of the water.

946
01:04:41,446 --> 01:04:43,781
Jim and Alex started sand surfing...

947
01:04:43,865 --> 01:04:47,284
and if you're gonna surfs and,
you might as well surf big sand.

948
01:04:47,368 --> 01:04:51,830
So they headed up the coast
hoping to find that perfect dune.

949
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:59,169
Without hesitation, Alex jumped
into the first ride of the day.

950
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:04,507
The wipeout seemed over,
and then he looked behind him.

951
01:05:12,389 --> 01:05:15,433
Jim thought it looked easy
and ended up with a 20-grit enema.

952
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:18,727
This kid was the big kahuna
of the dunes.

953
01:05:18,811 --> 01:05:21,813
He showed the Knosts
how to really ride the sand.

954
01:05:23,899 --> 01:05:25,817
The kid was so stoked on the board...

955
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,568
he made Jim and Alex follow him back to
his village so he could show his pals.

956
01:05:28,653 --> 01:05:31,363
This kid had a lot of pals...

957
01:05:31,488 --> 01:05:33,656
and they were all stoked
on the board.

958
01:05:33,782 --> 01:05:35,241
Hundreds of them.

959
01:05:35,325 --> 01:05:39,119
Alex could hardly move and tried
to take sanctuary in the water.

960
01:05:43,123 --> 01:05:45,917
That didn't really help matters much.

961
01:05:48,169 --> 01:05:50,587
It didn't really matter
that they were riding ripples.

962
01:05:50,671 --> 01:05:52,297
The joint went ballistic.

963
01:05:52,423 --> 01:05:55,675
Every time they stood up, the kids
went into a full frothing frenzy.

964
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,343
What can you say?
How can you deny 'em?

965
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:00,679
It reminds me of the first time
I went surfing.

966
01:06:00,805 --> 01:06:04,724
Jim was using the standing start,
which is a fairly cool method.

967
01:06:07,018 --> 01:06:09,144
Alex, meanwhile,
found a salad bowl...

968
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:11,772
and challenged the croutons
in it to a race.

969
01:06:11,856 --> 01:06:14,358
Croutons got his board,
he got their bowl.

970
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:18,527
The four on the board were a well-oiled
machine. Alex was the Titanic.

971
01:06:19,445 --> 01:06:21,488
Jim's students were fed up...

972
01:06:21,614 --> 01:06:23,573
and it turned into a full mutiny.

973
01:06:32,581 --> 01:06:36,292
- Hang ten.!
- Hang ten!
- Hang ten.!
- Hang ten!

974
01:06:36,376 --> 01:06:39,378
- Wipe out!
- Wipe out!
- Wipe out!
- Wipe out!

975
01:06:39,504 --> 01:06:41,755
- Cut back.!
- Cut back.!
- Cut back.!
- Cut back.!

976
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:43,757
- Bottom turn.!
- Bottom turn.!
- Bottom turn.!
- Bottom turn.!

977
01:06:43,882 --> 01:06:47,051
With all their newfound friends
following them, chanting, Cowabunga'...

978
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:49,637
Jim and Alex set out
for one final stop.

979
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:53,140
It was the last place
Jim had surfed in Vietnam-- Da Nang.

980
01:06:53,224 --> 01:06:57,519
They still had hope, especially when
they found out Da Nang had a surf club.

981
01:06:57,644 --> 01:06:59,687
This club from 1 992...

982
01:06:59,812 --> 01:07:02,439
so we have over 1 0 surfer.

983
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:04,858
- Over 1 0 surfers?
- Yeah, over 1 0 surfer.

984
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:07,694
Over 1 0 out of a population
of nearly 80 million.

985
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:10,279
Numbers don't matter
when you're stoked.

986
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:13,324
I have got free time,
I must go to the sea...

987
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:15,575
and play surfing.

988
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:19,996
The Da Nang Surf Club
is also the national swim team.

989
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,332
They request that every guest
sign their register.

990
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,334
With Jim and Alex's signature...

991
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,544
their 1 0-year total of visitors
reached 2 4.

992
01:07:46,643 --> 01:07:50,104
At the end of the day,
Jim gave the club his surfboard.

993
01:07:50,188 --> 01:07:53,857
He'd done a similar thing in 1 97 2
when his military tour ended.

994
01:07:53,941 --> 01:07:58,569
Two surfboards, 30 years apart,
both left in Da Nang.

995
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:00,613
One given by a young soldier...

996
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:02,698
the other by a father with his son.

997
01:08:02,782 --> 01:08:05,409
It's the kind of thing that makes
a surf trip worthwhile.

998
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:16,627
There comes a time
in every surfer's life...

999
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:20,338
when he realizes he's always
gonna be a surfer... forever.

1000
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:22,924
It's no longer what he does.
It's who he is.

1001
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:24,966
It's part of his inner compass.

1002
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:28,761
Laird, David, Pete and Skinny
have a compass...

1003
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:31,055
but only the four of them can read it.

1004
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:33,265
Their Maui meeting
has somehow become a trip...

1005
01:08:33,391 --> 01:08:36,059
to the Earth's belly button, Rapa Nui.

1006
01:08:36,143 --> 01:08:38,144
Three thousand miles
off the coast of Chile--

1007
01:08:38,228 --> 01:08:42,439
a friendly place,
but also remote and mysterious.

1008
01:08:44,108 --> 01:08:46,568
To describe the energy
that you feel here...

1009
01:08:46,652 --> 01:08:49,404
is like to try to describe
a color in words.

1010
01:08:49,488 --> 01:08:51,781
Unless you've seen it,
it's hard to explain.

1011
01:08:51,907 --> 01:08:54,617
The power of the land
and the power of the people...

1012
01:08:54,742 --> 01:08:56,660
that still have survived...

1013
01:08:56,744 --> 01:09:00,872
on this most remote island
in the world.

1014
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:04,959
It's rugged and raw, but it's one
of the more pure places in the world...

1015
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:09,087
that hasn't been spoiled
by the western civilization.

1016
01:09:09,171 --> 01:09:12,965
So you come here, you know,
and it's just warmth.

1017
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,473
We're in such a remote location,
and to see somebody surfing...

1018
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:25,351
you can see the smiles on their face,
giggling and laughing.

1019
01:09:25,477 --> 01:09:28,187
Those pure moments
that surfing has to offer...

1020
01:09:28,312 --> 01:09:30,814
that aren't as common
as they used to be...

1021
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:33,274
really are what make
the whole thing special.

1022
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:36,777
You'd think a small island like this,
doing a lot of inbreeding...

1023
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:39,446
there'd be some goofy,
ugly people.

1024
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:43,032
Some of the most beautiful people I've
ever seen in the world, inside and out.

1025
01:09:44,993 --> 01:09:47,453
Rapa Nui is a very special place.

1026
01:09:47,537 --> 01:09:49,538
You can actually feel it.

1027
01:09:49,622 --> 01:09:53,124
In the morning when they'd awake,
they'd find gifts on their front door...

1028
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:55,835
anonymous signs of appreciation.

1029
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,003
They'd become instant folk heroes...

1030
01:09:58,087 --> 01:10:00,839
and with their respect
for the island and the natives...

1031
01:10:00,965 --> 01:10:03,884
it was a mutual
admiration society.

1032
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:24,409
They seemed to feed off
of each other's energy.

1033
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,494
The boys were nonstop action.

1034
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,747
A circus of perpetual motion
was Skin dog, the ringmaster.

1035
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,135
They gave me a hard time
for being all pale.

1036
01:11:45,261 --> 01:11:48,346
You're not buff, dude.
You're not tan.

1037
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:51,891
You need to get in the buff, bronzed and
bitchin' club, buddy, all that shit.

1038
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,476
I'm, like, Come on.!

1039
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,647
You see one guy
do something stupid...

1040
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:02,650
then try and do something
even more stupid.

1041
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:06,653
Make it happen and make it fun.

1042
01:12:06,737 --> 01:12:09,072
That's what surfing's about,
is having fun.

1043
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:12,075
There was something different
about Peter's hair.

1044
01:12:28,505 --> 01:12:30,631
I feel the love here.

1045
01:12:30,757 --> 01:12:33,175
Can you feel it? You feeling it?
I'm feeling it.

1046
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:36,386
Laird, David, Pete and Skinny
had become fast friends...

1047
01:12:36,512 --> 01:12:40,473
but the time had come for them
to go back to their respective homes.

1048
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,516
Life is interesting in the sense of...

1049
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,144
no matter where you go in life, you
always meet people you'll relate to...

1050
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:50,440
from different tribe,
different language, different country.

1051
01:12:50,524 --> 01:12:55,277
When you have something as incredible
as the ocean to relate to...

1052
01:12:55,361 --> 01:12:58,155
you get to have some brothers
that you haven't known...

1053
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,699
but you get to meet
for the first time.

1054
01:13:00,824 --> 01:13:03,784
That's a feeling-- that's a life.

1055
01:13:03,868 --> 01:13:05,869
You know, that's your life.

1056
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:11,458
On Rapa Nui,
the statues are called moai.

1057
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:14,543
How they got there,
who built them, is a mystery.

1058
01:13:14,627 --> 01:13:17,421
A lot like surfers, who are always
looking for that better wave...

1059
01:13:17,546 --> 01:13:19,547
just past the horizon...

1060
01:13:19,673 --> 01:13:24,510
somehow believing that at that moment,
that perfect wave may appear.

1061
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,095
How many good surf spots
people have found...

1062
01:13:27,221 --> 01:13:30,682
and a lot of places I'd been looking,
figurin', There's no surf there.

1063
01:13:30,808 --> 01:13:33,727
Next thing you know,
there's some great surf.

1064
01:13:33,852 --> 01:13:37,980
You gotta be there on the right day,
right time of the year, et cetera.

1065
01:13:38,064 --> 01:13:40,065
To find it, be patient.

1066
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,108
It's nature's schedule, not yours.

1067
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:44,694
Surf forecaster Sean Collins
knows this.

1068
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:47,362
He's had his eye on one place
for a decade.

1069
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:51,533
Cortes Bank is probably one of the most
fragile areas you could imagine...

1070
01:13:51,617 --> 01:13:56,245
because it is so open to so many
other swells and so open to the wind.

1071
01:13:56,371 --> 01:14:00,499
We only have maybe five days out there
where the wind's really under 1 0 knots.

1072
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:03,835
So, you know, maybe five days a year
that's even surf able...

1073
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:07,588
and then trying to get one of those
five days to have 60-foot waves.

1074
01:14:07,714 --> 01:14:10,174
You know, your odds
are pretty much against you.

1075
01:14:10,257 --> 01:14:12,925
That's why we waited 1 0 years
before we were able to get it.

1076
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:14,927
A once-in-a-lifetime deal.

1077
01:14:15,053 --> 01:14:17,680
'Cause I've been out there
in boats quite a few times...

1078
01:14:17,764 --> 01:14:20,766
and I've never, you know--
never seen it even--

1079
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:23,727
I've seen gnarly looking
white water...

1080
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:27,896
and backwash and white sharks
and all that stuff...

1081
01:14:27,981 --> 01:14:31,442
but never a wave
I'd think you could ride.

1082
01:14:31,525 --> 01:14:34,068
The wave there is made by
a sea mount, they call it.

1083
01:14:34,152 --> 01:14:36,070
It's just a mountain
in the ocean...

1084
01:14:36,154 --> 01:14:38,072
at the end of
the continental shelf...

1085
01:14:38,156 --> 01:14:42,117
so you got open ocean swells,
and it's just 5,000 feet...

1086
01:14:42,243 --> 01:14:44,119
and it just goes straight down.

1087
01:14:44,244 --> 01:14:46,871
We met them down in San Diego
at about 5:00 p.m.

1088
01:14:46,955 --> 01:14:49,665
We loaded up the boat,
got everything on there.

1089
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:52,751
It was like, God, I hope
somebody doesn't get hurt.

1090
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:54,753
Hope somebody doesn't die.

1091
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:58,548
Met the captain. A funny guy.
He's a young guy, like, 22.

1092
01:14:58,631 --> 01:15:00,549
He skated out, and I thought
he was some deck hand.

1093
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:04,427
He was, What's up? I'm your captain!
We're taking you out to Cortes.

1094
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:07,096
I'm like, You? Kid? Oh, man!

1095
01:15:07,222 --> 01:15:09,098
I was like,
Right on. Let's do this!

1096
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,478
For us, this is a, you know...

1097
01:15:15,604 --> 01:15:18,481
an adventure,
a rocket ride to the moon.

1098
01:15:18,565 --> 01:15:20,483
I'd never been out that far.

1099
01:15:20,525 --> 01:15:24,945
I was scared to go driving a boat out in
20-foot seas in the middle of the night.

1100
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:26,655
Trudging along for 1 2 hours...

1101
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,823
we had a few engine problems
in the middle of the night.

1102
01:15:28,948 --> 01:15:31,491
We were all bummed, thinking
we weren't even gonna get there.

1103
01:15:31,617 --> 01:15:33,535
We got out there on one engine.

1104
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:39,581
Okay, 1 00 miles out, everybody's
trying to get their skis off the boat.

1105
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:41,876
Whew! This is serious.

1106
01:15:42,001 --> 01:15:46,129
When the first ski hit the water,
Skinny went out for a closer look.

1107
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,466
When I first pulled up, there was,
I'd say, 1 00 seals out there.

1108
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:54,094
You think you're the only people out
there, and, nah, you're the newcomers.

1109
01:15:54,178 --> 01:15:57,972
The locals don't even want you
around here. Get out of here.

1110
01:15:58,056 --> 01:16:02,017
Then the set came, and that really
tripped me out. I'm, like, Oh, my God.!

1111
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:14,319
So we knew then-- we had some
perspective that it was pretty darn big.

1112
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,029
That was the shocker for me.

1113
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,031
I'm a hundred miles out to sea
on a jet ski!

1114
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,491
It's like watching these waves.
Let's do this.

1115
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:24,161
There are very few surfers
in the world...

1116
01:16:24,245 --> 01:16:28,123
who have the mind-set or the ability
to go out and surf waves of this size...

1117
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,166
in a break completely unknown.

1118
01:16:31,584 --> 01:16:33,168
Peter and Mel
caught the first wave.

1119
01:16:33,294 --> 01:16:36,922
John Wallop, the young boat captain,
who'd paddled out for a closer look...

1120
01:16:37,047 --> 01:16:40,633
realized he'd made a serious mistake.

1121
01:16:56,439 --> 01:17:00,275
You really have to make it.
You don't want to fall.

1122
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,360
The young captain survived
and made it back to the boat...

1123
01:17:03,445 --> 01:17:05,363
which was lucky for everybody.

1124
01:17:05,446 --> 01:17:07,405
After all, who'd drive us home?

1125
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:21,168
You're riding a mountain in the ocean,
there's nothing in front of you.

1126
01:17:21,251 --> 01:17:24,295
As soon as you get off your board,
you wanna get on that ski so fast...

1127
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,838
'cause it's so much stuff out there.

1128
01:17:26,923 --> 01:17:30,509
You can guarantee there's some big fish
out there that'd love to eat ya.

1129
01:17:31,843 --> 01:17:33,719
Cortes is teeming with life.

1130
01:17:33,803 --> 01:17:37,014
With all the seals,
it's a snack stand for white sharks.

1131
01:17:37,098 --> 01:17:41,893
But when you're this excited,
nothing exists except the wave.

1132
01:17:42,019 --> 01:17:43,937
All around the reef,
there's water breaking.

1133
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:46,188
So it just seems like
there's shore around.

1134
01:17:46,272 --> 01:17:48,774
You don't really realize...

1135
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:51,234
until you sit down
during a lull or something...

1136
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:55,238
and you look at your buddy and go,
We're out 1 00 miles at sea.! Perfect.!

1137
01:17:55,321 --> 01:17:58,406
High-five each other. That's the only
time you realize it's pretty cool.

1138
01:18:07,457 --> 01:18:10,751
Those guys actually got the biggest wave
because it was their turn.

1139
01:18:10,834 --> 01:18:13,252
It was the luck of the draw.
I'm watching them get this thing.

1140
01:18:13,337 --> 01:18:15,255
Oh, my God!
It's such a killer wave!

1141
01:18:16,506 --> 01:18:20,717
Swell's picking up. I turn around.
You want this one? And he's like--

1142
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:25,596
I remember going through my mind,
going, You know, don't be a wuss.

1143
01:19:05,005 --> 01:19:08,257
I remember picking him up after.
He said, Yeah.! That was just--

1144
01:19:08,341 --> 01:19:11,135
Yeah, I was just--
I was dropping in forever!

1145
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,554
I just kept going and kept going
and kept going and kept going!

1146
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,140
He goes, That was the biggest wave
I ever had in my life!

1147
01:19:17,224 --> 01:19:20,184
He was just, Whoo! I'm all,
Get back on. Here's another one!

1148
01:19:20,268 --> 01:19:24,271
Just right back out there and wham--
put him into another one!

1149
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,868
Taking a break for lunch,
they talked very little...

1150
01:19:40,994 --> 01:19:42,578
while the waves
kept pouring through.

1151
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:45,998
We went out there thinking,
half hour, an hour sesh'...

1152
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,082
we'll be able to get in, and then
the wind will blow and ruin it.

1153
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,709
No, it just got glassier.

1154
01:19:49,834 --> 01:19:54,129
We're looking at each other and going,
Is there an oil spill around?

1155
01:19:54,213 --> 01:19:56,464
We just ended up surfing
all day long.

1156
01:19:56,548 --> 01:19:58,549
Have lunch, go suit up, back out.

1157
01:19:59,968 --> 01:20:03,596
The wind completely stopped.
The ocean and sky merged.

1158
01:20:03,721 --> 01:20:06,515
And it seemed that the waves
knew the game.

1159
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:09,225
They'd come to play with giants.

1160
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:29,834
So when we were leaving,
it was still glassy.

1161
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,836
Sun's going down. It's all pink.

1162
01:21:31,962 --> 01:21:33,546
We're watching the waves
stand up offshore blow off...

1163
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:37,633
like a giant stallion running
in the middle of the ocean.

1164
01:21:37,758 --> 01:21:41,552
Oh, my God. Was that for real?
Still pinching yourself.

1165
01:21:41,637 --> 01:21:44,556
That ride home,
when we were just sitting there...

1166
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,474
the four of us looking at each other,
just glowing, you know.

1167
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,102
You don't even have to
say anything to each other.

1168
01:21:50,227 --> 01:21:52,353
You just look at each other
and just smile.

1169
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:55,439
This is it. This is how good I feel.
This is what it's all about.

1170
01:22:04,656 --> 01:22:07,283
It was the end
of a fantastic adventure...

1171
01:22:07,408 --> 01:22:10,327
but I realized the perfect wave
isn't one thing.

1172
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:14,039
It's always changing, depending on
the surfer and the situation.

1173
01:22:14,164 --> 01:22:17,458
It's a choice.
It's what you make of it.

1174
01:22:22,087 --> 01:22:25,131
Surfing is great while
it's happening, but boy.!

1175
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:27,216
You can talk about it
forever and ever.

1176
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:30,136
And in a way, you know...

1177
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:32,929
the stories are all intertwined.

1178
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:41,436
Whether it be oil tank surfing or
the guy surfing every day of his life...

1179
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,521
or us on the outer reefs...

1180
01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:47,149
it just carries on,
and it's just the love and the laughter.

1181
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:50,319
It just goes on and on,
and it's to the grave.

1182
01:22:54,156 --> 01:22:56,699
It is so pure and so intense...

1183
01:22:56,825 --> 01:23:00,244
that we hang all this crap and bullshit
on surfing and it survives it all...

1184
01:23:00,369 --> 01:23:02,245
'cause the ride itself
is so bitchin'.

1185
01:23:35,232 --> 01:23:38,401
It's the moments, the people
and the passion.

1186
01:23:38,526 --> 01:23:41,320
There's something to be said
for being stoked.

1187
01:23:42,613 --> 01:23:45,907
I guess the bottom line is,
real surfers don't say dude. 

1188
01:23:53,706 --> 01:23:57,208
The difference between surfing on the
ocean and surfing on the Great Lakes--

1189
01:23:57,334 --> 01:24:01,087
There are some geologic differences...

1190
01:24:01,212 --> 01:24:04,923
at-- at-- at-- at--

1191
01:24:05,049 --> 01:24:08,510
So it's important for me to know--

1192
01:24:08,593 --> 01:24:11,303
I don't know, but, yeah.

1193
01:24:12,472 --> 01:24:15,224
You love it? Love it.

1194
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,809
What?

1195
01:24:18,977 --> 01:24:22,021
Okay, Dana. Fire away, baby.

1196
01:24:22,105 --> 01:24:24,857
You're an animal. Burrow.

1197
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:31,487
Can we start with something easier?

1198
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:34,740
Quiet, please. Rolling.

1199
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:43,455
Let's cut the camera crew.
Five second mini break.

1200
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:48,251
- Distraction.
- Damn, bro.

1201
01:24:48,377 --> 01:24:51,754
- Focus.
- We're talking about surfing right now.

1202
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:55,299
- To me, that is surfing.
- A different kind.

1203
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:57,634
My name--

1204
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,053
An Irishman would say...

1205
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:03,263
Oh, geez,
it looks good out there today.

1206
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:06,349
You're gonna get out and get
a couple waves. It looks pretty great.

1207
01:25:06,475 --> 01:25:09,769
And a Scottish guy would say,
Oh, great! Look at that!

1208
01:25:09,895 --> 01:25:12,647
I can't believe it!
Are you going surfing or not?

1209
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:16,149
Yeah. Yeah.

1210
01:25:16,275 --> 01:25:17,734
Yeah!

1211
01:25:19,278 --> 01:25:23,698
I'm getting in touch with my feminine
side, so now I'm able to deal with it.

1212
01:25:25,741 --> 01:25:30,703
This is an exact replica of my father,
shrunken down and with blond hair.

1213
01:25:30,829 --> 01:25:34,123
Kids like to throw these around
in their bathtub.

1214
01:25:34,249 --> 01:25:38,377
I've caught my dad, actually, playing
with this in the bathtub as well.

1215
01:25:38,502 --> 01:25:40,461
He enjoys it.

1216
01:25:40,546 --> 01:25:43,381
I like being around him.
I like playing golf with him.

1217
01:25:43,506 --> 01:25:45,382
I like surfing with him.

1218
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:47,968
I like to talk to him on the phone
when the phone rings.

1219
01:25:49,345 --> 01:25:51,054
I'll be there in a minute.

1220
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,139
Dinner's ready. You're welcome.
