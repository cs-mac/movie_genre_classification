Am I in England?</font>

Just... fine.</font>

so I'm going to keep it.</font>

144
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,727
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. No, you should.
I think it suits you.</font>

145
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,854
<font color="#ffff80">Adds Latin flavour to it.</font>

146
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,106
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

147

want to leave that amazing party?</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Mm.</font>

154
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,219

best about this place?</font>

155

<font color="#ffff80">Apart from the free glacé cherries,</font>

157
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,184
<font color="#ffff80">the fact that they still insist upon</font>

and I prefer Polynesian call girl.</font>

160
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,191
<font color="#ffff80">Mm-hm.</font>

161
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,109
<font color="#ffff80">So talk me through head-butting
your new boss.</font>

162
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,904
<font color="#ffff80">Well, actually,
she might have head-butted me,</font>

163
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,699
<font color="#ffff80">but our lanyards tangled.
There was a struggle, you know?</font>

164
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,035
<font color="#ffff80">Our heads went forward.
There was a crash, wallop.</font>

165
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,329
<font color="#ffff80">Mm, sounds like
she made quite an impression.</font>

166
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,581
<font color="#ffff80">- No, no, not this again.
- Oh, come on, Bruce.</font>

167
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,250
<font color="#ffff80">You haven't even mentioned a girl
since, what, the early '90s?</font>

168
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,920
<font color="#ffff80">Stand down, Samantha, please.
She is not of my world.</font>

169
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,589
<font color="#ffff80">Oh and what world is that,
the world of not even trying?</font>

170
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,468
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, indeed, the planet
She's Beautiful, Way Out Of My League,</font>

so knock it on the head.</font>

172
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,598
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, that well-known place.
Is that right next to precious comfort zone?</font>

173
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,476
<font color="#ffff80">A place you've never even
stepped out of ever.</font>

if you really like something,</font>

175
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,108
<font color="#ffff80">you've got to put yourself out there.
Got to reach out and grab it.</font>

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,902
<font color="#ffff80">The cherries are not that delicious.</font>

177
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,487
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not talking
about the cherries, Bruce.</font>

178
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,287

393
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,116
<font color="#ffff80">- We will, thank you.
- Do your basics.</font>

394
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,160
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you very much.
Here we go.</font>

395
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,329
<font color="#ffff80">Ready and one, two, three.</font>

396
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,875
<font color="#ffff80">Hello?</font>

397
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,799
<font color="#ffff80">- Hey. Are you not teaching me?
- I said I ran a class.</font>

398
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,386
<font color="#ffff80">- Didn't say I taught one.
- Ron, please.</font>

399
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:23,182
<font color="#ffff80">It's baby stuff out there.
Just one quick freshener.</font>

400
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,187
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, I see.</font>

401
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,688
<font color="#ffff80">OK.</font>

402
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,860
<font color="#ffff80">I think we've done...
One private lesson.</font>

403
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,823
<font color="#ffff80">How much do you want?
40 for an hour?</font>

404
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,909
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, that's what you think.</font>

405
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,327
<font color="#ffff80">You think I sit back here</font>

406
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,412
<font color="#ffff80">waiting for someone to come in
and open their wallet?</font>

407
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,331
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, what are you waiting for?</font>

408
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,337
<font color="#ffff80">Alicia.</font>

409
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:59,134
<font color="#ffff80">- Hello.
- This is Bruce Garrett.</font>

410
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,053
<font color="#ffff80">- Take him out for a quick spin.
- No.</font>

411
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,304
<font color="#ffff80">Road test him.</font>

412
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,431
<font color="#ffff80">Alicia teaches our advanced class,</font>

413
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:08,268
<font color="#ffff80">2007 world champion,
dances cabaret style.</font>

414
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,062
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, yes, yes.</font>

415
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,148
<font color="#ffff80">You do know cabaret style, yeah?</font>

416
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:18,195
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry, do I... You ask if I know
cabaret style?</font>

417
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,750
<font color="#ffff80">Do you want to get warm?</font>

418
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,336
<font color="#ffff80">You should, although
you look quite warm as it is.</font>

419
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,845
<font color="#ffff80">I hear about you.</font>

420
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,267
<font color="#ffff80">- Ah.
- The boy with fire in his heels.</font>

421
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,227
<font color="#ffff80">Well, that's a long time ago.</font>

422
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,104
<font color="#ffff80">Aw.</font>

423
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,273
<font color="#ffff80">- You're in my yard now.
- Mm?</font>

424
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,485
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, crikey.</font>

425
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,903
<font color="#ffff80">Shh-ah.</font>

426
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,116
<font color="#ffff80">Ah, cha.</font>

427
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,120
<font color="#ffff80">- Ya.
- Rumba!</font>

428
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:32,686
<font color="#ffff80">Ow!</font>

429
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,119
<font color="#ffff80">Please.</font>

430
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,506
<font color="#ffff80">Stop it.</font>

431
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,050
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh.</font>

432
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,177
<font color="#ffff80">Welcome back.</font>

433
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,726
<font color="#ffff80">That's lesson one, son.</font>

434
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,279
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you.</font>

435
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,251
<font color="#ffff80">All right, dump truck.</font>

436
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,961
<font color="#ffff80">Have you seen
what she's wearing today?</font>

437
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,047
<font color="#ffff80">- Who?
- The big boss, yeah.</font>

438
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,633
<font color="#ffff80">She's got her green number on.
Isn't that nice?</font>

439
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,969
<font color="#ffff80">She's trying to tell me something,
you know what I mean?</font>

440
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,180
<font color="#ffff80">She's trying to tell me something.</font>

441
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,058
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to leave a stink on her
that she will never get off.</font>

442
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,144
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to be on her
like bonfire smell, you know I mean?</font>

443
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,523
<font color="#ffff80">She's going to be in the shower
changing her clothes.</font>

444
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:04,236
<font color="#ffff80">She's going to be like,
"OMG, I can still smell him."</font>

445
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,406
<font color="#ffff80">That's right, Julia. Get used to it.
I'm in your pores.</font>

446
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,243
<font color="#ffff80">You're disgusting.</font>

447
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,665
<font color="#ffff80">I think it's so cute
when you've got a little crush.</font>

448
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,210
<font color="#ffff80">You get a little crush
and you get so disgusted. Listen.</font>

449
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:25,215
<font color="#ffff80">Women like that use guys like you
to get advice about men like me.</font>

450
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,636
<font color="#ffff80">It's empty.</font>

451
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,580
<font color="#ffff80">Are you kidding me?</font>

452
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,290
<font color="#ffff80">Argh!</font>

453
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,375
<font color="#ffff80">Ah! Oh...</font>

454
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,002
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, God.</font>

455
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,713
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God. Oh, God.</font>

456
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,090
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh, my God, are you OK?
- Yeah.</font>

457
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,552
<font color="#ffff80">- Somebody call an ambulance!
- Really, no, I'm fine.</font>

458
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,472
<font color="#ffff80">Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.</font>

459
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,186
<font color="#ffff80">In for two, out for two. Slow down.</font>

460
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,481
<font color="#ffff80">- Was there a pastry in this bag?
- Yeah, I had an iced bun.</font>

461
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,484
<font color="#ffff80">I was driving...</font>

462
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,403
<font color="#ffff80">and then, all of a sudden, my tape deck
wasn't working and then bang!</font>

463
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,739
<font color="#ffff80">All of a sudden you were on the hood
of my car. I thought I'd killed you.</font>

464
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,741
<font color="#ffff80">Listen, don't worry. I'm fine.</font>

465
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,868
<font color="#ffff80">OK. OK, you're OK.</font>

466
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,703
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah. We're OK.
- I'm OK.</font>

467
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,664
<font color="#ffff80">You're alive!</font>

468
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,916
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, I hit you with my car,</font>

469
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,460
<font color="#ffff80">the least I could do
is give you a ride home.</font>

470
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:47,464
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry about it.
It's only a little car, isn't it?</font>

471
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,257
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God. Are you going to sue me?</font>

472
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:53,011
<font color="#ffff80">No! No, gosh, no. Good Lord,
I'd never sue.</font>

473
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,138
<font color="#ffff80">You know we're not...
As a society,</font>

474
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,599
<font color="#ffff80">we're not really big suers,
you know?</font>

475
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,143
<font color="#ffff80">We don't... We don't do it.</font>

476
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,354
<font color="#ffff80">God, you're rambling.
Are you OK?</font>

477
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,064
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah.
- Are you sure?</font>

478
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,024
<font color="#ffff80">- No, I'm fine.
- OK, what's my name?</font>

479
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,193
<font color="#ffff80">- Do you remember my name?
- Julio.</font>

480
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,494
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, there's the culprit.</font>

481
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,287
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh.
- The cassette of death.</font>

482
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,290
<font color="#ffff80">La casete de muerte.</font>

483
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,253
<font color="#ffff80">Ah, Tito Puente,
Willie Colón, Ray Barretto.</font>

484
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,882
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, yes, let's just put that
somewhere else far, far away.</font>

485
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,843
<font color="#ffff80">It's uh...</font>

486
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,681
<font color="#ffff80">I salsa, OK? I'm into salsa.</font>

487
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,267
<font color="#ffff80">In fact, I was on my way
to salsa class,</font>

488
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,979
<font color="#ffff80">which is why
I was willing to kill a man to get there,</font>

489
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,523
<font color="#ffff80">so that's how much I like salsa.</font>

490
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,240
<font color="#ffff80">All right,
so you've entered total shock.</font>

491
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,951
<font color="#ffff80">Are you in a state of shock now?</font>

492
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,912
<font color="#ffff80">I... I salsa.</font>

493
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,875
<font color="#ffff80">Ah.</font>

494
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,633
<font color="#ffff80">Right, sure you do.</font>

495
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,802
<font color="#ffff80">Wow, now I'm really worried
about you. Are you OK?</font>

496
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,223
<font color="#ffff80">Did Helen tell you
about the, uh, bowling?</font>

497
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,976
<font color="#ffff80">'Cause we're going to do
this whole bowling-bonding thing</font>

498
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,062
<font color="#ffff80">if you want to come.</font>

499
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:29,024
<font color="#ffff80">Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.</font>

500
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,569
<font color="#ffff80">I like bowling.
I was... I was born to bowl, really.</font>

501
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:36,698
<font color="#ffff80">Born to bowl, wow.
That's a big statement.</font>

502
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,384
<font color="#ffff80">One more time and...</font>

503
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,096
<font color="#ffff80">One, two, three,
five, six, seven.</font>

504
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,015
<font color="#ffff80">Let's try that one more time.
Ready and one...</font>

505
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,685
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, you, whatever your name is.</font>

506
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:11,024
<font color="#ffff80">My name is Bruce Garrett
and I'm here to learn salsa.</font>

507
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,653
<font color="#ffff80">Well, very nice to meet you, Bruce.
We're walking through some basics.</font>

508
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,741
<font color="#ffff80">Ready and one, two, three,
to the side, six, seven.</font>

509
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,161
<font color="#ffff80">Forward and turn.
Back and shimmy.</font>

510
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,166
<font color="#ffff80">One more time and...
one, two, three, five, six, seven.</font>

511
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,336
<font color="#ffff80">Forward and turn, back and shimmy.</font>

512
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,672
<font color="#ffff80">Nice one, Bruce.</font>

513
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,467
<font color="#ffff80">Let's try that again.
Ready and five, six, seven, go!</font>

514
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,220
<font color="#ffff80">Turn! Shimmy!</font>

515
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,972
<font color="#ffff80">One more time.</font>

516
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,065
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, thank you.</font>

517
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,652
<font color="#ffff80">Well done, everyone.
Muy bien.</font>

518
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,572
<font color="#ffff80">See you next week.
Thank you very much, guys. Thank you.</font>

519
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,657
<font color="#ffff80">Woo.</font>

520
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,868
<font color="#ffff80">Ah.</font>

521
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,705
<font color="#ffff80">- I love this.
- Hey.</font>

522
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,833
<font color="#ffff80">I just wanted to say sorry
for being rude to you.</font>

523
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,086
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, you were.
You were very rude to me.</font>

524
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,839
<font color="#ffff80">You were kind of a pig to me,
actually, a rude pig.</font>

525
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:21,720
<font color="#ffff80">I'm kidding with you. God!
My name is Bejan, nice to meet you.</font>

526
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,972
<font color="#ffff80">- I'm Bruce.
- Bruce, hi.</font>

527
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,099
<font color="#ffff80">Bejan is actually my middle name.</font>

528
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,310
<font color="#ffff80">My full name is
Ali Reza Bejan Ahmadzadeh.</font>

529
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,437
<font color="#ffff80">Wow, a bit of a mouthful, innit?</font>

530
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,231
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. Bejan means hero.</font>

531
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,317
<font color="#ffff80">- Ah, that's nice.
- What does Bruce mean?</font>

532
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,823
<font color="#ffff80">Uh, Bruce, I think it comes from
the old Saxon meaning bush or hedge.</font>

533
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,825
<font color="#ffff80">Mm.</font>

534
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,286
<font color="#ffff80">We're all hitting the club
if you want to...</font>

535
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,581
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh, right.
- Boteco. It's hot shit.</font>

536
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:55,587
<font color="#ffff80">The dance floor, fully programmable
LED ester and black glass.</font>

537
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,881
<font color="#ffff80">- Wow. Semi-sprung?
- Yes, please.</font>

538
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,509
<font color="#ffff80">Mm, it would be like dancing
on a glass pillow.</font>

539
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,597
<font color="#ffff80">- You want to come? Take my number.
- I don't know.</font>

540
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,349
<font color="#ffff80">- You don't want to take my number?
- Not your number.</font>

541
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,142
<font color="#ffff80">You don't have to take my number
if you don't want it.</font>

542
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,519
<font color="#ffff80">I can walk in the other direction.
Plenty of other people to speak to.</font>

543
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,104
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sure one of them
want my number.</font>

544
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,273
<font color="#ffff80">- I didn't mean that.
- I'm fucking with you again!</font>

545
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,568
<font color="#ffff80">Get a sense of humour,
for God's sake! Wait there.</font>

546
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,823
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to give you
my direct number, OK?</font>

547
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:29,955
<font color="#ffff80">You call me on this
any time between 5:30 and quarter to six.</font>

548
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,707
<font color="#ffff80">That's a.m.
I'm a morning person.</font>

549
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,877
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you.</font>

550
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,257
<font color="#ffff80">- I tracked down Ron Parfitt.
- Oh, my God. What's he like?</font>

551
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,551
<font color="#ffff80">Exactly the same.
Just a horrible, grumpy, old bastard.</font>

552
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,263
<font color="#ffff80">Holy shit, Bruce.
This is huge.</font>

553
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,392
<font color="#ffff80">Is this for her?</font>

554
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,812
<font color="#ffff80">"Is this for her?"
Yes, it's for her.</font>

555
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,190
<font color="#ffff80">I'm thinking about asking her
to maybe dance with me.</font>

556
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,734
<font color="#ffff80">That sounds good,
so what happens next?</font>

557
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,861
<font color="#ffff80">- I'm just going go ask her.
- Wrong.</font>

558
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,322
<font color="#ffff80">No, no, no. You don't go straight in
with a big romantic gesture</font>

559
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,991
<font color="#ffff80">until you've done the groundwork.</font>

560
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,410
<font color="#ffff80">She's like a blank wall, Bruce.</font>

561
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,911
<font color="#ffff80">Firstly,
you have to apply the primer,</font>

562
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,705
<font color="#ffff80">then the undercoat
and then you go in with the emulsion.</font>

563
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,749
<font color="#ffff80">What kind of wall?
It might not need primer.</font>

564
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,209
<font color="#ffff80">I'm serious, Bruce.</font>

565
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,212
<font color="#ffff80">You can't go and ask her out
until you've done the undercoat.</font>

566
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,895
<font color="#ffff80">Fantastic, that's just tremendous.
Hey, Bruce.</font>

567
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,647
<font color="#ffff80">- Hey.
- Oh, hey, man.</font>

568
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,649
<font color="#ffff80">You look nice, but you know what?</font>

569
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,903
<font color="#ffff80">I'm already, er,
sorted with a phone plan.</font>

570
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,949
<font color="#ffff80">Bruce, you need your shoes otherwise
you're gonna miss out on this frame.</font>

571
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,994
<font color="#ffff80">- Good luck.
- All right, here we go.</font>

572
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,496
<font color="#ffff80">Phone shop.</font>

573
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,582
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh.
- Oh.</font>

574
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,959
<font color="#ffff80">Here comes the dirty thunder.</font>

575
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,422
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, the Gaelic gale.</font>

576
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,884
<font color="#ffff80">- Huh? I hit seven, I think.
- Move over.</font>

577
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,472
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

578
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,015
<font color="#ffff80">- Never mind.
- Pump it up.</font>

579
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,643
<font color="#ffff80">Amazing. Ah.</font>

580
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,146
<font color="#ffff80">Can I just give you
a little bit of constructive feedback?</font>

581
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,191
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah, please do.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

582
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,945
<font color="#ffff80">Well, uh,
I've noticed a little flaw in your game.</font>

583
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,863
<font color="#ffff80">OK, listen,
I think I know what you're going to say.</font>

584
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,949
<font color="#ffff80">This probably is about me</font>

585
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,869
<font color="#ffff80">continually rolling the balls
into the recess gutters, isn't it?</font>

586
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,831
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes, it is.
- Yeah. I think...</font>

587
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,291
<font color="#ffff80">I think it's the only weakness
in my game, you know?</font>

588
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,087
<font color="#ffff80">It is. It is the only weakness,
but, uh, it's a pretty major one.</font>

589
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,464
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah, it's a biggy.
- So let's deal with it.</font>

590
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,217
<font color="#ffff80">Here, I'll show you. Come on.</font>

591
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,220
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! Sumba, bunga, wunga!</font>

592
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,597
<font color="#ffff80">Did you see that?</font>

593
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,684
<font color="#ffff80">So you put your fingers
in the holes.</font>

594
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,604
<font color="#ffff80">No. No, no, no, no.
No innuendo, OK?</font>

595
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,816
<font color="#ffff80">The first rule of bowling is
there's holes and there's balls</font>

596
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,818
<font color="#ffff80">and we're all adults.
We just have to get over it.</font>

597
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,320
<font color="#ffff80">- Let's bowl.
- Yup.</font>

598
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,156
<font color="#ffff80">Hold your ball like a baby.</font>

599
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,366
<font color="#ffff80">- Throw it like a rocket.
- Yup.</font>

600
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,619
<font color="#ffff80">Hold it like a baby.
Throw it like a rocket, yeah?</font>

601
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,621
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

602
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,251
<font color="#ffff80">Hold it like a baby
and then I throw it like a rocket.</font>

603
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,838
<font color="#ffff80">I hold it like a baby
and then I throw it like a rocket.</font>

604
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,883
<font color="#ffff80">Hold it like a baby
and then I throw it like a rocket.</font>

605
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,137
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

606
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,930
<font color="#ffff80">I'm calling social services.</font>

607
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,932
<font color="#ffff80">You're calling social services?</font>

608
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,560
<font color="#ffff80">Why? Has he been
within 100 metres of a school?</font>

609
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,567
<font color="#ffff80">- You're up, Jules.
- Oh.</font>

610
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,903
<font color="#ffff80">Go on, Julio, if that's your name.</font>

611
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,072
<font color="#ffff80">Listen, you just focus
on your baby rocket big shot.</font>

612
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,908
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

613
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,203
<font color="#ffff80">All right. Let's do this.</font>

614
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,121
<font color="#ffff80">Come on, baby ball.</font>

615
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,374
<font color="#ffff80">- I just need one strike.
- Oh, wow.</font>

616
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,044
<font color="#ffff80">Have you seen the pants
on that guy over there?</font>

617
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,798
<font color="#ffff80">- Go on.
- Here we go.</font>

618
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,220
<font color="#ffff80">Did you end up keeping the shoes
or you gave them back or?</font>

619
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,182
<font color="#ffff80">- No, I gave them back.
- I thought they really suited you.</font>

620
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,184
<font color="#ffff80">Ah, do you mind
if I just put my seat back?</font>

621
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,895
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh, there's not much room here.
- It's just I've got such long legs.</font>

622
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,813
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! That's better.</font>

623
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:11,152
<font color="#ffff80">Bruce, we'll drop you off first.
All that exercise, you must be exhausted.</font>

624
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,745
<font color="#ffff80">- Bye, Bruce.
- See you later, Brucie.</font>

625
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,082
<font color="#ffff80">Loving the pad.
Let's get this party started.</font>

626
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,608
<font color="#ffff80">Bruce!</font>

627
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,860
<font color="#ffff80">Bruce!</font>

628
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,321
<font color="#ffff80">- Bruce!
- Hey, shut up.</font>

629
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,116
<font color="#ffff80">My God, I thought it was number 4
and then I thought it's number 14</font>

630
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,076
<font color="#ffff80">and then I thought it was number 40
and then I went to 14</font>

631
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,786
<font color="#ffff80">and then I went to 40,
but there isn't a 40.</font>

632
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,372
<font color="#ffff80">- How are you doing?
- I'm good. Hello.</font>

633
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,667
<font color="#ffff80">- One more for me.
- You want a drink?</font>

634
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,294
<font color="#ffff80">- Do you have any Fanta?
- I do not.</font>

635
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,964
<font color="#ffff80">That's a shame, because I do!</font>

636
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,842
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh. Wow. I'll get glasses.</font>

637
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,137
<font color="#ffff80">No, no, no, it's not a wedding.
You drink from the bottle.</font>

638
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,389
<font color="#ffff80">- Erm... thank you.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

639
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,058
<font color="#ffff80">- Salamati.
- Ah, salamati.</font>

640
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,104
<font color="#ffff80">- Mm.
- Mm. Urgh, it's flat.</font>

641
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,065
<font color="#ffff80">It's not flat. It's still.
It's still Fanta.</font>

642
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,192
<font color="#ffff80">- They don't do still Fanta.
- They don't do still Fanta.</font>

643
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,862
<font color="#ffff80">I have to make my own. You just open
the bottle. Put it on the balcony.</font>

644
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,281
<font color="#ffff80">Two days later,
boom, shake the room, yes please.</font>

645
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,325
<font color="#ffff80">- Ha.
- Mm.</font>

646
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,202
<font color="#ffff80">Are you ready?
Do you want to go? Let's go.</font>

647
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,330
<font color="#ffff80">You're going like this?</font>

648
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,084
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. What's the matter with this?</font>

649
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,836
<font color="#ffff80">Well...</font>

650
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,839
<font color="#ffff80">...everything</font>

<font color="#ffff80">- We should do it again.
- Yeah, maybe.</font>

781
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,485
<font color="#ffff80">What's erm...
What's with the tape?</font>

782
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,571
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, shoot.</font>

783
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,783
<font color="#ffff80">You caught me.
Er, it's for your car.</font>

784
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,662
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God.
You made an inlay.</font>

785
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,956
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, I did.</font>

786
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,875
<font color="#ffff80">Nobody makes inlays anymore.</font>

787
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,587
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, it's just a silly,
little touch I thought you'd like.</font>

788
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,715
<font color="#ffff80">That's really... That's really nice.</font>

789
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,134
<font color="#ffff80">Now I feel like
I have to get you something.</font>

790
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,678
<font color="#ffff80">That would be so cute.</font>

791
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,847
<font color="#ffff80">That's really nice. Thank you.</font>

792
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,027
<font color="#ffff80">- How was your bubble bath?
- Ha-ha!</font>

793
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,574
<font color="#ffff80">- Was it rejuvenating?
- That's classic, Gary, classic.</font>

794
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,035

795
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,371

I'm addicted to the craic,</font>

796
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,831
<font color="#ffff80">but right now
I just want to get my head down</font>

797
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,960
<font color="#ffff80">and plough my way
through this bucket of balls, all right?</font>

798
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,462
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah?</font>

799
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,631
<font color="#ffff80">I think we've got a new heading
for our weekly roundup.</font>

- Me, nil. Brucie?</font>

803
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,644
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck it.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Oh, dear. What's wrong with her?</font>

805
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,441
<font color="#ffff80">Come on, Bruce. Who was he?</font>

806
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,777
<font color="#ffff80">- What are you hiding from us?
- Nothing.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Aw.</font>

808

irritate your sensitive skin?</font>

809
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,371
<font color="#ffff80">- Fuck off.
- Oh!</font>

810
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,707
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, are you all right, Gary? Gary?</font>

811
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,959
<font color="#ffff80">- I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine mate.</font>

812

- Hey, hey, hey. Don't go.</font>

813

the trusty arsehole wedge.</font>

- Help me!</font>

- Yes.</font>

833
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,444
<font color="#ffff80">Why?</font>

834
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,114
<font color="#ffff80">I was doing it for that girl.</font>

835
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,618
<font color="#ffff80">- What girl?
- The... the butterfly.</font>

836
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,661
<font color="#ffff80">The eponymous butterfly</font>

837
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,373
<font color="#ffff80">from the
"Tale of the Butterfly and the Parsnip".</font>

838

- Oh.</font>

839
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,172
<font color="#ffff80">What, you thought
the parsnip would win the butterfly</font>

840
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,341
<font color="#ffff80">by doing
a bit of tiny shoe shuffle?</font>

841
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,636
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. I know. It's stupid, isn't it?</font>

842
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,848
<font color="#ffff80">And then there's Drew.
Do you remember Drew?</font>

843
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,184
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, yes, that horse's arse.</font>

844
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,770
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. Well, he likes her, too.</font>

845
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,816
<font color="#ffff80">He might be a horse's arse,
but he's better at all this than I am so...</font>

846
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,819
<font color="#ffff80">I might just let him
get on with it.</font>

847
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,573
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, mate, just...
It's probably for the best.</font>

848
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,701
<font color="#ffff80">Just... just forget about her, eh?</font>

849
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,763
<font color="#ffff80">He's back.</font>

850
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,559
<font color="#ffff80">Jesus Christ, Ron.
You fuckin' made me jump.</font>

851
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,102
<font color="#ffff80">Who is she, Bruce?</font>

852
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,146
<font color="#ffff80">Mm?</font>

853
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:27,985
<font color="#ffff80">The girl in the club the other night,
she's the one, hm?</font>

854
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,487
<font color="#ffff80">- It doesn't matter.
- No, of course, it doesn't matter.</font>

855
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,240
<font color="#ffff80">That's why you've got a face
like a dropped scone.</font>

856
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,535
<font color="#ffff80">It's just stupid.
I wanted to make her fall in love with me.</font>

857
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:40,330
<font color="#ffff80">Mm... and then along comes
this other fella - tall, better looking...</font>

858
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,000
<font color="#ffff80">Let's face it.
His dick couldn't be any smaller.</font>

859
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:49,548
<font color="#ffff80">That's why you came back.
La doña, the woman.</font>

860
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,551
<font color="#ffff80">It's salsa, Ron.</font>

861
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,595
<font color="#ffff80">- It's always about a woman.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

862
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,222
<font color="#ffff80">I just wanted you
to make me good enough for her.</font>

863
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,183
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't you just keep standing
in front of that mirror</font>

864
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,809
<font color="#ffff80">and do what you did
in the club the other night?</font>

865
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,437
<font color="#ffff80">- Do me a favour and do that.
- What?</font>

866
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,607
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, come on. You know what you did.
You felt it.</font>

867
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,652
<font color="#ffff80">- You want me to do it now?
- Come on. It's just us girls, Brucie.</font>

868
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,155
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to.</font>

869
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,115
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh, he bottles it.
- Bottles?</font>

870
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,326
<font color="#ffff80">What a surprise.</font>

871
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,247
<font color="#ffff80">- Where are you going?
- Come on. We got work to do.</font>

872
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,415
<font color="#ffff80">What kind of work?</font>

873
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,543
<font color="#ffff80">We're going to get shit-faced
and play board games.</font>

874
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,508
<font color="#ffff80">- Eye piece for one eye?
- Monocle.</font>

875
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,009
<font color="#ffff80">Mm.</font>

876
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,261
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry, why are we doing this again?</font>

877
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,056
<font color="#ffff80">- Sits on top of a Christmas tree?
- A fairy.</font>

878
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,683
<font color="#ffff80">No, a star.</font>

879
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,894
<font color="#ffff80">- That's time.
- Oh, all right.</font>

880
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,271
<font color="#ffff80">- That's for you.
- Go.</font>

881
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:51,485
<font color="#ffff80">OK, they ate this much to God's
annoyance in the Garden of Eden.</font>

882
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,445
<font color="#ffff80">- Apple.
- Apple is correct.</font>

883
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,948
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, OK, he... Um, he's a an actor.</font>

884
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,950
<font color="#ffff80">- He does films.
- It's a purple one.</font>

885
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,244
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah and?
- You have to do an impression.</font>

886
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,996
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not doing an impression.</font>

887
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,123
<font color="#ffff80">- Well, you have to.
- No.</font>

888
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,251
<font color="#ffff80">- Do the impression, Bruce.
- No, I can't.</font>

889
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,337
<font color="#ffff80">- Just do the impression.
- No, I'm not doing an impression.</font>

890
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,715
<font color="#ffff80">- What are you so scared of, eh?
- I'm not.</font>

891
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,301
<font color="#ffff80">- Just do the impression, then.
- No, I'm not doing...</font>

892
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,011
<font color="#ffff80">Why are you so afraid
of what people might think?</font>

893
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,972
<font color="#ffff80">Why can't you put yourself
out there?</font>

894
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,682
<font color="#ffff80">- I mean...
- So do the impression.</font>

895
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,767
<font color="#ffff80">- It's almost time.
- Do the impression.</font>

896
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,979
<font color="#ffff80">- That's it. Time.
- Do the fucking impression!</font>

897
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,983
<font color="#ffff80">- Why are you always shouting at me?
- Because you fucking quit on me.</font>

898
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,860
<font color="#ffff80">- I did not quit.
- You had the world at your feet.</font>

899
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,280
<font color="#ffff80">- I did not quit.
- And you walked away, didn't you?</font>

900
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,781
<font color="#ffff80">- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.</font>

901
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,367
<font color="#ffff80">You keep swanning back in here
and swanning out again.</font>

902
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,620
<font color="#ffff80">- Swanning back in...
- They broke me. All right?</font>

903
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,748
<font color="#ffff80">If you want to know, the night
of the competition, they broke me.</font>

904
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,127
<font color="#ffff80">A gang of kids, bullies, they just...
they broke it out of me.</font>

905
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:54,131
<font color="#ffff80">- I didn't want to do it anymore!
- Some big boys gave you a shoeing.</font>

906
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,175
<font color="#ffff80">You're a male dancer.
Do you think I never took any shit?</font>

907
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,969
<font color="#ffff80">So what are you going
to do about it, eh?</font>

908
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,972
<font color="#ffff80">Are you going to hide away,
or maybe crawl under your duvet</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Then what?</font>

912
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,735
<font color="#ffff80">- Then what?

in front of the mirror?</font>

920

921
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,424
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. That is time.</font>

922
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,552
<font color="#ffff80">Get the shoulders. Loosen up.</font>

not a fucking heron.</font>

927
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,526
<font color="#ffff80">It is an eagle.</font>

928
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,030
<font color="#ffff80">OK, try again. Legs of a stallion.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Go.</font>

931
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,960

<font color="#ffff80">- Mm.
- All right.</font>

935
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,069
<font color="#ffff80">Think about it all the time.</font>

936
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,158
<font color="#ffff80">Now, I know you're all waiting
for this particular model,</font>

937
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,994

better lathe than never.</font>

- What?</font>

Someone's coming.</font>

945

<font color="#ffff80">Whoa, whoa!
Room for a small one?</font>

946
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,357
<font color="#ffff80">I have a question for you.</font>

947
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,318
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I love questions.</font>

948
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,612
<font color="#ffff80">So you like Latin music, huh?</font>

949
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,575
<font color="#ffff80">- The mix tape.
- Oh, right, the mix, yes.</font>

950
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:13,413
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, I am a Latino boy
big time, I am, music wise.</font>

951
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,458
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks for listening to that.
It was a real labour of love for me.</font>

952
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:20,796
<font color="#ffff80">That track
at the end of side one, oh...</font>

953
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:25,050
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, shoot, that's the...
That's my favourite track.</font>

954
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,552
<font color="#ffff80">- Isn't it just so er... tracky?
- It's so...</font>

955
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:31,890
<font color="#ffff80">And, er, it's the best song
that you could put at the end of side one</font>

956
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,684
<font color="#ffff80">- on a mix tape, like that.
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

957
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:39,523
<font color="#ffff80">You know what's weird
is whenever I listen to that track,</font>

958
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:43,026
<font color="#ffff80">I like to imagine myself
just lying in front of a log fire,</font>

959
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,780
<font color="#ffff80">just with a glass of... tequila,</font>

960
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,324
<font color="#ffff80">just chewing on a chimichanga,
you know?</font>

961
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,244
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, hey.</font>

962
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:56,832
<font color="#ffff80">That pitch that you and Bruce did,
you guys aced it, bam, sold.</font>

963
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,251
<font color="#ffff80">Shut the front door. You're kidding.</font>

964
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,461
<font color="#ffff80">Stop that train.
No, I'm not.</font>

965
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,713
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not.</font>

966
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,091
<font color="#ffff80">We should get together
and celebrate.</font>

967
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,759
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes, we should.
- My place.</font>

968
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,261
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes.
- Take-out.</font>

969
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,346
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes.
- Invite Bruce and Helen.</font>

970
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,307
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

971
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,143
<font color="#ffff80">We should absolutely do that.</font>

972
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,479
<font color="#ffff80">- Cool, so you'll tell them.
- Yeah.</font>

973
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,648
<font color="#ffff80">- Great.
- Of course. I'll totes tell them.</font>

974
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,109
<font color="#ffff80">You can totally trust me to do that.</font>

975
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,195
<font color="#ffff80">That's not a problem.</font>

976
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:33,577
<font color="#ffff80">- Hey. What are you hiding?
- Nothing.</font>

977
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,788
<font color="#ffff80">- What are you hiding?
- Behold.</font>

978
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,457
<font color="#ffff80">Santo Vito.</font>

979
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,920
<font color="#ffff80">What?
It's just another salsa night. So what?</font>

980
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,257
<font color="#ffff80">So what?
Look at it squashy chops.</font>

981
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,926
<font color="#ffff80">It's a competition. Sorry.</font>

982
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:55,223
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you see?
This is your time, Bruce.</font>

983
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,350
<font color="#ffff80">This is the Goonie time.</font>

984
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,936
<font color="#ffff80">Do you know about the Goonie time?</font>

985
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:04,065
<font color="#ffff80">Of course I know about the Goonie time.
My watch runs on Goonie time.</font>

986
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:07,611
<font color="#ffff80">So then you know
that it's their time up there,</font>

987
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,529
<font color="#ffff80">but it's our time down here.</font>

988
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,284
<font color="#ffff80">You can do this, Bruce.
You can win this mother-funky</font>

989
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,329
<font color="#ffff80">and you can show the world
what you're really made of.</font>

990
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,123
<font color="#ffff80">Think about it.
What have we go to lose?</font>

991
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,794
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, I mean, I suppose I could.</font>

992
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,131
<font color="#ffff80">Bruce, we Persians have a saying.</font>

993
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,597
<font color="#ffff80">- I... I don't really speak Farsi.
- If you want to do something do it.</font>

994
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,724
<font color="#ffff80">If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.</font>

995
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,855
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to be late for my ball wax.
I'll call you later.</font>

996
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,440
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah, sure.
- OK, bye.</font>

997
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,822
<font color="#ffff80">I can still see you there.</font>

998
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,700
<font color="#ffff80">- See you.
- See you later.</font>

999
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:01,706
<font color="#ffff80">Hello.
One, two, three, four, five. Yes.</font>

1000
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,459
<font color="#ffff80">- You win.
- Finally. Finally.</font>

1001
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,212
<font color="#ffff80">Now, you know what you get
for first prize, you lucky prick.</font>

1002
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,339
<font color="#ffff80">- I dread to think.
- You get one of these.</font>

1003
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,341
<font color="#ffff80">- And there it is.
- And...</font>

1004
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,845
<font color="#ffff80">two of these.</font>

1005
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:23,061
<font color="#ffff80">I just thought you might want
an old pair of shitty shoes from the '80s.</font>

1006
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,105
<font color="#ffff80">One careful owner.</font>

1007
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,360
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks, Ron.</font>

1008
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,363
<font color="#ffff80">You're not going to try
and finger me now, are you?</font>

1009
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,616
<font color="#ffff80">- You want me to try and finger you?
- You're ready.</font>

1010
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,619
<font color="#ffff80">You... are free.</font>

1011
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,581
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to ask her
to this thing tomorrow night</font>

1012
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,751
<font color="#ffff80">and I would be honoured
if you would come and watch us.</font>

1013
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,671
<font color="#ffff80">Ah, I'll have to check my diary.</font>

1014
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,214
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you.</font>

1015
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,259
<font color="#ffff80">Look at them.</font>

1016
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,428
<font color="#ffff80">- They're so soft
- Mm.</font>

1017
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,641
<font color="#ffff80">Don't... Don't do that.</font>

1018
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,696
<font color="#ffff80">Come on.</font>

1019
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,622
<font color="#ffff80">She's not at work today.</font>

1020
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,666
<font color="#ffff80">'Fine, so do it tomorrow.'</font>

1021
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:31,463
<font color="#ffff80">No, I can't. It is tonight, all right?
I have to do it tonight.</font>

1022
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,715
<font color="#ffff80">In that case,
you are a tiny bit fucked.</font>

1023
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,426
<font color="#ffff80">Sam, please,
I really need you to just help me.</font>

1024
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,387
<font color="#ffff80">OK, do exactly as I say
and do not deviate.</font>

1025
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:42,390
<font color="#ffff80">You go home, you shower,
you shave, you put on something nice.</font>

1026
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,476
<font color="#ffff80">I'm thinking powder blue,
shirt not trousers.</font>

1027
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,603
<font color="#ffff80">Do not put on powder blue trousers.</font>

1028
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,105
<font color="#ffff80">Then you get a taxi to her house.
Someone will know where she lives.</font>

1029
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,191
<font color="#ffff80">You knock on her door.
You knock her off her feet</font>

1030
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,734
<font color="#ffff80">with your confident suggestion
of a night out.</font>

1031
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,487
<font color="#ffff80">She immediately says yes,
then you whisk her off to the club.</font>

1032
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,614
<font color="#ffff80">You dance the competition.
You win the competition.</font>

1033
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,616
<font color="#ffff80">We all get shit-faced,
then we all go home, got it?</font>

1034
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,743
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks, Sam.</font>

1035
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,749
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, God, I'm good.</font>

1036
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:18,593
<font color="#ffff80">God, it's so busy in here.
I think I'll use this one.</font>

1037
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,845
<font color="#ffff80">- All right, ball bag.
- Stupid.</font>

1038
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:24,099
<font color="#ffff80">Just finishing off
a little text to Julie-Jules.</font>

1039
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,434
<font color="#ffff80">I told you that
she gave me her mobile number, right?</font>

1040
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,061
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, a few times.</font>

1041
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:31,314
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh, by the way,
thanks for that mixed tape.</font>

1042
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,316
<font color="#ffff80">That was a hit.</font>

1043
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,111
<font color="#ffff80">- You gave it to her?
- Oh, yeah, she bloody loved it.</font>

1044
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,321
<font color="#ffff80">Thought it was very sweet.</font>

1045
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,324
<font color="#ffff80">I think I'm going to put it on
when we seal the deal for the first time.</font>

1046
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,952
<font color="#ffff80">You know, a bit of sex-muzak,
set the mood.</font>

1047
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,079
<font color="#ffff80">Don't be jealous, big lad.</font>

1048
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,040
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sure she'll still have room in her life
for a fat best friend.</font>

1049
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:52,001
<font color="#ffff80">You don't know about me.</font>

1050
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,131
<font color="#ffff80">What don't I know?</font>

1051
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,298
<font color="#ffff80">I dance.</font>

1052
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,843
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry,
I thought you said that "I dance".</font>

1053
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,011
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, I did. I dance salsa.</font>

1054
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,474
<font color="#ffff80">- You dance salsa?
- Yeah, salsa.</font>

1055
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,937
<font color="#ffff80">I would fucking love to see that.</font>

1056
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,398
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe you will.
Maybe I'll dance you under the table.</font>

1057
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,402
<font color="#ffff80">What sort of table?</font>

1058
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,112
<font color="#ffff80">Any sort of table.</font>

1059
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,872
<font color="#ffff80">All right, bum flap,
let's settle this like men.</font>

1060
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,832
<font color="#ffff80">Winner takes Julia.</font>

1061
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:33,793
<font color="#ffff80">What about HR?</font>

1062
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,342
<font color="#ffff80">What happens at lunch stays at lunch.</font>

1063
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,706
<font color="#ffff80">Ow!</font>

1064
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,002
<font color="#ffff80">Your wrists are limp.</font>

1065
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,754
<font color="#ffff80">- Ooh!
- Your dick is limp.</font>

1066
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:23,218
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, sorry.</font>

1067
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:31,351
<font color="#ffff80">- You learn fast.
- I learn from the best. Julia.</font>

1068
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,646
<font color="#ffff80">Sweet, sweet,
rest-your-balls-on-my-chin, Julia.</font>

1069
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,481
<font color="#ffff80">- Smell that.
- No.</font>

1070
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,611
<font color="#ffff80">Did you just lick my pussy?</font>

1071
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,364
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah and you tasted like a nasty girl.</font>

1072
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,324
<font color="#ffff80">That's disgusting.</font>

1073
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:51,704
<font color="#ffff80">Wanker!</font>

1074
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:57,210
<font color="#ffff80">I'm wearing the wrong shoes
for this shit.</font>

1075
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,921
<font color="#ffff80">- What the fu...
- Coo-ee!</font>

1076
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,173
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you?</font>

1077
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,592
<font color="#ffff80">I thought you liked banter.</font>

1078
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,720
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, fuck off, Bruce. Fuck off.</font>

1079
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,355
<font color="#ffff80">- Ooh.
- What the... Big mistake.</font>

1080
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:19,524
<font color="#ffff80">That's Jessie the lezzie
from accounts' car.</font>

1081
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,202
<font color="#ffff80">Quick step for such meaty thighs.</font>

1082
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,587
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh, ooh, do you like that?</font>

1083
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:46,009
<font color="#ffff80">- Wait, no, don't lead me!
- Like a lady.</font>

1084
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,469
<font color="#ffff80">- This is wrong. You know it is.
- Like a lady.</font>

1085
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,222
<font color="#ffff80">- I'm a man. I'm a fully-grown man.
- Then prove it.</font>

1086
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:57,770
<font color="#ffff80">What is that?</font>

1087
01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,689
<font color="#ffff80">- That's my phone.
- No, no.</font>

1088
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:04,902
<font color="#ffff80">Huh?</font>

1089
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,745
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh! Oh, me blades!</font>

1090
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,669
<font color="#ffff80">Oh!</font>

1091
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,965
<font color="#ffff80">Whoo!</font>

1092
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:29,344
<font color="#ffff80">Like I said, any sort of table.</font>

1093
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,512
<font color="#ffff80">Fine, you win.</font>

1094
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,723
<font color="#ffff80">I can't do this every fucking lunch.</font>

1095
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,226
<font color="#ffff80">Doesn't mean
that she's going to pick you, Bruce.</font>

1096
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,687
<font color="#ffff80">She wouldn't pick you over me.
That's just bad maths.</font>

1097
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:42,231
<font color="#ffff80">- She's a clever girl.
- Probably right.</font>

1098
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,985
<font color="#ffff80">You're quite good-looking.
You've got lovely, long legs.</font>

1099
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,528
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah.
- Nice car.</font>

1100
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:50,239
<font color="#ffff80">- Great car.
- But there is something missing.</font>

1101
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,909
<font color="#ffff80">I have got something that you don't have.
Do you know what that is?</font>

1102
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,536
<font color="#ffff80">Type 2 diabetes.</font>

1103
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,455
<font color="#ffff80">Heart.</font>

1104
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,374
<font color="#ffff80">Corazón.</font>

1105
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:05,129
<font color="#ffff80">You know, I am Bruce Garret
and I am fucking salsa.</font>

1106
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,049
<font color="#ffff80">Get up, bum flap.</font>

1107
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,973
<font color="#ffff80">How can you take something so
seriously that's named after a dip?</font>

1108
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:55,388
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh, nice shirt.
- Thank you.</font>

1109
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,515
<font color="#ffff80">- Come in.
- No, wait, wait. Please.</font>

1110
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:04,772
<font color="#ffff80">I dance. I dance salsa
and there is this club called Santo Vito...</font>

1111
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:06,232
<font color="#ffff80">- Bruce.
- No, please</font>

1112
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:10,903
<font color="#ffff80">I can hardly breathe. I'm so nervous.
I'm hyperventilating.</font>

1113
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,156
<font color="#ffff80">I feel like I can see flies.</font>

1114
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,993
<font color="#ffff80">- I don't...
- Let me cut to the chase.</font>

1115
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,622
<font color="#ffff80">If you're not doing anything tonight,
I would love to take...</font>

1116
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:29,338
<font color="#ffff80">- Of course.
- Bruce?</font>

1117
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,675
<font color="#ffff80">- What's wrong, Bruce?
- Of course, this is...</font>

1118
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,804
<font color="#ffff80">- Bruce...
- I'm sorry.</font>

1119
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:41,350
<font color="#ffff80">What do you mean?
No, Bruce, what? Wait. Bruce.</font>

1120
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,854
<font color="#ffff80">Come back. Bruce?
Where are you go... Oh.</font>

1121
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,859
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my... Oh, my God.
What are you doing?</font>

1122
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,737
<font color="#ffff80">Come on. You know.</font>

1123
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:55,573
<font color="#ffff80">I know? What do I know?</font>

1124
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:59,535
<font color="#ffff80">Let's say we skip dinner
and go straight to pudding.</font>

1125
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:02,705
<font color="#ffff80">Are you kidding?</font>

1126
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:07,126
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. Yeah, totally kidding.</font>

1127
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,711
<font color="#ffff80">Just focus
on putting your pants back on.</font>

1128
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,839
<font color="#ffff80">OK, I'm not kidding.
Here's the thing. This is where I'm at.</font>

1129
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,425
<font color="#ffff80">I just want to be honest with you
because I think you deserve that.</font>

1130
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:15,927
<font color="#ffff80">I'm just going to say this.</font>

1131
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,304
<font color="#ffff80">I'm just going to blurt it out
before I lose my nerve.</font>

1132
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:23,184
<font color="#ffff80">- Oh, my God.
- Julia Matthews of America...</font>

1133
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:29,815
<font color="#ffff80">I would be honoured
if you would let me fuck you.</font>

1134
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,611
<font color="#ffff80">- Really?
- I just want to...</font>

1135
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,947
<font color="#ffff80">I just want to...
I just want to do it.</font>

1136
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,784
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God.</font>

1137
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,078
<font color="#ffff80">Just get up and just get out, please.</font>

1138
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,913
<font color="#ffff80">- What?
- Just get out.</font>

1139
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,706
<font color="#ffff80">Wait. Is this banter?</font>

1140
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:48,251
<font color="#ffff80">I can't believe
that you just dropped trou</font>

1141
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,169
<font color="#ffff80">and propositioned your boss.</font>

1142
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,755
<font color="#ffff80">- Did you really just do that?
- It was an act of boldness.</font>

1143
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:56,425
<font color="#ffff80">Wait, did you not tell Bruce
about tonight, or Helen?</font>

1144
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,303
<font color="#ffff80">- Did I tell Bruce and Helen?
- Was this all part of your plan?</font>

1145
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:03,558
<font color="#ffff80">I can't... I might have.
I don't think I mentioned it.</font>

1146
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:06,519
<font color="#ffff80">All right,
this conversation is definitely over.</font>

1147
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,355
<font color="#ffff80">Just please
take your little Italian shoes</font>

1148
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,691
<font color="#ffff80">and your pudding and just get out.</font>

1149
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,360
<font color="#ffff80">Can I just say I think
that you are making a big mistake?</font>

1150
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,322
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to have you transferred
to plastic mouldings on Monday.</font>

1151
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:21,242
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, that's bullshit!
That's just a bad managerial...</font>

1152
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:24,704
<font color="#ffff80">You know what?
FYI I didn't make that shitty mix tape.</font>

1153
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,790
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

1154
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,834
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, Julia.</font>

1155
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,879
<font color="#ffff80">I said some things,
which may now seem foolish.</font>

1156
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:38,926
<font color="#ffff80">OK, I'm... I'm going to be honest.
My granny died.</font>

1157
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:41,762
<font color="#ffff80">I swear to God, Drew,
if you're still there in 15 seconds,</font>

1158
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:45,057
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to take your pudding
and shove it right up your ass.</font>

1159
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,143
<font color="#ffff80">Uh...</font>

1160
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,827
<font color="#ffff80">Bruce.</font>

1161
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:16,756
<font color="#ffff80">Welcome tonight to the
Santo Vito salsa espectáculo. Let's go!</font>

1162
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:30,061
<font color="#ffff80">We're about an hour away
from the main competition event.</font>

1163
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,396
<font color="#ffff80">You like it?</font>

1164
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:33,939
<font color="#ffff80">Not really my thing.</font>

1165
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,610
<font color="#ffff80">How do you know
you don't like it unless you try it?</font>

1166
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,987
<font color="#ffff80">A lot of things
I haven't tried, mate.</font>

1167
