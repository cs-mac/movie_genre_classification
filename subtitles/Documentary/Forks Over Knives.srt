1
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:26,627
The average American now
carries 23 extra pounds.

2
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,068
Heart disease and stroke
will claim the lives

3
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,644
of 460,000 American women.

4
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,773
69 grams of fat.

5
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:35,961
You could actually save
12 grams of the fat

6
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,313
and half the calories

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,577
if you simply ate an
entire stick of butter.

8
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:42,100
We're talking about diabetes

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,246
and hypertension and bone
diseases, osteoporosis.

10
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:48,425
Prostate cancer is now
the most common cancer

11
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:49,599
in American men.

12
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:53,233
Doctors say we really need to eat
less red and processed meat.

13
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,714
And arterial
sclerosis and cancer

14
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,104
and autoimmune disease.

15
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,836
We have unprecedented amount of
type 2 diabetes in our children,

16
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:01,479
and we're starting
to see hypertension

17
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:04,091
in our children in
grammar school.

18
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:08,613
In case you're wondering,
2,120 calories.

19
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,714
Clearly the Western
diet is taking a toll.

20
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,396
This should serve
as a wake-up call.

21
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,002
We have a growing problem,

22
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:17,687
and the ones who are
growing are us.

23
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:23,753
Food! It's central to our
lives and traditions.

24
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:27,357
Every special occasion seems
to involve food and feasting.

25
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:29,808
But could some of
these same foods,

26
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:32,663
including several that we think
are good for our health,

27
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:36,187
also be causing many of our
most serious health problems?

28
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:40,191
Indeed, we're facing a
massive health crisis.

29
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:44,195
No less than 40% of
Americans today are obese,

30
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:48,439
and about half of us are taking
some form of prescription drug.

31
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,965
The best known statin
drug, Lipitor,

32
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,650
is the most prescribed
drug ever in the world.

33
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:56,795
Almost one in five
American four-year-olds

34
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:58,797
are now considered to be obese.

35
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:01,800
Though Mexican-Americans and
African-American children

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,302
are still more likely
to be overweight.

37
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:07,229
This could be the first
generation of children

38
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,808
in the United States that
lives less than its parents.

39
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:13,812
We spend 2.2 trillion dollars
a year on health care,

40
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:18,316
over five times more
than the defense budget.

41
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:20,819
In fact, we pay more per
person for health care

42
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,321
than any industrialized
country in the world,

43
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,824
yet we're sicker than ever.

44
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,826
You see, there's no money
in healthy people,

45
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:29,828
and there's no money
in dead people.

46
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:33,331
The money is in the middle:
People who are alive, sort of,

47
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,834
but with one or more
chronic conditions.

48
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:38,336
Obesity, diabetes,
heart disease,

49
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,492
high blood pressure

50
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:42,588
are all diet-related
health issues

51
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:49,032
that cost this country more
than $120 billion each year.

52
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,349
Every minute, a person in the U.S.

53
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:53,871
is killed by heart disease.

54
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:57,355
1500 people a day
die from cancer.

55
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,615
Combined, these
two diseases kill

56
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:02,861
over 1 million
Americans every year.

57
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,864
Cases of diabetes
are skyrocketing,

58
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,366
particularly among our
younger population.

59
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,598
- Diabetes.
- Diabetes.

60
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:11,369
Life-threatening diabetes.

61
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,447
One out of three people
born in the U.S. today

62
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:16,875
will develop this crippling
condition during their lifetime.

63
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,877
Millions of others suffer

64
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:21,379
from a host of
degenerative diseases.

65
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:24,382
Millions more of us are
so stimulated by sugar,

66
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,384
coffee, and energy drinks

67
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:29,387
that we've masked our
chronic fatigue.

68
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,389
But could there be
a single solution

69
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,891
to all of these problems?

70
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:36,895
A solution so comprehensive,
yet so straightforward,

71
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:39,071
that it's mind-boggling
that more of us

72
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:40,899
haven't taken it seriously?

73
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,879
Someone has to stand up
and say that the answer

74
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,644
isn't another pill.

75
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:47,906
The answer is spinach.

76
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,352
A growing number of
researchers claim

77
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:52,935
that if we eliminate,
or greatly reduce,

78
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:55,534
refined, processed, and
animal-based foods,

79
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:58,886
we can prevent and, in
certain cases, even reverse

80
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:01,920
several of our worst diseases.

81
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,045
They say all we need to do
is adopt a whole foods,

82
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:06,424
plant-based diet.

83
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:09,447
It sounds almost too
simple to be true.

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,769
You might not expect
someone like me

85
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,444
to explore the connection
between diet and disease.

86
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:31,449
On my way over, I drank
these two Red Bulls.

87
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,792
I also had a 12-ounce Coke

88
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:37,187
and another half of
a 12-ounce Coke.

89
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,456
I haven't always lived

90
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:39,958
the healthiest lifestyle.

91
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:42,961
And I've eaten more than
my share of fast food.

92
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:45,751
But as part of my effort to
learn more about the link

93
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:46,965
between food and health,

94
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:49,860
I visited two physicians
in Los Angeles,

95
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:52,971
Dr. Matt Lederman and
Dr. Alona Pulde.

96
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:53,972
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

97
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,473
- Lee Fulkerson.
- Lee, nice to meet you.

98
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:56,474
Nice to meet you too.

99
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:57,475
This is Dr. Pulde.

100
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,478
Hi, Dr. Pulde.
Pleasure to meet you too.

101
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:01,980
Both are M.Ds.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,468
Dr. Lederman was trained
in internal medicine

103
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:06,734
and Dr. Pulde in family practice.

104
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:09,988
They incorporate a whole
plant foods nutrition plan

105
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,730
into the treatment
of their patients.

106
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,764
So let's get started on that,

107
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:15,027
and then we'll do some talking.

108
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,386
142/82.

109
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,872
I found out a lot
more than I expected.

110
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:20,699
Like a lot of Americans,

111
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,802
I thought my health
was pretty good.

112
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,003
I had no major diseases
that I knew of.

113
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:28,317
But I hadn't had a thorough
check-up in a while,

114
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,117
so I decided to get one.

115
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,614
When Dr. Lederman gave
me the results,

116
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,300
it was a real wake-up call.

117
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:39,017
I gotta say I'm kinda shocked.

118
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:42,154
I'm really worried about
my blood work numbers.

119
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:46,519
240 and 241 for my cholesterol

120
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,267
is way higher than
it's ever been.

121
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:50,528
I got this six number.

122
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:54,032
That, to me, is the most
worrying number I got.

123
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,779
The six number was the result

124
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,036
of something called a CRP test,

125
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:01,539
which measures the inflammation
in my heart and blood vessels.

126
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:05,043
This put me in the high-risk
category for a heart attack.

127
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,046
So I committed to a
12-week nutrition program

128
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,068
under Dr. Lederman's supervision.

129
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,489
The plan was to treat
my health problems

130
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,316
by eating a whole foods,
plant-based diet.

131
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:25,854
The idea of using nutrition

132
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:28,066
to promote good health
is nothing new.

133
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:29,961
Indeed, Hippocrates,

134
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:32,353
the ancient Greek father
of Western medicine,

135
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:36,992
said, "let food be thy medicine,"
over 2,000 years ago.

136
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:39,415
Yet it wasn't until
more recently

137
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,484
that the science behind
this observation

138
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,739
was systematically
probed and applied.

139
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,624
Two researchers who've made
groundbreaking contributions

140
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:51,089
to this effort are Dr. Colin Campbell

141
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,899
and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn.

142
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:59,016
Born just a few months
apart in 1933 and '34,

143
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,368
they each grew up on farms.

144
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,928
Campbell's childhood farm
is in rural Virginia,

145
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:11,109
where his family raised dairy
cattle and milked cows.

146
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,921
My dad and mother
moved here in 1943

147
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,613
when I was nine years old.

148
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:18,116
And during that time,
we had a dairy of about

149
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:20,277
somewheres between
20 and 30 cows,

150
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,622
which in those days was a
modest, medium-sized dairy.

151
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,125
At the time, milk
was believed to be

152
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,929
nature's perfect food.

153
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:32,511
So perfect, in fact, that this
U.S. government film

154
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:35,133
from the early 20th century
recommended that infants

155
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,135
who have just been weaned
from their mother's milk

156
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,554
should be switched
immediately to cow's milk.

157
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:44,142
That was the excitement
of doing something,

158
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:46,644
producing nature's perfect
food, if you will.

159
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,647
Established in 1675,

160
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,670
the Esselstyn's farm is
in upstate New York.

161
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:55,504
On these rolling hillsides,

162
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:58,434
they grazed both beef
and dairy cattle.

163
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:00,862
This was sort of like
the nerve center

164
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,007
of the operation in a way?

165
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,186
More or less, absolutely.

166
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,761
This is sort of the epicenter,
around these barns.

167
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:09,049
This is the way farming
was done in that era.

168
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:10,668
And so this is sort
of where you learned

169
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,170
the craft... the trade.

170
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,671
The trade of farming.

171
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,287
How old were you
when you moved here?

172
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:16,174
Seven.

173
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:17,798
I didn't start
driving the tractor

174
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:19,048
till I was eight years old.

175
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,180
A late bloomer, right?

176
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,432
Yeah, exactly.

177
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,381
But I enjoyed it,

178
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:28,066
and I really got a great kick
out of doing the farm work.

179
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:31,108
Although they didn't
know each other yet,

180
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:33,811
farm life had a deep
and lasting influence

181
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,693
on both Campbell and Esselstyn.

182
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:38,196
To make it successful, you
had to have persistence,

183
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,698
staying power, and
tenacity of purpose.

184
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:42,200
I guess it's ironic in the
sense that we're both

185
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,203
now advocating not
consuming the products

186
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:48,706
that we were busy actually
producing with our families.

187
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:51,209
During Campbell and
Esselstyn's lifetimes,

188
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:55,213
the American diet has
changed dramatically.

189
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,215
Near the beginning
of the 20th century,

190
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:01,239
Americans each ate about 120
pounds of meat annually.

191
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:04,722
By 2007, that
figure had exploded

192
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:07,725
to no less than 222 pounds.

193
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:10,728
In 1913, we ate about 40 pounds

194
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:13,231
of processed sugar
each per year.

195
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,233
However by 1999,

196
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,235
our consumption of all
refined sweeteners

197
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,738
had risen to over 147 pounds.

198
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:23,241
In 1909, Americans consumed

199
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:27,245
around 294 pounds of
dairy products apiece.

200
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:30,248
But by 2006, our
yearly intake of dairy

201
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:34,252
had more than doubled
to 605 pounds.

202
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:38,756
By the early 1950s, Campbell was
off to college at Penn State

203
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:41,259
while Esselstyn went to Yale.

204
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,760
As part of Yale's rowing team,

205
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,764
Esselstyn won an olympic
gold medal in 1956.

206
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,766
During this same decade,

207
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:51,269
the pace of American
life was accelerating,

208
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,771
even with our food.

209
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,774
The late '50s was the heyday
of the drive-in burger joint.

210
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:59,277
The supermarket was just
beginning to thrive

211
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:02,280
in the newly built,
post-World War II suburbs.

212
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,284
This was when the so-called
convenience foods were born,

213
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:09,287
like the legendary
foil-wrapped TV dinner,

214
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,790
not to mention a host of other
tasty processed delicacies

215
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,313
devised to make our lives
easier and better.

216
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:19,797
By now, Colin Campbell

217
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:22,800
was in graduate school
at Cornell University,

218
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,321
which had one of the
most prestigious

219
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:27,305
nutritional science
departments in the country.

220
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:30,808
His research was on animal
nutrition and biochemistry.

221
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,312
But it was focused more
on feeding animals

222
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:36,314
for their ability to
be able to produce

223
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,836
meat, milk, and eggs,
protein containing.

224
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,819
And so my own research
was focused on protein,

225
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,822
making sure we got enough.

226
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:47,344
It was considered to
be the vital nutrient.

227
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,827
It was one of the first
nutrients discovered

228
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:54,332
and without protein,
the animal would die,

229
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,334
so it was a life force.

230
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:59,337
In fact, in the
even early 1900s,

231
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,339
there were statements made

232
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,842
that this is the stuff
of civilization itself.

233
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:07,845
Protein was also
nearly synonymous

234
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,348
with animal-based
foods like meat.

235
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:13,851
It still is today
all over America.

236
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,853
Why do you think meat is
important in our diet?

237
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:16,854
Protein.

238
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:18,856
- Protein.
- Protein.

239
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:20,358
- Protein.
- Protein.

240
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:21,859
- Protein.
- Protein.

241
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,861
- Protein.
- A lot of protein in it.

242
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,363
We need protein, don't we?

243
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:28,366
You can't live without protein.

244
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:29,867
The idea that plants had protein

245
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,370
also didn't come into play

246
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,872
until maybe the late
1800s, early 1900s,

247
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,874
and then it struggled
through the years.

248
00:11:36,894 --> 00:11:39,377
No matter what source
the protein came from,

249
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,380
in the late 1950s, most
scientists believed

250
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,902
the world needed a
lot more of it.

251
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:46,384
We had a lot of starving

252
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:47,885
and malnourished
children in the world.

253
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,888
And so in my community, in
the nutrition community,

254
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:53,891
there were discussions
about why so.

255
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,393
You know, what could be done?

256
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,395
And one of the
prominent thoughts

257
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:59,397
was to make sure they
get enough protein.

258
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,399
I certainly went along
with this view.

259
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,901
At about the same time,

260
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,903
Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn
was just beginning

261
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:07,405
his medical career

262
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,408
at the world famous Cleveland
Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.

263
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,411
Surgery soon became
his specialty.

264
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,413
There's something awfully
satisfying about

265
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,915
if you can remove the disease.

266
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,417
For instance, if a
patient had gallstones

267
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:20,418
you could remove them.

268
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,420
If it was a gastric ulcer
or a stomach ulcer,

269
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,941
you directly could
take care of that.

270
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,424
If it's a hernia,
the same thing.

271
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,925
During the 1960s,

272
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,429
heart disease was on
the rise in the U.S.

273
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,432
What doctors commonly call
"coronary artery disease"

274
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,934
is usually caused by a
condition of the arteries

275
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:38,936
that supply the
heart with blood.

276
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,439
What happens is that over time,

277
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,442
a fatty substance in the
bloodstream called cholesterol

278
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,444
builds up in the
coronary arteries,

279
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,946
restricting the blood
flow to the heart.

280
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:51,949
This can ultimately
cause several problems,

281
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,452
from severe chest
pain, called angina,

282
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:55,973
to heart attacks.

283
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,956
Cholesterol is a
natural substance

284
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:01,959
produced by all animals,
including humans,

285
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:05,463
and it's an essential component
of our cells' walls.

286
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,466
But when we consume
dietary cholesterol,

287
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,468
which is only found
in animal foods

288
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,970
like meat, eggs, and
dairy products,

289
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,972
it tends to stay in
the bloodstream.

290
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:17,975
This so-called plaque
is what collects

291
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,477
on the inside of
our blood vessels

292
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:23,981
and is the major cause of
coronary artery disease.

293
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:28,005
In the late 1960s, a colleague
of Dr. Esselstyn's

294
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,488
at the Cleveland Clinic
made a major breakthrough

295
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,990
in the treatment
of this condition.

296
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,492
In fact, Esselstyn
shared space with him

297
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,994
in the clinic's
surgical locker room.

298
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:39,997
His name was Dr. Rene Favaloro.

299
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:43,000
Rene really sparkled
in the operating room.

300
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,504
And in 1967, he did
this first bypass graft

301
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:50,007
at the clinic...
coronary artery bypass graft.

302
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,509
This revolutionary new procedure

303
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,012
was accomplished by removing a
vein from the patient's leg,

304
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:58,015
then stitching it on the heart's
blocked coronary artery

305
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:02,520
to allow the blood to flow
around, or bypass, the blockage.

306
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,524
Today, over 500,000 Americans
go under the knife annually

307
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,526
for heart bypass surgery.

308
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,528
Costing around $100,000 apiece,

309
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:15,032
these operations alone
constitute a staggering total

310
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:17,054
of nearly $50 billion.

311
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,543
Joey Aucoin lives
in Tampa, Florida,

312
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:29,046
where he owns and operates
a landscaping company.

313
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,549
I tell everybody...
the joke with everybody with me is:

314
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,551
I don't eat to live,
I live to eat.

315
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:36,053
And I... my whole life, I
ate whatever I wanted.

316
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:38,575
In 2004, doctors discovered

317
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:42,560
Joey had a dangerously high
cholesterol level of 320

318
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,063
and a hazardous blood
sugar level of 480.

319
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,066
This not only made him
a type 2 diabetic,

320
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:53,070
but a prime candidate for a
heart attack and a stroke.

321
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,073
This is my daily pill regiment.

322
00:14:56,093 --> 00:15:00,077
Um, I got two pills I
take for my diabetes.

323
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:03,080
Then I got one for cholesterol,
one for high blood pressure,

324
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,084
and then I take Byetta, which
is an injectable medicine,

325
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:11,088
every morning before breakfast
and every night before dinner.

326
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:13,591
And that's what I've been doing
for almost four years now.

327
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,093
And I know it makes me tired,

328
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:18,095
and I just...
I just don't feel normal.

329
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:20,097
I only sleep four
hours a night or so.

330
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,618
I just hate takin' 'em.

331
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:28,105
In the mid 1960s,

332
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,107
Dr. Campbell was in
the Philippines,

333
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:31,609
trying to get more protein

334
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,611
to millions of
malnourished children.

335
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,613
To keep costs down,

336
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:39,617
he and his colleagues decided not
to use animal-based protein.

337
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:42,119
The program was beginning
to show success.

338
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,623
But then, Dr. Campbell stumbled
onto a piece of information

339
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:48,125
that was extremely important.

340
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,628
It centered on the more affluent
families in the Philippines,

341
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:55,132
who were eating relatively high
amounts of animal-based foods.

342
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,635
But at the same time,
they were the ones

343
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,136
most likely to have the children

344
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:01,658
who were susceptible to
getting liver cancer.

345
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,641
This was very unusual,

346
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:06,143
since liver cancers are
mainly found in adults.

347
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:09,146
But just the mere fact that
they occurred in children

348
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,167
said, you know, there's
something here.

349
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:11,649
This is pretty significant.

350
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,152
Shortly afterward, Dr. Campbell

351
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:16,654
came across a scientific paper

352
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:19,657
published in a little-known
Indian medical journal.

353
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,158
It detailed work
that had been done

354
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:23,160
on a population of
experimental rats

355
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,665
that were first exposed to a
carcinogen called aflatoxin,

356
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:32,169
then fed a diet of casein, the
main protein found in milk.

357
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:33,671
They were testing the
effect of protein

358
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,673
on the development
of liver cancer.

359
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:38,175
They used two different
levels of protein.

360
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,678
They used 20% of total calories,

361
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:44,682
and then they used a
much lower level, 5%.

362
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:48,185
20% turned on cancer,
5% turned it off.

363
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:49,687
This Indian paper,

364
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,689
together with what
Dr. Campbell had learned

365
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,691
about increased liver
cancers in children

366
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,693
eating animal-based foods,

367
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:58,696
combined to create a
decisive moment in his work

368
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,698
and his life.

369
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:03,200
Because we learned
that animal protein

370
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,224
was really good in
turning on cancer.

371
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:10,728
During this same time,

372
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,711
the way Americans ate
was changing, again.

373
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:16,233
The number of fast-food
franchises was exploding,

374
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,736
as more and more
overscheduled Americans

375
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,218
began using them as
a convenient way

376
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:23,220
to feed themselves
and their families.

377
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,724
While the fast-food revolution
was sweeping the nation,

378
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,225
the rate of cancer
deaths in America

379
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,227
was continuing to rise.

380
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,230
As a result, in 1971,

381
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,733
president Richard Nixon
initiated a program

382
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:38,736
that was dubbed
"The War on Cancer".

383
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:40,237
We are here today
for the purpose

384
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:43,741
of signing the
Cancer Act of 1971.

385
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,243
And I hope that in
the years ahead

386
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:49,747
that we may look
back on this day

387
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:52,750
and this action as being the
most significant action

388
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,753
taken during this
administration.

389
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,254
On the front lines
of this new war

390
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,757
was Caldwell Esselstyn.

391
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:03,761
By 1978, he was chairman of
the Breast Cancer Task Force

392
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:04,762
at the Cleveland Clinic.

393
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:06,784
Yet he soon began to doubt

394
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:10,267
the medical procedures
he was using.

395
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,769
No matter how many
of these operations

396
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,271
I was doing for women
for breast cancer,

397
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,274
I wasn't doing one single thing

398
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:20,778
for the next
unsuspecting victim.

399
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,280
So Dr. Esselstyn started
investigating

400
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,802
the global statistics
on breast cancer.

401
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:27,304
One of the facts he discovered

402
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,787
was that the incidence of
breast cancer in Kenya

403
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:33,290
was far lower than it was
in the United States.

404
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,294
In fact, in 1978, the
chances of a woman

405
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,796
getting breast cancer in Kenya

406
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:43,801
were 82 times lower
than in the U.S.

407
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:46,303
Dr. Esselstyn was
even more surprised

408
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:49,306
by the numbers he discovered for
some other types of cancer.

409
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:53,330
In the entire nation
of Japan in 1958,

410
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,312
how many autopsy-proven deaths

411
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:59,817
were there from cancer
of the prostate?

412
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,819
18.

413
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,821
18 in the entire nation.

414
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:06,323
That, to me, was about
the most mind-boggling

415
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:10,327
public health figure that I
think I'd ever encountered.

416
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:12,830
In the same year, the
U.S. population

417
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,332
was only about twice
the size of Japan's,

418
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,835
yet the number of
prostate cancer deaths

419
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:20,838
exceeded 14,000.

420
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:22,840
Dr. Esselstyn also
discovered that

421
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,344
in the early 1970s, the risk for
heart disease in rural China

422
00:19:27,364 --> 00:19:30,347
was 12 times lower than
it was in the U.S.

423
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,850
And in the highlands
of Papua New Guinea,

424
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,853
heart disease was
rarely encountered.

425
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:40,858
The link he noted between all the
areas he studied was simple.

426
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,860
Virtually, the Western
diet was nonexistent.

427
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,861
They had no animal products.

428
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,362
They had no dairy, no meat.

429
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:46,864
Even more compelling
to Esselstyn

430
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,366
was some historical data that
had long been overlooked.

431
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:53,871
In World War II, the
Germans occupied Norway.

432
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:56,874
Among the first things
they did was confiscate

433
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:58,876
all the livestock
and farm animals

434
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:01,378
to provide supplies
for their own troops.

435
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:06,884
So the Norwegians were forced to
eat mainly plant-based foods.

436
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:09,887
Now we look at the
deaths in Norway,

437
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,388
just antecedent to this period,

438
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:13,891
from heart attack and stroke.

439
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:17,895
1927, 1930, '35.

440
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,396
Look at right up here.

441
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,398
Right at the very top, 1939.

442
00:20:21,418 --> 00:20:25,402
Bingo! In come the Germans.

443
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:27,905
Immediately, 1940, wow.

444
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:31,408
'41, '42, '43, '44, '45.

445
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:32,910
Have we ever seen a population

446
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,412
have their cardiovascular
disease plummet

447
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:37,434
like this from statins,

448
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,917
from bypass surgery,

449
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:41,919
or from stents?

450
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:42,920
No.

451
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,422
But look what
immediately happened.

452
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:48,926
With the cessation of
hostilities in 1945,

453
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:51,929
back comes the meat,
back comes the dairy,

454
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:54,932
back comes the strokes
and heart attacks.

455
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:58,936
I mean, it's such an
absolute, powerful lesson.

456
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:01,438
But, uh, we didn't get it.

457
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,440
Because of evidence like this,

458
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,943
Dr. Esselstyn was making
the same assessment

459
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:09,446
that Dr. Campbell was due to
his work in the Philippines,

460
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:12,950
seeing a causal link
between animal-based foods

461
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,452
and some of our most
deadly diseases.

462
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:16,954
But they weren't the
only researchers

463
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:18,956
coming to this conclusion.

464
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,959
Another was Dr. John McDougall.

465
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:22,960
In the mid 1970s,

466
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,964
he began practicing on a
sugar plantation in Hawaii.

467
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:31,468
What I observed there was
the health of the people

468
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:32,970
differed dramatically
depending upon

469
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,973
how long they'd been in Hawaii.

470
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:39,476
People who were raised in Japan,
the Philippines, Korea, China,

471
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:42,980
first generation who had moved
from their native land,

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,983
were always trim, never
had heart disease,

473
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:47,985
prostate cancer, colon
cancer, breast cancer,

474
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,987
rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis,

475
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,488
never overweight.

476
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:54,992
They were in their 80s and
90s and fully functional.

477
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:57,995
Their kids got a little
fatter, a little sicker.

478
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,997
Their grandkids in
the next generation

479
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:03,000
were just as fat and sick
as anybody I'd ever seen.

480
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,003
And what came through clearly was
the diet was the difference.

481
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,505
The first generation had learned
a diet of rice and vegetables

482
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,007
in their native land.

483
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:12,009
But the kids, they started
to give up the rice

484
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,511
and replace it with
the animal foods,

485
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:17,014
the dairy products, the meats,

486
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,515
and the results were obvious.

487
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:20,017
They got fat and sick.

488
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:24,521
So I knew at that point
what caused most diseases.

489
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,024
At the time, however,
Campbell and Esselstyn

490
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:29,526
knew virtually nothing about
this other information.

491
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:34,031
Even so, they ultimately reached
a revolutionary conclusion...

492
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:36,053
that many of our most
crippling conditions

493
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:40,037
could be greatly reduced, if
not completely eradicated,

494
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:44,041
simply by eating what they call a
whole foods, plant-based diet.

495
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:47,044
This means consuming
foods that come mainly

496
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:50,047
from whole, minimally
refined plants

497
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:54,071
such as fruits, vegetables,
grains, and legumes.

498
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:57,054
It also means avoiding
animal-based foods

499
00:22:57,074 --> 00:23:00,057
such as meat, dairy, and eggs,

500
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:03,060
as well as processed foods
like bleached flour,

501
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,563
refined sugars, and oil.

502
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,066
Campbell and Esselstyn's
research in this field

503
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,088
would change their
lives forever.

504
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:31,588
So, I went through
your preliminary form.

505
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,090
The goals that I have...
tell me if I missing any...

506
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,592
from you were: Eliminate
your shots and medicines.

507
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:36,613
You want to get off this stuff.

508
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:38,095
You want to sleep well at night.

509
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:39,116
You're not doing that.

510
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:41,098
You want to stop feeling
tired and run down.

511
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,099
You want to lose weight.

512
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,101
- That's it. You got it.
- So those are your goals.

513
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:46,123
The other complaints: You had low
energy, ringing in the ears,

514
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:49,106
sinus problems, post nasal
drip, shortness of breath,

515
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:51,108
wheezing, coughs,
indigestion, and reflux,

516
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,110
loose stool, diarrhea, bloating,

517
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,612
black and bloody mucousy
stool with meat consumption,

518
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:58,115
and difficulty walking,
getting around,

519
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,118
trouble losing weight, chronic
and unpleasant hunger feelings,

520
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,120
groggy after meals,
strong food cravings,

521
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,122
and anxiety about
food in general.

522
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,144
All of that stuff...
sounds like I'm dead.

523
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:10,127
So I don't mean to, you know,

524
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:12,129
harp on the bad stuff,
but, you know,

525
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:15,132
that will all...
most of that should get better.

526
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:17,134
My goals, I'm adding in.

527
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:18,635
Which goals do you have?

528
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,137
I want you to reverse all
your medical diseases,

529
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:21,638
the ones that we can reverse,

530
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:23,140
and most of yours, we could.

531
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,142
I told you all the
risk and benefits.

532
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:28,145
Based on what I told you, I
would stop all these meds.

533
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,167
And I would stop these, on
top of all these risks.

534
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:31,648
Okay, that's what I'm gonna try.

535
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:33,150
You're gonna get my best...
my best effort.

536
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,152
I can tell you that.
You'll do good.

537
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,174
You'll do well.

538
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:42,659
By 1975, Dr. Campbell was
at Cornell University,

539
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,662
investigating what he'd
discovered in the Philippines.

540
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:48,165
Our work from the
beginning was designed,

541
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,167
in a sense, to do
two main things.

542
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:53,690
One, I wanted to replicate,
if possible, the Indian work,

543
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:57,174
because it was so provocative.

544
00:24:57,194 --> 00:25:00,177
Secondly, if this
was really true,

545
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,179
I wanted to study
how does it work?

546
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,700
Just like the
Indian researchers,

547
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,183
Campbell fed half the
rats in his study

548
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:07,704
a diet of 20% casein,

549
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:11,188
the main protein
in dairy products.

550
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,690
The other half was
fed only 5% casein.

551
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,692
Over the 12 weeks of the study,

552
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:18,195
the rats eating the
higher protein diet

553
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:22,219
had a greatly enhanced level of
early liver cancer tumor growth.

554
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:26,703
On the other hand, all of the
rats eating only 5% protein

555
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:30,707
had no evidence of
cancer whatsoever.

556
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,209
But Dr. Campbell decided

557
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:34,711
to take these findings
a step further.

558
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:37,214
This time, instead of
keeping his test rats

559
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:39,716
on the same diet
throughout the study,

560
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,218
he kept them in one group

561
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:42,739
and switched their
diets back and forth

562
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,722
between 5% and 20%
dairy protein,

563
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:48,725
doing so at
three-week intervals.

564
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:50,727
The results were astonishing.

565
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:53,730
Whenever the rats
were fed 20% protein,

566
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,733
early liver tumor
growth exploded.

567
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:59,736
But when the same rats
were given 5% protein,

568
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:03,240
tumor growth actually went down.

569
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,243
I mean, this is so provocative,
this information.

570
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:10,247
We could turn on and
turn off cancer growth

571
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:14,251
just by adjusting the level
of intake of that protein.

572
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:15,752
Going from 5% to 20%

573
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:17,754
is within the range of
American experience.

574
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:21,758
The typical studies on chemical
carcinogens causing cancer

575
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:23,760
are testing chemicals at levels

576
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,763
maybe three or four orders
of magnitude higher

577
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:28,265
than we experience.

578
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:30,267
Even more surprisingly,

579
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,769
Dr. Campbell discovered
that a 20% diet

580
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,791
of plant proteins from
soy beans and wheat

581
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,774
did not promote cancer.

582
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:40,296
However, there's a longstanding
belief among the public

583
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:44,781
that animal protein is
important for human health.

584
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:48,785
Connie Diekman supports
this position.

585
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:50,787
Ms. Diekman is
director of nutrition

586
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:53,810
at Washington University in St.
Louis, Missouri.

587
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:57,794
She's the past President of the
American Dietetic Association,

588
00:26:57,814 --> 00:27:00,797
and an advisor to the
National Dairy Council.

589
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:04,801
When you eliminate animal
foods from your eating plan,

590
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:08,805
you run the risk of
inadequate protein content.

591
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:12,328
Animal proteins provide
all the amino acids

592
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:15,312
that we need for cell growth,

593
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:18,315
tissue repair, and
overall health.

594
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:20,817
Eating whole foods, it's
virtually impossible

595
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:23,820
to be protein deficient without
being calorie deficient.

596
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,323
Because even if you
take the foods

597
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:27,824
that have the least
amount of protein in it,

598
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:30,327
let's say potatoes,
for example, or rice.

599
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:31,828
You know, 8%, 9%.

600
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:33,830
Well, that's the figure
we more or less need.

601
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,352
Dr. Campbell's research
led him to a conclusion

602
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,335
about the way genes, chemicals,

603
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:41,838
and nutrition interact
to promote cancer.

604
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,340
Cancer starts with genes.

605
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,342
It might be genes
we're born with,

606
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:48,845
it might be genes that are
actually changed by a chemical,

607
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:53,850
so those genes become capable
of producing cancer cells.

608
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,353
Whether we do or
don't get cancer

609
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:58,355
is primarily related
to how we promote

610
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:02,359
those cancer cells
to grow over time.

611
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:04,861
That's where nutrition
comes into play.

612
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:09,866
They grow much more rapidly when
they were fed animal protein.

613
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,888
Dr. Campbell and other
nutritional scientists

614
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,871
have found that only a small
percentage of cancer cases

615
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:18,375
are caused solely by genes.

616
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:20,377
I think the general
consensus in my field

617
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:23,880
is that probably not more
than 1% or 2% at most

618
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,384
is attributed to the genes
we may or may not have.

619
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:28,885
And that's the most helpful

620
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:30,887
and hopeful information
I give people.

621
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:31,888
Because if you go through life

622
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:33,390
thinking that what
happens to you

623
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,891
from a health perspective
is based on your genes,

624
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:35,912
you're a helpless victim.

625
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,395
My diet was pretty abominable.

626
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,397
I thought the two
principal food groups

627
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,898
were caffeine and sugar.

628
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:43,900
Dr. Pam Popper is
executive director

629
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,403
of the Wellness Forum
in Columbus, Ohio,

630
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:49,906
and an expert in the areas
of health and nutrition.

631
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:53,410
The women in my family are
all overweight. I'm not.

632
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,912
I don't eat and live
like they do, you know.

633
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,914
So, I've changed
my health destiny

634
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:00,417
by not engaging in
the same habits.

635
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:02,919
Over the next several years,

636
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:04,921
Dr. Campbell initiated
more extensive lab studies

637
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:07,924
using various animal
and plant nutrients.

638
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:10,427
The results were consistent:

639
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:13,930
Nutrients from animal foods
promoted cancer growth,

640
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,435
while nutrients from plant
foods decreased cancer growth.

641
00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:21,438
Yet Campbell hadn't identified a
specific biological mechanism

642
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,940
that caused the
effects he observed.

643
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,442
And it finally occurred to me

644
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:28,945
that there is no such
thing as the mechanism.

645
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:32,468
What we are looking at was
a symphony of mechanisms.

646
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,951
We think that nutrition
is attributed

647
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:36,453
to individual nutrients.

648
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:37,954
And that's the way
it gets marketed

649
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,956
and that's the way the
companies tell us, so forth.

650
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:41,958
When, in fact, nutrition,

651
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:44,461
all of it working together
to create this symphony,

652
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,962
the hundreds of thousands

653
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:47,964
of different kinds of
chemicals in food,

654
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,466
all kind of working
together nicely.

655
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:51,968
I mean, the complexity is total.

656
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,470
That's a holistic concept.

657
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,974
And I had to say to myself,
that's a very exciting idea.

658
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,476
Dr. Campbell realized

659
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:00,977
that his discoveries
in the laboratory

660
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:02,979
were significant, but limited.

661
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:05,982
How were these findings
relevant in people?

662
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:07,984
How do different types of foods

663
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:10,487
affect cancer and
other diseases?

664
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:14,511
Campbell needed a large-scale
population study.

665
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:19,015
He would soon find a
perfect opportunity.

666
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,509
So mangoes are really good.

667
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,010
They flavor things
really nicely.

668
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,512
- Okay.
- That's something...

669
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,013
you wanna get a riper one.

670
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:41,017
Dr. Matt Lederman and his wife,
Dr. Alona Pulde,

671
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:43,520
are among a small but growing
number of physicians

672
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,523
who use a whole foods,
plant-based diet

673
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:49,025
as a primary treatment
for their patients.

674
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:51,027
From shopping with
patients to teach them

675
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:52,529
how to read nutrition labels...

676
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:53,530
And I don't care what it says

677
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,532
on the front, the
back, or the sides...

678
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:56,553
both: Look at the ingredients.

679
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:58,034
And that's all I care about.

680
00:30:58,054 --> 00:31:00,537
To showing patients
how to prepare meals,

681
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:03,540
they are not your typical M.D.s.

682
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,543
Doctors Lederman and Pulde
use food as treatment

683
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:09,546
because they feel it's the
best medicine available...

684
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:12,048
medicine that not only makes
their patients feel better

685
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:15,071
but that truly
improves their health.

686
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:20,557
In 1973, the U.S. congress

687
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:23,059
passed a new farm subsidy bill.

688
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:26,062
Among other things, it
included incentives

689
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:29,566
that encouraged a massive
increase in corn production.

690
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,569
One of the major byproducts
of this enormous corn surplus

691
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:37,073
was a low-cost sweetener called
"high fructose corn syrup".

692
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:39,075
Companies could add this
sweetener to anything

693
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:40,577
from soda pop to hot dogs,

694
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:45,081
and then make these products
widely available at low prices.

695
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:47,584
Processed sugars and
other refined foods

696
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:49,085
are far more calorie-dense

697
00:31:49,105 --> 00:31:51,087
than the whole plants
they're made from.

698
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:53,089
The dramatic increase
in their use

699
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:56,593
is a major reason why our
food has become richer.

700
00:31:56,613 --> 00:32:00,096
To evolutionary psychologist
and author Dr. Doug Lisle,

701
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,598
the consumption of
unnaturally dense foods

702
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:05,602
is the main cause for the
epidemic of obesity in America.

703
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:08,104
It isn't that people have
become more self-indulgent.

704
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:11,608
It isn't because they're
lazier than they ever were.

705
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:14,110
What's happening is that their
mechanisms of satiation

706
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,612
are being fooled.

707
00:32:15,632 --> 00:32:17,113
The process starts

708
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,114
with a range of receptors
in our stomachs

709
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:21,117
that help us gauge how
much food we've eaten.

710
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,620
These include stretch
receptors to help measure

711
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,122
the sheer volume of
food in our stomachs.

712
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:28,625
We also have density receptors,

713
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:30,627
to help determine the
caloric density,

714
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:34,631
or what we more commonly call
the richness of our food.

715
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:38,134
For instance, 500 calories
of natural plant food

716
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:39,655
fills the stomach completely,

717
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:43,139
triggering both our stretch
and density receptors

718
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:46,142
to signal our brain that
we've had enough to eat.

719
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:49,646
But 500 calories of unnaturally
rich or processed food

720
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:52,148
fills the stomach far less,

721
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:54,150
deceiving these receptors
into telling our brain

722
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,671
that we need to eat more.

723
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:58,674
Even worse is 500
calories of oil,

724
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:00,657
which is almost pure fat

725
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:03,660
and barely triggers
any response at all.

726
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,662
The problem with weight
management in humans

727
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:08,164
is that if you make these
foods completely artificial,

728
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:09,666
which we do today,

729
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:12,669
you wind up with a problem
that people have to overeat

730
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:14,170
just to be satisfied.

731
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,172
But why do these
concentrated foods

732
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:19,676
that are so harmful to us
give us so much pleasure?

733
00:33:19,696 --> 00:33:21,678
Dr. Lisle says the
answer is related

734
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:25,181
to a system called the
motivational triad.

735
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:27,203
This is a trio of
biological mechanisms

736
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:30,186
that nature has designed
into every creature on earth

737
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:31,688
so they can survive
to pass their genes

738
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,190
on to the next generation.

739
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,212
The first leg of the
motivational triad

740
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:38,695
is pleasure seeking.

741
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:41,698
And, primarily, two things
are the cause of that,

742
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:44,200
and those two things
are food and sex.

743
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,702
So in the case of a
great white shark,

744
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:49,205
its basically got a neon sign
flashing across its forehead

745
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:52,208
saying, "food, sex,
food, sex, food, sex."

746
00:33:52,228 --> 00:33:54,711
Unless it's a male, then it
says, "sex, food, sex, food,"

747
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:56,713
but it's pretty much
the same thing.

748
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,215
The other two legs of
the motivational triad

749
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:00,717
are avoiding pain

750
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:03,720
and doing everything with
the least amount of effort.

751
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,722
Pleasure seeking,
pain avoidance,

752
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:06,723
and energy conservation,

753
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:08,725
that really sums up
animal behavior,

754
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:11,227
whether we're talking about a
paramecium under a microscope

755
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:12,729
or a great white shark.

756
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:15,732
Richer foods naturally
excite our senses

757
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:17,233
because it's nature's
way of telling us

758
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,755
they will provide the highest
amount of dietary reward

759
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:23,239
with the least amount of effort.

760
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:25,742
This helped our ancestors
find the most calorie-dense

761
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:26,743
and ripe foods available,

762
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:31,247
which contributed
to our survival.

763
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,248
But in today's environment,

764
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:34,751
we can artificially
increase calorie density

765
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:38,254
well beyond what our ancestors
would have found in nature.

766
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:41,277
The resulting foods give us a
hyper-normal amount of pleasure,

767
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,259
leading us into something

768
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:46,262
Dr. Lisle calls the
pleasure trap.

769
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:49,265
What the pleasure trap
is is an interaction

770
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:51,768
between our natural instincts,

771
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,770
which are trying to tell
us the right thing to do,

772
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,292
and some kind of artificial,
modern stimulation

773
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:59,796
that is piggybacking or
hijacking that process.

774
00:35:00,296 --> 00:35:01,797
So the classic example
of the pleasure trap

775
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:04,781
would be drugs and
drug addiction.

776
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:08,284
The way drugs work
is they hijack

777
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:10,306
the existing pleasure circuits.

778
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:13,289
When certain chemicals
hit those areas,

779
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:15,811
they cause feelings of
euphoria and excitement.

780
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:18,294
The same drug-like
effect happens

781
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:21,817
when we eat highly
concentrated, processed foods.

782
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:24,300
We've removed the fiber,
we've removed the water,

783
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,821
we've removed the minerals.

784
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:27,303
We've done everything
that we can

785
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:30,306
to hyper-concentrate
sugar and fat

786
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:32,308
and add a bunch of salt
as well into the food,

787
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:33,810
and now what the food has become

788
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,812
is it's become a
low-grade addiction.

789
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:37,814
These things are drugs.

790
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,816
They have other
deleterious side effects,

791
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:42,819
not the least of which is
adding a lot of empty calories.

792
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,321
Dr. Terry Mason is
commissioner of health

793
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:47,824
for the city of Chicago.

794
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:49,345
He's one of the few public
officials in America

795
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:52,829
who openly supports
a plant-based diet.

796
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,332
If it walked, hopped,
swam, crawled, slithered,

797
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:59,836
had eyes, a mom and a dad...
don't eat it.

798
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:01,357
Dr. Mason contends

799
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:03,860
that the less affluent
segments of our population

800
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,843
have difficulty making
the best food choices.

801
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:08,845
Well, first of all,

802
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:12,849
the diets are calorie-rich
and nutrient-poor.

803
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:14,851
This is the real problem.

804
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:18,855
And, unfortunately, poor
people are poor in everything.

805
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:21,858
They're poor in health,
they're poor in food choices,

806
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:25,862
they're poor in almost every
aspect that you could think of.

807
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:27,363
This makes the less prosperous

808
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:29,866
particularly vulnerable to
the low-grade addiction

809
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:32,368
of highly processed foods.

810
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:33,870
People want stuff that's fast,

811
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,872
people want stuff that's quick,

812
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:38,374
and they like the
stuff that's salty,

813
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,877
and they like the taste
of something fried.

814
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,879
And so those are the
kinds of things

815
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,401
that you see in our community.

816
00:36:57,413 --> 00:37:00,396
San'Dera Nation lives
in a quiet suburb

817
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,899
in Cleveland, Ohio,
with her five children.

818
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:07,904
In October 2008, she was
stricken by a strange illness.

819
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:10,907
I wanna say something,
but it's not coming out.

820
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:13,409
I'm getting really
shaky and sweats,

821
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:14,911
and then I'm cold and I'm sick

822
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:16,913
and I'm fatigued, and my
stomach hurts and everything.

823
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,414
So I went to the doctor,

824
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:23,419
and that's when he diagnosed me
with hypertension and diabetes.

825
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,940
Like Joey Aucoin,

826
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:28,925
San'Dera was treated with
expensive prescription drugs.

827
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:31,427
I was in denial for a while.

828
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:34,931
I heard what they said, but
I was in denial, like, mmm.

829
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:37,453
I still ate things
I shouldn't have.

830
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:38,935
I didn't really
get the education

831
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:40,937
that I needed to know,

832
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:44,440
so I really depended on
that pill to save me.

833
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,943
Then San'Dera met with
Dr. Esselstyn,

834
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:49,445
who recommended that she
treat her illnesses

835
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,948
with a whole foods,
plant-based diet.

836
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:53,950
Come on in, and
we'll get to work.

837
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:59,455
I was a little nervous, but
he made it real easy for me.

838
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:01,958
I was real interested
in what he had to say

839
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:02,979
and what he was
going to teach me

840
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:06,482
and the new journey that I
would be taking with him.

841
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,986
Between China and the
United States...

842
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:32,488
In 1974, Chinese
premier zhou enlai

843
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:36,492
was hospitalized
with bladder cancer.

844
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:38,995
Knowing that his
disease was terminal,

845
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:39,996
he decided to give his country

846
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:42,999
a more complete
understanding of cancer.

847
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:44,500
So he initiated
what would become

848
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,502
one of the largest
and most thorough

849
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:49,505
scientific studies in history.

850
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:53,509
650,000 researchers catalogued
the mortality patterns

851
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:55,011
caused by several
types of cancer

852
00:38:55,031 --> 00:39:00,516
for the years between
1973 and 1975.

853
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:03,019
The study encompassed
every county in China

854
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,542
and over 880 million people.

855
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:11,527
Zhou died in 1976, years
before his study was complete.

856
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:14,530
Okay, and you'll need
how many shirts?

857
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,033
Probably three?

858
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,035
- Yeah.
- Okay.

859
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:20,036
Zhou enlai's cancer study

860
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:22,038
would ultimately
have a major impact

861
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:24,540
on what Dr. Campbell himself
has called

862
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,062
the capstone of his research.

863
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:32,548
Early 1980.

864
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:34,050
And you were there for
two or three months?

865
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,053
Dr. Junshi Chen is now
senior research Professor

866
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:40,556
with the Chinese center for
disease control and prevention.

867
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:43,059
He first met Dr. Campbell
at Cornell in 1980,

868
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,061
when he was a member of
the Chinese Institute

869
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:48,084
of Food and Nutrition Science.

870
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:50,566
The Cold War was just
beginning to thaw,

871
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:53,569
and Dr. Chen was among the
first senior scientists

872
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:56,072
from China to visit
the United States.

873
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:58,074
By then, Dr. Campbell had become

874
00:39:58,094 --> 00:39:59,075
one of the most distinguished

875
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:01,577
nutritional biochemists
in the world.

876
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:04,080
When they discovered this book,

877
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,583
a significant
collaboration was born.

878
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:12,588
This is the atlas of
cancer mortality in China.

879
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:16,092
Published in 1981,
the cancer atlas

880
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:19,595
was the result of Zhou
Enlai's nationwide study.

881
00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:23,118
It showed a highly unusual
geographical distribution

882
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:25,601
of different types
of cancer in China,

883
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:30,106
which tended to be clustered
in certain hot spots.

884
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:33,129
The same was true with
cancer after cancer.

885
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:35,111
And the counties with
the highest levels

886
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:36,132
were often far greater

887
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:38,614
than the counties with
the lowest levels.

888
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:42,118
So, for example,
esophageal cancer,

889
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:44,120
according to this cancer map,

890
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,124
the mortality has a
400-fold difference

891
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:52,128
among different
counties in China.

892
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:53,129
- That's huge.
- Yeah.

893
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:56,632
And in...
I understood, in the United States,

894
00:40:56,652 --> 00:41:00,136
only several-fold difference.
Not even...

895
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:02,638
maybe twofold or so, we see.

896
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:06,142
Yeah, yeah.
So that caught our attention

897
00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:09,145
in term of, so, why?

898
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:11,647
Because they're all Chinese.

899
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,149
Genetically, they
are all the same.

900
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:17,153
And the why they have
so much difference

901
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:20,156
in single cancer mortality?

902
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:24,160
So we believe it has to be
related to the environment.

903
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,662
The bigger environment.

904
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:29,184
And from our professional
perspective,

905
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:32,187
of course, it's
diet and nutrition.

906
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:34,170
Dr. Chen and I said, you know,

907
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,672
"why don't we just go
there and do a study?"

908
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:38,674
For Dr. Campbell,

909
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:41,177
it was the opportunity
he'd been looking for.

910
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,180
Among other things, he could
examine how his observations

911
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,682
about liver cancer
in Filipino children

912
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:49,185
and the findings
from his lab studies

913
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:52,208
applied to a large
human population.

914
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,190
The project would consider

915
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,693
367 diet and
health-related variables,

916
00:41:57,713 --> 00:41:59,695
making it one of
the most ambitious

917
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:03,199
nutritional studies
ever conceived.

918
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,200
Dr. Campbell and his associates

919
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,204
carefully chose 65 counties
scattered across China.

920
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:10,706
These counties were
mainly located in rural

921
00:42:10,726 --> 00:42:12,708
or semi-rural areas.

922
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:15,211
We used the rural counties

923
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,714
because they are stable
in their residents,

924
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:21,217
and they have been
in this lifestyle

925
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:24,720
for at least 20 to 30 years.

926
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,722
More than 350 workers
were trained.

927
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:30,226
They carefully surveyed
the diet and lifestyle

928
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:34,730
of 6,500 people in
the chosen counties.

929
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,734
Urine and blood samples
were also taken.

930
00:42:38,754 --> 00:42:43,239
In 1983, doctors Campbell,
Chen, and their collaborators

931
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:46,242
began to analyze the vast
amount of information

932
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:47,743
that had been collected.

933
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:50,265
The job would take years.

934
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,253
After eight weeks eating
plant-based foods,

935
00:42:57,273 --> 00:43:00,756
Joey Aucoin was still off
all his medications.

936
00:43:00,776 --> 00:43:03,259
When I started this, I had
all these side effects

937
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:06,762
from medication and from
my being so unhealthy.

938
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:09,765
But now I'm getting in better
and better shape every day.

939
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:10,766
I feel more healthy.

940
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:12,768
I very seldom get
tired during the day.

941
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:15,271
I just feel so
good all the time.

942
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,773
This... this is the scale
that I weigh myself on.

943
00:43:17,793 --> 00:43:22,778
And it started about eight weeks
ago way up here around 218, 220.

944
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:26,802
And now it's bouncing
between 180 and 185.

945
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:28,284
None of my belts fit.

946
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:30,286
This one here, I
actually had to have

947
00:43:30,306 --> 00:43:33,789
two new holes punched in, 'cause
I liked the belt so much.

948
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:35,291
Nothing fits.
I gotta go shopping.

949
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:37,793
It's just everything,
all my clothes.

950
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:39,795
A good problem to have.

951
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:40,796
It's been fun for him,

952
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:42,298
because I think he's learned

953
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,800
in addition to the fact that
he's seeing such great results,

954
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,803
that it's... He loves it.

955
00:43:47,823 --> 00:43:49,305
I don't think he'll go
back to his old ways.

956
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:52,308
He feels too good, and he likes...

957
00:43:52,328 --> 00:43:54,310
even if he started to
go off a little bit,

958
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,313
he feels too good, his energy's
too good, he looks younger.

959
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,814
And the fact that he
would have to go back

960
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:01,317
on all the meds, you
know, if he did,

961
00:44:01,337 --> 00:44:03,319
I think that that's
a huge motivation

962
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:06,342
for him to maintain
the lifestyle.

963
00:44:10,846 --> 00:44:14,830
In the mid-1980s, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn

964
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,332
was struggling to
organize a study

965
00:44:16,352 --> 00:44:18,834
on coronary artery disease.

966
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,836
His plan was to put
a group of patients

967
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:22,838
on a diet of low-fat
plant-based foods,

968
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:26,342
along with small quantities
of low-fat dairy products

969
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:30,846
and minimal amounts of
cholesterol reducing drugs.

970
00:44:30,866 --> 00:44:33,849
And slowly over the
next, uh, 18 months,

971
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:36,352
I got the 24 patients
that I had asked for.

972
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:37,853
But the ones they sent me

973
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:40,856
Were a little bit sicker
than I had thought.

974
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:41,877
These were patients
who had failed

975
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:44,360
their first or second
bypass operation.

976
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,862
They had failed their first
or second angioplasty.

977
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:48,364
And there were
five who were told

978
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:49,865
by their expert cardiologists

979
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:51,367
they would not
live out the year.

980
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:53,889
One of the most
gravely ill patients

981
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,872
was a 59-year-old speech and
communications teacher,

982
00:44:56,892 --> 00:44:58,874
Evelyn Oswick.

983
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:01,377
Ate all the chocolate
candy I could eat,

984
00:45:01,397 --> 00:45:03,879
ate every doughnut I
could put my hands on.

985
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:05,881
Oh, I just love
things like that,

986
00:45:05,901 --> 00:45:07,383
a lot of gravy.

987
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:09,885
And then, um, I had my...

988
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:12,888
I have had two heart attacks
before I met Dr. Esselstyn.

989
00:45:12,908 --> 00:45:15,891
When I had the
second heart attack,

990
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:19,395
the doctor said that I
should prepare for death,

991
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:20,896
really is what he said.

992
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:22,398
And I looked at him and I said,

993
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:25,401
"do you really mean that
what you want me to do

994
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:26,422
"is buy a rocking chair

995
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:28,404
and just sit there and
rock away and wait?"

996
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:30,406
And he just looked
at me and he said,

997
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:32,928
"yes, that's just exactly
what I'm saying."

998
00:45:36,932 --> 00:45:41,417
Anthony Yen was born
and raised in China.

999
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:45,421
And we were eating a typical
Chinese cultural diet.

1000
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:48,924
A very small piece of meat.

1001
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:53,929
But they sliced it, and so
it was cooked for flavor

1002
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:55,431
rather than your American style,

1003
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:58,934
when you eat, you eat a large,
great, big piece of meat,

1004
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:02,938
which you could easily fed
the whole family in China.

1005
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,460
And we eat a lot of
vegetables in China.

1006
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:06,942
And we had soup.

1007
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:08,463
But once I came to
the United States,

1008
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:12,948
you find beginning to
experience fast food.

1009
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:16,952
The hamburgers and
cheeseburgers, pizza.

1010
00:46:16,972 --> 00:46:18,954
And I noticed my weight
beginning to gain.

1011
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:21,957
When Mr. Yen was 56 years old,

1012
00:46:21,977 --> 00:46:25,461
he suddenly experienced
severe chest pains.

1013
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:29,465
At that point in time, I
had a open heart surgery.

1014
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:33,469
I have five bypass... five.

1015
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,971
But it was very interesting.

1016
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:39,475
About a week later, uh,

1017
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:42,978
I felt my chest
tighten up again.

1018
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:48,484
So myself and my wife went
to see Dr. Esselstyn.

1019
00:46:48,504 --> 00:46:51,987
I saw every one of
these patients myself

1020
00:46:52,007 --> 00:46:54,490
every two weeks for
the first five years.

1021
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,992
And at that visit, we would get

1022
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:59,495
a full cholesterol
lipid profile.

1023
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:02,498
We would get blood
pressure, weight,

1024
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,500
and I would go over
every morsel they ate.

1025
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,502
By using simple foods

1026
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:09,004
as the main treatment
for his patients,

1027
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:13,028
Dr. Esselstyn was bucking a
high-tech, high-cost system

1028
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:15,010
that was deeply entrenched
in both big medicine

1029
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,012
and big government.

1030
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:19,014
You know, behind my back,

1031
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:21,517
I got to be known as Dr. Sprouts.

1032
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:25,541
But I guess I've always
liked a challenge.

1033
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:31,026
We preheated the oven,
got the water going.

1034
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:32,547
I just added some seasonings.

1035
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:35,030
And then we add the
onions and the spinach.

1036
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,533
I've never been a morning
person, my whole life.

1037
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:42,037
And, uh, but previous
to this experience,

1038
00:47:42,057 --> 00:47:46,542
um, it had probably
been worse than ever.

1039
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:51,046
And that entailed needing
to get up in the morning

1040
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:53,549
and caffeinate myself

1041
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:56,051
with cokes and red bulls
and stuff like that,

1042
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:59,555
uh, before I could even
think or start to work.

1043
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:01,557
We didn't make the rice noodles,

1044
00:48:01,577 --> 00:48:04,059
but you can just
boil them real quick

1045
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,561
and then throw this
on top of them.

1046
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:07,062
Right, right.

1047
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:09,064
He's actually eating more often,

1048
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:12,067
but he's eating the right
foods, and he lost weight.

1049
00:48:12,087 --> 00:48:15,070
So he certainly feels
much better that way.

1050
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,592
And you can tell it in
his face, in his neck,

1051
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:19,074
you know, in his belly.

1052
00:48:19,094 --> 00:48:21,076
It's all...
he's lost a lot of weight there.

1053
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:22,578
He also has a better energy.

1054
00:48:22,598 --> 00:48:24,079
Um, he's waking up earlier now.

1055
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:27,082
That's great, because we have
then some morning time together.

1056
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:29,585
I don't have to carry anything.

1057
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:31,086
You're the doctor.

1058
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,092
1990.

1059
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:40,095
Following nearly a decade
of intense effort,

1060
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:42,097
Dr. Campbell and his colleagues

1061
00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:44,099
finally publish
their China Study.

1062
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,103
It identified no less
than 94,000 correlations

1063
00:48:48,123 --> 00:48:50,105
between diet and disease.

1064
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,608
Those are big numbers
for any study.

1065
00:48:52,628 --> 00:48:54,109
And in the end of the day,

1066
00:48:54,129 --> 00:48:56,612
when we did all these
correlations in this book here,

1067
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:58,113
and we looked at
the number of them

1068
00:48:58,133 --> 00:49:00,115
that were statistically
significant,

1069
00:49:00,135 --> 00:49:03,118
it was between about
8,000 to 9,000.

1070
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:04,620
When you have that large
number of correlations

1071
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,623
then you start
analyzing each one,

1072
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:09,625
if it works out as
statistically significant,

1073
00:49:09,645 --> 00:49:11,627
this means that if 19 out of 20

1074
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:13,629
are pointing in the
same direction,

1075
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:15,631
it's highly significant

1076
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:18,133
and likely to be true.

1077
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:20,135
Hundreds of detailed
tables and charts

1078
00:49:20,155 --> 00:49:21,637
were included in the study.

1079
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:25,140
Each one presented the raw
data that was collected.

1080
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,162
Then this information
was cross-referenced

1081
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:30,145
in multiple ways to
demonstrate its reliability

1082
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:33,148
and to show how it linked
with the 367 variables

1083
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:35,150
the study examined.

1084
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,152
I think the major message

1085
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:43,659
we got out of all these
correlation analyses

1086
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,662
is only one message.

1087
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:49,164
The plant food-based diet,

1088
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:53,168
mainly cereal grains,
vegetables, and fruits,

1089
00:49:53,188 --> 00:49:56,672
and very little animal food

1090
00:49:56,692 --> 00:50:03,178
is always associated with lower
mortality of certain cancers,

1091
00:50:03,198 --> 00:50:07,182
stroke, and coronary
heart disease.

1092
00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:09,184
The New York Times called it

1093
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:12,187
"the most comprehensive
large study ever undertaken

1094
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:13,689
"of the relationship
between diet

1095
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:16,211
and the risk of
developing disease."

1096
00:50:16,712 --> 00:50:20,696
For Dr. Campbell, he finally had
large-scale data on people,

1097
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:24,700
and it was remarkably consistent
with his earlier discoveries.

1098
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,705
Together, he found that the
scientific evidence was clear:

1099
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:33,208
Whole, plant-based foods were
beneficial to human health,

1100
00:50:33,228 --> 00:50:35,730
while animal-based
foods were not.

1101
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:45,721
San'Dera Nation's journey
to better health

1102
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:48,223
wasn't easy at first.

1103
00:50:48,243 --> 00:50:50,726
It was a little hard, 'cause
I'd been eating fatty foods

1104
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:54,229
and grease and
everything for 38 years,

1105
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:56,732
you know, as long
as I can remember,

1106
00:50:56,752 --> 00:50:59,755
so it was kinda hard
to go from that

1107
00:51:00,255 --> 00:51:03,238
to changing the next
day completely.

1108
00:51:03,258 --> 00:51:06,742
I started a journal for maybe
the first three weeks,

1109
00:51:06,762 --> 00:51:09,244
write down my feelings
and emotions,

1110
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:11,747
what I felt like...
So that other people

1111
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:14,750
could know it's okay
to feel that way.

1112
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,752
Along the way,

1113
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:19,755
San'Dera had strong support
from Dr. Esselstyn

1114
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:21,757
and his wife Ann.

1115
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:24,259
They keep in touch,
and they're like,

1116
00:51:24,279 --> 00:51:25,761
"we haven't forgotten
about you,"

1117
00:51:25,781 --> 00:51:27,262
and I know they haven't.

1118
00:51:27,282 --> 00:51:29,765
I really feel here
that they haven't.

1119
00:51:29,785 --> 00:51:31,767
"I went to Wal-Mart this day.

1120
00:51:31,787 --> 00:51:33,268
"I had wanted a subway sandwich,

1121
00:51:33,288 --> 00:51:35,270
"and I said I'm gonna get
me that meatball sub.

1122
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:38,774
"I then received a call
while I was at Wal-Mart

1123
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:41,276
"from Mrs. Esselstyn,

1124
00:51:41,296 --> 00:51:45,280
"as if they knew I was
weak at this moment.

1125
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,282
"She stated, 'promise me

1126
00:51:47,302 --> 00:51:50,285
"you will not eat
anything from Wal-Mart.'

1127
00:51:50,305 --> 00:51:52,788
"it gave me chills to know that
she called at that moment.

1128
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:54,790
"Therefore I left the store

1129
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,812
without getting
that meatball sub."

1130
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,314
What do you see?

1131
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:02,798
While Dr. Campbell was
publishing his China Study,

1132
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,801
Dr. Esselstyn was getting
some powerful data

1133
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:08,804
from the research
he'd started in 1985.

1134
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:11,306
He began with 24 patients,

1135
00:52:11,326 --> 00:52:14,309
but 6 had dropped out
in the first year,

1136
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:16,311
leaving him with a total of 18.

1137
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:19,815
At the end of five years, we
had follow-up angiograms,

1138
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:22,317
and 11 of the group had
halted their disease.

1139
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:23,819
There was no progression.

1140
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,823
And there were four where we
had rather exciting evidence

1141
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:29,825
of regression of disease.

1142
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:31,827
These results were astonishing.

1143
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:35,330
The diet produced something
that medication and surgery

1144
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:40,335
never had before: Actual
reversals of heart disease.

1145
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:43,839
The biological mechanism
that caused these reversals

1146
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:46,361
centers on the lining of
our veins and arteries...

1147
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:48,844
the endothelial cells.

1148
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:50,846
They are the absolute
life jackets

1149
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:52,347
of our blood vessels.

1150
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:55,350
You're young, and you're a
teenager, you're healthy,

1151
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,853
you could spread those
out one layer thick,

1152
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:58,854
and you'd have something
that would cover

1153
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:00,856
six or eight tennis courts.

1154
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:03,859
In 1988, scientists discovered

1155
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:05,360
that endothelial
cells manufactured

1156
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,863
the gas nitric oxide.

1157
00:53:07,883 --> 00:53:10,365
Well, what did nitric oxide do?

1158
00:53:10,385 --> 00:53:15,370
Nitric oxide keeps our
blood flowing smoothly

1159
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,372
without being sticky.

1160
00:53:17,392 --> 00:53:20,375
It also helps to dilate
constricted blood vessels

1161
00:53:20,395 --> 00:53:21,877
during physical activity

1162
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:24,880
and inhibits the
formation of plaque.

1163
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,884
And most importantly, nitric
oxide is a powerful force

1164
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:32,387
for eliminating the inflammation

1165
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:34,890
that seems to go
with this plaque.

1166
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,893
However, scientific
tests have demonstrated

1167
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:40,395
that when we start eating
the typical Western diet,

1168
00:53:40,415 --> 00:53:43,899
our endothelial
cells are damaged.

1169
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:46,902
When you're getting to be in
your 40s and 50s and 60s,

1170
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:49,905
and you've been slaughtering
your endothelial cells,

1171
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:51,907
you don't have those six
or eight tennis courts.

1172
00:53:51,927 --> 00:53:53,909
You may be down to one
and a half or two,

1173
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:55,911
and they can't protect you.

1174
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:58,413
Yet according to Dr. Esselstyn,

1175
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:01,917
when we begin eating a whole
foods, plant-based diet,

1176
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:04,920
the damage to our endothelial
cells not only stops,

1177
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,442
it starts to reverse.

1178
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,933
About five years into his study,

1179
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:20,435
Esselstyn made a small
but significant change

1180
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:21,937
in his patients' menu.

1181
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:24,439
It started in 1990,

1182
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:27,442
when he read the glowing review
of Dr. Campbell's China Study

1183
00:54:27,462 --> 00:54:30,445
the New York Times.

1184
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:32,447
Dr. Esselstyn saw that,

1185
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:34,449
and he invited me to
come to a conference

1186
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:36,451
he was organizing in Arizona.

1187
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:38,453
These two revolutionaries,

1188
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:41,957
who, up until then, had been
on similar but separate paths

1189
00:54:41,977 --> 00:54:45,460
finally met face-to-face.

1190
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,482
On the one hand, I'm coming
from the scientific group,

1191
00:54:47,983 --> 00:54:49,464
getting some ideas.

1192
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:50,966
He's coming from
the clinical route

1193
00:54:50,986 --> 00:54:53,969
and doing some
dramatic research.

1194
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:56,972
Here's the science, here's
the clinical evidence.

1195
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,473
Put the two together,
it's amazing.

1196
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:00,976
When he learned of
Campbell's research,

1197
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:05,480
Esselstyn removed dairy products
from his patients' diet.

1198
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,483
The results of his ongoing study
continued to be impressive,

1199
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:10,986
and in 1995, he
published a paper

1200
00:55:11,006 --> 00:55:14,489
detailing them in a noted
scientific journal.

1201
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:17,993
Yet one of Esselstyn's most
remarkable success stories

1202
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:20,495
involved a colleague of his
at the Cleveland Clinic,

1203
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:22,998
Dr. Joseph Crowe.

1204
00:55:23,018 --> 00:55:27,002
Actually I was, um,
active, healthy,

1205
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:28,503
very busy,

1206
00:55:28,523 --> 00:55:34,009
uh, mid-40s, absolutely,
um, no risk factors

1207
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:38,513
at all for any heart problem.

1208
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:41,016
But Dr. Crowe, even with
what was considered to be

1209
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:43,018
a healthy cholesterol level,

1210
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:46,021
was actually ravaged
by heart disease.

1211
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:48,023
This angiogram,

1212
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:51,526
taken after his first nearly
fatal heart attack in 1996,

1213
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:53,528
shows how badly damaged

1214
00:55:53,548 --> 00:55:56,031
one of his coronary
arteries was.

1215
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:59,034
This angiogram was done
after less than three years

1216
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:01,556
of entirely dietary treatment.

1217
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:10,565
Dr. Crowe was fortunate.

1218
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:13,548
In 25% of cases, sudden death

1219
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:18,553
is the first and only sign
of coronary artery disease.

1220
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:22,557
Of Dr. Esselstyn's
original 18 patients,

1221
00:56:22,577 --> 00:56:26,061
all survived the initial
12 years of the study.

1222
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:29,064
Today, 14 patients
are still alive

1223
00:56:29,084 --> 00:56:32,567
over two decades after
the study began.

1224
00:56:32,587 --> 00:56:36,571
The thing about Essy, although
he's always very pleasant,

1225
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:39,574
when you said, "I'm going
to be on this program

1226
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:41,095
and I'm going to stay
with this diet,"

1227
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:44,079
you stayed with the diet,
or there was the door.

1228
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:45,580
You had no choice.

1229
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,584
I mean, his smiles
are wonderful,

1230
00:56:49,604 --> 00:56:51,086
but he is very stern.

1231
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:53,088
You know, that's why
I'm still living.

1232
00:56:53,108 --> 00:56:55,090
But, you know, he's just...

1233
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:59,094
He's just a wonderful man.

1234
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:00,115
And I look at the pictures...

1235
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:03,618
Some of my pictures
years ago, 20 years ago

1236
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:06,101
actually looks older than today.

1237
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:10,105
The only thing is I lost
more hair, you know?

1238
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,107
Anthony and the
other male patients

1239
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:13,608
also noted another change.

1240
00:57:13,628 --> 00:57:15,110
When you're young,

1241
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,611
when you were teenager,

1242
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:21,616
you see a female or so on,
it gets kind of excited.

1243
00:57:21,636 --> 00:57:24,619
And the first
reaction physically,

1244
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:27,122
you know, it gets
attention, you know?

1245
00:57:27,142 --> 00:57:29,124
Raise the flag, I call it.

1246
00:57:29,144 --> 00:57:33,128
This happened to us,
all the other, uh,

1247
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:36,631
Dr. Esselstyn's, uh, I call
'em all the Guinea pigs.

1248
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:39,634
The flag still rises.

1249
00:57:39,654 --> 00:57:42,137
Talking to your doctor about E.D.

1250
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:44,139
may be the last
thing you wanna do,

1251
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:46,141
but it's definitely a
conversation worth having.

1252
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:48,143
I'm a practicing urologist

1253
00:57:48,163 --> 00:57:50,645
and have been so for
the last 25 years.

1254
00:57:50,665 --> 00:57:52,667
And erectile dysfunction
is actually

1255
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:55,150
the first clinical indicator

1256
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,653
of generalized
cardiovascular disease.

1257
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:00,655
It's the canary
in the coal mine.

1258
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:02,157
It's the thing
that lets you know

1259
00:58:02,177 --> 00:58:04,679
that you have some
significant endothelial

1260
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,661
and vascular disease,

1261
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:09,664
much earlier than
will a heart attack

1262
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:11,166
or something like that.

1263
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:12,667
We have to stop
thinking of the body

1264
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:15,170
like it's compartmentalized.
It really isn't.

1265
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,672
The blood goes
everywhere in the body.

1266
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:21,195
And so if you have
vascular disease anywhere,

1267
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:24,179
you have it everywhere.

1268
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,682
Despite the apparent success
of the dietary approach,

1269
00:58:27,702 --> 00:58:33,688
some critics say eating
this way is extreme.

1270
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:36,691
Now, with the Western diet,

1271
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:38,693
this guarantees there
are gonna be what?

1272
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:40,695
A half a million people
in this country this year

1273
00:58:40,715 --> 00:58:44,699
who will have to have the front
half of their body divided,

1274
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,202
their heart exposed,

1275
00:58:47,222 --> 00:58:49,704
then veins will be
taken from their leg

1276
00:58:49,724 --> 00:58:51,206
and sewed on their heart.

1277
00:58:51,226 --> 00:58:53,708
Some people would
call that extreme.

1278
00:58:53,728 --> 00:58:57,231
Dr. Esselstyn has now
successfully treated

1279
00:58:57,732 --> 00:59:00,215
over 250 patients
with heart disease,

1280
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:04,719
using almost exclusively a
whole foods, plant-based diet.

1281
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:06,221
Heart disease, as far
as I'm concerned,

1282
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:09,224
is an absolutely
toothless paper tiger

1283
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:11,726
that need never, ever exist.

1284
00:59:11,746 --> 00:59:15,750
And if it does exist, it
need never, ever progress.

1285
00:59:39,774 --> 00:59:42,257
Las Vegas, Nevada.

1286
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:44,259
At the Xtreme Couture gym,

1287
00:59:44,279 --> 00:59:46,781
we found an extraordinary
plant-based athlete...

1288
00:59:47,282 --> 00:59:50,265
ultimate fighter
champion Mac Danzig.

1289
00:59:50,285 --> 00:59:52,767
In the mixed martial arts world,

1290
00:59:52,787 --> 00:59:55,270
strength, toughness,
and endurance

1291
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,792
are of Paramount importance,
and Mac has them all.

1292
01:00:00,295 --> 01:00:03,798
I had cut dairy out of my diet
when I was about 18 years old,

1293
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:05,800
um, because I had a, uh...

1294
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:08,783
Ear, nose, and throat
allergy to dairy,

1295
01:00:08,803 --> 01:00:10,285
and I was getting a
lot of ear infections

1296
01:00:10,305 --> 01:00:11,786
and things like that.

1297
01:00:11,806 --> 01:00:14,789
So when I cut that out,
really the only thing

1298
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:17,792
that was separating me
from having a vegan diet

1299
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:18,793
was chicken and fish.

1300
01:00:18,813 --> 01:00:20,295
So I was just eating
that for years,

1301
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:23,298
and I was eating it because
I thought that I needed to,

1302
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:25,300
because everyone
tells you, you know,

1303
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,801
if you're an athlete,
you need, you know,

1304
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:29,304
at least chicken and fish
in your diet for protein.

1305
01:00:29,324 --> 01:00:31,306
You know, something that's
just one of the myths

1306
01:00:31,326 --> 01:00:33,828
that's been perpetuated
for a while.

1307
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,813
All it took was me cutting
the chicken and fish out,

1308
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,814
and I did it cold turkey.

1309
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:42,317
I think a lot of people,
stereotypically speaking,

1310
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:44,319
think someone that's
a vegan is, like,

1311
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:45,820
some skinny hippie
type of person,

1312
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,323
and, uh, you know,
I'm not necessarily

1313
01:00:48,343 --> 01:00:50,325
trying to break the stereotype.

1314
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:53,828
I just... I tried the diet
for my own personal reasons,

1315
01:00:53,848 --> 01:00:54,849
and it worked for me,

1316
01:00:58,353 --> 01:00:59,334
I feel like I have more energy

1317
01:00:59,354 --> 01:01:01,836
now that I don't eat
the meat products.

1318
01:01:01,856 --> 01:01:05,860
And I also feel like I recover
better in between my workouts.

1319
01:01:07,362 --> 01:01:10,345
I'm not trying to be part
of some exclusive club

1320
01:01:10,365 --> 01:01:11,846
or anything like that.

1321
01:01:11,866 --> 01:01:14,849
I'm just doing my
thing, and, um,

1322
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:17,352
you know, don't plan on
eating meat or dairy

1323
01:01:17,372 --> 01:01:19,374
or anything like that for
the rest of my life.

1324
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:26,861
This, uh, guide is called the
type "a" planning guide.

1325
01:01:26,881 --> 01:01:30,365
Now, it includes
foods that are found

1326
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:31,866
in the basic four food groups,

1327
01:01:31,886 --> 01:01:35,370
because we are concerned
about the total daily needs,

1328
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,391
and this is a part of it.

1329
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:39,874
We must serve 1/2 pint
of fresh fluid milk

1330
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:44,879
to provide calcium, riboflavin,

1331
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:48,883
and the other nutrients that
are needed for our children.

1332
01:01:48,903 --> 01:01:49,884
For decades,

1333
01:01:49,904 --> 01:01:51,906
the dairy industry
and U.S. government

1334
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:55,390
have been saying that milk
is good for our bones.

1335
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,393
While all whole foods
contain calcium,

1336
01:01:58,413 --> 01:02:00,895
an essential nutrient
for bone health,

1337
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:02,897
it is argued that we
need the higher amounts

1338
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,399
found in dairy.

1339
01:02:04,419 --> 01:02:06,901
Children and aging
women in particular

1340
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:12,407
have been singled out to drink
more and more and more milk.

1341
01:02:12,427 --> 01:02:13,908
What do you think the
most important nutrient

1342
01:02:13,928 --> 01:02:15,429
we get from dairy
products is, like milk?

1343
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:16,911
Calcium.

1344
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:18,413
- Calcium.
- Calcium.

1345
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:19,434
- Calcium.
- Calcium.

1346
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:21,416
- Calcium.
- Calcium.

1347
01:02:21,436 --> 01:02:22,417
Calcium.

1348
01:02:22,437 --> 01:02:23,438
Calcium.

1349
01:02:24,939 --> 01:02:28,923
The science in terms of
dairy's role in healthy bones

1350
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:29,944
is pretty strong,

1351
01:02:30,445 --> 01:02:32,447
and, in fact, the national
osteoporosis foundation,

1352
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:35,930
of course, utilizes that science
in their recommendations.

1353
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,933
Osteoporosis is a
degenerative bone disease,

1354
01:02:38,953 --> 01:02:42,437
which has been widely linked
to a lack of calcium.

1355
01:02:42,457 --> 01:02:45,940
If this is true, nations with a
high intake of dairy products,

1356
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,943
which are a major source of
calcium in a westernized diet,

1357
01:02:48,963 --> 01:02:52,947
should have low levels
of osteoporosis.

1358
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:54,949
But according to a study

1359
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:57,452
done by a distinguished
Harvard researcher,

1360
01:02:57,472 --> 01:03:00,455
nations with high levels
of calcium intake

1361
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:02,457
tend to have high levels
of hip fractures,

1362
01:03:02,477 --> 01:03:06,461
which is a key indicator
for osteoporosis.

1363
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:09,464
And so, in fact, the higher
the dairy consumption,

1364
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:11,466
the higher the rate
of osteoporosis...

1365
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:13,468
exactly the opposite of
what the dairy industry

1366
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,970
has been telling us for so long.

1367
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,974
One of the primary mechanisms
for that is that animal protein

1368
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:22,977
tends to create an acid-like
condition in the body

1369
01:03:22,997 --> 01:03:25,480
called metabolic acidosis.

1370
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,981
To combat this condition,

1371
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:31,486
the body draws upon its most
readily available acid buffer,

1372
01:03:31,506 --> 01:03:33,988
namely calcium in our bones.

1373
01:03:34,008 --> 01:03:37,492
As the calcium is extracted to
neutralize the excess acid,

1374
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,994
our bones are weakened.

1375
01:03:40,014 --> 01:03:42,997
In defending the health
benefits of milk,

1376
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:46,000
many national health
organizations now recommend

1377
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,503
that we consume low-fat
dairy products.

1378
01:03:48,523 --> 01:03:51,005
It can be milk,
it can be yogurt,

1379
01:03:51,025 --> 01:03:54,509
it can be cheese, it can be
anything made from milk.

1380
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:57,512
But again, the
important message,

1381
01:03:57,532 --> 01:03:58,513
it's a message that comes

1382
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:00,515
from the American
Dietetic Association,

1383
01:04:00,535 --> 01:04:04,018
the National Osteoporosis
Foundation, Cancer, Heart,

1384
01:04:04,038 --> 01:04:06,020
we're all on the same page.

1385
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,023
It needs to be
low-fat or fat-free.

1386
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:10,525
So as the fat's taken out,

1387
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:15,029
the protein becomes a larger
proportion of the total.

1388
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:19,033
So they become higher in
protein, lower in fat.

1389
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:22,036
And when we compare
these high-protein,

1390
01:04:22,056 --> 01:04:24,539
low-fat milk products,
for example,

1391
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,040
with prostate cancer,

1392
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,062
the relationship is
as strong as it is

1393
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:30,064
for cigarette smoking
and lung cancer.

1394
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:35,550
Most of these animals here
are what we call heifers.

1395
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,551
Uh-huh.

1396
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:39,053
They're the young
females, not yet cows.

1397
01:04:39,073 --> 01:04:41,055
So they haven't had
their first calf yet.

1398
01:04:41,075 --> 01:04:42,056
Haven't had their first calf.

1399
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:43,558
So they have to have
their first calf

1400
01:04:43,578 --> 01:04:44,559
before they can lactate.

1401
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:45,560
And once they come
into lactation,

1402
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,061
they almost keep
them, these days,

1403
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:48,563
they keep them
pregnant continuously

1404
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,064
for three of four years.

1405
01:04:50,084 --> 01:04:52,066
Why are they eating grass now?

1406
01:04:52,086 --> 01:04:53,568
Well, this is the last
time, in their lifetime,

1407
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:55,069
they're going to see grass.

1408
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:56,090
After that they're in the barn,

1409
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:59,073
they're standing up for
the rest of their life.

1410
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:02,076
When I was young, we
defended our product,

1411
01:05:02,096 --> 01:05:03,077
promoted our product,

1412
01:05:03,097 --> 01:05:05,079
because it was nature's
most perfect food.

1413
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:08,583
And, uh, so I believed that.

1414
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:12,086
But it took a slightly different
twist as time passed.

1415
01:05:12,106 --> 01:05:15,089
I mean, it's the most
perfect food for calves.

1416
01:05:15,109 --> 01:05:17,592
And trying to switch the milk of
one species to another species

1417
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:19,614
doesn't make a lotta sense.

1418
01:05:23,117 --> 01:05:25,600
Only two months
into her treatment,

1419
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,102
San'Dera was experiencing
dramatic effects

1420
01:05:28,122 --> 01:05:32,106
on her type 2 diabetes
and hypertension.

1421
01:05:32,126 --> 01:05:34,628
Since I've been on a
plant-based diet,

1422
01:05:35,129 --> 01:05:37,111
blood pressure's been wonderful.

1423
01:05:37,131 --> 01:05:39,614
My blood sugars are in the 80s.

1424
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:41,115
It shocks me, 70s.

1425
01:05:41,135 --> 01:05:43,117
So I was alarmed when it was 60.

1426
01:05:43,137 --> 01:05:46,120
I'm like, "aah!
Isn't that bad? It's 60?"

1427
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,122
You know, and I talked to
the diabetes educator,

1428
01:05:48,142 --> 01:05:49,123
which is wonderful.

1429
01:05:49,143 --> 01:05:51,626
She's like, "no, that's
a normal blood sugar."

1430
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:54,629
You're pancreas is working,
it's reversing."

1431
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:56,631
Ironically, San'Dera works

1432
01:05:56,651 --> 01:05:59,133
at an outpatient
facility for diabetics.

1433
01:05:59,153 --> 01:06:01,135
Yet the treatment that was

1434
01:06:01,155 --> 01:06:03,137
achieving success
with her diabetes

1435
01:06:03,157 --> 01:06:06,140
came from outside the
established medical system.

1436
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,643
The positive results
went far beyond

1437
01:06:08,663 --> 01:06:11,145
San'Dera's chronic diseases.

1438
01:06:11,165 --> 01:06:13,648
Mentally, not having
the sluggishness,

1439
01:06:13,668 --> 01:06:16,651
the fear of the
disease progressing.

1440
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:18,152
Because I feel I'm in control

1441
01:06:18,172 --> 01:06:20,655
and have power of taking
it back the right way now.

1442
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:23,658
So, mentally, I feel great.

1443
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:25,660
I'm eating the
things I should eat.

1444
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,662
The one thing that is
true that Ann said to me,

1445
01:06:27,682 --> 01:06:29,163
"you really start tasting

1446
01:06:29,183 --> 01:06:30,684
the real taste of
what you're eating,"

1447
01:06:31,185 --> 01:06:32,667
cause I'd eat a peach,
and you'd think...

1448
01:06:32,687 --> 01:06:36,170
I was in heaven with
my white peaches.

1449
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,171
I get to eat,

1450
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:39,173
and that feels good
to be able to eat,

1451
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:40,675
bringing the sugar down,

1452
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:42,176
you're losing the weight,

1453
01:06:42,196 --> 01:06:44,178
your whole everything changes.

1454
01:06:44,198 --> 01:06:45,699
You know, I think we're
a little dependent

1455
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,683
on, you know, our doctors
and the medications.

1456
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,685
We should take a little
bit more responsibility

1457
01:06:50,705 --> 01:06:52,186
and check it out for ourselves.

1458
01:06:52,206 --> 01:06:54,689
And speaking of doctors
and medications,

1459
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:57,191
how does San'Dera's
regular physician

1460
01:06:57,211 --> 01:06:58,693
feel about her new lifestyle?

1461
01:06:58,713 --> 01:07:01,195
When I recently approached her

1462
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:04,699
about my blood sugars
being so great,

1463
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:10,204
my question was, "should I
not take my medication?"

1464
01:07:10,224 --> 01:07:12,707
She said, "no, you still
take your medications."

1465
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:16,711
And she said, "what is
that doctor trying to do?

1466
01:07:16,731 --> 01:07:18,713
Take you off your medications?"

1467
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:23,718
And I'm looking like, "yeah,
I'm hoping that's the...

1468
01:07:23,738 --> 01:07:25,219
The goal."

1469
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:29,223
So there's still people we
have to make believers, yeah.

1470
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:35,229
Sally and Jim eat their
breakfast at about 7:00.

1471
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:38,733
It's a good breakfast of
good foundation foods.

1472
01:07:38,753 --> 01:07:41,736
Today, they're
having milk, cereal,

1473
01:07:41,756 --> 01:07:44,238
poached eggs, and
sliced oranges.

1474
01:07:44,258 --> 01:07:46,240
They are starting the day right.

1475
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,743
The key agency that sets

1476
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:50,745
nutritional guidelines
for Americans

1477
01:07:50,765 --> 01:07:53,748
is the United States
Department of Agriculture,

1478
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:56,751
the USDA.
Helps determine what foods are served

1479
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:58,753
to everyone from our
soldiers in the field

1480
01:07:58,773 --> 01:08:02,256
to our kids in their
school cafeterias.

1481
01:08:02,276 --> 01:08:04,778
These guidelines are also
taught in our schools,

1482
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:07,261
influencing what our
children will eat

1483
01:08:07,281 --> 01:08:09,263
for the rest of their lives.

1484
01:08:09,283 --> 01:08:11,785
Dr. David Klurfeld is a
nutritional scientist

1485
01:08:12,286 --> 01:08:14,769
and national program
leader for human nutrition

1486
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:18,272
with the USDA's agricultural research service.

1487
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:20,274
We've made dietary
recommendations

1488
01:08:20,294 --> 01:08:23,277
since the 1890s, from USDA,

1489
01:08:23,297 --> 01:08:26,280
and that was before we knew
about vitamins and minerals.

1490
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,784
Subsequently, we've had
different food groups,

1491
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:31,786
and we had the basic 4

1492
01:08:31,806 --> 01:08:33,307
and 5 and 7 and 12,

1493
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:35,790
and it varied as the
science changed.

1494
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:38,292
Perhaps the best known
of the food groups

1495
01:08:38,312 --> 01:08:41,796
was the "basic four",
introduced in 1956

1496
01:08:41,816 --> 01:08:43,798
in a leaflet called
"Food for Fitness".

1497
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:47,802
The mainstay of nutrition
education for over 30 years,

1498
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:49,303
the basic four defined

1499
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:51,305
what an entire
generation of Americans

1500
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:53,808
believed was healthy to eat.

1501
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:56,811
The four food groups
was replaced in 1992

1502
01:08:56,831 --> 01:09:01,816
by the "food pyramid," then
updated by "my pyramid".

1503
01:09:01,836 --> 01:09:03,317
These guidelines recommend

1504
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:05,820
three servings of dairy
products per day,

1505
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,824
and meat is still a primary
source of protein.

1506
01:09:09,844 --> 01:09:13,828
In following "my pyramid",
a 15-year-old girl

1507
01:09:13,848 --> 01:09:15,329
can eat a daily menu consisting

1508
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:18,332
of a bowl of lucky
charms with low-fat milk

1509
01:09:18,352 --> 01:09:21,836
and a glass of orange juice
from concentrate for breakfast,

1510
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:23,838
cheese-flavored crackers
for a morning snack,

1511
01:09:23,858 --> 01:09:26,340
a cheeseburger on
a whole-grain bun

1512
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,843
with French-fries and
a coke for lunch,

1513
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:31,345
chocolate pudding and grapes
for an afternoon snack,

1514
01:09:31,365 --> 01:09:33,347
and chicken nuggets
with a biscuit

1515
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:35,349
and canned green
beans for dinner

1516
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:37,871
with low-fat ice
cream for dessert.

1517
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:42,356
I see now what's
happening with the way

1518
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:45,860
that we feed many of our
children in our school systems.

1519
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,363
We shouldn't be surprised that
we're seeing childhood obesity

1520
01:09:49,383 --> 01:09:50,865
at the rates that
we're seeing it.

1521
01:09:50,885 --> 01:09:53,868
Dr. Neal Barnard is a
medical researcher

1522
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:56,370
and president of the
physicians committee

1523
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,872
for responsible medicine.

1524
01:09:57,892 --> 01:10:00,875
Well, the problem is, when
a kid is pulling his tray

1525
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:02,376
down the school lunch line,

1526
01:10:02,396 --> 01:10:04,879
you see federal
policies in action.

1527
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:06,881
There are burgers
topped with cheese,

1528
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:08,883
the milk is heavily subsidized.

1529
01:10:08,903 --> 01:10:11,886
But the vegetables and fruits,
a little bit harder to find.

1530
01:10:11,906 --> 01:10:13,888
And this is because the
government contracts

1531
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:16,891
are going to particularly
the meat producers

1532
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:18,392
and other producers as well.

1533
01:10:18,412 --> 01:10:19,894
It has nothing to do with
the health of the children.

1534
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:22,416
It has all to do with
the financial health

1535
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:24,919
of the big
agribusiness entities.

1536
01:10:25,419 --> 01:10:27,401
What we have with the USDA

1537
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:29,923
is it's really a farmers
advocacy organization.

1538
01:10:30,424 --> 01:10:32,406
And, okay let's have one,

1539
01:10:32,426 --> 01:10:35,910
but that same group cannot
advocate for farmers,

1540
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:38,913
help subsidize their operations,

1541
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:40,414
manage commodity foods,

1542
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:42,917
subsidize the price
of growing things,

1543
01:10:42,937 --> 01:10:43,918
and then turn around and say,

1544
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:45,920
"okay, we're going to
tell people what to eat."

1545
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,421
They're going to tell
people what to eat

1546
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:48,442
based on their constituents,

1547
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:50,925
which are the farmers,
not the American public.

1548
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:54,929
In 1998, Barnard's group sued the USDA.

1549
01:10:54,949 --> 01:10:57,431
Every five years, the
government reformulates

1550
01:10:57,451 --> 01:10:58,933
the dietary guidelines
for Americans.

1551
01:10:58,953 --> 01:11:01,435
That's the blueprint of what
Americans are supposed to eat

1552
01:11:01,455 --> 01:11:02,937
to be healthy.

1553
01:11:02,957 --> 01:11:07,441
And we looked at the panel that
pulled it together... 11 people.

1554
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:10,444
6 of the 11 had
financial relationships

1555
01:11:10,464 --> 01:11:11,965
with the food industry.

1556
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:13,447
So we said, hey, wait a minute.

1557
01:11:13,467 --> 01:11:15,950
There are laws about what
they're supposed to do

1558
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:18,452
and how transparent they
are supposed to be.

1559
01:11:18,472 --> 01:11:19,453
They violated those.

1560
01:11:19,473 --> 01:11:21,455
And we brought them to court,

1561
01:11:21,475 --> 01:11:24,959
and it was a long
trial, but we won.

1562
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:26,460
But that doesn't change the fact

1563
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,962
that the policies
they came up with

1564
01:11:27,982 --> 01:11:29,964
continued to favor industry
as they always have.

1565
01:11:29,984 --> 01:11:32,466
I don't think there
really is a problem

1566
01:11:32,486 --> 01:11:35,970
with industry connections
between scientists

1567
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,972
and the food industry,

1568
01:11:37,992 --> 01:11:41,495
primarily because if
the beef industry

1569
01:11:41,996 --> 01:11:43,978
has a question about
their products,

1570
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:47,481
shouldn't they go to
the best scientists?

1571
01:11:47,501 --> 01:11:48,983
And if the best scientists

1572
01:11:49,003 --> 01:11:51,485
are consulting for
the food industry,

1573
01:11:51,505 --> 01:11:56,991
I still want the best
scientists on these committees

1574
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:58,993
that make nutritional
recommendations.

1575
01:11:59,013 --> 01:12:00,995
Financial conflict of interest

1576
01:12:01,015 --> 01:12:03,998
is only one conflict
of interest.

1577
01:12:04,018 --> 01:12:04,999
You know, there are people

1578
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:07,001
who've spent their
entire careers

1579
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:11,005
trying to prove that a
vegetarian diet is good for you

1580
01:12:11,025 --> 01:12:12,526
or that red meat is bad for you.

1581
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:15,009
Now, they may not
have industry ties,

1582
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:18,012
but they too have a
conflict of interest.

1583
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:20,514
You know, we do develop
biases personally.

1584
01:12:20,534 --> 01:12:22,016
I had those biases, too.

1585
01:12:22,036 --> 01:12:25,019
But I got to a
point in my career

1586
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,022
that I was getting results
that went against

1587
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:30,024
what I had thought was true.

1588
01:12:30,044 --> 01:12:36,050
So I had to self-reflect,
criticize my own bias,

1589
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:38,032
look at it really carefully,

1590
01:12:38,052 --> 01:12:40,034
and I changed my views.

1591
01:12:40,054 --> 01:12:43,537
Dr. Campbell paid a price
for changing his views.

1592
01:12:43,557 --> 01:12:45,039
He's been marginalized

1593
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:48,042
by key administrators
of his own university,

1594
01:12:48,062 --> 01:12:50,044
this after being
a lead scientist

1595
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,546
and securing millions of
dollars in research grants

1596
01:12:52,566 --> 01:12:55,549
for Cornell's nutritional
sciences division.

1597
01:12:55,569 --> 01:12:57,551
He had a popular
nutrition course

1598
01:12:57,571 --> 01:12:59,553
canceled by the
division director

1599
01:12:59,573 --> 01:13:01,055
who had long been a
major consultant

1600
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:03,057
to the dairy industry.

1601
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:06,560
Numerous observers feel this
was an arbitrary decision

1602
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:09,563
that violated the standards
of academic freedom.

1603
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:13,567
Dr. Campbell has also witnessed
serious corporate influence

1604
01:13:13,587 --> 01:13:15,088
over research that
is used to develop

1605
01:13:15,589 --> 01:13:17,571
the government's
nutrition policy.

1606
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:20,074
One example he cites centers on

1607
01:13:20,094 --> 01:13:23,077
the prestigious national
academy of sciences.

1608
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:25,579
The building behind
me here is perhaps

1609
01:13:25,599 --> 01:13:28,101
the single most
important building

1610
01:13:28,602 --> 01:13:30,084
in the area of science
in the country.

1611
01:13:30,104 --> 01:13:33,087
This is where scientists
participate in deliberations

1612
01:13:33,107 --> 01:13:34,588
about issues of the day

1613
01:13:34,608 --> 01:13:38,612
and determine how that science
can be used to affect policy.

1614
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:40,594
In the early days
when I was involved,

1615
01:13:40,614 --> 01:13:44,098
those panels were mostly
funded by public money.

1616
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:46,600
But on the other hand,
in more recent years,

1617
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,103
I have seen more and
more corporate money

1618
01:13:49,123 --> 01:13:51,605
coming in to support
these activities

1619
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,608
and more and more people being
allowed on the committees,

1620
01:13:54,628 --> 01:13:56,610
especially the chairs
of the committee.

1621
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,112
And, of course, they can
pick the kind of people

1622
01:13:58,132 --> 01:13:59,613
they want to pick

1623
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:01,115
in order to get a certain
kind of conclusion.

1624
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:03,117
It's not the way it should be,

1625
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:05,119
and I'm sure that if the
public were to know

1626
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:09,143
how powerful is this influence,
they would be surely upset.

1627
01:14:28,662 --> 01:14:30,664
I had been a runner
for 14 years,

1628
01:14:31,165 --> 01:14:32,646
in fact, a marathoner.

1629
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:35,649
47 years old, the
top of my game.

1630
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:39,153
In 1982, Ruth Heidrich's
running career

1631
01:14:39,173 --> 01:14:40,154
came to a sudden stop

1632
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:42,656
when she was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

1633
01:14:42,676 --> 01:14:46,660
After a mastectomy, her doctors
recommended chemotherapy

1634
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,162
and radiation to
treat the cancer

1635
01:14:48,182 --> 01:14:51,165
that had by then spread
to her lungs and bones.

1636
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:54,668
Ruth decided to visit
Dr. John McDougall instead.

1637
01:14:54,688 --> 01:14:57,171
And I said, "Ruth, I
spent my residency

1638
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:59,173
"collecting information on
diet and breast cancer.

1639
01:14:59,193 --> 01:15:01,195
"It's all in these
files right here.

1640
01:15:01,695 --> 01:15:03,177
"Sit in my office
and read through it

1641
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:04,178
and see what you think."

1642
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:06,680
He said, "these are the
studies that show...

1643
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,182
"what I'm trying to prove

1644
01:15:08,202 --> 01:15:11,685
is that diet can reverse
breast cancer."

1645
01:15:11,705 --> 01:15:13,687
And she read it,

1646
01:15:13,707 --> 01:15:15,689
and she comes out and she says
"okay, I've changed my diet."

1647
01:15:15,709 --> 01:15:16,710
She changed her diet.

1648
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:19,193
So he showed me how to eat.

1649
01:15:19,213 --> 01:15:23,697
No added oils, lots of fruits
and vegetables, whole grains.

1650
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:25,699
Ruth then started training

1651
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:28,202
for the Ironman
Triathlon in Hawaii,

1652
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:30,204
which combines
running a marathon

1653
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:33,707
with long-distance
biking and swimming.

1654
01:15:33,727 --> 01:15:35,709
I became obsessed.

1655
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:37,711
Kept up the running, of
course, never stopped,

1656
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:39,713
and then added swimming, biking,

1657
01:15:39,733 --> 01:15:42,216
and, for good measure,
lifted weights.

1658
01:15:42,236 --> 01:15:44,718
And people were saying,
"you're crazy.

1659
01:15:44,738 --> 01:15:47,221
You're a cancer patient.
You should be resting."

1660
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:47,721
Doctors told me this.

1661
01:15:47,741 --> 01:15:49,723
I felt so good.

1662
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:52,226
I felt fit, and I wanted to
maintain that level of fitness.

1663
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:55,229
And I felt sure that if
I had a healthy body

1664
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:57,731
and I was putting the
right food into it

1665
01:15:57,751 --> 01:16:00,734
that I could beat this cancer.

1666
01:16:00,754 --> 01:16:04,238
At the Ironman Triathlon,

1667
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:07,241
Ruth won a gold medal
in her age group.

1668
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:09,243
Stuck with the diet.

1669
01:16:09,263 --> 01:16:11,245
Found out my arthritis
disappeared.

1670
01:16:11,265 --> 01:16:13,247
My constipation disappeared.

1671
01:16:13,267 --> 01:16:14,748
My dandruff disappeared.

1672
01:16:14,768 --> 01:16:16,250
No sign of depression,

1673
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:18,772
which you might expect
with a cancer diagnosis.

1674
01:16:19,273 --> 01:16:22,756
I felt renewed, invigorated,

1675
01:16:22,776 --> 01:16:26,760
and out to show that diet
is so much more important

1676
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,263
than anybody ever thought.

1677
01:16:29,283 --> 01:16:30,764
Mmm!

1678
01:16:30,784 --> 01:16:32,266
Other women get
over breast cancer,

1679
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:34,268
colon cancer, prostate cancer.

1680
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:35,789
There are people who've had
metastatic prostate cancer

1681
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,771
all over their body

1682
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:39,793
who have gone through what we
call spontaneous remission.

1683
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:41,775
In other words,
they've been cured.

1684
01:16:41,795 --> 01:16:42,776
And it's not the
end of the world

1685
01:16:42,796 --> 01:16:44,778
when you get this diagnosis.
Some people get over it.

1686
01:16:44,798 --> 01:16:45,799
Ruth did.

1687
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:49,783
So I'm still racing.

1688
01:16:49,803 --> 01:16:51,785
Still daily training.

1689
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:54,788
Now how many people in their
70s are doing triathlons?

1690
01:16:54,808 --> 01:16:56,290
Not very many.

1691
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:59,293
So that gives hope for
all of us as we age

1692
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:01,795
that not only will
you stay healthy

1693
01:17:01,815 --> 01:17:05,799
and beat the degenerative
diseases that most people get,

1694
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:08,321
but you can start
collecting medals.

1695
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,312
The food choices we make

1696
01:17:18,332 --> 01:17:20,334
have profound global effects.

1697
01:17:23,837 --> 01:17:26,320
It takes over ten times
the amount of energy

1698
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:29,823
from fossil fuels to produce a
calorie of animal-based food

1699
01:17:29,843 --> 01:17:32,826
than it does to produce a
calorie of plant food.

1700
01:17:32,846 --> 01:17:36,830
Since the 1970s, 20% of
the Amazon's rainforest

1701
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,351
has been destroyed.

1702
01:17:38,852 --> 01:17:41,835
That's an area the
size of California.

1703
01:17:41,855 --> 01:17:46,840
80% of this cleared land is
now occupied by livestock.

1704
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:49,843
The world's cattle alone
eat enough grain to feed

1705
01:17:49,863 --> 01:17:52,346
8.7 billion people,

1706
01:17:52,366 --> 01:17:56,850
nearly 2 billion more than
the population on earth.

1707
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:58,852
With almost a billion
malnourished people

1708
01:17:58,872 --> 01:18:02,356
across the globe, redirecting
even a portion of the grain

1709
01:18:02,376 --> 01:18:04,858
used to fatten cattle could feed

1710
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:08,882
every hungry mouth
on the planet.

1711
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:12,866
For Gene Baur,
factors like these,

1712
01:18:12,886 --> 01:18:14,868
combined with a deep
respect for animals,

1713
01:18:14,888 --> 01:18:17,871
helped convince him to
adopt a plant-based diet.

1714
01:18:17,891 --> 01:18:21,375
Mr. Baur is president and
co-founder of farm sanctuary

1715
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:23,877
near Watkins Glen, New York.

1716
01:18:23,897 --> 01:18:26,380
It provides a safe
haven for animals

1717
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,882
that have been
abandoned or abused.

1718
01:18:28,902 --> 01:18:32,386
I grew up eating animals like
most people in our country,

1719
01:18:32,406 --> 01:18:35,889
but once I started
considering my food choices

1720
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:38,392
I recognized that I didn't
want to eat animals.

1721
01:18:38,412 --> 01:18:41,895
And the more I learned,
the more I saw

1722
01:18:41,915 --> 01:18:44,898
that I was healthier if
I didn't eat animals

1723
01:18:44,918 --> 01:18:47,401
and that I had a much lighter
footprint on our planet.

1724
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:49,403
The livestock industry
is a greater contributor

1725
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:50,924
to global warming than the
entire transportation industry

1726
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:52,906
according to the United Nations.

1727
01:18:52,926 --> 01:18:56,910
So by eating meat, milk,
and eggs the way we are,

1728
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:58,912
we're harming our own health,

1729
01:18:58,932 --> 01:19:02,416
we're slaughtering 10
billion innocent animals

1730
01:19:02,436 --> 01:19:03,417
every year in the U.S.,

1731
01:19:03,437 --> 01:19:04,918
and we're destroying the planet.

1732
01:19:04,938 --> 01:19:07,941
Statistics compiled
from the United Nations

1733
01:19:08,442 --> 01:19:09,923
and the World
Health Organization

1734
01:19:09,943 --> 01:19:11,925
demonstrate the
profound global effect

1735
01:19:11,945 --> 01:19:14,428
that diet has on health.

1736
01:19:14,448 --> 01:19:16,930
These are the estimated
amounts of animal foods

1737
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:18,932
produced in nine countries,

1738
01:19:18,952 --> 01:19:22,936
a figure that's closely related
to animal food consumption.

1739
01:19:22,956 --> 01:19:25,939
These are the numbers of deaths
due to heart disease and cancer

1740
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:28,461
in the same countries.

1741
01:19:30,964 --> 01:19:32,446
In the United States,

1742
01:19:32,466 --> 01:19:36,450
the very same diseases continue
to have a grave impact.

1743
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,951
Even with the
billions of dollars

1744
01:19:37,971 --> 01:19:39,953
spent on cardiac treatment,

1745
01:19:39,973 --> 01:19:42,956
heart disease is still the
number one cause of death,

1746
01:19:42,976 --> 01:19:46,960
killing over 600,000
people a year.

1747
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,962
And the elephant in the room,

1748
01:19:48,982 --> 01:19:52,466
when we talk about stents
and heart bypass surgery,

1749
01:19:52,486 --> 01:19:54,988
is the fact that while
it's no question

1750
01:19:55,489 --> 01:19:56,470
in an emergency,

1751
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,473
these procedures are
absolutely lifesaving.

1752
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:01,475
But when they're
done electively,

1753
01:20:01,495 --> 01:20:05,479
these procedures do not protect
from new heart attacks.

1754
01:20:05,499 --> 01:20:07,481
Stents and bypass operations

1755
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:09,983
are used mainly to treat
large arterial blockages.

1756
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:13,987
Yet according to many
research studies,

1757
01:20:14,007 --> 01:20:15,989
only a small percentage
of heart attacks

1758
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:18,992
are caused by the largest
build-ups of plaque.

1759
01:20:19,012 --> 01:20:21,995
The rest are caused by the
more numerous, newer blockages

1760
01:20:22,015 --> 01:20:23,497
that are far more inflamed

1761
01:20:23,517 --> 01:20:25,499
and much more likely to rupture

1762
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:29,503
than the larger, older,
more stable plaques.

1763
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:32,506
And so this is why
those procedures

1764
01:20:32,526 --> 01:20:34,007
don't treat the disease.

1765
01:20:34,027 --> 01:20:35,528
They are treating symptoms.

1766
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:40,514
Doctor Esselstyn has been
eating the same foods

1767
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:45,018
that he has recommended to his
patients for over 25 years.

1768
01:20:45,038 --> 01:20:49,022
One of his sons, Rip Esselstyn,
used a plant-based diet

1769
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:51,024
to fuel a successful
ten-year career

1770
01:20:51,044 --> 01:20:52,545
as a professional tri-athlete.

1771
01:20:53,046 --> 01:20:56,549
When Rip turned 34, he was
ready for a career change

1772
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:59,552
and trained to become
a firefighter.

1773
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:07,040
Rip was assigned to
engine company number 2

1774
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,042
in Austin, Texas.

1775
01:21:09,062 --> 01:21:12,546
We're incredibly competitive
here at the fire station,

1776
01:21:12,566 --> 01:21:14,047
and we love making bets.

1777
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:16,049
So we were out on the
porch one night,

1778
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:18,051
and we kind of made
this little bar bet

1779
01:21:18,071 --> 01:21:20,053
to see who had the lowest
cholesterol level.

1780
01:21:20,073 --> 01:21:24,057
So the next morning, we
drove to a lab, got tested,

1781
01:21:24,077 --> 01:21:26,059
and the results came back.

1782
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:29,062
And it lead to a
discovery that J.R.,

1783
01:21:29,082 --> 01:21:33,066
James Ray, our resident redneck,
had a cholesterol of 344.

1784
01:21:33,086 --> 01:21:35,569
Pretty much means you're
knocking at death's door.

1785
01:21:35,589 --> 01:21:39,072
And so what we did, in
an act of solidarity,

1786
01:21:39,092 --> 01:21:43,076
is the next day we went about
eating a plant-strong diet,

1787
01:21:43,096 --> 01:21:45,598
to basically save his life
and save his arteries.

1788
01:21:46,099 --> 01:21:49,102
The men agreed to change
their firehouse diet.

1789
01:21:49,603 --> 01:21:53,086
But in Texas, old
eating habits die hard.

1790
01:21:53,106 --> 01:21:55,589
Meat's almost a sport in Texas.

1791
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:58,091
I have several good friends
that, they're barbeque teams.

1792
01:21:58,111 --> 01:21:59,092
That's what they do.

1793
01:21:59,112 --> 01:22:01,094
That's their sport on weekends.

1794
01:22:01,114 --> 01:22:02,596
Texans are serious
about their barbeque.

1795
01:22:02,616 --> 01:22:04,117
Texas, Kansas.

1796
01:22:14,127 --> 01:22:18,111
Well, guys associate being
manly with eating meat.

1797
01:22:18,131 --> 01:22:20,614
And if you're a firefighter,
it's exponentially so.

1798
01:22:20,634 --> 01:22:26,119
Last year, for example, there
were 133 firefighter fatalities

1799
01:22:26,139 --> 01:22:27,621
in the United States.

1800
01:22:27,641 --> 01:22:31,625
52% were from heart disease.

1801
01:22:31,645 --> 01:22:35,128
Our number one killer of
in-the-line-of-duty deaths

1802
01:22:35,148 --> 01:22:37,130
for firefighters
is heart disease.

1803
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:39,633
After just three weeks
on his new diet,

1804
01:22:39,653 --> 01:22:42,135
J.R. tested his blood cholesterol,

1805
01:22:42,155 --> 01:22:46,640
and it dropped 148 points,
a decrease of 43%.

1806
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,142
His results inspired the others,

1807
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:51,144
who also saw their
cholesterol drop

1808
01:22:51,164 --> 01:22:53,647
and their energy levels rise.

1809
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:56,650
As firemen, they were not
only helping themselves,

1810
01:22:56,670 --> 01:23:00,153
they were in better
shape to assist others.

1811
01:23:00,173 --> 01:23:01,655
One of the things about
being a firefighter

1812
01:23:01,675 --> 01:23:04,157
is you don't have any idea
what your next call could be.

1813
01:23:04,177 --> 01:23:06,159
We may have a high-rise alarm,

1814
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:08,662
where we have to go up
20 flights of stairs

1815
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:10,163
with air packs on,

1816
01:23:10,183 --> 01:23:11,665
with all of our bunker gear on,

1817
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:14,167
with a high rise
pack on our backs.

1818
01:23:14,187 --> 01:23:16,169
Anybody can go down the poll,

1819
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:19,172
but not everybody can go up,
especially without their legs.

1820
01:23:19,192 --> 01:23:22,175
And right there
you're talking about

1821
01:23:22,195 --> 01:23:25,178
an additional 75 to 100 pounds

1822
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:26,680
that you have to carry
up 20 flights of stairs.

1823
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,682
You have to have an
amazing aerobic capacity

1824
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:30,183
and strength in
order to do that.

1825
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:34,187
Real... men... eat... plants.

1826
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:38,191
Real... men... eat... plants.

1827
01:23:40,213 --> 01:23:42,696
You know what, as firefighters,

1828
01:23:42,716 --> 01:23:46,199
everybody thinks that we
fight fire, and we do.

1829
01:23:46,219 --> 01:23:49,703
But over 70% of our calls
are medical emergencies

1830
01:23:49,723 --> 01:23:53,206
where we are responding
to heart disease,

1831
01:23:53,226 --> 01:23:57,210
hypertension, type 2
diabetes, rampant obesity.

1832
01:23:57,230 --> 01:24:00,714
And so we see, up
close and personal,

1833
01:24:00,734 --> 01:24:02,716
basically the destruction
that's being caused

1834
01:24:02,736 --> 01:24:04,738
by the standard American diet.

1835
01:24:05,238 --> 01:24:06,739
To me, the answer

1836
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,723
is just absolutely so
simple, it's criminal.

1837
01:24:09,743 --> 01:24:12,225
It's just people
starting to take

1838
01:24:12,245 --> 01:24:13,727
responsibility for their health

1839
01:24:13,747 --> 01:24:17,230
and starting to eat
more plant-based foods.

1840
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,751
It's that simple.

1841
01:24:21,755 --> 01:24:25,238
After 13 weeks on a whole
foods, plant-based diet,

1842
01:24:25,258 --> 01:24:28,261
it was time to get my results
from Dr. Lederman.

1843
01:24:28,762 --> 01:24:32,245
When you started, your
weight was 231, 231 pounds,

1844
01:24:32,265 --> 01:24:33,747
now 211 pounds.

1845
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,248
Okay, that's good.

1846
01:24:35,268 --> 01:24:36,750
- It's a 20-pound drop there.
- Wow.

1847
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:38,772
Your blood pressure was 142
over 82 when you started.

1848
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:40,754
It's now 112 over 70.

1849
01:24:40,774 --> 01:24:42,756
Wow. That's a big drop.

1850
01:24:42,776 --> 01:24:44,257
That's a nice drop.
Oh, yeah, that's...

1851
01:24:44,277 --> 01:24:46,279
that's great, and, uh,
it'll just keep getting...

1852
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:49,262
It'll keep dropping as
you continue to do this.

1853
01:24:49,282 --> 01:24:51,765
Your pulse was resting
at 92 when you started.

1854
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:54,267
It's now down to 60, resting.

1855
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:55,769
Okay, cool.

1856
01:24:55,789 --> 01:25:00,774
Your total cholesterol though
went from 241 down to 154.

1857
01:25:00,794 --> 01:25:02,275
What?

1858
01:25:02,295 --> 01:25:04,277
Yeah, that was pretty amazing.

1859
01:25:04,297 --> 01:25:06,279
241 down to 154.

1860
01:25:06,299 --> 01:25:07,781
154?

1861
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:08,782
154, yeah, that's really...

1862
01:25:08,802 --> 01:25:11,284
and your LDL, which is
your bad cholesterol...

1863
01:25:11,304 --> 01:25:13,787
um, I think this is the
most impressive...

1864
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:16,289
went from 157 down to 80.

1865
01:25:16,309 --> 01:25:17,791
No way!

1866
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:20,794
Yeah. That's amazing that
it dropped almost in half.

1867
01:25:20,814 --> 01:25:22,295
Uh, we did C.R.P. last time,

1868
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:23,797
which is sort of the
marker of the inflammation

1869
01:25:23,817 --> 01:25:25,799
in the heart and
the blood vessels.

1870
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:29,803
And that went from
6.0 down to 2.8.

1871
01:25:29,823 --> 01:25:31,805
Without using any medications,

1872
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:34,808
I significantly
reduced my chances

1873
01:25:34,828 --> 01:25:37,831
of getting a heart attack
and many other diseases.

1874
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:43,316
Tomorrow marks 20
weeks on the program.

1875
01:25:43,336 --> 01:25:45,318
I've lost 45 pounds.

1876
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:46,839
I've reversed the diabetes.

1877
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,822
You have to know that everybody

1878
01:25:48,842 --> 01:25:51,825
is so incredibly proud
of what you've done.

1879
01:25:51,845 --> 01:25:53,326
I don't have to rely
on the medication.

1880
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:56,329
I have a lot of energy
that I didn't have before.

1881
01:25:56,349 --> 01:25:59,332
My children love it.

1882
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:01,835
They're so proud of me, and
they tell me all the time.

1883
01:26:01,855 --> 01:26:03,837
I had a little saying
that I've carried around

1884
01:26:03,857 --> 01:26:06,339
for maybe the last two years.

1885
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:07,340
And it's "win the war.

1886
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,862
"Do not let one lost
battle end the war.

1887
01:26:10,363 --> 01:26:13,866
"If you do break down and give
into temptation, do not quit.

1888
01:26:14,367 --> 01:26:15,849
"Just get right back on track.

1889
01:26:15,869 --> 01:26:18,351
Not tomorrow, but right now."

1890
01:26:18,371 --> 01:26:19,853
The diabetes is not coming back.

1891
01:26:19,873 --> 01:26:20,854
I'm not gonna let it come back,

1892
01:26:20,874 --> 01:26:22,355
nor the weight.

1893
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,358
The message is, you're
in control of your life.

1894
01:26:25,378 --> 01:26:28,862
Joey Aucoin had over two
dozen health problems,

1895
01:26:28,882 --> 01:26:31,364
including type 2 diabetes.

1896
01:26:31,384 --> 01:26:34,868
But after 22 weeks eating
plant-based foods,

1897
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:37,370
his condition had
changed dramatically.

1898
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,872
Hey, how you doin'?

1899
01:26:38,892 --> 01:26:40,874
- Back again.
- And you're getting healthier.

1900
01:26:40,894 --> 01:26:43,376
Your weight is down 28 pounds.

1901
01:26:43,396 --> 01:26:44,878
You feel better than you have.

1902
01:26:44,898 --> 01:26:48,882
26 out of 27 complaints
are gone completely.

1903
01:26:48,902 --> 01:26:50,884
Your marker of inflammation
in the vessels

1904
01:26:50,904 --> 01:26:52,886
is down to that of
a normal person.

1905
01:26:52,906 --> 01:26:55,388
Uh, your blood sugars
are coming down.

1906
01:26:55,408 --> 01:26:56,909
They continue to come down
even on a daily basis,

1907
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,892
which are gonna get better.

1908
01:26:58,912 --> 01:27:00,894
Your cholesterol is
significantly lower

1909
01:27:00,914 --> 01:27:02,896
than it was when
you first started,

1910
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:04,397
before you ever started
taking any pills.

1911
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:05,899
Your blood pressure
is normal now,

1912
01:27:05,919 --> 01:27:08,401
compared to how it was
before while on pills.

1913
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:09,903
It was still elevated.

1914
01:27:09,923 --> 01:27:12,405
And you just...
you know, you just said

1915
01:27:12,425 --> 01:27:13,907
you've never felt
like this before.

1916
01:27:13,927 --> 01:27:15,909
You look...
look at how you look in the pictures.

1917
01:27:15,929 --> 01:27:16,910
You look healthier.

1918
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:18,411
So, you know, like
I told you before,

1919
01:27:18,431 --> 01:27:19,913
I explained how the
numbers can affect...

1920
01:27:19,933 --> 01:27:22,415
can affect our judgment
of what real health is.

1921
01:27:22,435 --> 01:27:23,917
And it's not just the numbers.

1922
01:27:23,937 --> 01:27:24,918
It's overall the entire picture,

1923
01:27:24,938 --> 01:27:27,420
and your picture
looks fantastic.

1924
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,422
I was takin' nine pills
a day and two shots.

1925
01:27:29,442 --> 01:27:32,926
I was spending almost a 150
to 200 a month on medication,

1926
01:27:32,946 --> 01:27:34,427
above my insurance.

1927
01:27:34,447 --> 01:27:36,930
Just think about that: I've
been doin' it five months.

1928
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:39,933
I've saved, you know,
$800 to a $1,000 already,

1929
01:27:39,953 --> 01:27:42,435
'cause I haven't taken
one pill, one shot.

1930
01:27:42,455 --> 01:27:43,937
So think about what
that saved me...

1931
01:27:43,957 --> 01:27:45,939
not just me, the
insurance company.

1932
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:47,440
The U.S. government will
give you figures

1933
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:50,944
that 75% of the dollars
spent in health care

1934
01:27:50,964 --> 01:27:52,445
are due to chronic illnesses,

1935
01:27:52,465 --> 01:27:53,947
and these are due to
diet and lifestyle.

1936
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:55,468
Let's get rid of the problem,

1937
01:27:55,969 --> 01:27:57,971
which is the sickness which
is caused by the food.

1938
01:28:08,982 --> 01:28:11,464
Now well into their 70s,

1939
01:28:11,484 --> 01:28:14,987
doctors Campbell and Esselstyn
are both vital and active.

1940
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:19,973
They also continue to
spread their message.

1941
01:28:19,993 --> 01:28:22,475
If you carefully look
at our school children,

1942
01:28:22,495 --> 01:28:24,978
already the arteries
to their brain,

1943
01:28:24,998 --> 01:28:28,982
their carotid artery, is getting
some intimal medial thickening.

1944
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:31,484
Dr. Esselstyn lectures
about his research

1945
01:28:31,504 --> 01:28:34,487
all over the United
States and abroad.

1946
01:28:34,507 --> 01:28:36,990
His wife Ann frequently
accompanies him

1947
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:37,991
to help council patients

1948
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:39,993
and to demonstrate
the preparation

1949
01:28:40,013 --> 01:28:41,995
of plant-based foods.

1950
01:28:42,015 --> 01:28:43,997
Dr. Esselstyn is also director

1951
01:28:44,017 --> 01:28:47,500
of the cardiovascular disease
prevention and reversal program

1952
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,004
at the Cleveland Clinic's
Wellness Institute.

1953
01:28:51,024 --> 01:28:54,507
Like Dr. Esselstyn, Dr. Campbell

1954
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:58,011
continues to lecture
throughout America and beyond.

1955
01:28:58,031 --> 01:29:01,014
Dr. Campbell, you believe that
even if animal-based proteins,

1956
01:29:01,034 --> 01:29:05,018
meat, dairy, et cetera...
are free from contamination,

1957
01:29:05,038 --> 01:29:07,020
you don't think people
should eat them?

1958
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,521
No, I don't.

1959
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:11,024
I think the closer we get
to a plant-based diet...

1960
01:29:11,044 --> 01:29:13,526
I should say a whole-foods,
plant-based diet,

1961
01:29:13,546 --> 01:29:17,030
the healthier we're going
to be for all of us.

1962
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:20,033
In China, where Dr. Campbell

1963
01:29:20,053 --> 01:29:22,035
did his large study
a generation ago,

1964
01:29:22,055 --> 01:29:25,038
the population has experienced
dramatic increases

1965
01:29:25,058 --> 01:29:27,540
in the amount of meat,
dairy, and processed foods

1966
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:30,043
the average person consumes.

1967
01:29:30,063 --> 01:29:31,064
At the same time,

1968
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:35,048
the rates of degenerative
diseases are skyrocketing.

1969
01:29:35,068 --> 01:29:37,550
Many Chinese now share
some of the same beliefs

1970
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:40,072
Americans have about nutrition.

1971
01:29:51,084 --> 01:29:53,566
Dr. Campbell's message
is resonating

1972
01:29:53,586 --> 01:29:55,068
with growing numbers
of concerned people

1973
01:29:55,088 --> 01:29:56,589
around the world.

1974
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,072
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1975
01:29:59,092 --> 01:30:02,575
Thanks to the efforts
of both these pioneers

1976
01:30:02,595 --> 01:30:03,576
and their colleagues,

1977
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:05,578
thousands of people
are realizing

1978
01:30:05,598 --> 01:30:07,080
that profound improvements

1979
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,583
in health and quality of
life are within reach.

1980
01:30:10,603 --> 01:30:13,086
You have two choices:

1981
01:30:13,106 --> 01:30:17,590
You can eat yourself into
poor health and early death,

1982
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:21,094
or you can eat yourself
into good health

1983
01:30:21,114 --> 01:30:23,096
and a long, healthy life.

1984
01:30:23,116 --> 01:30:28,101
And that road is on a plant-
centered dietary pattern.

1985
01:30:28,121 --> 01:30:32,105
You know, I know of
nothing else in medicine

1986
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:35,108
that can come close to what
a plant-based diet can do.

1987
01:30:35,128 --> 01:30:37,110
I can say this with a
great deal of confidence,

1988
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:40,613
that our national authorities
are simply excluding

1989
01:30:40,633 --> 01:30:43,116
this concept of nutrition from
the debate and the discussion

1990
01:30:43,136 --> 01:30:45,618
in order to protect
the status quo.

1991
01:30:45,638 --> 01:30:48,621
In theory, if everyone
were to adopt this,

1992
01:30:48,641 --> 01:30:52,625
I really believe we could cut
health care costs by 70% to 80%.

1993
01:30:52,645 --> 01:30:53,646
That's amazing.

1994
01:30:54,147 --> 01:30:57,150
And it all comes from
understanding nutrition,

1995
01:30:57,650 --> 01:31:01,654
applying nutrition, and
just watchin' the results.

1996
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:10,162
The greatest gift that
you could possibly give

1997
01:31:10,663 --> 01:31:12,145
to yourself and your family,

1998
01:31:12,165 --> 01:31:15,148
not only those in
your generation,

1999
01:31:15,168 --> 01:31:17,650
but your children and
your grandchildren,

2000
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:20,153
if you can make them be aware

2001
01:31:20,173 --> 01:31:24,157
of the incredible power that
resides within each of them

2002
01:31:24,177 --> 01:31:29,162
to avoid life's most poignantly
tragic and painful events,

2003
01:31:29,182 --> 01:31:32,165
you just don't have to have
those kinds of events.

2004
01:31:32,185 --> 01:31:34,667
I believe that
with all my heart,

2005
01:31:34,687 --> 01:31:36,169
if anyone listen to this,

2006
01:31:36,189 --> 01:31:40,173
and they really should look
at their refrigerator,

2007
01:31:40,193 --> 01:31:42,675
and look at their
diet, and give a try.

2008
01:31:42,695 --> 01:31:45,178
You lose weight, and
you'll be healthier.

2009
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:47,180
Nothing could lose

2010
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,682
if you just take
few weeks and try.

2011
01:31:49,702 --> 01:31:52,185
You could see how easy it is.

2012
01:31:52,205 --> 01:31:54,687
I'm not gonna say
it was difficult.

2013
01:31:54,707 --> 01:31:57,190
Again, I made up my mind,
this is what I'm going to do.

2014
01:31:57,210 --> 01:32:00,693
I never felt like I wasn't
getting what I wanted.

2015
01:32:00,713 --> 01:32:03,196
So I didn't have ice cream, so
I didn't have the doughnuts,

2016
01:32:03,216 --> 01:32:04,697
so I ate something else.

2017
01:32:04,717 --> 01:32:07,200
I can thank them in every
way I can think possible,

2018
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,701
and my doctor, especially Matt,

2019
01:32:08,721 --> 01:32:10,703
and they just can't
understand what it's done

2020
01:32:10,723 --> 01:32:11,724
to change my life.

2021
01:32:12,225 --> 01:32:13,206
And it really has.

2022
01:32:13,226 --> 01:32:14,707
Not just mine, my
family's, everybody's.

2023
01:32:14,727 --> 01:32:17,210
It gives me shivers
talking about it,

2024
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:18,711
because it's so serious.

2025
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:20,213
It's a life-changing experience.

2026
01:32:20,233 --> 01:32:22,735
You can be in control,

2027
01:32:23,236 --> 01:32:24,717
and I stress this, 'cause
there's so many things

2028
01:32:24,737 --> 01:32:27,220
going on in my life that
I'm not in control of.

2029
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,221
And that's my message.

2030
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:31,724
You can control your
outcome of your body.

2031
01:32:31,744 --> 01:32:35,728
Eat to live and
don't live to eat.

2032
01:32:35,748 --> 01:32:37,230
You better get that.

2033
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,751
You better get the recipe.

2034
01:32:39,252 --> 01:32:41,254
This is good.

2035
01:33:29,802 --> 01:33:34,287
# sleep, don't visit #

2036
01:33:34,307 --> 01:33:37,310
# so I choke on the sun #

2037
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:41,294
# and the days burn into one #

2038
01:33:41,314 --> 01:33:43,796
# backs of my eyes #

2039
01:33:43,816 --> 01:33:47,800
# of the things
I've never done #

2040
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:52,805
# sheets are swayin' #

2041
01:33:52,825 --> 01:33:55,808
# from the old clothesline #

2042
01:33:55,828 --> 01:33:59,331
# like a row of
captured ghosts #

2043
01:33:59,832 --> 01:34:02,315
# over dead grass #

2044
01:34:02,335 --> 01:34:06,839
# was never much but
we made the most #

2045
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:13,346
# welcome ho oh oh ah ah home #

2046
01:34:13,846 --> 01:34:19,832
# ah ah oh ah ah home #

01:34:19,852 --> 01:34:26,339

01:34:26,359 --> 01:34:32,345
# ha ha oh ah ah ah home #

2049
01:34:32,365 --> 01:34:34,847
# ships #

2050
01:34:34,867 --> 01:34:37,350
# are launching #

2051
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:40,353
# from my chest #

2052
01:34:40,373 --> 01:34:43,856
# some have names
but most do not #

2053
01:34:43,876 --> 01:34:46,859
# if you find one, please #

2054
01:34:46,879 --> 01:34:50,863
# let me know what
piece I've lost #

2055
01:34:50,883 --> 01:34:55,368
# peel the scars from #

2056
01:34:55,388 --> 01:34:58,371
# off my back #

2057
01:34:58,391 --> 01:35:02,375
# I don't need them anymore #

2058
01:35:02,395 --> 01:35:05,378
# you can throw them out #

2059
01:35:05,398 --> 01:35:09,882
# keep them in your Mason jars #

2060
01:35:09,902 --> 01:35:16,889
# I've come ho oh
oh ah ah home #

2061
01:35:16,909 --> 01:35:22,895
# ah ah oh ah ah home #

01:35:22,915 --> 01:35:28,901
# ah ah ha ha ha ha home #

01:35:28,921 --> 01:35:35,408
# ha ha oh ah ah ah home #
