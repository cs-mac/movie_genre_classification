1
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,320
Fucking...

2
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,485
Fucking bastards.

3
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:17,389
Come on, you fuck...

4
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,332
<i>Mikey, get down I

5
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:20,494
<i>Mikey!

6
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,235
I'm hit, Charlie.
I'm hit.

7
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,371
You'll be all right,
Mikey. Hold strong.

8
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,919
<i>You'll never</i>
<i>take me alive,</i>
<i>you bastardsl</i>

9
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:19,589
Do I need to introduce myself?

10
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:21,994
I know Who you are.

11
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,599
<i>Good.</i>

12
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,658
<i>I know who you are.</i>

13
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:31,473
My brother's taken
a bullet, Stanley, and is in need
of medical attention.

14
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:36,171
well, allow me to address
the subject of your brother,
Mr. Burns.

15
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:43,847
Christmas, as you're probably
aWare, is fast approaching.

16
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,119
And Christmas this year
will hold a unique significance
for young M icky here.

17
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,181
Mikey.

18
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,560
Because on Christmas day

19
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:58,260
I have made plans
that he be taken
from the jail in Banyon

20
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,427
and hanged by the neck
until he's dead.

21
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:02,300
Charlie...

22
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,738
You're a copper, Stanley,
not a judge and jury.

23
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:08,869
well... clearly, Mr. Burns,
I am what I wish to be.

24
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:14,046
So what is it that you want?

25
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:15,709
I want Arthur Burns.

26
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,580
I no longer ride with my brother.

27
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,960
Aah!

28
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:31,967
Now, I will allow you
a moment to think
about it.

29
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,646
what's happening, Charlie?

30
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,088
It's all right, Mikey.

31
00:05:57,193 --> 00:05:58,683
It's all right.

32
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,272
<i>Australia.</i>

33
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,741
what fresh hell is this?

34
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,411
I've kept company
with bad men all my life.

35
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:26,378
I was 22 years in
Her Majesty's Land Forces.

36
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,083
I dealt with your type
many times.

37
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:30,149
Touch me brother again
and I'll kill you.

38
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:42,999
Make no mistakes, Mr. Burns.
It will be done.

39
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,562
I will civilise this place.

40
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,768
what the fuck are you
talking about, Stanley?

41
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:55,380
Listen to me Now, Charlie.
Don't speak.

42
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:57,476
Hush, Mikey, you'll be fine.

43
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,385
Hush.

44
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,095
I wish to present you
with a proposition.

45
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:19,668
<i>I know where</i>
<i>Arthur Burns is.</i>

46
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:23,505
<i>It is a godforsaken</i>
<i>place.</i>

47
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,378
<i>The blacks won't go there,</i>
<i>nor the trackers.</i>

48
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,548
<i>Not even my own men.</i>

49
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,388
<i>I suppose in time</i>
<i>the bounty hunters</i>
<i>will get him.</i>

50
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,796
<i>But I have other plans.</i>
<i>I aim to bring him down.</i>

51
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,308
<i>I aim to Show that</i>
<i>he is a man like any other.</i>
<i>I aim to hurt him.</i>

52
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,936
when you're ready, sir.

53
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,508
<i>And what will most</i>
<i>hurt him?</i>

54
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:07,584
<i>well, I've thought</i>
<i>long and hard about that.</i>

55
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,190
<i>And I have realised,</i>
<i>Mr. Burns...</i>

56
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:16,358
<i>that I must become</i>
<i>a little more inventive</i>
<i>in my methods.</i>

57
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:24,771
<i>Don't speak, Mr. Burns.</i>
<i>Listen to me now.</i>

58
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:27,275
<i>Don't say a word.</i>

59
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,210
<i>Suppose I told you there was</i>
<i>a way to save your little</i>
<i>brother Mikey from the noose.</i>

60
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:41,213
<i>Suppose I gave you</i>
<i>a horse and a gun.</i>

61
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,418
<i>Suppose, Mr. Burns,</i>
<i>I were to give both you...</i>

62
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:50,591
<i>and your young brother</i>
<i>Mikey here a pardon.</i>

63
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:57,498
Suppose I said that I could...

64
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:00,337
give you the chance
to expunge the guilt

65
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,106
beneath Which
you so clearly labour.

66
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:08,242
<i>Suppose I gave you</i>
<i>till Christmas.</i>

67
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:12,379
<i>Now suppose you tell me</i>
<i>what it is I want from you.</i>

68
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,557
You want me to kill me brother.

69
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,787
I want you to kill your brother.

70
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,336
<i>Arthur Burns is a monster,</i>
<i>an abomination.</i>

71
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:39,206
<i>You were right to part</i>
<i>company with him,</i>

72
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:41,477
<i>to take Mikey with you.</i>

73
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:46,479
<i>what happened at the Hopkins</i>
<i>place was unforgivable.</i>

74
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,787
<i>I have never seen</i>
<i>such a sickening sight.</i>

75
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:57,390
<i>Did you know that, that poor</i>
<i>woman Eliza Hopkins</i>
<i>had a child in her belly?</i>

76
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:56,914
<i>Your business with your</i>
<i>brother is unfinished.</i>

77
00:10:56,993 --> 00:11:00,019
<i>You have nine days,</i>
<i>Mr. Burns.</i>

78
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,065
Come on, let's hit them!

79
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:53,281
<i>You got him I

80
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:07,890
<i>Pigsl</i>

81
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:09,090
<i>Who have you got?</i>

82
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:16,071
Troopers...
dismount!

83
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,075
The man I have brought in

84
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,712
is Mike Burns,
of the Burns gang.

85
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:37,025
So that's one down
and two to go,
gentlemen.

86
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,827
<i>You've got to get</i>
<i>the other ones Now.</i>

87
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:43,590
I will

88
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,190
civilise this land.

89
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:50,271
<i>Make yourself</i>
<i>at home, Mikey.</i>

90
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,608
<i>Good evening to you,</i>
<i>Mrs. Stanley.</i>

91
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,175
Good evening,
Mr. Broussard.

92
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:51,358
<i>Not so fucking</i>
<i>dangerous Now, is he?</i>

93
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,244
<i>Martha?</i>

94
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:14,887
Good evening, gentlemen.

95
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,754
Good evening, Mrs. Stanley.

96
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:19,192
You should really not come here.

97
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:23,220
Can't a lady
visit her husband
in his place of work?

98
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:39,907
You men...
wait outside.

99
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:52,186
we spoke about why you
shouldn't come here, dear.
This is not appropriate...

100
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,559
Morris, you've been gone
for three days.

101
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,600
It's Ionely out there
at the house.

102
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,031
It's so quiet without you.

103
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:04,834
Are you coming home Now?

104
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:07,432
well, I have things to attend to.

105
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:12,606
I'll have Officer Dunn
escort you home.

106
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:13,910
I'll be back soon.

107
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,814
You look terrible, Morris.

108
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:17,045
Yes.

109
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,517
Yes, I do.

110
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:28,055
Dunn!

111
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:30,226
<i>Who is that?</i>

112
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,628
But he's no more than a boy!

113
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:36,399
<i>Oh, he's man enough, Ma'am.</i>
<i>He's man enough indeed.</i>

114
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:37,461
Enough.

115
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:48,642
Escort Mrs. Stanley home
and wait there
till I return.

116
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,811
how long will you be, dear?

117
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:51,944
Later.

118
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:06,231
Never speak to my wife
about such things again,
do you understand?

119
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:07,769
My apologies, Captain.

120
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:10,328
what happened today
on the Flats, that's
between you and me.

121
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:11,395
Of course, sir.

122
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:14,375
<i>Because, there would be</i>
<i>consequences, were it</i>
<i>to become common knowledge.</i>

123
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:15,740
Yes.

124
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:15,328
<i>Eliza Hopkins was</i>
<i>a good Christian woman.</i>

125
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:16,894
<i>And she was my friend.</i>

126
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:20,601
<i>I pray to God</i>
<i>that her death</i>
<i>was mercifully swift.</i>

127
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:23,110
<i>It was, wasn't it?</i>

128
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,671
Martha... could we
speak of other things?

129
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,951
Come here, Captain Stanley.

130
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,905
My poor husband.

131
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:08,987
Oh...

132
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:19,194
The world you live in, in there.

133
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,374
Don't be gloomy, dear.

134
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:32,709
This burden you carry,

135
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,943
you might let me carry it, too.

136
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:40,819
I believe in you.

137
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:57,732
Martha...

138
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:01,900
Stay down.
Stay in bed.

139
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:20,890
<i>what in God's name...?</i>

140
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:23,022
Christ, Sir...

141
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:25,066
I've shot me bloody toes off.

142
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,509
There's nothing
to see here, Martha.
Go back to bed.

143
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:36,544
Officer Dunn has shot his toe.

144
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:40,774
<i>Martha,</i>
<i>go back inside.</i>

145
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,680
<i>Bloody fliesl</i>

146
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:54,780
Kill one and a dozen more
turn up to his funeral.

147
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:03,322
<i># Oh, Danny boy, the flies,
the flies are craWling... <i>#

148
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:11,266
Oh, a thousand pardons,
my dear man.

149
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,741
It appears that I am
a little scuppered.

150
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,008
No, no need for that, sir.
No need for that.

151
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,675
we are white men, you and I.

152
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,547
Permit me to introduce myself.
My name is Jellon Lamb.

153
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:32,025
Citizen of the world,
you might say,
an adventurer,

154
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:38,260
and if I may be so bold,
a man of no little education.

155
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,198
And you, sir?

156
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,934
By what name am I
honoured to address thee?

157
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,108
Of course...

158
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:54,342
a mere detail.

159
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:57,851
Mere detail.

160
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:03,384
Forgive me, sir,
but I've been
stuck here with no one

161
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:07,054
but this sorry sack
of Hibernian pig shit
for conversation.

162
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:12,032
<i>Poor, poor</i>
<i>Dan O'Reilly.</i>

163
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,763
<i>Sit, sir.</i>
<i>Drink with me.</i>

164
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,931
One more crack about
the Irish, Mr. Lamb,
and I'll shoot you.

165
00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:21,910
Am I clear?

166
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:24,104
Oh, as the Waters of Ennis, sir.

167
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,272
Let us drink, then,
to the Irish.

168
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:29,442
No finer race of men have ever...

169
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:31,918
peeled a potato.

170
00:22:31,987 --> 00:22:33,284
Do yoUpray,
Mr. Lamb?

171
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:36,449
Good Lord, son.
No, I do not.

172
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:40,791
I was, in days gone-by,
a believer.

173
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:46,859
<i>But, alas, I came to</i>
<i>this beleaguered land</i>
<i>and the God in me just...</i>

174
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,504
evaporated.

175
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:56,772
<i>Let us change our</i>
<i>toast, sir. To the God</i>
<i>who has forgotten us.</i>

176
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:03,443
But first, cardinal rule.

177
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:10,687
Never raise a glass
with a man whose name
you do not know.

178
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:14,792
My name's Charles Murphy.

179
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,534
Charles, eh?

180
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:31,374
Perhaps you've read

181
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:35,143
<i>On the Origin of</i>
<i>the Species by Means</i>
<i>of Natural Selection</i>

182
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:38,846
by Charles Darwin.
Oh, don't be thrown
by the title.

183
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:42,823
He had some most
fascinating things
to say.

184
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:45,223
Chilling things!

185
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:49,856
Mr. Darwin spent time
studying Aboriginals.

186
00:23:49,932 --> 00:23:54,494
He claims we are at bottom...

187
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:58,037
one and the same.

188
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:06,470
He infers,
Mr. Murphy,

189
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:11,747
that we share a common
ancestry with monkeys.

190
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:17,621
Monkeys!

191
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:27,726
Mr. Murphy, Russia,
China, the Congo...

192
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:34,333
Oh, I have travelled among
unknown people in lands
beyond the seas,

193
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:38,309
but nothing...

194
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,285
nothing could have
prepared me for this
godforsaken hole.

195
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:48,153
You see,
Mr. Murphy,

196
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:54,359
I am something
of a fortune hunter.

197
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:01,061
And what fortune do you
hunt out here, Mr. Lamb?

198
00:25:01,136 --> 00:25:03,696
No, that would be
my question to you,
Mr. Murphy.

199
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:07,767
Unhand me Murphy,
or I'll slit your
fucking throat.

200
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,553
we are white men, sir.

201
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,553
Not beasts.

202
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:45,471
<i>Ahhh...</i>

203
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:51,076
He sits
up there in those
melancholy hills.

204
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:55,852
<i>Some say he sleeps</i>
<i>in caves like a beast,</i>

205
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:59,382
<i>slumbers deep</i>
<i>like the Kraken.</i>

206
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:03,693
<i>The blacks say</i>
<i>that he's a spirit.</i>

207
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:06,598
<i>The troopers</i>
<i>will never catch him.</i>

208
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:10,331
<i>Common force is meaningless,</i>
<i>Mr. Murphy,</i>

209
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:15,672
<i>as he squats up there</i>
<i>on his impregnable perch.</i>

210
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:24,315
<i>So I wait, Mr. Murphy.</i>

211
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:27,883
I wait.

212
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,630
Aye, you wait.

213
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:39,496
You wait here, bounty hunter.

214
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:54,174
<i>Hang him, sir.</i>
<i>Hang him high, sir.</i>

215
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:12,796
<i>Hail the</i>
<i>conquering hero.</i>

216
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:29,506
what a vile specimen of humanity.

217
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,921
<i>what a little</i>
<i>piece of filth.</i>

218
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,289
Not really the one that
we're looking for, though,
is it, Captain?

219
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,590
I n the end,
justice will be done.

220
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:43,062
Mmm... justice.

221
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:46,532
Save your little wisdoms
for the mob, Stanley.

222
00:27:49,037 --> 00:27:51,164
Has he told you
Where his brothers are?

223
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:53,332
<i>with due respects,</i>
<i>Mr. Fletcher...</i>

224
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:57,105
perhaps it would be wise
to allow police work
to be done by police men.

225
00:27:57,746 --> 00:27:59,680
Hmm...

226
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:06,252
what a little piece of filth.

227
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,491
Still, better than
nothing, I suppose.

228
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,789
Good evening, Captain.

229
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,261
Good evening.

230
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,930
Your roses are looking lovely.

231
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:58,802
I've got green thumbs, I have.

232
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:02,501
<i>I was just thinking</i>
<i>about England.</i>

233
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:07,105
Do you not miss it, Martha?

234
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:13,182
There's much to miss.
There and here.

235
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:20,017
Let's get rid of that headache.

236
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,119
Now...

237
00:29:24,032 --> 00:29:25,590
Captain Stanley...

238
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:28,101
eat your breakfast
before the flies do.

239
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,533
Made by me own
fair hands, them eggs.

240
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:39,177
Me eggs have never
tasted so fine, M um.

241
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,711
You're a good man, Morris.

242
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:46,185
And you're a good woman, Martha.

243
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,120
<i>Do we have company?</i>

244
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:54,024
Yes, I'm afraid we do.

245
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,129
<i>Captain I

246
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,846
Excuse me, Ma'am.
Excuse me, Sir.

247
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:20,711
Martha, would you excuse us?

248
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,086
It's fine, Morris.

249
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:24,421
<i>No, Martha, please.</i>
<i>This is police business.</i>

250
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:36,365
how dare you come
to my house in that state?

251
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:37,427
Sir...

252
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:38,767
what exactly do you want?

253
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,035
we just got back from
the Arooka Ranges, Sir.

254
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:42,940
we rounded up
six rebel blacks, Sir.

255
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:46,378
Sean killed one.
Thought you'd want to know
about it straight away.

256
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:53,845
Captain...

257
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:56,921
Captain?

258
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:04,064
No, leave the door open.
It's rank in here.

259
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:07,260
Yes, sir.

260
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:10,862
<i>Are you sure yoUput enough</i>
<i>iron on these men, Sergeant?</i>

261
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:13,464
They have been
adequately secured, sir.

262
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:14,769
Jacko, get over here.

263
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:16,401
Yes, Captain sir.

264
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:19,936
<i>Ask them how long</i>
<i>they've been hiding</i>
<i>up in the ranges.</i>

265
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:25,244
<i>He says</i>
<i>they very tired.</i>

266
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:29,514
well, you'll have
a nice long rest

267
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:33,186
if you don't open your fucking
mouth and start yapping,
you black bastards!

268
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:34,489
<i>Sergeant.</i>

269
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:37,564
<i>wait outside.</i>

270
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:39,429
wait outside the door.

271
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:41,560
I'll call you if
and when I need you.

272
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:57,578
<i>Ask them, again,</i>
<i>how long they've been</i>
<i>hiding up in the ranges.</i>

273
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,486
<i>Captain, Sir, he said they</i>
<i>don't hide in the ranges.</i>

274
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,996
They live in the ranges.

275
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:13,057
<i>Then ask him how long they</i>
<i>have lived in the ranges.</i>

276
00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:15,796
Them always been living
in the ranges, Captain, Sir.

277
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,038
Ask him if they've seen
a white man up there.

278
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,510
Yes, Captain, Sir, I'll ask them.

279
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:39,289
They've seen white men.
White men catches them.

280
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,850
Jesus Christ!

281
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,829
I don't mean the police.

282
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,424
This... this man.

283
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:51,136
This man.
A man with this man.

284
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:52,764
A white man.

285
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:55,766
This man. This man.

286
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:01,240
<i>Ask him.</i>

287
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:07,017
<i>fellow</i>
<i>in the picture,</i>

he live in a cave.

289
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,790
Dog man.

290
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,622
Big fella.

291
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:15,492
<i>He said Dog Man</i>
<i>never sleep.</i>

292
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:18,999
He sit there all day.
Sit down, in the cave.

293
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:22,298
Way up. He live
with small fella...

294
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:24,996
and black fella.

295
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:28,065
<i>Cannot catch him.</i>
<i>Cannot kill him.</i>

296
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:30,503
<i>He is dog.</i>

297
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:33,012
what? He "eats" dog?

298
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:35,379
No, Captain, Sir.
He is dog.

299
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,078
<i>He changed to dog.</i>

300
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:39,518
He grows ears.

301
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:43,182
He grow teeth, sharp.
And he grows a tail,
this Way.

302
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:49,321
<i>Long. And he stand</i>
<i>with two leg,</i>
<i>like this.</i>

303
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:52,855
And he goes...

304
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,940
<i>Sergeant? Sergeant I

305
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:05,404
<i>Captain is weak.</i>
<i>A weak man.</i>

306
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:09,239
Oh, so, so you reckon
he's weak, eh,Lawrence?

307
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:14,244
Came out here
to sort out niggers,
fuck me, he's done nothing.

308
00:35:14,315 --> 00:35:17,751
Those black bastards,
they're running all over us.

309
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:19,912
<i>They chose</i>
<i>the wrong man for the job.</i>

310

<i>This isn't London.</i>
<i>It's not England.</i>
<i>This is fucking Australia.</i>

311
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:25,317
<i>Right.

312
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:29,159
Did I say
I wanted to fuck
the Captain's wife?

313
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,698
<i>will you go back</i>
<i>to sleep, Paul,</i>
<i>for God's sake?</i>

314
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,563
<i>I would like</i>
<i>to fuck his wife.</i>

315
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:35,728
<i>If I was married to that</i>
<i>bucket of pig's tripe</i>

316
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:38,033
<i>you call a fucking wife,</i>
<i>I'd want to fuck her, too.</i>

317
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,903
<i>I want</i>
<i>to fuck his wife.</i>

318
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,738
<i>I want to fuck</i>
<i>his wife.</i>

319
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,338
Yeah, all right. we all
Wanna fuck Missus Stanley.

320
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:52,818
She certainly isn't
getting anything from
the good Captain, is she?

321
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:56,287
And you know why?

322
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:59,190
Oh, because he's weak.

323
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,854
He's got other things
on his mind.

324
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,161
<i>Because he really</i>
<i>fucked up this time.</i>

325
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:07,599
<i>He got the boy, yeah.</i>

326
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,603
He let the other one go.

327
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:10,660
Eh?

328
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,735
<i>Got good medicine.</i>
<i>Fix him no time at all.</i>

329
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:24,067
Gonna need sleep,
gonna need rest.

330
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:30,673
No cry, daddy. That'll
go on good and clean him.

331
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:33,680
<i>Gonna need sleep,</i>
<i>gonna need rest.</i>

332
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,528
Good afternoon,
Mr. Broussard.

333
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:38,999
<i>Remember to save
a turkey for me.

334
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:40,335
Of course,
Mrs. Stanley.

335
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,238
Is everything all right?

336
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:50,145
Go home, you stupid cow.

337
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:52,482
I'm sorry, what did you say?

338
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:56,389
Mrs. Stanley...

339
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:58,448
perhaps you'd better
ask your husband.

340
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:20,878
Shut up, dog.

341
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,150
Holy Mother of Mercy!

342
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,279
Look Who's raised
himself from the dead.

343
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:29,448
Him much better Now.

344
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,320
Him much better
because I fixed him.

345
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,519
<i>Don't look better</i>
<i>to me.</i>

346
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:36,654
You know, Samuel,
the thing I relished
the most while I was away?

347
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:39,291
was not having to see your
fucking face all the time.

348
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,335
<i>If it weren't for me</i>
<i>and my crack shooting</i>

349
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:42,892
you'd be fucking dingo dinner.

350
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,130
Thirty yards away I was.

351
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,304
Blew that black bastard's
head right off.

352
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:49,502
It was beautiful.

353
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:51,777
Show a bit of respect.

354
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:54,644
I might just have to shoot you...

355
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,239
with my new Winchester.

356
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,983
Fuck! That hurt!

357
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,209
Oh, Charlie...

358
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,310
Go easy there.

359
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:07,649
It's all right, Charlie.

360
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:13,424
You want to know
why I've come back?

361
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:15,860
I know why you've
come back, Charlie.

362
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:19,326
Look at that.

363
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:25,202
Be humble of heart, Charlie.

364
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,069
This is the end of things.

365
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:29,767
You're my brother, Charlie.

366
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:31,368
You belong with me.

367
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,405
we are a family.

368
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:36,279
All of us.

369
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:39,148
I was just getting reacquainted.

370
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,815
Samuel? Oh, be kind.

371
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,916
A little tolerance, Charlie.

372
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:46,925
Samuel's a boy.

373
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,928
He's a vicious little cretin.

374
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:03,371
Where's Mikey, Charlie?

375
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:05,469
Mikey stayed behind in Clarence.

376
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:06,843
You left Mikey alone?

377
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:08,779
He met a girl.

378
00:44:10,518 --> 00:44:11,780
Mikey met a girl.

379
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:14,650
Aye, Mikey met a girl.

380
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:22,559
what's her name, Charlie?

381
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,927
Molly.

382
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:25,966
Molly.

383
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:28,263
Molly O' Boyle.

384
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,667
Molly O' Boyle.

385
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:36,103
A redheaded colleen, no doubt.

386
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:37,872
Aye, red.

387
00:44:37,945 --> 00:44:38,912
Like the sunset.

388
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,239
Like the sunset.

389
00:44:57,431 --> 00:45:00,491
what does she do,
this... Molly O' Boyle?

390
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:05,564
I'm feeling a bit tired
right Now, Arthur.

391
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,472
Is she a farmer's daughter?
Can she cook a good
lamb steW?

392
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:09,770
would you stop it?

393
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:21,680
Mikey's not the same stuff as us.

394
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:25,213
we will be flung
to the depths,
you and I.

395
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,985
He worshipss you, you know?

396
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,831
There was a time we both did.

397
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:44,640
Mikey deserves better.

398
00:45:44,712 --> 00:45:47,545
You were right to leave.
Take him with you.

399
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:51,650
I need to rest.

400
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,584
Mary O' Boyle.

401
00:45:53,654 --> 00:45:56,487
Molly, Arthur, Molly.

402
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:59,822
Molly. Molly,
right, Molly.

403
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:31,483
Mikey...

404
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:16,561
<i>Martha...</i>

405
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:20,330
Martha...

406
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,704
when SergeantLawrence said

407
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:29,840
that the boy that you
are holding at the lockup
was man enough,

408
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,181
what did he mean by that?

409
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:35,346
SergeantLawrence
is an ignorant thug

410
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:38,152
with the moral
fortitude of a snake,
just disregard...

411
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:41,558
what did he mean?
what did the boy do?

412
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,927
He's a member of the Burns Gang.

413
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:45,829
There are some things
that a woman...

414
00:47:45,899 --> 00:47:47,833
I know that, and I
asked you a question.

415
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:49,391
And I asked you not
to visit me...

416
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,937
Just tell me
what he did to Eliza.

417
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,836
She was my friend!

418
00:47:52,906 --> 00:47:53,895
Enough!

419
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,839
<i>That's enough.</i>

420
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:03,413
Headache, Captain Stanley?

421
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:14,792
So what can I do
for you, Mr. Fletcher?

422
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:25,702
Word has it that your men
captured half a dozen
rebel blacks two days ago.

423
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:29,206
And that one was shot
in the process.

424
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:32,936
Do you have a problem with that?

425
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:36,115
Yes, Captain, I do.

426
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:38,708
Word came this morning
from Eight M ile Creek

427
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:40,845
that Dan O' Reilly's
place was attacked.

428
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,821
Are you sure it was blacks?

429
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,485
Dan O' Reilly had so many
spears in him that he
resembled your good old

430
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,721
garden variety, English hedgehog.

431
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:51,564
It's simple, Captain.

432
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:54,362
It's called the law
of reciprocity.

433
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:58,769
Kill one of them,
and they're going
to kill one of ours.

434
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:02,366
Do the job
I brought you here to do.

435
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,745
If you have to kill one,

436
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:08,782
make sure you bloody
well kill them all.

437
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,750
well, I'll send some
troopers out today.

438
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:19,292
Is our business here finished?

439
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:22,720
I'm going to have
Mike Burns flogged.

440
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:23,785
what?

441
00:49:23,864 --> 00:49:24,853
One hundred lashes.

442
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,694
Martha.

443
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:33,034
Thank you.

444
00:49:33,107 --> 00:49:35,837
I thought you gentlemen
might like a little tea.

445
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:38,366
Please, sit down.

446
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:43,312
<i>Thank you, Martha,</i>
<i>that would be lovely.</i>

447
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,217
<i>Thank you, Martha.</i>

448
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,303
Is there anything else
I can get you?

449
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:10,002
No, thank you, Martha,
this is lovely.

450
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,639
well, then, I'll leave
you two gentlemen alone.

451
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:33,965
Clever and well-bred
woman, your wife.

452
00:50:36,003 --> 00:50:37,971
You did well
for yourself, Captain.

453
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,370
Word has it

454
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,436
that you had Charlie Burns

455
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:50,946
<i>and you let him go.</i>

456
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,816
<i>Word has it</i>

457
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,879
<i>that you offered him</i>
<i>some kind of deal.</i>

458
00:50:56,957 --> 00:51:00,017
<i>Tell me this</i>
<i>isn't so, Captain.</i>

459
00:51:00,093 --> 00:51:03,085
<i>Word has it that you</i>
<i>promised those animals</i>

460
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:07,725
<i>who raped Eliza Hopkins</i>
<i>a pardon if Charlie Burns</i>
<i>brought back his brother.</i>

461
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:10,964
<i>A pardon for</i>
<i>the annihilation</i>
<i>of the Hopkins family.</i>

462
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:13,939
<i>Are you completely</i>
<i>out of your mind?</i>

463
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:17,272
<i>Listen to me. Mike Burns</i>
<i>is a simpleton.</i>

464
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:19,835
<i>He spends all day in his cell</i>
<i>crying like a child.</i>

465
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:23,041
<i>It is my belief that he's</i>
<i>unresponsible for his actions.</i>

466
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:25,880
<i>I'm not interested</i>
<i>in your beliefs,</i>
<i>Captain Stanley.</i>

467
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:28,046
Who do you think you are?
The judge and the jury?

468
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,055
Arthur Burns must be stopped.

469
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:33,388
It is he Who's responsible
for this outrage.

470
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,362
And I know that Charlie Burns
will stop at nothing

471
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,797
to protect his younger
brother, Mike.

472
00:51:42,236 --> 00:51:44,033
So all we need do Now is wait.

473
00:51:44,905 --> 00:51:46,372
<i>wait?</i>

474
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,034
<i>My God, man,</i>
<i>they raped a woman.</i>

475
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:52,306
<i>Tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>I want Mike Burns</i>
<i>flogged.</i>

476
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:56,640
<i>As I said,</i>

477
00:51:56,717 --> 00:51:57,843
<i>one hundred lashes.</i>

478
00:51:57,918 --> 00:51:58,907
This would kill him.

479
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:00,044
So be it.

480
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,315
what if I'm right?

481
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:06,917
what if Charlie Burns
does as I ask?
what if he comes back?

482
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:08,962
Then we will hang
the lot of them.

483
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,889
Good day.

484
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:27,837
<i>Martha.</i>

485
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,149
Martha, stay here.
Do not let anyone in.

486
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,881
<i>I shall return tomorrow.</i>

487
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,123
<i>Martha! Do you hear me?</i>

488
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:41,427
Please, stay here.

489
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,970
what's going on in here?

490
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:38,883
I believe
Officer Davenport
and Officer MattheWs

491
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:41,113
have been entertaining
the prisoner, Sir.

492
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:42,348
Is that right, Sergeant?

493
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:43,446
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

494
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:44,888
I've got a job for you.

495

<i>we have unfinished business</i>
<i>in the Arooka Ranges.</i>

496
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:48,621
<i>Sir?</i>

497
00:53:48,695 --> 00:53:50,595
<i>Rebel blacks, Sergeant.

498
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:53,963
<i>within two hours</i>

499
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:58,471
and recruit some more

500
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:05,205
Fucking snake.

501
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:10,513
why are you still standing there?

502
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,752
<i>You've been dismissed.</i>

503
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,731
Where's Charlie,
Mr. Stanley?

504
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:28,901
I don't know, son.

505
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:31,061
I don't know.

506
00:54:42,249 --> 00:54:43,477
<i>Captain?</i>

507
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,992
<i>Captain.</i>

508
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:41,139
<i>Let's see him, Stanley!

509
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:47,139
<i>Give him to us,</i>
<i>Stanley!

510
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,749
Bring him out, Stanley.

511
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,481
<i>Stand aside,</i>
<i>Stanley.</i>

512
00:55:57,257 --> 00:55:58,918
<i>we want justice.</i>

513
00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:07,195
I'll shoot

514
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:12,034
the first person
Who lays hands
on Mike Burns.

515
00:56:12,105 --> 00:56:13,436
<i>Give him to us.</i>

516
00:56:24,784 --> 00:56:25,978
You heard me.

517
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:29,681
You move, I'll shoot you dead.

518
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:32,850
<i>Are you going to shoot</i>
<i>your wife as well, Captain?</i>

519
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:38,924
Martha?

520
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:42,935
She was with child,
for God's sake.

521
00:56:43,003 --> 00:56:46,632
Martha, if this...
flogging goes ahead,

522
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:52,441
it will be our death sentence.

523
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,412
what if it had been me?

524
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:18,967
Captain Stanley?

525
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:20,028
Help me!

526
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,095
Get on, Mikey!

527
00:57:21,174 --> 00:57:22,664
Get off of me!

00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:27,712
Come on!

530
00:57:32,352 --> 00:57:34,217
My good people,

532
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:40,516

<i>Most bloodthirsty villains</i>

<i>Today he will be flogged.</i>

540

00:58:03,283 --> 00:58:05,148
<i>One hundred lashes.</i>

542
00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:06,617
Proceed.

543
00:58:06,686 --> 00:58:07,880
One!

544
00:58:10,457 --> 00:58:11,617

Please!

547
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:38,296
He could shame a nightingale.

548
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,015
Thirty-eight!

549
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:56,521
<i>Thirthy-ninel</i>

Your days are over,
Captain Stanley.

552
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:45,262
Martha...

553
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:48,363

554
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,842
Martha, you must eat.

555
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:39,180
Tobey's made you some soup.

556
01:04:00,506 --> 01:04:01,632
This is good.

557
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:14,150
You must eat something,
Martha, please.

558
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:18,346
No.

559
01:04:23,096 --> 01:04:24,188
No.

560
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:38,008
I'm so sorry.

561
01:04:40,413 --> 01:04:41,903
Forgive me, please.

562
01:04:41,981 --> 01:04:43,972
I just wanted to protect you.

563
01:04:46,419 --> 01:04:48,410
I had an idea about justice

564
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:51,887
for the town, for the country,

565

For you.

567
01:04:59,966 --> 01:05:01,228
But Now...

568
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:05,470
I don't know.

569
01:05:06,806 --> 01:05:08,831
Hey, quit pissing down me leg.

570
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:10,671
what do you need
a fucking tree for?

571
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:19,343
Strange mob, you Whities.

572
01:05:26,826 --> 01:05:28,418
Good news!

573
01:05:28,494 --> 01:05:29,859
Sergeant Laurie,

576
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:36,259
Where?

577
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:37,359
See?

578
01:05:38,805 --> 01:05:39,999
Hard to see it.

579
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:42,773
At foot of the Ranges.

580
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:44,935
<i>what? I can't see</i>
<i>a bloody thing.</i>

583
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:52,244
Smoke.

584
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:11,197
Love.

585
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:14,807
Love is the key.

586
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:18,567
Love and family.

587
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:24,111
For what are night and day,

588

<i>what could be</i>

595
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:49,501

Hey, Jacko, you lazy bugger.

606

Jacko!

609

<i>slowly Now, Sergeant.</i>

Put your privates
back in your pants

612
01:09:53,059 --> 01:09:54,720
Come to steal my brother a horse

and we find ourselves a copper.

614
01:09:56,562 --> 01:09:59,725
You fire that gun,
you'll have eight more
all over you.

615
01:09:59,799 --> 01:10:01,323
Fair enough.

<i>Step into the shade,</i>

617

That's right, stay.
Lay down, Sergeant.

Hey! Whoa!

01:11:29,722 --> 01:11:33,920
<i>I've been having a dream,</i>
<i>most nights.</i>

639
01:11:33,993 --> 01:11:36,120
<i>I've kept it from you.</i>

640
01:11:36,195 --> 01:11:38,322
<i>But I don't suppose</i>
<i>it matters Now.</i>

641
01:11:39,965 --> 01:11:41,694
I'm in a room.

642
01:11:43,035 --> 01:11:45,697
It's our bedroom, I think, and...

643
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:48,503
I'm searching for something.

644
01:11:49,842 --> 01:11:51,571
<i>And then suddenly,</i>

645
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:54,112
<i>I feel a presence</i>
<i>in the room,</i>

646
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:58,776
<i>and I stand up,</i>
<i>and I turn around</i>

647
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:01,843
<i>and there in the doorway</i>
<i>is Eliza Hopkins.</i>

648
01:12:02,855 --> 01:12:05,016
And she looks frightful.

649
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:10,527
Her dress is all...
creased and torn

650
01:12:10,596 --> 01:12:13,690
and covered in blood,
and her face, too.

651
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:17,964
All battered and bruised
and splashed with blood.

652
01:12:18,037 --> 01:12:19,299
Martha...

653
01:12:19,371 --> 01:12:20,838
<i>But listen to this.</i>

654
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:24,808
I n her arms she's
holding something. L...

655
01:12:25,778 --> 01:12:27,643
I can't see what it is

656
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:31,647
because it's covered by her hair.

657
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:35,553
And then she Walks toWards me

658
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:38,313
very slowly.

659
01:12:40,693 --> 01:12:41,921
Then...

660
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:46,254
she hands me a tiny bundle,

661
01:12:49,235 --> 01:12:51,066
and I look down,

662
01:12:53,072 --> 01:12:55,836
and I see that it's a baby.

663
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:59,768
<i>A newborn.</i>

664
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:05,408
<i>And this baby...</i>
<i>oh, it's a beautiful baby,</i>
<i>Morris.</i>

665
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:11,813
<i>And it opens it's eyes,</i>

666
01:13:11,891 --> 01:13:13,586
and then

667
01:13:13,659 --> 01:13:19,120
I feel a pressure on my hand,
and I look down, and I see
that the baby has

668
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:24,761
taken hold of my finger,
and its squeezing it tight
in its tiny fist.

669
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,240
Then I wake up.

670
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:41,509
But after I wake it's...

671
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:43,145
It's the strangest thing.

672
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:45,349
I can still feel...

673
01:13:45,424 --> 01:13:49,884
I still feel the pressure
of that dream-baby's hand.

674
01:13:49,962 --> 01:13:52,192
On my finger.

675
01:13:56,335 --> 01:13:58,326
what do you think of that?

676
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:15,250
Good boy!

677
01:14:16,855 --> 01:14:18,152
Nice and tight!

678
01:14:18,224 --> 01:14:19,657
<i>Right...

679
01:14:21,093 --> 01:14:23,152
Up we get.

680
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,157
Oh, no I wouldn't
try that if I were you.

681
01:14:27,233 --> 01:14:30,430
Ligatures and knots are one
of my many talents.

682
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:33,762
<i>Right.

683
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:38,501
And it appears

684
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:42,775
that you are singularly
bereft in any talents
whatsoever, Mr. Burns.

685
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:48,351
To be speared by a savage.

686
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,752
how extraordinarily quaint.

687
01:14:52,725 --> 01:14:56,183
Easy, Mr. Burns.

688
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:02,900
I was drunk.
You only got me
because I was drunk.

689
01:15:02,968 --> 01:15:07,200
well,
I'm not drunk Now.
I'm on the job Now.

690
01:15:08,974 --> 01:15:10,566
Not a bad day's work either.

691
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:15,376
<i>For what is</i>
<i>an Irishman, but a nigger</i>
<i>turned inside out?</i>

692
01:15:15,447 --> 01:15:16,937
Now...

693
01:15:17,016 --> 01:15:19,541
we're going to sit down

694
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,186
on this log

695
01:15:22,254 --> 01:15:25,553
nice and easy,
Mr. Burns.

696
01:15:26,258 --> 01:15:27,520
There.

697
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:49,239
I really should
stop saving your life,
brother Charlie...

698
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:54,510
...all things
considered.

699
01:15:54,586 --> 01:15:58,022
<i>"There's night</i>
<i>and day, brother.</i>

700
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:01,082
"Both sweet things.

701
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:07,429
"Sun and moon and stars,
all sweet things.

702
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:11,198
"Very quiet.

703
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:14,296
"There's a Wind on the heath.

704
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:18,170
"Life is very

705
01:16:18,243 --> 01:16:22,407
sweet, brother."

706
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:27,350
"Life is very sweet, brother.

707
01:16:27,419 --> 01:16:31,549
Who would wish
to die?"

708
01:16:33,092 --> 01:16:35,151
George Borrow, I believe.

709
01:16:36,295 --> 01:16:38,195
A Worthy writer

710
01:16:38,263 --> 01:16:40,788
and a beautiful sentiment, sir.

711
01:16:42,034 --> 01:16:44,002
But you're not my brother.

712
01:16:55,681 --> 01:16:56,739
Finish him.

713
01:16:59,685 --> 01:17:00,845
Oh, dear.

714
01:17:05,424 --> 01:17:07,221
This may hurt.

715
01:17:36,255 --> 01:17:39,782
why can't you
ever just... stop me?

716
01:17:45,931 --> 01:17:48,126
They are hanging Mikey
come Christmas Day.

717
01:17:50,335 --> 01:17:51,825
when's Christmas, Charlie?

718
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:54,000
I have some riding to do.

719
01:17:54,072 --> 01:17:55,630
Brother!

720
01:18:13,492 --> 01:18:14,823
Where did you get it?

721
01:18:14,893 --> 01:18:16,656
I am a very resourceful woman.

722
01:18:16,728 --> 01:18:18,286
I never doubted it for a moment.

723
01:18:18,363 --> 01:18:19,830
<i>Look real good, Missus.</i>

724
01:18:19,898 --> 01:18:21,365
Thank you, Tobey.

725
01:18:22,468 --> 01:18:23,594
And...

726
01:18:36,849 --> 01:18:37,907
And look.

727
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:46,516
snow.

728
01:18:53,799 --> 01:18:55,528
Ho-ho-ho.

729
01:18:55,601 --> 01:18:57,432
Ho-ho-ho.

730
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,129
<i>Who is it?</i>

731
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:04,368
<i>Doctor Bantry.</i>

732
01:19:10,148 --> 01:19:11,410
Are you alone?

733
01:19:12,217 --> 01:19:13,206
Yes.

734
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:17,455
Then you may come in.

735
01:19:24,029 --> 01:19:27,055
It doesn't look good,
Morris. The boy is dying.

736
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:31,700
Nothing I can... do.

737
01:19:35,674 --> 01:19:38,142
It sure is pretty.

738
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:40,405
You can never get
your fill of nature, Samuel.

739
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:42,447
To be surrounded
by it is to be stilled.

740
01:19:42,514 --> 01:19:44,539
It salves the heart.

741
01:19:44,616 --> 01:19:48,382
The mountains, the trees,
the endless plains.

742
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:50,546
The moon, the myriad of stars.

743
01:19:50,622 --> 01:19:53,284
Every man can be made
quiet and complete.

744
01:19:53,358 --> 01:19:57,317
Even the lowliest
misanthrope or the most
Wretched of sinners.

745
01:19:57,396 --> 01:19:59,830
what's a misanthrope, Arthur?

746
01:19:59,898 --> 01:20:02,696
Some bugger Who fucking
hates every other bugger.

747
01:20:02,768 --> 01:20:05,066
Hey! I didn't ask you,
you black bastard.

748
01:20:05,137 --> 01:20:08,197
He's right, Samuel.
A misanthrope is one
Who hates humanity.

749
01:20:09,975 --> 01:20:12,603
Is that what we are?
M isanthropes?

750
01:20:12,678 --> 01:20:15,044
Good, Lord, no.
we're a family.

751
01:21:27,953 --> 01:21:29,682
Best you go Now, Tobey.

752
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:42,322
Tobey...

753
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:47,198
Merry Christmas.

754
01:21:56,682 --> 01:21:58,377

762
01:22:49,901 --> 01:22:51,368

763
01:22:51,436 --> 01:22:53,961

And keep your lustful
eyes to the ground,
you lecherous dog,

766
01:23:03,582 --> 01:23:06,346
or I'll whip the filthy
black hide right off you.

Good morning, M iss.

768
01:23:29,741 --> 01:23:30,969

769
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:33,169
<i>I don't know.</i>

770
01:23:33,245 --> 01:23:35,270
It must be some
ofLawrence's lot.

771
01:23:37,315 --> 01:23:38,304

That's right.

793

Mikey...

794
01:27:23,575 --> 01:27:25,475
It's all your fault, Charlie.

795
01:27:25,543 --> 01:27:27,568
You should never have left us.

796
01:27:44,195 --> 01:27:45,526
would you like me to carve?

797
01:27:45,597 --> 01:27:47,963
No, no, no.
I'll carve.

798
01:28:10,789 --> 01:28:12,484
Finest bird I've ever had, Ma'am.

799

01:28:46,491 --> 01:28:47,890
Thank you.

801
01:29:12,784 --> 01:29:15,776
For what we are about to receive,

802
01:29:15,854 --> 01:29:17,822
may the Lord make us
truly thankful.

803
01:29:17,889 --> 01:29:18,981
Amen.

804
01:29:21,926 --> 01:29:23,393
Merry Christmas.

805
01:29:25,163 --> 01:29:26,790
Merry Christmas.

806
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,262
Mmm!

807
01:29:55,026 --> 01:29:56,323
Guard the woman, Samuel.

808
01:29:57,729 --> 01:29:58,787
Shit!

809
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:16,871
Move out of your seat
again, Ma'am,

810
01:30:16,948 --> 01:30:19,917
and I'll stick this fork
through your fucking eye.

811
01:30:21,819 --> 01:30:23,446
Shut up.

812
01:30:23,521 --> 01:30:25,819
I said, shut up.

813
01:30:50,014 --> 01:30:51,242
It's Christmas.

814
01:31:19,844 --> 01:31:21,038
what does that say?

815
01:31:33,224 --> 01:31:34,885
"To my darling wife,

816
01:31:36,027 --> 01:31:37,824
"Whom I love so much.

817
01:31:37,895 --> 01:31:40,125
I'm sorry."

818
01:31:41,966 --> 01:31:43,456
<i>Sorry for what?</i>

819
01:31:58,816 --> 01:32:02,650
Oh, Ma'am, they're beautiful!

820
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,416
<i>Never seen</i>
<i>anything so beautiful.</i>

821
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:06,479
<i>Samuel!

822
01:32:06,557 --> 01:32:07,819
That's us.

823
01:32:29,647 --> 01:32:31,615
You Won't want
to miss this, Captain.

824
01:33:05,783 --> 01:33:08,513
<i>Samuel, sing us</i>
Peggy Gordon.

825
01:33:26,704 --> 01:33:28,194
Charlie!

826
01:33:28,272 --> 01:33:30,240
Just in time.

827
01:33:30,308 --> 01:33:32,435
Mikey's dead.

828
01:33:35,079 --> 01:33:37,809
Listen to that.
He sings like a bird.

829
01:33:53,664 --> 01:33:56,360
Ohhh...

830
01:33:59,637 --> 01:34:01,400
Not the guts, Charlie.

831
01:34:03,508 --> 01:34:04,736
Shit.

832
01:34:09,514 --> 01:34:10,708
No more.

833
01:34:57,628 --> 01:34:59,528
I'm going to be with me brother.

834
01:36:10,768 --> 01:36:12,258
You got me, Charlie.

835
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:23,910
what are you going to do now?
