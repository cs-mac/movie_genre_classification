1
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,410
They say that it's safe on the
other side.

2
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:20,206
That people don't kill over
there.

3
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,293
But the narcos are over here.

4
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,886
My dream is that there would be
no more murders here.

5
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,634
I want to see him!

6
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,226
We can't get through here.

7
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:05,019
They're saying hooded people
came and killed him.

8
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,731
They took out an AK-47 and shot
him.

9
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,192
Well first with a pistol.

10
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,695
Then they ran out of bullets

11
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,407
so they took the AK
and started shooting the car.

12
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,410
Good thing they didn't hit the
gas tank.

13
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,037
It would have exploded.

14
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,291
They shoot randomly

15
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,211
and liquidate everyone.

16
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,257
That's how they killed my
uncle. He was going to church.

17
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:41,722
My uncle was just walking and
gotshot

18
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,142
He choked on his own blood.

19
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,482
We're going out to Guadalupe
to pick up a body.

20
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,069
The streets are empty.

21
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,699
Because of the situation people
don't leave their houses.

22
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:47,037
Here in this plaza
they left dismembered bodies,

23
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,580
without heads.

24
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,334
Sometimes only the heads
with a message.

25
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,506
We have to come out here to
work

26
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,635
and it's very dangerous for us
to be here.

27
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,197
Juarez has always been a
dangerous city.

28
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,792
In 2007, we processed 320
murders.

29
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:39,256
Then the drug war arrived in
our city.

30
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:02,946
In 2008, we processed 1,623
homicides.

31
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:12,623
In 2009, there were 2,754
murders.

32
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:30,099
3,622 were murdered in Juérez
in 2010.

33
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:49,076
In El Paso, Texas, just across
the river

34
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,704
there were only five murders
that same year.

35
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,251
Making it the safest city in
the United States.

36
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,982
I was walking in peace
around Guadalajara

37
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:24,820
The damn government started a
battle

38
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:32,161
With an AK-47 but no bulletproof
vest, I cruised in my white truck

39
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:36,123
I hit one, my rifle never fails

40
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:40,586
With a good eye and a good
pulse, my school fights back

41
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,011
All right "Ghost" my friend...

42
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,555
What do you want me to put in
your song?

43
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,809
The more stuff you let me know, the
more I can make it interesting

44
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,353
and the better it will come
out.

45
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,440
Say that I come from Michoacén.

46
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,402
And now you can find me in
Oxnard.

47
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,779
What caliber do you carry?

48
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,656
A 9mm.

49
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,411
Or the R15 [machine gun].

50
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,123
Do you want me to say your
name, or just call you "Ghost?"

51
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,750
"El Ghost."

52
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,793
That's it.

53
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,132
Gonna go meet up with "Ghost."

54
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,552
A little hustle I got going on
here.

55
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,769
Let's do it here in the truck.

56
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,363
Is everyone ready or what?

57
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,911
Walking around without hearing
with bags under my eyes

58
00:08:55,911 --> 00:09:01,041
I don't like the usual [weed] Only
the best quality inside these jars

59
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,127
The clients ask and they pay

60
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,588
And I bring them the package

61
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,341
The car stayed parked

62
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,552
and I went in my Silverado

63
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,265
South to north on Highway 101,
always in transit

64
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,434
With payments for my friends

65
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,147
My name... it slipped my mind

66
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,653
I'll pay you now?

67
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,159
Solid?

68
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,424
Damn, no tip?

69
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,066
Savings.

70
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,073
Did he like the corrido?

71
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,409
Yeah he liked it.
Tomorrow I'm gonna record it for him.

72
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:51,026
...And he asks if I want to
sing in a band he was starting

73
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:46,873
We're bloodthirsty, crazy,
and we like to kill

74
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,917
Sing it!

75
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,436
Sorry.

76
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,399
Why do you work with a mask?

77
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,485
For our security.

78
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,864
There are so many people at the
crime scene.

79
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,366
We never know

80
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,870
what people are in the crowd.

81
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,707
Maybe the murderer is one of
them?

82
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,177
Please... my children are over
there!

83
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,556
Let me see!

84
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:50,645
I'm fine! Let me see!

85
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,731
My children!

86
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,318
- Let me pass.

87
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,778
- I can't.

88
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,113
Why not? It's my house.

89
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,081
We saw two cars arrive.

90
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,169
One of them stopped, put their hand
out the window and started shoofing.

91
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,714
There were three shots and
then they left.

92
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,466
And who did it?

93
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,011
A kid. Maybe 14 or 15 years
old.

94
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,602
He left a note: "There are 11
left."

95
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,231
They are going to come for 11
more.

96
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,150
That's it.

97
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,120
We'll have to walk.

98
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,541
This is going to be a bitch.

99
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,840
Get behind the line.

100
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,892
They killed him!

101
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:24,197
In this last year, many of my
colleagues have quit

102
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,867
out of fear and insecurity.

103
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,129
I know the danger that we are in
as crime scene investigators.

104
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,259
But this is my job.
It's what I like to do.

105
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,471
And so I refused to quit.

106
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,329
I was born here in Juérez.

107
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:18,251
My father was born in Juérez
too.

108
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,588
It's a beautiful city

109
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,591
and very sincere.

110
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:38,480
Six or seven years ago, This was a
very different city than today.

111
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,608
Now there are no jobs.

112
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,444
There are no businesses

113
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,655
they have closed because of
extorsion.

114
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:53,578
So many innocent people here
have lost their lives

115
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,582
for being in the wrong place.

116
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,390
The only way I can help this
city

117
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,725
is through my work.

118
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,436
We'll be right there.

119
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,897
You are probably asking, as are
other Mexicans, if this can change.

120
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,274
And my answer is "yes."

121
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,525
Yes it can change.

122
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,779
Things can change, and they
will change for the better.

123
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,413
It's Mexican weed with an
American name.

124
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,418
Wow it smells nice.

125
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,421
Like the scent of a woman.

126
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,137
Thanks to the fucking weed

127
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,101
You take it like this, right?

128
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,612
A little gift, a bonus.

129
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:39,077
The guy liked the corrido and he
gave me a weapon. That's how it is.

130
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,710
1... 2... 3... BuKnas!

131
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,052
What song does this fucking
bazooka remind you of?

132
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:04,018
With an AK-47 and a bazooka on
my shoulder

133
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,148
Cross my path and I'll chop
your head off

134
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:15,405
We're bloodthirsty, crazy,
and we like to kill!

135
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,159
What violent people in El Paso,
Texas!

136
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,288
That's why we are
as disturbing as ever.

137
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,040
This song is what we are all
about!

138
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,670
With an AK-47 and a bazooka on
my shoulder

139
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,756
Cross my path and I'll chop
your head off

140
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:39,262
We're bloodthirsty, crazy,
and we like to kill!

141
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,390
We are the best at kidnapping

142
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,602
Our gang always travels in a
caravan

143
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:51,357
With bullet proof vests, ready
to execute!

144
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,360
I'm number one, code name "M1"

145
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,156
I'm backed up by El Chapo

146
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,992
My name is Manuel Torres Felix

147
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,494
sending greetings from
Culiacén.

148
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,114
SEMEFO consists of the forensic
medical service,

149
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,451
criminal investigation field
work

150
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,996
the ballistic laboratory

151
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,042
the chemical laboratory

152
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,294
the genetics department

153
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,755
criminal identification

154
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,051
and vehicle identification,
among others.

155
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:10,770
Right now we are the busiest forensic
department in this country and the world.

156
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,565
We have two bodies. Completely
burned.

157
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,694
Completely burned? Damn.

158
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,240
Copy that.

159
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,174
It's difficult to work on the bodies here.
We can't get them out.

160
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,928
It'll be safer to do back in
the lab.

161
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,521
The men in the car were first
executed by shooting.

162
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:40,735
Then they were doused in gasofine, and the
truck was left burning for everyone to see.

163
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:50,536
Revenge is something we've
experienced first hand.

164
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:57,877
On June 3rd, 2010, my colleague
Juan Luis was assassinated.

165
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:03,383
He was gunned down in front
of his house after work.

166
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:12,433
A month later, Saul Chavez left the
office to go pick up his kids from school

167
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:16,729
He was murdered as he waited
outside.

168
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,361
Oscar Miranda was the third
member of the unit we lost.

169
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:30,910
The hitmen unloaded over 40 rounds from
automatic weapons in front of his home.

170
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:42,130
They were all killed on their
way to or from the office.

171
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,677
I just saw a suspicious car
outside.

172
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,222
When was this?

173
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,516
Right now. I just got back.

174
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:00,189
You should contact
the coordinator and the boss

175
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,066
and tell them...

176
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,111
Fuck.

177
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,365
Do you have your radio?

178
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,869
Those were gun shots.

179
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,872
High caliber.

180
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,643
If you see any action or anything just call
us so we can send you 23 [Emergency Help].

181
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,061
Thank you.

182
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:43,483
Wait, just let me check.

183
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,707
You always go out with a prayer
on your lips.

184
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:04,295
You never know when things will
happen.

185
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,225
You always have to

186
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,271
look what vehicles are at your
side.

187
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,943
If you see a strange car...

188
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,321
Look, that one doesn't have
plates.

189
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,200
Those are the kind of vehicles
that we're really scared of.

190
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:51,217
This is the risk of working
here.

191
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,067
This is the "Movimiento
Alterado"

192
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,695
Straight out of Sinaloa

193
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:17,410
Sending reinforcements to decapitate El
Macho leads wearing a bulletproof vest

194
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:23,207
Bazooka in hand with experience
Wearing grenades, death is within

195
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,547
Twiins Culiacén.

196
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:38,639
...The girls take off their clothes a
private party like you can't imagine!

197
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,602
Hit it! Hit it!

198
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:51,485
If there wasn't so much violence in Mexico,
we wouldn't have such badass corridos.

199
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:55,031
And that's reflected in the
Movimento Alterado.

200
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,800
This is the first time all of the Movimiento
Alterado bands are here on Sunset.

201
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,596
In Hollywood, with all the
celebrities.

202
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:26,103
We do it in L.A. because it's
very powerful

203
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:31,275
to give birth to new musical
movements, artistic movements.

204
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,653
We upgraded to The House of
Blues now.

205
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,700
...A new Mexican-American
culture.

206
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,495
All this culture is being mixed
together.

207
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,206
People have come here from all
oven"

208
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,890
It's so cool to see regular
people...

209
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,977
They go to a club, and they feel
narco for that night, you know?

210
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,472
Komander, Komander!

211
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,400
Komander how are you?

212
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,863
Is this the first step to
Hollywood?

213
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,614
Let's hope, let's hope!

214
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,080
We're going to see a series of
great artists...

215
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,083
a huge lineup of 22 artists.

216
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,920
You said you were going to
arrive at 11am.

217
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,719
I was waiting here with the
weed.

218
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,600
This is a musical movement from
Los Angeles

219
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,977
but really it comes from
Sinaloa.

220
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:34,565
And so it's an honor to present,
straight out of Culiacéln,Sinaloa...

221
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,861
my main man, Komander.

222
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,993
- Great corrido.
- Yeah you like it?

223
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,079
My mom listens to it. She says,
"it reminds me of you!"

224
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,540
Yeah I wrote that in Durango.
Badass,dude.

225
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,375
Oh you wrote it there?

226
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,563
He's started playing the
accordion.

227
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,149
One day you can be like me!

228
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,861
Who wants corridos?

229
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,994
One, two, three... BuKnas!

230
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,651
Take a bite out of crime!

231
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,243
People are very drunk, very
hyped up.

232
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,788
Often people have already taken
drugs.

233
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,252
There are fights in eight out
of every ten shows we do.

234
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:25,277
You always hear these narco corridos
over the police frequencies.

235
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:32,993
After we hear a narco corrido, it
means there's been an execufion.

236
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,899
Thanks, we'll be right there.

237
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:22,918
[The police] never come around here.
And now they drive by twice. Why?

238
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,547
They were scouting ahead,
working for the bad guys.

239
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:30,009
They're all the same guys.

240
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,179
I don't understand why
there are so many police here.

241
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,266
They should go and catch the
criminal.

242
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,439
The federales stop people,
but then just let them go.

243
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,775
And the local cops abuse their power.
They're bullies.

244
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,904
It's their fault so many
innocent people die.

245
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,409
Just now five or six people
were killed.

246
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,203
Including workers, clients

247
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,206
and supposedly a police officer
too.

248
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,835
Nice Christmas.

249
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,487
Sometimes you ask yourself,
"Did I mess up?"

250
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,948
"Was there something I didn't
do right?"

251
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,081
Some people even say...

252
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,210
"You guys are just bullet
collectors."

253
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,132
It's sad when people don't
value your work.

254
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,100
The truth is

255
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,436
there are many deaths that...

256
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,563
that sometimes...

257
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,525
it gets frustrating.

258
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:19,076
As a crime investigator, I play
my part in the system.

259
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,867
He was watching the news.

260
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,827
And I asked, "What happened
son?"

261
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,705
- He grabbed his face.
- "What happened son?"

262
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,748
A colleague.

263
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:09,334
- "What happened?"
- They killed him.

264
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,424
Now Richi doesn't go out.

265
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,720
He doesn't go have a drink, go for a walk.
He doesn't leave.

266
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,015
He comes from work to home

267
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,892
eats and sleeps

268
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,768
and then goes back to work.

269
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:36,278
When he leaves in the morning, I
don't know if he'll come back.

270
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,826
Sometimes I wish that you would
leave that job.

271
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,829
WW don"t you quit my son?

272
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,127
Why not? Give me an
explanation?

273
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,760
There is no other work.

274
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,221
And it's my career.

275
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:11,897
But last week, you lost one of
your colleagues?

276
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,155
Sometimes I worry so much, you
have no idea.

277
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:27,621
But like Richi said, it's his
work, it's his career.

278
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,334
If he leaves his job, what will
he do for work?

279
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,880
All the small businesses are
closed or closing.

280
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:42,386
And those that aren't closing
are paying extortion money.

281
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,639
What if you get married and go
to El Paso?

282
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:50,185
If he gets a good job there,
we'll all go with him!

283
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,986
This is my house.

284
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,947
I was born and raised here.

285
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,033
I've lived here for 34 years.

286
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:14,042
This has always been my room.
My own space.

287
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,505
Here it's just me.

288
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:23,635
This is where I laugh, this is
where I cry, all of it.

289
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,780
Yes my son.

290
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:47,409
Be really careful okay?

291
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,122
Bye son, God bless.

292
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,586
Richi doesn't want to leave his
work.

293
00:38:57,586 --> 00:39:05,344
But the higher he gets promoted
the more danger he's in.

294
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:11,350
And he tells me "Mom, at 6pm
lock yourself in."

295
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,312
Unless you see that they're customers,
don't open the door for anyone

296
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,109
These young guys come in...

297
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:27,157
They come in with little papers like
this, and they leave you a phone number.

298
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:32,829
And you say, "What is this?
What do you want?"

299
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,334
They say, "Call this number, I
don't know anything."

300
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:45,967
You're afraid and don't know what to do.
But you have to call.

301
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,474
They tell you they'll come by
to charge a certain amount.

302
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:58,021
- But why? I don't have very much...
- I already told you.

303
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,067
If not, close your store.

304
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,986
We'll burn this place down.

305
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,198
What can we do?

306
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,662
OPEN

307
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:29,052
- Joaquin, you okay?
- You got hit by the ricochet?

308
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,106
Calm down, my love.

309
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,358
A gun shot!

310
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,819
Another!

311
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:26,526
It's all taken care of.
Where to now, boss?

312
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:31,656
We run the risk that this
fucker will tell his friends.

313
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,741
Cut it.

314
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,493
Okay, cut.

315
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:40,165
This is how movies need to be
made, stupid.

316
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,845
He's here! It's the actor from
"El Baleado"!

317
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:55,722
Take eight, camera two.

318
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:57,599
Action!

319
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,022
You're dead!

320
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,608
Cut.

321
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,325
Everyone listens to narco
corridos.

322
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,786
I don't think there's anyone
who doesn't like them.

323
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:23,083
I would like to be the
girlfriend of a narco

324
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,546
because it's a way of life, not
anything bad.

325
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:30,799
Well, okay, it is something
bad, but it's a way of life.

326
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,677
It's been coming for years, in
our Mexico.

327
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,888
It's something that's a culture
for us.

328
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,413
Where are you playing now, at
the Nokia theater?

329
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,665
Yeah man.

330
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,543
Sold out, dude.

331
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:10,059
Arriba Los Angeles!

332
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:24,949
...I've got so much to learn!

333
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:30,747
I need more words, more slang.

334
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:37,128
You should send me to Mexico to live
there for six months or something.

335
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:46,554
If you're born here, you don't have the
same vocabulary as someone from Mexico.

336
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:58,233
I have to get my information
from YouTube and the Internet.

337
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,027
All Komander has to do is walk
outside.

338
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:09,661
For that reason I've always wanted to
go to Culiacén, to write more corridos.

339
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:36,855
How are you my son?

340
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,898
I'm good grandma, thanks.

341
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,985
You've been dancing!

342
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,155
I was thinking today...

343
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:52,203
I just could not have met a
better woman than you.

344
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,248
No, I'm serious.

345
00:47:55,623 --> 00:48:00,545
Avvvvw, love!

346
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:05,800
I kill at a very early age

347
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,553
That's why I live so
traumatized

348
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:15,643
then to get over the trauma, I
go get into a fight

349
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:19,188
Now nobody can catch me

350
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:23,192
They'll say "He has flown
away."

351
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:28,156
...with his AK-47 at his side.

352
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,201
We are getting to work...

353
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:35,705
I don't like his voice.

354
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:41,836
He has a good tone, but the
Gordito Chaparrito is better.

355
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,130
Yeah, why couldn't he come?

356
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,883
In the mafia he is known

357
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,177
as M1 by his friends

358
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:52,722
Active collaborator

359
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,744
My girlfriend and I have
plans...

360
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,415
to live over there in the
United States, in El Paso.

361
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,002
She feels more at peace there.

362
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:28,675
She doesn't want to live in Juérez
because of the insecurity and dangen

363
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:35,473
We have to think about the safety of our
kids when we have a family one day.

364
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,267
It would be a major change.

365
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:02,667
After you cross the bridge,
you feel a certain quietness.

366
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:09,382
A different rhythm of life.

367
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,826
How do you feel, Richi,
coming back to Mexico?

368
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:41,164
You wouldn't believe how much
more free I feel

369
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,625
because it's my country and my
city.

370
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:50,882
Here I'm less worried about
breaking every little rule.

371
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:54,677
I just feel more confident.

372
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,935
It'll be hard to live there.

373
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,231
There are different customs and
culture.

374
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:09,984
A different language.

375
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,946
I'll miss this.

376
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,241
Everything that's here -
Mexico...

377
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,619
Juérez.

378
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:24,290
Juérez isn't just death and
violence.

379
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,169
There's also love. Kindness.
Respect.

380
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,050
There are good people.

381
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:39,323
What's your name?

382
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,783
Carlos Hogada

383
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,160
And who received money?

384
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:48,875
In a video posted online, a captured
member of the Sinaloa Cartel

385
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,962
is being interrogated by
members of a rival cartel.

386
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,926
They force him to identify corrupt
officials working with the Sinaloa cartel.

387
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:05,224
Who else inside the law is paid
off by the Sinaloa Cartel?

388
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:12,565
Corrupt or not, the officials named in
the video knew they were targets now.

389
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,817
Give me more names!

390
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:19,572
The coordinator of SEMEFO in
Juérez.

391
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,782
What's his name?

392
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:41,594
Two days later another video
was released.

393
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:43,930
This time, there was no
talking.

394
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,642
Awritten message appeared,
saying:

395
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:52,271
"This is what will happen to people who
continue to work for the Sinaloa Cartel."

396
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:56,651
And this time, as usual, a narco
corrido playing in the background.

397
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:21,759
The situation in the office was
very uncomfortable.

398
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:26,430
The guys began referring to
Oscar as "dead man walking."

399
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:37,775
After knowing about the threats, and
certain information being circulated

400
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:44,448
your life changes radically because
you need to take precautions.

401
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:50,454
You can't go out like you used
to or like any person does

402
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,291
walk through the mall...

403
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,879
And you have a family too
right?

404
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:03,092
This is something you have to
explain to them?

405
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:08,681
Yes, but in the last year we've
lost colleagues.

406
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:14,478
It's a risk all of us who work
here take.

407
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,607
You're not working in a flower
shop.

408
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:25,072
It'd be stupid not to be on
alert.

409
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:31,620
And I'd rather not talk about my family,
so I don't give them any ideas...

410
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:39,962
Although Oscar was shaken, he kept
working until he received a threat:

411
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:44,759
"if you don't resign, you'll be
executed tonight."

412
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:50,639
Oscar quit, and was never seen
at the office again.

413
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,787
The first thing that happens is
you stop fearing the law.

414
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:18,000
We have the law bought when we
work.

415
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,548
Because it's a cycle.

416
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:26,592
All of it.

417
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,224
Did you ever torture anybody?

418
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,601
Once.

419
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,816
I've had to do many things.

420
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:45,194
I've had to do favors for many
people.

421
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:52,576
There were three people
hitting him with wooden bats.

422
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:57,998
And when he wouldn't tell us
where [the drugs] were,

423
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:03,254
we burned him, pressed nails
into his hands,

424
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,505
everything.

425
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:10,678
But in that moment you don't
feel anything, because...

426
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:21,605
if the people you're working with see your
weakness, you're no longer useful to them.

427
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:27,236
So you need to turn cold.

428
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:31,282
You can't have compassion for
other people.

429
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,998
So I picked up the bat again

430
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,253
and worked up my nerve.

431
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:51,385
I took the bat again and gave
him three more hits

432
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:56,265
but these I gave him to the
back of his head

433
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,766
and it all opened up.

434
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,610
I couldn't sleep for a week.

435
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,747
I don't think it will ever end.

436
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:34,887
On July 25th, 2011, there was a
massacre in the Juérez prison.

437
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:39,517
In a video released by the
authorities

438
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:46,315
inmates dressed in white easily take keys
from guards, who then simply walk away.

439
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:58,494
They open the doors to the cell, and
other prisoners emerge with guns.

440
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:10,464
17 inmates were murdered that day,
and another 20 were injured.

441
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:21,809
It took 24 hours for the authorities
to take control of the situation,

442
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:26,480
and for us to gain access to
recover the bodies.

443
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,571
So the fact that you catch less

444
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:19,283
Does that indicate that there's actually
less movement of drug trafficking?

445
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:23,037
That could be a bad number too, right?
You're catching less.

446
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:17,132
The most natural herb ever,
marijuana from Sinaloa.

447
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:09,893
No to drugs. No to drugs.

448
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,282
We got a shoutout on YouTube.

449
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:30,706
"This video was specially made
for my friend Edgar Quintero

450
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:34,376
and my friend Jaime from
BuKnas de Culiacén, Sinaloa."

451
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,212
That's it. Make no mistake.

452
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,386
This is for our friends the
BuKnas!

453
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,188
To our friends The BuKnas!

454
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,570
Every time I watch this video
it hits me.

455
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,697
I want to raise a glass.

456
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:07,117
That's my friend "300" right
there.

457
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:08,911
Him and his brother

458
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:11,413
with his wooden leg.

459
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:17,544
300 came up to me as a fan and
asked how he could get a corrido.

460
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:21,924
Arriba Sinaloa, motherfuckers!

461
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,596
The Sinaloa Cartel has always
been there.

462
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:33,769
It's been the strongest cartel
after all these years.

463
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:39,316
And that's very important for
corridos.

464
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:46,031
You have to recognize what direction things
are going in, and what's becoming popular.

465
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:50,953
The Sinaloa Cartel is on the
rise right now

466
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:54,957
and that's why we sing corridos
to people who deserve them.

467
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,870
He sings for BuKnas de
Culiacén. He's a singer.

468
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,915
Yeah, we already know him.

469
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:47,426
The years have passed,
today I am a hitman

470
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:50,971
Working on the line for El
Chapo and El Mayo

471
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,266
I'm a brave person, a hard
worker

472
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:59,855
And I'm alert 24/7

473
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:05,861
I'm good at this and I follow
orders

474
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:09,531
my name is "300,"
tell me when and where

475
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:12,784
Business is booming,
even if it doesn't look like it

476
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,870
I've overseen it

477
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,916
down to the last detail

478
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:41,415
We've been looking at the
statistics of all reported crimes.

479
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:48,839
And we've found that out of every 100 homicides,
only three cases advance in their investigation.

480
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:57,723
And once those three are in court, even less
are actually found guilty and punished.

481
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:09,151
So 97% of the 10,000 murders in the last
four years have not even been investigated.

482
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,572
None of them have been
punished.

483
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:20,746
And if there's no punishment, people
will just commit more and more crimes.

484
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:38,972
In recent years, there's an increased
focus on forensic science.

485
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:43,351
The problem is that all this forensic
information is not going anywhere.

486
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:16,093
After the crime scene investigators
collect all this information

487
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:23,183
there are very few cases where they
actually follow that trail of evidence

488
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:26,103
and find the guilty party.

489
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,687
Almost never.

490
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:47,332
We have seen many many cases of authorities
collaborating with criminal organizations.

491
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:52,045
My opinion, based on what I've
seen

492
01:08:52,712 --> 01:09:01,930
is that the administration is very careful
to make sure there is no investigation.

493
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,978
This is going to be unsolved

494
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:12,065
and it's going to be like a
blackout in our history.

495
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:22,325
Can you tell us what happened with the body that
was found in the government office last Tuesday?

496
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:27,330
Cut.

497
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:33,420
I don't know if it's okay to
talk about that case.

498
01:09:47,017 --> 01:09:50,812
There's an infinite number of
cases.

499
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:57,402
We simply do our job and don't
know why.

500
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:10,916
On October 10th I went out on a
call and found a dismembered torso.

501
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:17,547
Human Jigsaw Puzzle

502
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:24,763
By nightfall, we had collected over ten
pieces of that one chopped-up body.

503
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:35,774
Not long after, a video of the
victim's mother appeared online.

504
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,778
Who authorized this war?

505
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:42,989
Who did they ask for
permission?

506
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,701
They didn't ask the citizens.

507
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:50,538
We are in the middle of this
war.

508
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,832
They are killing us.

509
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:56,711
They are killing our children
and nobody is doing anything.

510
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,966
Nobody shouts!

511
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:07,097
Who told [President Calderén] to
turn this into a battlefield?

512
01:11:07,097 --> 01:11:07,889
Who?

513
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,895
Who told this animal that he
could leave us like lab rats?

514
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:17,190
He should be the one fighting!

515
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,901
He should go to the front lines
and not our children.

516
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:23,363
Why do the all the mothers stay
silent?

517
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:28,285
Why?

518
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:34,040
They decapited him alive.

519
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:37,836
Those animals cut him up into
16 pieces.

520
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:41,172
Everybody saw when they took my
son.

521
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:46,136
It would have been better
if they killed him right there.

522
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:51,391
But they decapitated him alive.

523
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,852
That's what I can't stand.

524
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:56,146
The pain.

525
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:59,941
That I can't stand.

526
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,112
Shout, Juérez, Shout!

527
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:08,241
Shout about the pain they are
causing!

528
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,369
Why doesn't anybody shout?

529
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:55,955
Today, Durango, I want you to pay attention
even if it hasn't happened to you.

530
01:12:56,414 --> 01:13:01,503
But I want you to look around
you, and think and listen

531
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:04,506
to the pain of the cries:

532
01:13:04,506 --> 01:13:12,138
"Give me back my son! Give me back my father.
Give me back my brothers."

533
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,933
Because if you don't cry today,
Durango

534
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:21,564
If you don't go home with a new awareness
that tomorrow can't be the same as today

535
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:26,069
that tomorrow you can't live
the same as you lived today

536
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:31,574
Tomorrow you have the responsibility
to build a better Durango

537
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:35,453
because if you don't become
aware today

538
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:39,582
tomorrow Durango will be an
abandoned homeland.

539
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:05,442
We've walked 3,400 km to get to
Ciudad Juérez

540
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:09,320
the epicenter of the pain of
this country.

541
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:16,494
The march stayed in Juérez for
two days.

542
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:23,042
Over those 48 hours, we kept
working like always,

543
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,338
and processed 19 more
homicides.

544
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,685
I want a protection blessing.

545
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:43,771
We're going to Mexico.

546
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:45,773
What part?

547
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,984
To Culiacén.

548
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,361
Close your eyes.

549
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:08,004
How good that you have faith.

550
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:14,344
What parts of your life would change
if someone gave you a million dollars?

551
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,971
What wouldn't I do?

552
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:22,560
Build a house for my mom and
dad.

553
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:27,690
A house for me and my family.

554
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:34,072
You have your plans, but in that moment you
won't know what to do with that money.

555
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:38,117
You know why? Because you don't
need it.

556
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:42,247
You simply don't need that
money.

557
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:45,333
Or do you?

558
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,129
I just need my health and to
be...

559
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:55,176
Exactly. Health and security.

560
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,055
How old are you?

561
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:00,890
How old do I look?

562
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,518
Twenty-seven.

563
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:09,148
I just turned 60, and one day
you will too.

564
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:16,739
And at this age you have done
what you've done.

565
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:23,413
And once you complete your
mission then that's that.

566
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,967
I'll be back. Are you going to
behave?

567
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,219
No parties in the house okay?

568
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:42,223
You. No after parties in the
hotel.

569
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,893
Not in Mexico. Fuck no.

570
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,857
Mexico's dangerous.

571
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,864
Yeah I'm scared.

572
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,038
AK-47!

573
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:07,457
What did he say?

574
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,084
He said AK-47!

575
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:18,176
Wait wait wait! What about me?

576
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:25,433
Stop lying to him, Edgar.

577
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:30,164
This is to everyone who says
BuKnas aren't in Culiacén.

578
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,417
Here we are right in the middle
of Culiacén!

579
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:35,002
On a little ranch outside the
city, here we are!

580
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,839
Check it out, look all around
us!

581
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:42,260
If you know it well, you'll
know where we are!

582
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,480
Hey, look at his shirt!

583
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,818
BuKnas, see?

584
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:04,949
That's me, in the middle.

585
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,872
Is this all yours?

586
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:12,790
Yeah, everything here is ours.

587
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:17,712
It's really peaceful here.

588
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,840
Well of course, this is our
territory.

589
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:29,015
You guys are the bosses here.
Just tell us what to do and when to do it.

590
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:32,185
Because you know how the water
runs here.

591
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:35,354
I don't want there to be any
problems.

592
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,815
We came for what we came for.

593
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:40,443
Do some singing, have a good
time...

594
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:43,070
We can go wherever we want.

595
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:46,491
I just feel grateful right now.

596
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:49,035
Happy and grateful for...

597
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,245
Even the dogs don't bark at us
here.

598
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:52,079
What?

599
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:55,082
Even the dogs don't bark at us
here.

600
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,807
This is the good stuff, bro.

601
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:19,357
My friend and I were cooking
meth

602
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:24,237
We were happy, over there at
the ranch near Modesto

603
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:29,992
When the DEA came,
the lookout was in place

604
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:33,871
How much is in each bag?

605
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,123
One pound.

606
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:43,756
How much is that worth in
dollars?

607
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:49,095
$9,000 each in Los Angeles.

608
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,056
$100,000 total.

609
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:02,066
He traded in his boats
for pots to cook meth

610
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,988
He brought it to Phoenix, Arizona
where he sold the "crystal"

611
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:12,034
Catrin and I will cook
and we'll send you the rocks

612
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:17,665
Just keep working at it, the
gringos will keep smoking it

613
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,921
That's the song. Put it on the
list.

614
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:36,767
You have to write down a few songs
so we can record them in L.A.

615
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:41,689
Anything I write in my garage
in L.A. is just bullshit.

616
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:45,484
You have to experience the real
thing to write about it.

617
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:14,555
I didn't hit a single one!

618
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:28,694
Arriba Culiacén, Sinaloa!

619
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,490
What a surprise to find you on
my ranch

620
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,534
He'd been waiting for me for a
while

621
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:39,246
Because I have so many hitmen

622
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:43,000
They offered me so much money

623
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:46,504
I don't care what you say

624
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:50,257
They paid me to kill him.

625
01:22:56,722 --> 01:23:01,727
Right now, we're gonna play for
this guy.

626
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:06,107
And he's going to pay us cash.
He wants us to go now.

627
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,359
Here? In here?

628
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:09,986
No, we're going to his place.

629
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:11,320
Okay fine.

630
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:15,700
He's the son of "The Rooster of
Sinaloa."

631
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,285
"The Rooster of Sinaloa"? Okay.

632
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:21,914
The private party's on. Let's
go.

633
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,714
I've got some "cuchita blanca."

634
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:32,133
Four little grams of it.

635
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,095
Can I try some tomorrow?

636
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:38,973
Yes of course. I'll give you
some to try.

637
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,144
How is life here?

638
01:23:43,436 --> 01:23:44,812
It's the best, my friend.

639
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:48,816
It's the very best.

640
01:23:50,026 --> 01:23:52,987
If you have money, you do
whatever you want.

641
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:55,865
Shoot guns...

642
01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:58,534
smoke marijuana...

643
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,203
...in front of the poli- oops,
I didn't say anything.

644
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,417
Sometimes we shoot paintballs
at the transit cops.

645
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,588
Yeah we start shooting "boom
boom boom"

646
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:14,341
and they all go, "Ahhhh!"

647
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:19,930
They get really scared.

648
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:27,688
Money and happiness.
They're the same thing.

649
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:32,109
First you get the power,
then you get the money

650
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,070
then you get the bitches.

651
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,197
...In other words.

652
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,870
I bring a bag full of ammo

653
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,290
of pure AK-47 and .45

654
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:50,044
Don't presume to be brave

655
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:56,050
I have enough, thank God.

656
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,553
At the federales' checkpoint

657
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:03,474
They only say to me, "Pass
through, sir"

658
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:07,394
Don't ask where I came from

659
01:25:07,812 --> 01:25:11,232
Much less where I'm going

660
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:15,945
I am a Sinaloense and very true

661
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:19,573
I have enemies, what can I do?

662
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:22,618
I will never forgive traitors

663
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:26,122
And if I fight, I won't lose.

664
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:29,959
I never get scared

665
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:33,087
When provoked, I respond

666
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:47,434
It was night and all of a
sudden

667
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:50,563
we started to hear a very loud
engine rumble.

668
01:25:50,855 --> 01:25:54,316
And Richi thinks they're
policemen.

669
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,444
They pass near our car

670
01:25:57,862 --> 01:25:59,989
and someone in the first truck
says:

671
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,449
"What's up faggots?"

672
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:06,036
And Richi turns around and
tells them:

673
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:08,247
"Go ahead, go ahead!"

674
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:11,000
Eight trucks pass by.

675
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,378
Really big trucks with masked
men inside.

676
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:17,256
That's when I said,
"These aren't policemen!"

677
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:20,342
Suddenly we were in the
eye of the hurricane.

678
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:22,678
Like that.

679
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,139
And the guy in the passenger
seat got out.

680
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:26,807
The guy who said "what's up
faggots?"

681
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:29,310
Yes, the guy who said "what's
up faggots."

682
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:31,896
He was an elegant man.

683
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:35,524
With a trench coat nearly
touching the floor but elegant!

684
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,527
Classy shoes, nice pants and
shirt.

685
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,405
Skinny and with white hair.

686
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:44,158
You would think he was a
lawyer.

687
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:47,912
He comes down holding an AK-47.

688
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:51,957
He starts to tell us, Coco
first

689
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,877
with an AK-47 pointed at his
stomach

690
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:57,504
"Don't you know who we are?"

691
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,632
"The truth is I don't."

692
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:03,302
When they realized we weren't
doing anything

693
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:05,512
they started to leave.

694
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,349
All the vans took off.

695
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:12,645
The first thing Richi does is
get the radio

696
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:15,147
and call 23 (Emergency Help).

697
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:17,316
Nothing.

698
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:22,905
The next day Internal Affairs
called us in.

699
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:25,407
"Do you remember the trucks?"

700
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,409
I remembered that they were
luxury trucks.

701
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:30,079
"Did you see the plates?"

702
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:35,084
I saw them. I saw. But no, I
didn't see.

703
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,879
I didn't see anything.

704
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,759
I'm supposed to risk my life
and my family's life?

705
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:46,428
How much more do we have to
deal with?

706
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:57,940
Will it change?

707
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,400
Will this change?

708
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,489
God willing.

709
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:14,039
One month after listening to
our conversation

710
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:18,335
My friend Isaac Jesus Orona was
murdered.

711
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,718
He was ambushed near his home

712
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:31,724
becoming the fourth investigator
in our unit to be assassinated.

713
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:56,332
We're with you.

714
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:58,917
In this line of work we're like
a second family.

715
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:02,338
What happens to one of us
happens to all of us.

716
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,007
That's how Isaac's death
affects us.

717
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:09,386
We already miss you
tremendously, Isaac.

718
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:14,558
Rest in peace, number
twenty-one.

719
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:18,520
- Bravo three
- Present

720
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:20,731
- Bravo nine
- Present

721
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,609
- Bravo thirteen
- Present

722
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:32,076
- Bravo twenty-one!
- Present!

723
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:13,784
I'm suffering the loss of a son.
That's two of my children they've killed.

724
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:22,501
The first was named David Saez. And the delinquents took
him from me in the same way: with a bullet to the head.

725
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:27,673
What's going to happen to the
future of our city?

726
01:30:28,257 --> 01:30:31,677
And not just this city, but all
of Mexico?

727
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:35,848
Will our society be destroyed?

728
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:48,235
And those who work for the
government...

729
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,113
They are all afraid.

730
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:59,371
If they quit, wherever they go,
that fear will hound them.

731
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:03,625
But I'd tell them not to
resign.

732
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,379
I'm afraid. We are all afraid.

733
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:12,050
But we can't always live in
fear.

734
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:29,026
All the big dogs end up here.

735
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:32,196
All the folks from Culiacén.

736
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,950
Alvarado, Ruben Cabada...

737
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:39,119
All the big dogs.

738
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:47,878
Since birth, I've wanted to be
like them...

739
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:51,715
I would love to be like Pedro
Aviles or Sefior de los Cielos.

740
01:31:52,216 --> 01:31:55,636
But of every thousand fuckers,
only one gets there.

741
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:58,305
Maybe not even one!

742
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:18,367
There are people here who wanted to be
buried along with their pickup trucks.

743
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:24,915
There are other tombs with
bulletproof glass.

744
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:28,418
Bulletproof. Just because they
wanted it.

745
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,631
They do it because they can.

746
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:36,760
Here's how it should go.

747
01:32:37,553 --> 01:32:41,431
You know where they dropped the
head and the legs?

748
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:43,976
I want you to say, "Here."

749
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:46,895
Here they left the head, here
they left the legs

750
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:49,606
and here they left the
mustache... got it?

751
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:57,781
Last year, like my boss just
said...

752
01:32:57,781 --> 01:33:01,368
they found the head and body of
a person, separated.

753
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:07,249
They say it was a gift. A small
gift for the dead.

754
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:13,130
Over there you'll find the new
rich.

755
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:15,424
The new narcos.

756
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:25,392
So this section is all new?

757
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:27,853
Three years ago, none of this
existed.

758
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:31,857
And now? it's a city.

759
01:33:36,153 --> 01:33:39,740
That whole area there will
keep expanding and expanding.

760
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:43,994
Next time you come, this will
all be packed.

761
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:41,093
I like the "bad life."

762
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,367
Look.

763
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:52,622
You see the person over there?

764
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:56,251
That person was killed.

765
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,215
You see the police?

766
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:07,053
They will take the bodies and
then leave.

767
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:16,813
I tell them the truth.

768
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:21,193
This is the reality they're
living.

769
01:36:21,193 --> 01:36:23,862
We can't deny reality.

770
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:46,092
I drive through the streets
and see people without hope.

771
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:52,474
They hear the sirens
and see us as angels of death.

772
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,521
I see the streets full of evil

773
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:01,900
and the good people hiding out
of fear.

774
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:07,030
The youth have lost their
values

775
01:37:07,364 --> 01:37:10,325
and now idolize the devil.

776
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:19,876
I do my job as professionally
and scientifically as I can

777
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:23,964
but without involving my
feelings.

778
01:37:25,423 --> 01:37:27,133
What are my options?

779
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:29,678
Weep?

780
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:31,429
Bear it?

781
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:36,518
I have to continue my work.

782
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:47,737
It smells here.

783
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:49,447
It smells awful.

784
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:51,283
It smells of blood.

785
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:53,535
It smells of death.

786
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:56,955
And fifty meters from here,

787
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,541
on the other side of the
border,

788
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:02,669
nobody wants to know what
happens

789
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:05,547
and they shut their eyes.

790
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,471
I miss the Juérez where I grew
up.

791
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:15,974
Where I played.

792
01:38:16,308 --> 01:38:18,560
Will it return again?

793
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:21,688
What is the limit?

794
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:23,565
Why go on?

795
01:38:25,692 --> 01:38:28,069
But at the same time, here I
am.

796
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:30,697
In my beloved Juérez.
