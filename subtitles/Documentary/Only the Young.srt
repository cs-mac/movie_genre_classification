Everything that goes
into your life never comes out.

2
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:23,468
- Just like me.
- It's like a bad stain.

3
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:24,869
Yeah.

4
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,466
And no tide can get rid of it.

5
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:32,646
I got involved in being your friend...

6
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:37,080
and now I'm stuck in your black hole, and
you couldn't get rid of me if you tried.

Children are the gods of this city.

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,564
Yeah, and there's still nothing to do here.

19
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:31,264
- We want to put a half-pipe in this place,
- Yeah.

20
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:35,469
so we can skate just somewhere
that no one knows about.

21
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,376
All I need is a generator to get some
electricity going...

22
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,414
and we'll have skating...

23
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,540
um, we'll have a live band...

24
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:46,212
and generally we'll pretty much do
whatever the hell we want out here.

25
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:49,289
There's no one to stop us.

26
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:52,048
That's the way I look at it.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,460
Who's gonna stop me?

28
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:58,688
Got all of our cups,
salt, pepper shakers.

29
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:01,200
Cologne, perfume.

30
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:04,261
Um, mugs, dishes.

31
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:06,533
Uh, cans.

32
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:09,667
All organized.
I think it looks pretty nice.

33
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,352
My parents don't really care
as much as Garrison's parents.

34
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,856
They keep telling me every time,
"You know it's trespassing" and...

35
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:24,858
- That's what my parents told me.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:27,827
Like, Garrison's parents
don't want him to come anymore.

37
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:30,090
My parents generally just don't care.

38
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,802
Oh, no, dude.

39
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,939
You suck.

40
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,883
You're gonna have to ride the warped deck.

41
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:55,986
He paid for this board
with tacos yesterday.

42
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:58,287
So he brought us some chipotle tacos...

43
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:02,021
- six of them-to feed everybody at the shop.
- I brought seven.

44
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:05,793
Begging, "Shannon, will you please
give me a board for tacos?"

45
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:09,997
And if you've never had a chipotle taco,
you know that's a pretty good trade.

46
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,643
Well, I personally think
he's kind of like my mentor.

47
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:20,374
I mean, I don't have anyone
that I, like, hang out with so much.

48
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,541
So-That is way older than me.

49
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:25,677
- He's kind of old.
- Yeah, I'm kind of-kind of ancient.

50
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:28,449
He's kind of crusty.

51
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,855
You're a curmudgeon.

52
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:38,893
I just qualified for the Volcom competition.
That's pretty cool.

53
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:45,428
So I guess I get to go to Arizona and...

54
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:50,543
I guess we're gonna go on a road trip,
take Garrison.

55
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,983
There's a cash prize of, like, $25,000.

56
00:03:57,051 --> 00:04:00,111
I think he's gonna probably put it
towards school.

57
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:03,554
Like trade school
to be a mechanic or something.

58
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:06,957
'Cause I know his parents don't really
have enough right now...

59
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:09,929
um, to pay for school, so...

60
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:12,329
just hoping he does all right.

61
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,031
I thought I'd kind of do something drastic
and, like, skate without shoes or something.

62
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:22,132
That'd be cool.

63
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,308
That would be pretty cool.

64
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,110
First person to skate a contest
without shoes.

65
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:32,175
Yeah, I think people do it,
but not in a contest.

66
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:34,619
Yeah. Who do you know
have done that?

67
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:37,414
I never heard of anyone doing that.

68
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:43,497
Just-Oh!

69
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:59,043
I don't know. This place used to
be, like, a mini golf course...

70
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:03,413
and then I guess they couldn't afford
to have it here.

71
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:06,112
'Cause it was, like, super fancy,
and you ate steak here.

72
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:10,783
And, um, it was just too fancy
for Santa Clarita.

73
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,383
I guess this used to be
a waterfall, I think.

74
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:16,327
But now it's just a fall.

75
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:20,525
I mean, I wouldn't take
any girl anywhere...

76
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,660
that isn't this cool.

77
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:25,805
- I mean-
- And dirty.

78
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:33,673
Well, one time I took him to dinner,
and he's never taken me anywhere.

79
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:39,679
Yeah, we had a nice
sit-down dinner at Sisley-on me.

80
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:46,022
Well, you earn money, and you never spend
any of it on anything, except for you.

81
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,118
Well, I put it in the bank.

82
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:52,265
- What about me?
- I'm trying to get a car.

83
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,825
- Oh, yeah.
- And then after I get a car, we can go places.

84
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:00,006
" Feel the vellum."

85
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:03,737
" Feel all of the dye."

86
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:09,647
" Feels like there's no plan,
but it's better to try."

87
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:13,118
" When I'm in that funnel."

88
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:16,156
" I feel so tired."

89
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:18,817
" Hold on to summer."

90
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:22,954
" Now just to get by."

91
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:35,675
" I'll always remember that."

92
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,405
" Summer light."

93
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,351
" I wonder if I am remembering right ."

94
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:52,381
They always say you can take the girl
out of the honky-tonk...

95
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,054
but you can't take the honky-tonk
out of the girl.

96
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,465
I don't believe that.

97
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:08,441
My mom's dead, my dad's in prison...

98
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,875
and...

99
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:15,473
my parents are... awesome.

100
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:17,039
They're my grandparents.

101
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:27,025
Well, we got Skye when she was just
two or three days old.

102
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:30,860
Uh, her mother...

103
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:36,733
She was born in the, uh,
Henry Mayo Hospital in Newhall.

104
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:41,241
And her mother, uh, lost custody
in the first couple of days...

105
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:44,641
uh, so she came to live with us.

106
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,442
We had a lot of good times.

107
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:52,582
And, uh, get a good enough education
where you can get a good job...

108
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:56,145
that you can support me
when I get a little older.

109
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:00,152
Aw, Pappa.

110
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:04,289
Which won't be too much longer now.

111
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:07,266
That's not true.
You're not old.

112
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,304
- You're not old.
- Well, uh, years maybe...

113
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:16,969
but in mentally and physically
I still feel pretty good.

114
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:31,457
Me and Kevin have just been trying to
get some extra cash for Arizona...

115
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:35,120
um, just doing some random little jobs.

116
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:07,588
You guys are doing a great job.
Really looks good.

117
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:09,457
Thank you.

118
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,365
My name's Ron, and I'm the next-door neighbor
to this house where the pool's cleaned.

119
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:15,925
And, uh...

120
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:19,495
there was a party here,
and, uh, one of the kids...

121
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:23,407
was on the roof of the add-on here...

122
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,843
and, uh, he was gonna jump in the pool...

123
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,939
and the pool was so black and dirty...

124
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:32,884
that, uh, you couldn't tell if there was
water in it, but there was no water in it...

125
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:36,980
and one of the kids warned him,
"There's no water in that pool."

126
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:40,754
And the kid goes, "Oh, wow," you know.

127
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,720
It was kind of ridiculous.

128
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:48,159
Um, what I think is funny is, uh...

129
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:52,537
I think what that guy was talking about,
that story...

130
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:56,303
was actually me on the roof.

131
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:58,911
We're, like, looking in the pool.

132
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:04,950
I'm all like, "Dude, I
wanna go in that pool."

133
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,954
He's like, "But it's empty, dude."

134
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:11,750
So I think that guy
was talking about us on the roof.

135
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:15,056
- Dude, I found a worm.
- A worm.

136
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,858
It's alive.

137
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,752
I'll give you a dollar
if you walk around the edge.

138
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,151
- That edge?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:50,821
I'll walk around this edge.

140
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:54,026
Like around the rim of it.

141
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:56,729
There's nowhere to walk. The water...

142
00:10:56,804 --> 00:11:00,205
- Yeah, there is.
- Has monsters in it, obviously.

143
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:02,742
- Give me a dollar if I did it?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,005
But you'll probably die.

145
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,437
Kind of hurts.

146
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:13,212
Wait. Can I give you two dollars
if I shoot you while you're doing it?

147
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:18,615
- Uh, give me 10.
- No. I don't have 10 bucks.

148
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,182
Okay, five.

149
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:25,589
Yeah, I don't think that you can, like,
wait on your feelings to change.

150
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:30,797
Like, if you... want to
like a chick, you know...

151
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,133
it sucks.

152
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:34,071
"I want to try to like a chick?"

153
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:38,305
Well, 'cause it's like you like 'em,
but you don't really like 'em...

154
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,042
and you're like, "Well, I'll
just give it a little time and...

155
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:45,517
maybe I'll start to really like her,
and things will work out great."

156
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:47,747
And it never happens.

157
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:55,858
- Oh, yeah. Garrison.
- Hi.

158
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,194
Before you break up with Skye,
give her her belt back.

159
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,234
Okay.

160
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,435
So, okay, yeah, there's this guy driving
through the busy parking lot at the mall...

161
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,241
and there's no parking spots.

162
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:16,771
So he starts praying. He's all, "God,
God, please let me have a parking spot."

163
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,045
Right after he did that,
there was this one right up front.

164
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,781
He pulled in, he goes,
"Oh, never mind, God. I found one."

165
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:27,984
So we're gonna go down to the Moorpark Skate
Park with the Ignition Skate Ministry.

166
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:30,530
Ignition Skate Ministry.

167
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:34,590
And, uh, we're gonna feed a bunch of kids
hot dogs and do raffles...

168
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:38,968
and then we're gonna preach the word
a little bit and just have fun.

169
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,339
Hello, everybody at the skate park. Hey. We
got about 130 tacos over here from Del Taco.

170
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,141
They're free. We got bags of chips.
Doritos, Lay's chips...

171
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:49,580
and free waters for
everyone here at the park.

172
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,140
Ah, me too!

173
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:56,750
- Do you have to be a Christian?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:59,156
You know, pretty much
what we do is we come out here...

175
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:02,059
to kind of show the love of Jesus Christ
through skateboarding.

176
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,427
I know that's kind of weird-sounding,
'cause a lot of skateboarders...

177
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:07,467
are looked at as punks
and outcasts and whatnot...

178
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:09,468
and we kind of gladly accept that image.

179
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,232
You know, we kind of like that.
So when you really want to be different...

180
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,570
is you go ahead and you skate for Christ...

181
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:16,905
and not yourself
and not other people around you.

182
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:20,242
But I want to talk to you about this big word
out here real quick called "influence."

183
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:22,441
- Have you ever heard of that word before?
- Tacos.

184
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,746
You guys in high school,
junior high school?

185
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:27,912
You ever heard a parent say,
"Oh, yeah. My son Billy...

186
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:32,391
he was such a good student, and then he
started hanging out with the wrong crowd...

187
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,188
"and then his grades went down."

188
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:38,027
You ever heard that before?
It's not a too uncommon thing, right?

189
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:40,498
Any of you guys ever been
that bad influence?

190
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,535
- Yes, sir.
- I know I have.

191
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,333
I've been both.
I've been the bad and the good influence.

192
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:47,635
And if anything that I just
talked to you about, you know...

193
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,303
if it's kind of, you know,
stewing in your brain a little bit...

194
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:54,040
feel free to come and talk to me
more in depth about it.

195
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,674
Talk to my buddy Rich here,
Garrison, Kevin.

196
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,311
These guys will all listen to you. Watch these two guys.
When they skate, they rip.

197
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:05,590
And, uh-And I just want to say
thank you guys again for listening to me.

198
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,354
Please enjoy these tacos.

199
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,588
- Uh, take two if you want.

200
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,654
- Thank you.
- You guys are awesome. Thank you for listening.

201
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,256
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

202
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,322
You're welcome.

203
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,907
Uh, I broke up with my girlfriend.

204
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,907
I kind of figured it'd be better for me
and my girlfriend to just be friends.

205
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,814
So that way, like... since I kind
of figured we'd break up anyway.

206
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:36,516
You technically didn't break up.
Like, it wasn't official either.

207
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:38,548
Yeah, it was.

208
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:43,485
Well, you, like, told her
that you were...

209
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:47,591
that you needed to talk to her, and then
she assumed it, and then told everyone.

210
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,935
She gets pretty upset,
and she keeps it for a long time.

211
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,535
You just kind of have to wait it out.

212
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:04,107
It's like a storm. You can't stop the storm.
You just have to wait it out.

213
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:06,152
Hide in the basement.

214
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,211
Hide in the basement.

215
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:11,883
You either get it right,
or you don't get it at all.

216
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,793
And if you don't get it at all,
you don't make it worse.

217
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:30,468
"I gave you true love."

218
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,944
"I thought there was no doubt at all."

219
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,880
"Still you went away."

220
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:38,417
"With not a word to say."

221
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,976
"Argue this tomorrow."

222
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:43,488
"Finding me in sorrow."

223
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:49,223
"What would I do
in a world without you?"

224
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:54,757
"Please bring your love back to me
Yeah, baby"

225
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:59,670
"'Cause when you left,
you took a part of me, yeah."

226
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,370
"My need is growing stronger."

227
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,279
"And the nights are growing longer."

228
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:09,645
What's Halloween on?

229
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:14,150
Wait, what-
Do you know what you're gonna be?

230
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,747
We should be Gandalf.

231
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,825
Both of us.

232
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:25,721
- There's his magic staff of doom.
- Where?

233
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,165
And he's carrying-
he's carrying a murse.

234
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,396
If you look carefully right there,
that's a murse.

235
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,439
Yeah. It is.

236
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:38,034
I don't think I have anything
that we could wear to be Gandalf though.

237
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,278
Is this Gandalf?

238
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:46,378
I think we need a robe.

239
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:48,614
Or a beard.

240
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,723
We should go look for stuff for Gandalf.

241
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,760
All right. Let's go.

242
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,522
I'll have to tell my mom.

243
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:09,100
- "Do the time warp again."
- "Do the time warp again."

244
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:13,706
Found the beard.

245
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:29,025
So, yeah, I just recently
broke up with Skye.

246
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:33,590
Living it out now and thinking about it,
it might not have been the best move.

247
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:38,661
Just 'cause, like, when I hang out with
her, I'm, like, the happiest person ever.

248
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:42,508
She's awesome, and...

249
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:44,737
Like, I don't know. Like...

250
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:48,110
I just kind of, like,
miss what was going on before.

251
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,411
You know, after I, like, cut it off.

252
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:52,645
So I don't know.

253
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:56,587
Like, I guess I'm starting to have a little
bit of feelings for her again, but...

254
00:17:57,157 --> 00:18:00,354
I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna
take it as it goes right now and...

255
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,861
I guess see what happens.

256
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,893
- Has Kevin taken you to the house yet?
- No.

257
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:11,028
I think that you guys need to, like,
not leave food there and stuff.

258
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,504
- Well-
- Considering there's rats, right?

259
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:16,701
We have food in the pantry,
and it's locked.

260
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:19,610
Right, but rats are a lot smarter
than you guys.

261
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,757
How much death
do you think this hat will cause me?

262
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:37,061
A lot?

263
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:42,395
Oh, my gosh! Kevin!

264
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:45,233
- This is so cool!
- Yep.

265
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:48,641
This is a big drop.

266
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:59,013
Got another board I can use?

267
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:00,575
No!

268
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,282
- My turn.
- Again?

269
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,392
- Ow!
- Stupid!

270
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:11,223
I'm gonna land it first.

271
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:12,822
Screw you.

272
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,931
I wanted to land it first.
That's why I went for it first.

273
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,972
- Yeah, what's up with that?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:29,005
Why do you wanna know?

275
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:35,320
We used a razor to make deep incisions
into my arm.

276
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:39,051
- Come on, dude.
- I can't believe you, like, didn't notice this.

277
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,990
This has been there for, like, a week.

278
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:42,892
You know that.

279
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,555
Yeah, I don't know.
Sorry about that.

280
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:48,464
It's been there for, like, a week.

281
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:53,465
I don't know.
I just don't want him to get, like...

282
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,735
become a friggin' creep.

283
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,272
I'm not already?

284
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,640
Well, you know...

285
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:03,945
I don't want your life
to get too screwed up.

286
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:09,952
- I know you guys love me. Will you guys-
- Well, then cut it out, man.

287
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:11,684
Help me.

288
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:13,317
Whoop.

289
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,029
It's like...

290
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,665
kind of freaking us out.

291
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,100
I've done this before.
Why are you freaked out now?

292
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:25,160
'Cause you're doing it again.

293
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,632
I mean...

294
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:37,609
Everyone thinks I'm a freak.

295
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,743
- Not really.
- Yeah.

296
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:42,344
No one thinks you're a freak, Kevin.

297
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,287
- This is awkward.
- We just love you...

298
00:20:44,357 --> 00:20:48,088
This is more awkward
than after I kissed you.

299
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,096
Yeah, I'm sorry.

300
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:01,502
I don't really do things
to make people upset.

301
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:20,518
Skye-she kind of got
wasted a little...

302
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:25,190
and ended up kissing Kevin kind of.

303
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:29,167
Just-Not because she likes him, but...

304
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:32,932
uh, just out of being wasted.

305
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:38,603
And Kevin kind of likes her,
but... I don't know.

306
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:43,912
Kind of gonna make tonight a little weird
if we all hang out again.

307
00:21:43,984 --> 00:21:46,976
So I'm not really sure
what I'm gonna do tonight...

308
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:51,717
but hopefully I have someone
to hang out with.

309
00:21:58,298 --> 00:22:00,698
Uh, hey, Garrison.

310
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:07,536
Uh, I was just calling to say
that I'm sorry for, uh...

311
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:11,065
what happened with me and Skye.

312
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:13,009
Uh...

313
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,537
Yeah, I don't know how, like,
you feel about it and all...

314
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:20,814
but I just wanted to let you know
that I'm really sorry...

315
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,117
uh, about what happened and all.

316
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,924
So...

317
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:29,359
uh, I mean...

318
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:35,596
I want-I really want you to come
to Arizona with me and all.

319
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:39,065
So, yeah.

320
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:44,637
So if you could call me back,
that would be cool.

321
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:46,810
All right.

322
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,142
Bye.

323
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:19,739
Like, me and Kevin have been friends
since, like, 13 years old...

324
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:23,044
and, you know,
we never really had any issues.

325
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:28,179
And-I don't know. I wouldn't want to say
that things changed too drastically...

326
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:32,714
but just after that,
things are a little different.

327
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:51,767
You shall not pass!

328
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:03,884
What's this?

329
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:05,117
Reese's.

330
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:47,693
If there's any chance that I would
ever get back together with Garrison?

331
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:51,365
Yeah, I would.
I don't think he would.

332
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:56,568
And if I ever got back together
with Garrison-I don't know...

333
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:59,441
I'd be really happy about it.

334
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:01,377
He never kissed me...

335
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:04,439
which I think is what made it so special...

336
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:07,452
because he was able to show me...

337
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,617
that I was important to him
without any of that.

338
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:14,819
And I've been through
enough kisses to know...

339
00:25:14,894 --> 00:25:18,887
that they're all just a waste of time
unless there's something behind it.

340
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:29,667
"I can laugh."

341
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:31,539
"I can smile."

342
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:35,206
"Hold my head way up high."

343
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:37,044
"Baby, it's all."

344
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,084
"It's all because of you"

345
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:40,847
- "All"
- "It's all because of you"

346
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,354
- "Because of you"
- "All because of you"

347
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:45,152
- "Yeah"
- "All because of me".

348
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:49,218
"I've got a new song I can sing."

349
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:53,425
"Seemed like my whole world
had been changed"

350
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:56,297
- "Baby, it's all"
- "It's all because of you"

351
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:57,893
- "All"
- "It's all because of you"

352
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:00,906
- "Because of you"
- "All because of you"

353
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:03,636
- "Yeah"
- "All because of me".

354
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,339
"Lonely days, lonely nights."

355
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:12,544
"They are gone, gone, gone, yeah."

356
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:16,180
"Sad songs, bad times."

357
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:19,692
"They are all in my past."

358
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,750
"Oh."

359
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:38,700
"Oh."

360
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:42,373
"Lonely days, lonely nights."

361
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:45,975
"They are gone, gone, gone."

362
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:50,984
"Sad songs, bad times."

363
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:54,754
"They are all in my past ."

364
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:57,591
Imagine yourself visiting here...

365
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,132
over seven centuries ago...

366
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:04,568
and receiving an invitation
into this cliff-dwelling home.

367
00:27:04,637 --> 00:27:08,767
What you would have seen might well have
been something like this cutaway model...

368
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,934
of Montezuma Castle...

369
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,605
a village of people who experienced
wants and needs...

370
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:16,842
anxieties and fears...

371
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,474
joys and sorrows...

372
00:27:18,551 --> 00:27:21,987
just as you and I today.

373
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,521
Well, I was on Facebook, and...

374
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:32,928
I got a friend request from my mom.

375
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:37,225
- She doesn't look anything like me.
- No.

376
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:39,237
I know.

377
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,330
I declined her friend request.

378
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:43,705
I think that after, like...

379
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:46,836
16 years-16 and a half years...

380
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:49,313
Facebook isn't the right way
to contact someone.

381
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:54,513
Yeah. Exactly. If they wanted
any sort of communication with you...

382
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:59,183
I think they would have done it,
or should have done it in a different way.

383
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:02,750
I don't know what she was trying
to accomplish by adding you on Facebook.

384
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:04,387
- On Facebook!
- Yeah.

385
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:08,093
I mean, I don't even-
Like, we're the computer...

386
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,568
Facebook, Myspace, YouTube generation.

387
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:15,573
We grew up with it, and we're still
not comfortable with things like that.

388
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:18,041
- Yeah.
- Like...

389
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:22,639
honestly, to me, no matter
how much technology progresses...

390
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:27,482
it's still not going to be okay
to do personal things impersonally.

391
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:39,256
I spent, um, the larger portion of my life
believing my mom was dead.

392
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:42,199
Finding out she's alive and-and...

393
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:45,237
you know, I have a half-sister,
and I have a half-brother...

394
00:28:45,304 --> 00:28:47,898
and I'm an aunt and, like...

395
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:51,740
It's-You know, it kind of blew my mind.

396
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:53,801
Um...

397
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:57,714
But it's not the right time right now.

398
00:28:57,784 --> 00:29:01,914
I-You know, with my mom,
with my sister.

399
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:03,979
I just had to put it on the back burner...

400
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:06,719
and just kind of say no for now.

401
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:09,785
It's just-It's just a bad time.

402
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:12,194
It's just I don't...

403
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:14,730
I don't think...

404
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:20,364
her, um, approach was okay.

405
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,771
I just...

406
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:24,469
I don't think either one of us
is healthy enough right now.

407
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:28,241
You know, she has an ongoing
heroin addiction...

408
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:30,839
that's extremely prevalent in her life.

409
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,350
She...

410
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:36,115
Uh, she can't be a mom.
She can't even be a friend.

411
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:39,283
And she doesn't owe it to me
to be my mom.

412
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:40,757
She just...

413
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:45,560
I guess the reason I'm upset is because
she owes it to me to be a decent person...

414
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:47,861
a decent human being,
and she's never done that.

415
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:50,164
So, I don't know.

416
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,294
I just...

417
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:53,995
I'll live without her.

418
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,129
Geez, dude.

419
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,503
I win.

420
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,672
- Morning.
- Good morning.

421
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:34,178
You're terrible.

422
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,910
I'm not nervous.

423
00:30:42,822 --> 00:30:44,915
Do you have stage fright?

424
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:47,619
- I do not have stage fright.
- Are you nervous?

425
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:50,752
Man, I'm not even going anywhere
near a stage.

426
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:54,324
Okay.

427
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,766
...left-hand side.

428
00:30:56,836 --> 00:31:00,863
$25,000 up for grabs today, in addition
to the obscene amount of prizes.

429
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,341
And we have the best
Europe has to offer as well.

430
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,847
They're here and ready to throw down
against their North American counterparts.

431
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,542
I am excited.

432
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:12,675
If you're not having fun
yet, just try harder.

433
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:14,845
Come get your sign-up on.

434
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:20,916
Five, four, three, two, one!

435
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:23,052
Bang, bang, bang!
Let's get it done.

436
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:29,068
Coming from Santa Clarita, California,
number 103, Kevin Conway.

437
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:33,535
See, the first trick,
he landed it, and he broke the board.

438
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,612
So, unfortunately,
Kevin didn't place in the competition.

439
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:19,344
Um, and he didn't win the money...

440
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:22,353
but, you know,
I don't want to sound too cheesy...

441
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:25,652
but I'm really proud of him
just for getting there...

442
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,886
and competing in such a big event.

443
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:53,417
Yeah, this girl Kristen's been, like,
helping me with math and stuff.

444
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:55,579
She's, like, a brainiac.

445
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:59,052
Let me read. No, it was-
I didn't see what it was.

446
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,423
Yeah. Point. So I can catch up.

447
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:04,520
Okay, so...

448
00:33:04,597 --> 00:33:06,360
Worst.

449
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:08,491
No, minus 81.

450
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:17,505
Mmm. I don't know. I guess it's safe to say
I kind of have, like, a crush on her.

451
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:21,780
Garrison doesn't know
what he wants. I mean, you know...

452
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:24,213
she's fun, she's crazy.

453
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:27,514
She likes different things,
and it's funny, 'cause I never...

454
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:30,350
I mean,
Garrison never really liked those things.

455
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:35,622
He was always, you know,
a conservative who loved punk rock music...

456
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:42,828
but I guess opposites attract, 'cause she's,
like, a hip-hop dancing, crazy liberal...

457
00:33:42,902 --> 00:33:45,029
with hair this short, so...

458
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:18,728
Sweat off the brow.

459
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:20,601
Put your hands here and go over.

460
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:23,801
Or do your little thing
that you liked doing. Oh!

461
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:28,675
And then you're just gonna go
boom, boom.

462
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:31,478
It's gonna go right, left, right.

463
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,574
Yeah.

464
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:36,178
I don't know. I don't want to
go out with someone that's just like me.

465
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:40,851
I wouldn't ever change,
like, for the better.

466
00:34:41,494 --> 00:34:44,395
I don't know. It's like I want to see
what else is out there...

467
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:46,897
rather than just people
that are just like me.

468
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:54,529
Garrison, have you ever taken me
to a place this nice?

469
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:58,742
- I took you here now.
- I took you here.

470
00:35:00,346 --> 00:35:02,041
It was my idea.

471
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:05,306
- I took you here.
- No.

472
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:07,750
- Yes!
- I-Uh...

473
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,256
Unless you just break into my neighbors'
backyards when I'm not around...

474
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,257
I took you here.

475
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:16,260
Go ahead.
Tell 'em all about it.

476
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:19,161
...Tell 'em about your escapades.

477
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:22,723
With Kristen. On the balcony.
Go ahead. I don't care.

478
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:26,169
She doesn't wanna go over there
because I've already been there.

479
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:28,229
With Kristen.

480
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:31,308
This is my neighborhood.

481
00:35:32,711 --> 00:35:35,509
And I said, "Okay, go
ahead and show her."

482
00:35:35,581 --> 00:35:39,017
But I didn't even know that was there.
And you went without me.

483
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:40,984
- Well, do you want to go now?
- No.

484
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:43,988
- Come on.
- No. I don't wanna go.

485
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,552
Let go of me!

486
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:50,686
Garrison sucks!

487
00:35:57,269 --> 00:35:58,930
Ow! Let go!

488
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,031
You're an idiot.

489
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:06,976
Garrison, are you and Kristen official yet?

490
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:09,446
Um, no. We're just friends.

491
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,506
And why is that?

492
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:15,587
I don't know. 'Cause I don't
wanna make it official.

493
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:20,057
We're just friends. We're gonna chill.

494
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,923
Then we'll see what happens, but...

495
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:24,587
Friendship first.

496
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:30,026
Oh, Santa Claus, Santa Claus and snow.

497
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:33,367
You'll be wet.
I'm glad I'm not a reindeer, that is true.

498
00:36:34,473 --> 00:36:37,840
- I wanna go pick out a Christmas tree.
- Okay. I don't care.

499
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,969
- Okay.
- We just gotta convince Mom.

500
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:42,411
- No, we don't.
- We just go get it.

501
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,210
Yeah.

502
00:36:44,283 --> 00:36:47,548
- Once it's done, it's done.
- Can't take it and put it back.

503
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,850
Mm-mmm.

504
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:54,723
Yeah, well, we just purchased
a house in Tennessee.

505
00:36:54,793 --> 00:37:00,254
Uh, after Kevin graduates-
So we're thinking maybe, uh...

506
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:03,631
when we move back to Tennessee,
that he'd, uh...

507
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:07,570
He'd be able to go to college
there in Tennessee.

508
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:12,065
Yeah. I'll most likely still
keep in contact with Garrison.

509
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:16,376
And-I can't see any difference...

510
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,439
why I couldn't keep in contact with him.

511
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:38,426
Oh!

512
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:44,306
Well, I guess Kev Bro's
parents bought, like...

513
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:46,742
some crazy mansion in Tennessee.

514
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:50,043
It's got, like, a creek, train tracks.

515
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:53,348
His parents are gonna move out there
towards the end of the year...

516
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:57,253
and I think Kevin might go with 'em
after he graduates.

517
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:58,813
He might go.

518
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:01,758
- You know, I'll-
I'll definitely be bummed when he goes...

519
00:38:01,827 --> 00:38:04,455
even if I go with him, 'cause I know
he's not gonna live here anymore.

520
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:10,127
And, you know, most-Almost all my teenage
years have been spent with this kid, so...

521
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,431
- You know, and there's this
kind of part about Kevin...

522
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,908
I'm not really sure what's going on.

523
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:24,541
But... you know, regardless, I love him.

524
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:38,424
I'm not happy with you today...

525
00:38:38,497 --> 00:38:41,159
Mr. Garrison.

526
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:44,430
Well, we were gonna have
black beans and rice for dinner, but...

527
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:48,303
Garrison had a date with Kristen,
so he ditched me.

528
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:52,435
- You better tell her I said, "I don't care."
- No!

529
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:54,706
- Tell her.
- Why?

530
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,841
Because I'm just gonna keep deleting
her Facebook wall posts.

531
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,317
- Why?
- I'm sick of her.

532
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:03,082
- Why?
- She's ruining my life.

533
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:05,282
Why? You have no good reason.

534
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,456
I just don't like her.

535
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:13,487
- She's short.
- That's the only reason I like her.

536
00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:16,125
No, I'm just kidding. That's just a joke.

537
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:19,061
It's not funny.

538
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:22,699
And... she's sassy,
and I don't like it.

539
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:27,878
What's Arnold Schwarzenegger's
favorite food?

540
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:29,743
What?

541
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:32,978
"Get to the chopper!"

542
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:40,492
So, what do you really like about Kristen?

543
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:45,352
Okay. She's attractive.

544
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:48,366
You're attracted to her
because she's attractive.

545
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:52,427
- Got it.
- No, I wasn't done, idiot. I have, like, five fingers.

546
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:18,123
All right. So... I just got my first car.

547
00:40:18,197 --> 00:40:21,633
Went and checked it out,
and it was perfect.

548
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,830
Some old guy owned it.
It's a 1990 Chevy Celebrity Wagon.

549
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:30,932
And it was in a garage its whole life.
It has 68,000 miles on it.

550
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:36,242
The inside's perfect. The outside's clean,
so I'm, like, beyond happy.

551
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:39,807
1,500 bucks.
Definitely worth saving up for.

552
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:49,118
So, I figured since I got a new car,
I'd go pick Kristen up...

553
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:52,493
and take her out to the lake.

554
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:54,725
Go hang out for a while.

555
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,995
I don't feel like a little kid anymore.

556
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:58,764
Now that I have, like, a car...

557
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:03,103
and, like, more of a job
doing skate lessons...

558
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:07,475
Now I think, you know,
I'm more ready for a relationship.

559
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:11,346
'Cause, like, I think, like,
past relationships I've had...

560
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:14,044
were kind of, like, less
exciting and stuff.

561
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,087
Just 'cause I didn't have a car.

562
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:19,386
If I wanted to hang out with them,
I had to, like, ride my bike there.

563
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:22,916
And if I got there, we had to stay
wherever we were basically...

564
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:24,656
unless we walked.

565
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,528
So now we can go anywhere.

566
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,124
I could drive us to the Bahamas.

567
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:43,006
What's Arnold Schwarzenegger's...

568
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:45,845
favorite hamburger?

569
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:49,046
"Get in the chopper!"
"Get to the chopper!"

570
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:52,022
Dumbest line ever.

571
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:05,196
So... I was thinking...

572
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,970
earlier that... I would ask you
if you would go on a date with me.

573
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:14,345
Yeah.

574
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:16,074
- Promise?
- Promise.

575
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:19,015
Yes.

576
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:23,821
- So really?
- Really.

577
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:39,766
- Valentine's Day.
- Wait, when's that?

578
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,036
When is that? I don't know. I'm not-Kristen
said I'm not allowed to do anything.

579
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:46,168
Said to keep-She said to keep it open...

580
00:42:46,245 --> 00:42:48,179
'cause she's doing something.

581
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:52,616
Or I don't know. She
said she can't tell me.

582
00:42:52,684 --> 00:42:55,517
But I shouldn't do anything that day.

583
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:58,078
Okay, so she's planning
to do something for you.

584
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:04,624
- Um, I don't know what I'll get her.

585
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:10,293
I just don't want it to be too cliché, like
a box of chocolates and, like, a flower.

586
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:14,463
'Cause I've done that, and
it's just not very cool.

587
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:16,700
I think it's pretty cool. I'd be flattered.

588
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:20,575
So is that what you want
for Valentine's from me?

589
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:23,706
- That'd be nice.
- Okay.

590
00:43:55,514 --> 00:43:57,209
I think that I will always...

591
00:43:57,282 --> 00:44:00,080
have some sort of feelings for Garrison.

592
00:44:00,786 --> 00:44:04,745
I think that that's sort
of, like, inevitable...

593
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:06,791
because he's my best friend...

594
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:09,326
and everything really happens for a reason.

595
00:44:10,595 --> 00:44:14,053
So-I don't know.
I think that I would rather...

596
00:44:14,132 --> 00:44:17,761
have him as a friend than not at all.

597
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:20,498
So...

598
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:23,336
Yeah. He's a good guy.

599
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:36,448
"Baby, I love you."

600
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:39,319
"Yes, I love you so much, baby."

601
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:42,554
"I really, really love you"

602
00:44:42,627 --> 00:44:45,892
- "Because I love you"
- "Oh-oh".

603
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:48,228
"Yes, I think a lot about you."

604
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,632
"Can't live my life without you."

605
00:44:50,702 --> 00:44:53,227
"A thousand times a day."

606
00:44:53,305 --> 00:44:55,068
"I'll be thinking of you."

607
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,734
"Oh, in a million ways."

608
00:44:57,809 --> 00:44:59,936
"That's how much I love ya."

609
00:45:00,012 --> 00:45:04,608
"Somehow I will repay you
for all the love."

610
00:45:04,683 --> 00:45:07,846
"Oh, you've given me"

611
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:09,784
- "Oh"
- "Baby".

612
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:13,689
"There's no one like you."

613
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,284
"There's no one quite like you."

614
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:18,659
"That's why I need you"

615
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,496
- "Need you"
- "Say you'll never go".

616
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:25,536
"Say you're never gonna leave me."

617
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:28,129
"If you do, I'll be so lonely."

618
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:30,174
"With you by my side."

619
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:32,608
"I know I can make it."

620
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:34,941
"Our love will survive."

621
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:36,913
"Nothing's gonna shake it."

622
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:39,576
"I get a glow inside."

623
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:41,812
"Knowing you love me."

624
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:44,754
"Just as I love you."

625
00:45:44,823 --> 00:45:46,450
"Whoa."

626
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:49,917
"Yeah ."

627
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:56,423
Like, recently we found out
that we lost our house.

628
00:45:56,501 --> 00:46:00,164
So, like-We have a few options...

629
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:03,901
but I guess Pappa and my dad
will probably end up moving to Tennessee...

630
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:07,206
and then, um...

631
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:09,110
Well...

632
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:11,149
Like, I'll figure out a place to be.

633
00:46:11,216 --> 00:46:14,014
I'll either move in with
my oma and my aunt.

634
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:18,318
Or, like, move in with
Garrison or something.

635
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:31,329
We met bowling.

636
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:34,338
Um, you know,
I had grease all over my hands.

637
00:46:34,406 --> 00:46:36,465
She had all the napkins.

638
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,600
So I said, "hey, Napkin Lady,
get me some napkins."

639
00:46:38,677 --> 00:46:40,508
And I said, "I don't work here."

640
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:44,276
And then I said, "You obviously look
the way you do because you work here."

641
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:48,308
And I said, "I'm wearing this uniform
because my great-grandma died in it."

642
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,916
Long story short, I didn't have greasy hands
at one point, and then... I found love.

643
00:46:54,993 --> 00:46:57,461
No, I love Skye because...

644
00:46:57,529 --> 00:46:59,793
- she makes me happy and-
- Good one.

645
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:02,129
She knows how to talk to me.

646
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,600
- Good one.
- And she does things for me all the time.

647
00:47:04,669 --> 00:47:10,733
- Keep going.
- And, um, I smile when I think of her.

648
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:14,176
And my stomach feels funny.

649
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,546
And... she does this a lot, and I like it.

650
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:23,179
And I could go on.
I have a book written about it.

651
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:24,779
What about Jesus?

652
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:27,450
Oh, and Skye loves Jesus, and I love Jesus.

653
00:47:27,526 --> 00:47:30,689
- Mmm.
- So together we both love Jesus.

654
00:48:30,288 --> 00:48:33,746
- You're not supposed to eat milky things.
- Probably not supposed to eat that at all.

655
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:36,658
- What if I get sick?
- Uh, then...

656
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:51,799
Did you make a wish at least?

657
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:55,972
No. I wish that this would
be out of my mouth.

658
00:48:57,649 --> 00:49:00,618
Did you hear that Kris
and Garrison broke up?

659
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:02,482
Like, 'cause I didn't know they broke up...

660
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:06,081
- until I checked Facebook after church, but-
- Yeah.

661
00:49:06,157 --> 00:49:09,320
When they, like, came
to church that night...

662
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,328
- they seemed-
- Perfectly fine?

663
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:13,330
Like they-Yeah. Like
they were dating still.

664
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:15,662
Anyways-So...

665
00:49:15,734 --> 00:49:20,330
then, like, a bunch of people
from church were just like...

666
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:24,341
like, "It would be beneficial
if you two broke up."

667
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:26,775
How is that beneficial though?

668
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:31,338
- I don't know. That's the way the church rolls.
- That's weird.

669
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:34,852
I know. They-They try and get anybody
to break up, if they can.

670
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:37,945
Destroy 'em.
It's what I did to my Barbies.

671
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:49,858
You know, she's kind of stepped away
from the church.

672
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:52,869
Me being a somebody
who kind of looks after Garrison...

673
00:49:52,937 --> 00:49:56,100
To me, I would want him
to be in a relationship with a girl...

674
00:49:56,174 --> 00:49:59,473
that loved the Lord first,
most importantly.

675
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:02,604
And if that's-If there was any goal
that I would have for Garrison...

676
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,171
it'd be for him to pursue that.

677
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:08,117
For me, I would-I would like to see him
pursue a relationship with a girl who...

678
00:50:08,186 --> 00:50:11,815
who definitely, uh, you know,
has the Lord first in her life.

679
00:50:13,758 --> 00:50:16,727
But I don't know.
She makes him question his faith in God.

680
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:18,387
She really does.

681
00:50:18,463 --> 00:50:23,127
Garrison needed to learn what it was like
to have a really crooked girlfriend...

682
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,568
so that he can appreciate me,
and then be sad now that I'm gone.

683
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:32,302
I guess the main thing for me was
when people in the church were kind of...

684
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:35,403
- especially people I respected were like, "Well..."
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,576
They believe that men are born to be leaders
and women are born to be submissive.

686
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:42,620
And, like, we're still both getting
to our own spots in that.

687
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:46,214
- I'm not exactly the most submissive person.
- Yeah.

688
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:49,721
Like, at first, when she brought it up,
people were saying things.

689
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:53,491
Not people, but, like-Well, these,
like, people that we look up to.

690
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:57,057
I was kind of, "Why do they have to stick
their nose in everyone's business, blah, blah."

691
00:50:57,135 --> 00:51:00,866
I was just kind of, like,
upset about it that...

692
00:51:00,939 --> 00:51:05,433
I guess I realized, you know, I'd rather
listen to them 'cause...

693
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,445
they're wiser than we are, obviously.

694
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:13,177
And I also didn't want it over our heads,
like-If we were gonna keep going out...

695
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:17,517
and I'd know these people we respect
weren't in agreement with it, then...

696
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:21,790
I don't know, I'd just have that
over my head, like, the whole time.

697
00:51:24,362 --> 00:51:28,321
Garrison, uh-
He told me to break up with Robin.

698
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,133
So I thought about it.

699
00:51:33,204 --> 00:51:37,800
But I can't do that to Robin.

700
00:51:37,876 --> 00:51:42,575
He's so sensitive. And... dumb.

701
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:45,844
They're all dumb. I don't know.

702
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:49,216
I think Garrison and I are just really,
really, really good friends.

703
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:54,589
Everyone always teases, like,
"Oh, you're gonna marry Garrison, "but...

704
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:57,594
- I don't know if I could put up with that.

705
00:51:57,662 --> 00:52:00,130
Oh, my Beastie Boys.
Oh, look at this!

706
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:02,666
A text message from Robin.

707
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:04,895
What are the odds?

708
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:09,997
The boys are back to back. I don't know.

709
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:13,367
It's the haircut.

710
00:52:18,183 --> 00:52:21,914
It wouldn't be that bad.
Like, her whole plan is that, like...

711
00:52:21,986 --> 00:52:25,945
if we're, like, 30, and we haven't, like, met
someone, we're just gonna marry each other.

712
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:31,018
So-I don't know.

713
00:52:31,095 --> 00:52:33,086
We'll see what happens.

714
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:49,811
- Gentle Barn?
- Yeah. I do community service.

715
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:51,508
Wait. What?

716
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,517
Ellen DeGeneres was there,
and I wanted to say hi.

717
00:52:53,585 --> 00:52:56,145
Wait. What's a Gentle Barn?

718
00:52:56,221 --> 00:53:01,215
There's a lot of animals, you see,
that were treated just the way I treat you.

719
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:04,386
And traumatized... into submission.

720
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:09,163
- "Ha, ha"-
- Can I check my Facebook?

721
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:10,724
- No.
- Kristen keeps commenting...

722
00:53:10,802 --> 00:53:13,862
No No, then definitely no.

723
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:16,600
How did you do that?

724
00:53:16,674 --> 00:53:19,802
- I'm good a drawing's.
- "Skye Likes Dandelions."

725
00:53:19,878 --> 00:53:22,438
- You don't have boobs.
- She's wearing a T-shirt.

726
00:53:22,514 --> 00:53:24,744
Right. I don't see the problem.

727
00:53:24,816 --> 00:53:27,614
You look like a boy...
with pretty eyes.

728
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:31,351
I'll fix it.

729
00:53:31,422 --> 00:53:34,084
Give him-Give him a thing
so my boobs aren't lopsided.

730
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:37,355
Should I draw them normal or hilarious?

731
00:53:37,428 --> 00:53:40,829
Oh, my gosh. Don't give
me Kim Possible boobs.

732
00:53:40,899 --> 00:53:43,697
- Oh, no.
- "Doo-doot-doo-doot."

733
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:46,196
Oh! Stop!

734
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:50,071
Oh, my gosh, Garrison.

735
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:55,241
- Hey, when do you have to move?
- I don't know. Pappa's not even preparing.

736
00:53:55,313 --> 00:54:00,945
He doesn't-
He's-He's just-Like, he's just too old.

737
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:07,254
He doesn't know what's going on.
Like, we haven't started packing. Nothing.

738
00:54:07,325 --> 00:54:09,293
Watch. We're gonna get
a knock on the door...

739
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,353
and they're gonna, like,
repossess all my great posters.

740
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:17,832
What about the place in, uh, the...

741
00:54:17,902 --> 00:54:20,336
Agua Dulce, where your cousin lives?

742
00:54:20,405 --> 00:54:22,965
I can't move there. My cousin lives there.

743
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,703
Well, build her, like, an igloo.

744
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:28,746
Yeah, we have-
We don't even have money for ice.

745
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:30,678
Okay, out of mud.

746
00:54:30,748 --> 00:54:32,306
It's, like, an adobe thing.

747
00:54:32,383 --> 00:54:35,113
We can't afford to make it rain
every day, Garrison.

748
00:54:35,186 --> 00:54:37,177
Okay, okay.

749
00:54:37,255 --> 00:54:40,486
Just-There's a shed.

750
00:54:40,558 --> 00:54:42,992
- Garrison, you're so insensitive.
- No, I'm just...

751
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:47,327
You don't know what it's like to lose your
house, Garrison, and have nowhere to go.

752
00:54:47,398 --> 00:54:49,798
Like, you don't know what
it's like to, like...

753
00:54:49,867 --> 00:54:53,928
have a papa that's too old to, like,
get off his feet again, you know?

754
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:55,438
Yeah.

755
00:54:56,975 --> 00:54:58,704
You don't know what that's like.

756
00:54:58,776 --> 00:55:02,007
You don't know how scary that is.

757
00:55:06,017 --> 00:55:10,579
It's so stupid. It doesn't even matter.
It's just a stupid house.

758
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:51,190
Well, I really wanted-
I think we both really wanted to...

759
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:54,390
build a half-pipe in it and stuff.

760
00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:59,459
And, like, have, like, punk shows here.

761
00:55:59,537 --> 00:56:02,199
And, like, make it, like,
the coolest place ever.

762
00:56:02,273 --> 00:56:07,506
But-Yeah. That's what we
wanted to do, anyway.

763
00:56:08,312 --> 00:56:10,746
- I guess time slips.
- Yeah.

764
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:13,682
That's cool. 'Cause this
place is still here.

765
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:16,379
I can still go to it
whenever I feel like it.

766
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,921
I remember all the times
when we almost fell off this roof.

767
00:56:22,994 --> 00:56:27,226
...I remember all the times we did.

768
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:33,631
We did fall off the roof.

769
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:36,264
Those were good times.

770
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:38,741
Yep.

771
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:43,440
I think Garrison will be with me forever.

772
00:56:43,514 --> 00:56:45,914
I mean, he's like a fungus.

773
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:48,008
He's like rust, you know?

774
00:56:48,086 --> 00:56:50,145
Like the rust on this building.

775
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:52,621
You never get rid of it.

776
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:56,983
- Thank you.
- He's gonna infect my life...

777
00:56:57,061 --> 00:56:58,619
- with happiness-
- Oh, good.

778
00:56:58,696 --> 00:57:00,630
And joy.

779
00:57:00,698 --> 00:57:04,634
- But deep inside, I'll be dying.
- We're all dying.

780
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:07,200
That's the morbid part about this.

781
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:10,297
- Is that we're all dying happily.
- Slowly.

782
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:12,433
Greatly.

783
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:15,070
- Can we die greatly?
- Yeah, I'm down.

784
00:57:21,352 --> 00:57:24,446
I don't know.
We've been packing up, but slowly...

785
00:57:24,522 --> 00:57:29,789
and I don't know why we've been
packing so slowly, considering...

786
00:57:29,861 --> 00:57:34,093
we only have two weeks to get out,
and we have no place to go.

787
00:57:34,165 --> 00:57:38,864
But I'm not packing my room, because
they're gonna have to drag me out of here.

788
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:43,740
I don't even remember
the last time I changed my sheets...

789
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,003
and I don't care either.

790
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:49,543
I don't know.

791
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:53,914
I guess it's hard because
they keep telling us, "Get out here..."

792
00:57:53,985 --> 00:57:57,079
and then it's like...

793
00:57:57,155 --> 00:58:00,249
Then we get extended again
and again and again.

794
00:58:00,324 --> 00:58:02,849
And everyone's stressed out,
and no one knows when.

795
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:06,158
Now we know when, and we don't
even know if that's gonna be the when.

796
00:58:12,003 --> 00:58:16,372
I've fought so hard...

797
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:19,104
through all of it.

798
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:20,872
Through everything.

799
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:28,013
I... was so hopeful.

800
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:31,543
I... was so happy.

801
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:36,190
I had so much faith...

802
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:39,321
that everything was gonna be okay.

803
00:58:39,397 --> 00:58:44,300
And I waited so long
to have my dad back, and...

804
00:58:46,737 --> 00:58:51,106
I wanted so bad just to...

805
00:58:54,245 --> 00:58:56,713
I don't know.

806
00:58:56,781 --> 00:58:59,079
I just...

807
00:59:01,485 --> 00:59:05,888
I- I didn't expect this, I guess.

808
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:08,448
And I'm not the only one.

809
00:59:08,526 --> 00:59:10,517
But...

810
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:17,192
I guess I just feel pretty... alone.

811
00:59:17,935 --> 00:59:20,369
That's all.

812
00:59:40,658 --> 00:59:43,593
- What do you want?
- Hi.

813
00:59:44,161 --> 00:59:46,561
- Do I look cute?
- No.

814
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:49,327
You look adorable.

815
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:55,997
Nothing has changed.

816
01:00:00,745 --> 01:00:04,442
I can see through those eyes.

817
01:00:05,016 --> 01:00:08,782
See? She still loves me.

818
01:00:13,457 --> 01:00:15,618
- You're making me feel sad.
- Why?

819
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:17,991
Because you're all
Negative Nelly these days.

820
01:00:18,496 --> 01:00:21,693
Mmm. My name is not Nelly.

821
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:24,963
Negative...

822
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:30,773
Hey, Garrison, I'm sorry things aren't
as easy as you'd like them to be for me.

823
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:37,404
- I'm-It's not that.
- These are just difficult days, I mean.

824
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:42,145
And it's not like-It's-
Never mind.

825
01:00:42,954 --> 01:00:44,751
Never mind.

826
01:00:44,822 --> 01:00:49,657
Just don't find the bad side
of everything instead.

827
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,354
You used to always say the good stuff.

828
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:58,894
I know, I used to do a lot of things.

829
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,336
But now, whenever there's a good
or a bad thing to choose from...

830
01:01:01,405 --> 01:01:05,398
you choose the bad thing... to say.

831
01:01:05,476 --> 01:01:07,467
It seems that way.

832
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:18,251
You don't know how hard I'm trying.

833
01:01:19,323 --> 01:01:21,621
I know.

834
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:36,639
You can't want to marry me. You have...

835
01:01:36,707 --> 01:01:39,699
- So that's your only option.
- Okay. Okay.

836
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:42,644
Well, I mean, either way
it's gonna be my only option.

837
01:01:42,713 --> 01:01:44,943
- Yeah.
- I'm never gonna want to marry you.

838
01:01:46,817 --> 01:01:50,913
So it's-You know, so it's a backup plan.

839
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:56,321
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

840
01:03:06,163 --> 01:03:10,623
See, I like-I'd rather
have a 250 than a 175.

841
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:12,498
- But-125-
- Or a 125.

842
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,403
No they-They race 125 Two Strokes.

843
01:03:15,473 --> 01:03:17,998
That's a-They're-They're fast.

844
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:21,442
- Yeah, but I wanna be faster.
- How much do you weigh? Like a hundred...

845
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,912
- Guess.
- 115.

846
01:03:23,981 --> 01:03:27,280
Are you kidding me? I
weigh 145 pounds, Dad.

847
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,516
- 145 pounds! Okay, yeah, that's 250.
- Yeah.

848
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:35,923
Okay? I'm skinny, but I'm all muscle.
I mean, I'm 5'11...

849
01:03:35,993 --> 01:03:38,962
- Yeah.
- It's a good weight.

850
01:03:49,874 --> 01:03:51,705
Hey, Gary. Uh...

851
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:54,972
You're coming to my graduation, right?

852
01:03:55,946 --> 01:03:57,743
Yes?

853
01:03:57,815 --> 01:04:01,512
I need to know so I can give you a ticket.

854
01:04:01,585 --> 01:04:05,988
If you are. So call me back.

855
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:10,151
Or I'll call you. Or
I'll go to your house...

856
01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:12,161
and stalk you through your window.

857
01:04:14,698 --> 01:04:16,461
Okay. Good-bye.

858
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:47,526
I honestly don't know how it's gonna go
with moving to Tennessee and all.

859
01:04:48,866 --> 01:04:50,197
Oh, well.

860
01:04:51,302 --> 01:04:53,395
It's really all up in the air.

861
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:56,598
Everyone's kind of, like,
pulling me different directions.

862
01:04:56,674 --> 01:05:01,737
Like, "Come here. Go there.
Do this. Go there. Do that.

863
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:05,179
You wanna do this. You
don't wanna do that."

864
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:10,414
I'm like, "Okay."
Well, we'll find out.

865
01:05:14,091 --> 01:05:15,786
Oh. Fixed him!

866
01:05:15,859 --> 01:05:18,089
Lookit. Now...

867
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:20,496
Off.

868
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:25,358
Now he can go up here.

869
01:05:37,248 --> 01:05:39,808
Now we can go on the adventure.

870
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:56,997
"You can spend your whole life building."

871
01:05:57,067 --> 01:06:00,036
"Something from nothing."

872
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:06,168
"Storms may come
and blow it all away."

873
01:06:06,243 --> 01:06:10,737
"Build it anyway."

874
01:06:14,218 --> 01:06:17,346
"You can chase a dream."

875
01:06:17,421 --> 01:06:20,788
"That seems so out of reach."

876
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:27,320
"As the fears and doubts
begin to come your way."

877
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:31,960
"Dream it anyway."

878
01:06:35,506 --> 01:06:41,877
"Anything is possible today."

879
01:06:41,945 --> 01:06:49,945
"And I believe that it will guide us
to our destiny someday."

880
01:06:51,388 --> 01:06:57,759
"I dream it anyway."

881
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:02,229
"I dream it anyway."

882
01:07:02,299 --> 01:07:05,496
Where's Skye and all them?

883
01:07:05,569 --> 01:07:07,833
I don't know.

884
01:07:21,418 --> 01:07:24,819
After graduation? Like today?

885
01:07:24,888 --> 01:07:27,186
I don't know what we're doing yet.

886
01:07:28,258 --> 01:07:31,352
We're gonna go get
something to eat, I guess.

887
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:37,793
I don't know.
How about Gary? Garrison! Gary!

888
01:07:37,868 --> 01:07:40,962
He's, uh-Gary!

889
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:46,868
Excuse me. I'm gonna run
into the big crowd.

890
01:07:48,345 --> 01:07:54,875
"Anything is possible today."

891
01:07:54,952 --> 01:08:02,952
"And I believe that it will guide us
to our destiny someday."

892
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:09,798
"I'll dream it anyway."

893
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:16,462
"Dream it anyway."

894
01:08:40,631 --> 01:08:44,089
"You can pour your soul out singing."

895
01:08:44,168 --> 01:08:47,331
"A song you believe in."

896
01:08:47,404 --> 01:08:53,741
"That tomorrow they'll forget
you ever sang."

897
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:59,181
"Sing it anyway."

898
01:09:00,551 --> 01:09:05,614
"Yeah, sing it anyway."

899
01:09:07,524 --> 01:09:12,928
"Believe it anyway."

900
01:09:14,598 --> 01:09:20,264
"Yeah, build it anyway."

901
01:09:21,538 --> 01:09:26,737
"Yeah, love it anyway."

902
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:33,882
"Yeah, sing it anyway."

903
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:38,451
"Dream it anyway."

904
01:09:41,592 --> 01:09:49,522
"Yeah, sing it anyway."
