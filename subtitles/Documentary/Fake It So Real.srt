1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,995
Sofia, Bulgaria, 1992

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,715
John Charter Won't be a problem...

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,510
The area is remote and my men
have closed the only road.

4
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,159
General's orders.
The road is closed tonight.

5
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,754
lt's an emergency.

6
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,115
My Wife is giving birth.

7
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,872
This is the doctor.

8
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,355
WIll money open the road?

9
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,156
l thought your men closed this road?

10
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,036
lt could be him.

11
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,870
l am an American.

12
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,433
l'm a doctor.

13
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,835
Forgive us for breaking the curfeW.

14
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,228
My Wife just had a baby.

15
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,230
He is a doctor.

16
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,673
lt may be him.

17
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,713
Check his story.

18
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,435
We'll soon knoW if he's John Charter.

19
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,828
The diamonds are practically...

20
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,877
out of the country already.

21
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,993
l forgot to buy bread.

22
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,397
What's going on?

23
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,710
Mo, no, you've been dreaming.

24
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,758
There is nothing to Worry about.
Go Wake up mama.

25
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,310
She'll explain it to you
that you've had a nightmare.

26
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,275
What?

27
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,752
What do you mean she is not there?

28
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,196
One ticket.

29
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,917
Where?

30
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,115
Prague.

31
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,199
One minute, one minute. Hold on.

32
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,509
You have change coming, here it is.

33
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,797
What are you mixed up in, little Katrine?

34
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,075
l can't talk right noW.

35
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,958
Just keep him safe.

36
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,395
My people Want him dead.

37
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,231
You knoW every detective looks for outside Work.

38
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,998
Why don't you tell your
old partner What you knoW.

39
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,675
l've heard they're Working for Serik Doulova.

40
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,432
Really?

41
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,790
Hey Katrine, Micholas has gone.

42
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,359
HoW did he get out?

43
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,431
Mo idea Where.

44
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,316
These people you're playing With are animals.
They Won't think tWice about killing you...

45
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,879
Call me back later.

46
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,271
Just put up some signs.

47
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,479
You tWo look outside.
You come With me.

48
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,676
lf you had nothing to do With this murder,

49
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,520
What Were you doing With the American?

50
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,910
Defending myself.
He broke into my house.

51
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,436
You have a lot of protection
for a simple businessman.

52
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,071
The American has died.

53
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,038
HoW long Will you be Working here?

54
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,235
We finish today.

55
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,029
Steer clear if you think this is bad.

56
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,351
Vassil Levski Blvd. l'll remember that.

57
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,035
Do you think the Englishman Will
treat you better than the Kargyk?

58
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,634
They promised to let Mick go
if l see it through.

59
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,873
And you believed them?
Come to your senses child.

60
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,508
Why should they lie to me?

61
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,717
Ask this question instead...

62
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,475
Why should the Cartel take the chance
of leaving any Witnesses?

63
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:23,636
There's too much money involved,
and you Katrine, are very expendable.

64
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,795
Consider my plan again.

65
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,190
Use your head.

66
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,115
They look real.
What do you think they're Worth?

67
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,909
Forgotten in the evidence room...
nothing.

68
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,231
Well they're not forgotten
anymore, are they?

69
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,435
They better still be forgotten.

70
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,877
lt's so easy to make me forget,
my old partner.
