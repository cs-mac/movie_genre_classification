1
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,413
Mr. Danielson?

2
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,999
He took my blanket!

3
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,375
Okay. Everybody calm down!
Calm down, everybody.

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,835
You'll get your blanket!

5
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,010
lt's mine! Legally, it's mine! lt's mine!

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,889
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,349
Evan, get help. Get help!

8
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,351
l don't need help!
What l need is my blanket!

9
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,938
- Man, you're crazy!
- l am not crazy! l want my goo-gaa!

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,900
l want my goo-gaa!

11
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,818
He wasn't always this way.

12
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,906
Once upon a time, he was a king.

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,328
The king of Somewhere.

14
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,038
Strong and powerful.

15
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,247
What l'm suggesting is that

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,708
you reallocate 8% of your equity
into international markets.

17
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,379
He protected his loyal subjects
and made them feel safe.

18
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,048
All right, are you looking at the charts?

19
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,718
Well, these are actually very
conservative projections. Yes they are.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,137
But one day he left his Kingdom

21
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,808
and he got lost in the Land of Nowhere.

22
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,519
Something no one could
have ever imagined.

23
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,038
Everybody's upped their stocks...

24
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,292
I am here to taIk about finances,
Wall Street...

25
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,855
In Nowhere Land,
everybody wanted to be king,

26
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,941
or at Ieast they aII try to be.

27
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,026
Evan, it's Noah. I got a feather.

28
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,528
- You got a what?
- A feather.

29
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,155
lt was on my desk with a note attached.

30
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,573
- From Johnny Whitefeather?
- Yup.

31
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,657
What'd the note say?

32
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,202
"l'll be at your 9:00 a.m. See you
in there. Ain't nothing but a thing."

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,622
- Wow. Then the rumor must be true.
- What? What rumor?

34
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,166
- Stevens is cashing in.
- What?

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,334
- He's selling the company?
- He has to be.

36
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,628
His repIacement is gonna be me
or Johnny!

37
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,796
You're gonna get this job!

38
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,134
- Hey. Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

39
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,178
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

40
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,804
It was a very strange pIace.

41
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,681
...and they've narrowed it down
to our firm and two others.

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,392
And it is confirmed, Whitefeather is
gonna be in the meeting.

43
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:09,188
The King was reaIIy unhappy there.
He just couIdn't figure out why.

44
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,981
- Hey, Tod!
- What's up, Mr. D?

45
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,983
Take this down to graphics
and add it to my chart, all right?

46
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,693
- After l...
- Now.

47
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,654
- What about the...
- Hey, "now" now, man. What's up?

48
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,032
- How much are we paying that guy?
- He's an unpaid intern.

49
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,075
lt might be too much.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,413
l think it was because he was
aIways working to protect his castIe

51
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,416
from those who wanted
to steal his crown.

52
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,418
Johnny Whitefeather.

53
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,130
Evan Danielson.
Fellow salmon swimming upstream.

54
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,091
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

55
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:44,223
So those of us he left behind
went out into the land to rescue him.

56
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,854
Whip, l said l'd sit you down with
our two best financial managers.

57
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,234
Evan's been our number-one guy
for the last eight and a half years.

58
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,027
Johnny's been with us for 16 months,

59
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,030
but he's already
one of our top producers.

60
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,659
Either way, you'll be well taken care of
here at Smith/Stevens.

61
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,328
- Evan?
- Mr. Bryson.

62
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,746
You've made some
really sound investments,

63
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,874
but quite frankly, l think we can do
better. Let's see if you agree.

64
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,087
Evan Danielson's office.

65
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:20,175
Now, this will give you a solid base of
capital and a 9 to 11 % yield, annually.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,470
Yeah, l understand. ls it...
His daughter?

67
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,514
Did you call her mother?

68
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,768
Because if l say it's urgent
and he's really, really...

69
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,272
The goo-gaa?

70
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,191
- Fantastic, Evan.
- Thank you, Tom.

71
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,152
- Johnny?
- Thank you, Tom. Whip.

72
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,407
Dave, Lee, Troy.
l see those looks of skepticism,

73
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,410
just like old man Stevens
the first week that he hired me.

74
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,955
Said to himself, "l hired an lndian.
Can he handle money?"

75
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,540
And how.

76
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,798
Hey, l really appreciate
you letting me contribute

77
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,426
a little piece of venison to your potlatch.

78
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,136
Okay.

79
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,888
We're here under one sky.

80
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,226
All of us, under one sky.
Let's appreciate that.

81
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,603
One sky.

82
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,817
Evan Danielson,
that man over there is a seer.

83
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,694
Uses the whole eye.

84
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,614
But there is a difference between sight

85
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,243
and vision.

86
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,082
Sight is about
what lies just in front of us.

87
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,795
Vision is about what lies ahead.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,548
- The genius of the hawk...
- Excuse me.

89
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,091
Johnny, sorry to interrupt you

90
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,469
in one of your always interesting stories
about nature,

91
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,055
but, gentlemen, l have...
l'm gonna have to leave you, Mr. Bryson,

92
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,350
in the very capable hands of
my colleague Mr. Noah Kulick here.

93
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,394
l have a little family emergency at my
daughter's school l have to take care of.

94
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,812
Thank you for your time, sir.

95
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,647
That's what we're all talking about.

96
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,818
Life, nest, eggs. Circle of life.

97
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,404
Yeah. Hakuna matata.

98
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,115
l'm so sorry, but the school kept calling.

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,867
- Don't tell me. The goo-gaa.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,285
l hate that blanket!

101
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,040
We don't normally allow
any kind of security items at school,

102
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,376
but because of yours
and Trish's separation,

103
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,086
we made a temporary exception.

104
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,631
Unfortunately,
it's just not workable anymore.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,966
Hey, you guys.

106
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,218
So this is why l was called out of work?

107
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,136
Because my daughter's
sitting by herself at recess?

108
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,514
No, the reason l called you,
Mr. Danielson,

109
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,183
is because her class went inside
45 minutes ago.

110
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,229
She's still sitting here because
Kupida and Mopida told her to.

111
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,899
- Kupida and Mopida are...
- Yeah. l know. Her imaginary friends.

112
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,194
l told Trish we're gonna have to
do something about that blanket.

113
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,362
Well, Trish and l discussed this,

114
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,197
and we both feel that
what needs to be dealt with

115
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,909
is the reason why she still feels
she needs a blanket.

116
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,787
lt's usually an indication of
some kind of emotional needs

117
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,455
that haven't been met.

118
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,667
What's happening? Are they talking?

119
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,002
Well, you know, sometimes,
these things are like a Band-Aid.

120
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,587
You just have to rip it off.

121
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,090
Right.

122
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,426
Rip it.

123
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,511
Rip.

124
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,270
Kupida. l can't hear you both
at the same time.

125
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,188
Go ahead, Mopida.

126
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,859
Wait. Wait a minute.
Someone's coming.

127
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,114
Hey, Liv.

128
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,783
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

129
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,870
Hey, remember we talked about
how the day was gonna come

130
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,497
when you couldn't take the goo-gaa
to school with you anymore?

131
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,124
That day is gonna be today.

132
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,376
So what Daddy's gonna do
is l'm gonna take the goo-gaa.

133
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,544
l'm gonna hold on to it for you.

134
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,298
When you get home from school,
you'll get it back then, all right?

135
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,633
All right, sweetie.
Just give me the goo-gaa.

136
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,386
And you have a great day.
All right, baby.

137
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,408
As you know,
the Mile High City Arts Council

138
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,911
relies solely on contributions.

139
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,957
Yeah. l've got 12 people and four desks.
We need your money.

140
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,546
Mr. Cosgrove, can l call you right back?

141
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,633
Trish, please, this is a really bad week.

142
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,220
Evan, l told you three months ago
that this week was pledge week.

143
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,971
- That's this week?
- Yes.

144
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,266
You promised me you wouldn't do this.
You promised me.

145
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,019
Look, Evan,
l know you and her haven't ever...

146
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,437
- Trish, please, not this week.
- ...had a chance...

147
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,939
- Not this week. l'm begging you.
- ...to connect.

148
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,732
- Can we flip-flop and l'll do it next week?
- No!

149
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,983
- l promise you...
- No.

150
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,569
Evan, even if l could, l wouldn't.

151
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,246
Evan, why did you tell me
you even wanted to have children?

152
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,207
'Cause l did. l do!

153
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,962
l just didn't know l'd be so bad at it.

154
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,966
You know, Evan,
you're a really smart guy.

155
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,468
You make huge deals every day.

156
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,764
l'm sure you'll find a way
to deal with her.

157
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,729
Sweetie, you're gonna go
with Daddy, okay?

158
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,190
- Okay.
- He's so excited.

159
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,653
And l'm gonna call you every night
to say good night.

160
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,738
- Promise?
- You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

161
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,948
- Okay.
- l love you, kiddo.

162
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,366
l love you, too.

163
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,882
Okay, here we go.

164
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,928
Hey, you're a competitive guy.

165
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,764
That's intimidating,
especially in a father figure.

166
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,350
Okay, first of all,
l'm not her father figure.

167
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,312
l'm her father.
And she's the one that's intimidating.

168
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,772
- What?
- Honestly. She just stares at me!

169
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,940
Or through me.

170
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,776
She's got this imaginary world
that she goes to

171
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,905
with Kupida and Kapuda and Zupida.
l don't get it.

172
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,575
Look, l'm gonna put this
as gently as possible, okay?

173
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,909
You're a complete idiot.

174
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,787
You feel out of control
and you project that onto her.

175
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,416
Hey, look, man.
Be my friend and be my client.

176
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,169
But don't be Mr. Mystic Man
or whatever that is you call yourself.

177
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,712
- Man Whisperer.
- The Man Whisperer.

178
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,673
John Strother, former cornerback
for the Denver Broncos,

179
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,884
is now known as the "Man Whisperer."

180
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,303
- That's right.
- You be whispering to men.

181
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,973
Look, all l'm saying is that
we all have a little kid inside, right here.

182
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,642
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And he's whispering.

183
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,435
Stop. Please. Stop. Stop!

184
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,519
lf you don't whisper to little Evan,

185
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,938
- you'll never get through to Olivia!
- l'm not whispering to little Evan

186
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,148
- and l'm not whispering with you.
- You just did.

187
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,691
No, l wasn't.
No, l wasn't whispering with you.

188
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,817
l was whispering on the other...

189
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,694
You was finished talking,
and then l said "whisper" after.

190
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,820
l wasn't whispering with you.

191
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,113
Little Evan?
What's wrong with little Evan?

192
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,075
Say it again. Say, "Whisper to little
Evan," one more time. Say it again.

193
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,785
- You know what's gonna happen?
- What's gonna happen? What?

194
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,496
- What you gonna do?
- l'm gonna crash your portfolio.

195
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,498
What's that have to do with anything?

196
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,757
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

197
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,635
- You wear him out?
- No, but Olivia will.

198
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,971
- Where are they at?
- Upstairs. Princess dress-up.

199
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,015
What? They started without me?

200
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,353
- Hey, Ev. Livvy's upstairs.
- Thanks. Thanks for watching her.

201
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,271
Absolutely. Anytime.

202
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,150
And Trish told me to remind you,
vaccinations on Thursday.

203
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,945
- Okay.
- And Ella's party is Friday.

204
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,031
lt's a sleepover here,
so pack all of her stuff.

205
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,033
And the Fall Sing is Saturday.

206
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,036
Livvy's really nervous,
so go through her songs with her.

207
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,163
She doesn't think l'm gonna
remember all this, does she?

208
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,957
No. She does not.

209
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,881
Oh, no. Come on, guys.

210
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,968
More! l want to be beautiful!

211
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,386
Hey, Ev.

212
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,054
l've got the perfect size seat
for little Evan.

213
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,223
- Come, sit down.
- l think l'm fine. l'm okay.

214
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,392
Come on, Liv, let's go. We gotta go.

215
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,812
- Bye, Olivia.
- Bye, Ella.

216
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,272
- Bye, Liv.
- Bye.

217
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,065
Denver Broncos, huh?

218
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,990
No, Mopida, l can't go.

219
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,909
No.

220
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,828
Well, yeah.

221
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,003
Are you sure, Mopida?

222
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,717
Okay, if you say so.

223
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,641
What? He actually had a snake?
A real snake?

224
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,019
Nobody's going to fall
for this whole shtick.

225
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,189
What we have to do is find a better way
to do this, all right?

226
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,732
No, no, listen.

227
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,526
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eliminate TriTek.

228
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,153
No, no, no, no.
Look, l'm looking at the specs here,

229
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,572
and l don't like what l see. First of...

230
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,451
Hold on a second.

231
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,787
Olivia, what are you doing?
Go back to bed.

232
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,415
- You said you'd be a king.
- l said l'd do what?

233
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,378
You said last time that next time
you'd do dress up, and you'd be a king.

234
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,380
Well, l don't recall saying that.
l don't remember saying that.

235
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,632
And even if l did say that,

236
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,675
l don't have the right stuff
to do king stuff here.

237
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,303
l don't have any king clothes,
and l don't have a king hat.

238
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,971
lt's called a crown.

239
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,598
- Evan, you there?
- Hold on a second.

240
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,391
Whatever. Olivia, please, just go to bed.

241
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,559
l will sleep in here.

242
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,937
No, you're sleeping in your room.
That's why you have a bedroom.

243
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,315
- You go sleep in your bedroom.
- l do not want to sleep in there.

244
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,736
All right. You're gonna go to sleep?
You promise?

245
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,491
Go over there and lay down. Be quiet,
Olivia. l have to work here, all right?

246
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,577
l'm sorry, man. Where was l?
What was l saying?

247
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,955
Listen, this is where
we're gonna snake Whitefeather.

248
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,249
'Cause he's thinking we're gonna go
for the obvious play, Solocom.

249
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,794
But what we're gonna do... Digital Fiber.
Digital Fiber is the play.

250
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,129
- That's the obvious choice.
- Stop saying...

251
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,548
Hold on a second.

252
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,633
- Olivia.
- What?

253
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,596
Yeah, sorry about that, man. Look.
No, no, no.

254
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,099
You gotta be quiet.

255
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,768
lt's his job, not yours.

256
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,814
Can l call you back? Thank you.

257
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,276
All right, that's it.

258
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,237
Now, l asked you to be quiet,
but you don't listen.

259
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,155
- Yes, l do.
- No, you don't.

260
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,032
l asked you not to talk,
but you kept talking.

261
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,326
You don't know how to listen,
so since you don't know how to listen,

262
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,745
you take your blanket
and you go in your room. Go.

263
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,792
Come on now.

264
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,460
Come on, come on, really, please.

265
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,505
Come on, please. l'm saying, "Please."
Go to bed, please.

266
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,934
Now what?

267
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,478
What is it?

268
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,817
Look, l told you,
l will play king with you some other time.

269
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,486
Daddy has a lot of work to do.
All right? So...

270
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,115
What?

271
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,826
l do listen.

272
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,573
l'm sorry.

273
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,993
How many days till l go back home?

274
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,712
I've gone over everything we taIked
about Iast night, and it aII Iooks great.

275
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,965
That's perfect, because
Whitefeather's gonna go with Solocom.

276
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,800
- Of course.
- But we got a better alternative.

277
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,968
- Digital Fiber.
- Got a good record.

278
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,386
Exactly.
l'm gonna call you in 20 minutes,

279
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,971
- right after l drop Olivia off to school.
- Very nice.

280
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,430
All right. Okay.

281
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,516
Come on, honey. Let's get going.
Daddy's sort of in a hurry.

282
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,309
l think this milk is spoiled.

283
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,311
No. That's not possible,
because l checked this milk.

284
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,647
Come on, let's go! Let's go.

285
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,003
What if we say
we just get a muffin, huh?

286
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,338
Tomorrow, can we make pancakes?

287
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,173
Honey, l don't know
if l have the right stuff for that,

288
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,926
- you know, supply-wise or skill-wise.
- l can help you.

289
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,845
l got a better idea.
How about we leave a note for Graciella,

290
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,388
she can make some pancakes,
put them in the freezer,

291
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,473
we'll thaw them out
and eat them tomorrow, huh? Yeah.

292
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,435
- Not what l was thinking.
- Move! Let's move!

293
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,730
Hey, you didn't pack my Fall Sing music.

294
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,734
Okay, your Fall Sing...
Where is that stuff?

295
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,778
Okay, here it is! Right here.
Right here's your music.

296
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,824
Rick?

297
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,953
- l thought you said you were in a hurry.
- Yeah. l'm coming right now.

298
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,253
Okay, stop, stop, stop. Once is enough.

299
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,676
Hey, does Mommy ever make
a new friend, you know, in like a...

300
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,803
- You mean Rick?
- Yes, Rick.

301
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,557
ls that the guy from Mommy's work with
the spiked hair and the pointed face?

302
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,727
"Hello, l'd like to talk to you for a sec."
That guy?

303
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,813
No, that's Skip. Rick is tall.

304
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,983
Handsome, too.
He looks like Prince Charming.

305
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,111
Good for Rick.

306
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,615
- Morning, Graciella.
- Morning, Mr. Danielson.

307
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,242
- Hi, Graciella.
- Hi, Olivia. Nice to see you.

308
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,078
Hey, Graciella! One thing.

309
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,663
Can you please make some pancakes
and put them in the freezer for us?

310
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,625
Thank you so much. All right.

311
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,752
Hey, what are you, a button maniac?
Stop it.

312
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,003
Press one floor and leave it alone.

313
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,963
Daddy?

314
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,342
Kupida wanted me to tell you something.

315
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,052
Yeah. Go ahead.

316
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,847
She heard what you were saying
on the phone last night,

317
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,601
and she told me to tell you
she doesn't like either of them.

318
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,728
Which guy? Rick or Skip?

319
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,649
The companies,
Solocom and Digital Fiber.

320
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:34,403
Kupida doesn't like them,
neither does Mopida, and Qwali agrees.

321
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,574
Daddy, do you know
why they don't like them?

322
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,828
Daddy, l said,
do you know why they don't like them?

323
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,205
- Why?
- Because they're broken.

324
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,875
- Do you know which one they do like?
- No, honey, l have no idea.

325
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,878
The first one,
the one you threw away, TriTek.

326
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,506
- Are you sure you're listening?
- Yes, Daddy sure is listening,

327
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,508
but come on, we got to go. Let's go.

328
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,053
Kupida and Mopida really like it.

329
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,222
- You know why?
- Why is that?

330
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,309
- Because it has buried treasure.
- Yeah? Okay.

331
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,396
- You aren't listening.
- No, no, Daddy's listening.

332
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,404
Okay, so, we're here,
and we're going in.

333
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,073
And there's something
you have to go without.

334
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,269
Hey, come on, come on,
Olivia, let's go, let's go.

335
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,523
- Liv! How are you?
- Hi!

336
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,193
- Give me five.
- Put her there. Put her there.

337
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,986
Okay, guys, l got, like,
three meetings back to back.

338
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,572
She's just gonna sit down here
and get settled down here.

339
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,199
Let's get settled in. All right.

340
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,326
- Mike, which one can l get rid of?
- Well...

341
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,535
That one.

342
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,204
No. You don't say that one.
That's sacrilege.

343
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,623
That's Dante D'Enzo.
We never get rid of Dante D'Enzo.

344
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,251
- Kupida says he's boring.
- Well, Kupida is estúpida.

345
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,962
Because he happens to be one of
the greatest investors on the planet.

346
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,756
- No, he's boring.
- No, no.

347
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,382
Why am l standing here
arguing with you about Kupida?

348
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,468
Let me get something for you to watch.

349
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,387
There you go. There's the...
What's that? Barney.

350
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,973
Okay, look, can you watch my kid for
me? You have my back for me, Mike?

351
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,808
Watch that Barney and l'll be...

352
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,146
That's not Barney. That's Blue.

353
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,234
And now I'm going to tap your knee
very gentIy...

354
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,652
Did you see that?

355
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,696
...by increasing your family's holdings
in optical fiber.

356
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,532
lf you take a look at these charts here
on page six in your folders...

357
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,085
Granted, Solocom looks solid,

358
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,046
but if you pore over the financials,
it's crystal clear,

359
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,674
the smart play here is Digital Fiber.

360
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,969
- Kupida says no.
- Okay.

361
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,429
- No.
- Let's move on Digital Fiber.

362
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,182
l'm sorry. Don't move on Digital Fiber?

363
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,435
Oh, no. Yes, yes. Do go, yes. No.

364
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,438
- No?
- Yes. Yes, go, yes.

365
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,904
- Mother?
- Tom?

366
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,449
Johnny?
Perhaps you have something to add?

367
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:30,121
Not really. lt's good work from Evan.
Digital Fiber. Solocom.

368
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,872
l struggled with it myself last night.

369
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,083
l went to sleep convinced
l was gonna take

370
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,379
the Pressman family towards
that pretty face, Solocom.

371
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,675
But in the middle of the night,
the dream sparrow comes to me.

372
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,304
She taps me on the forehead and says,
"Wake up, handsome brave.

373
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,473
"There's something happening
in Uzbekistan."

374
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,891
"Uzbeka-what?

375
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,437
"lt's 4:30 in the morning, little friend.
l'm sleeping."

376
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,483
But she said there's a kalacampi,
the worm hidden in the apple.

377
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,029
And l let the dream sparrow fly away.

378
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,157
- The dream sparrow.
- But l investigated what she said

379
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,910
on the white fire grid
you people call the lnternet.

380
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,205
At 4:15 this morning,
Mountain Standard Time,

381
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,667
the Uzbeki government
followed through on a series of threats

382
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,420
to detonate a nuclear weapon. Boom.

383
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,506
Digital Fiber, Solocom,

384
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,927
all of their underground cabling
that they were relying upon,

385
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,890
lost in that mushroom cloud.
Do l blame Uzbekistan? No.

386
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,060
Defend yourself, mountain republic,
just like you said you would.

387
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,561
You followed through.

388
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,025
But 200 miles south, in Turkmenistan,

389
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,821
a little company called TriTek,
didn't look like much to me yesterday,

390
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:51,327
but today, their 6,000 miles of
already-buried underground cabling,

391
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:56,749
looking a lot more valuable.
TriTek, baby. l say we go into TriTek.

392
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,044
- Let's keep our fingers crossed, huh?
- Okay.

393
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,050
Evan, you mind if l sit in on your 11:00?

394
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,387
Well, Johnny, that's not up to me.
That's up to the client.

395
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,679
So it's cool?

396
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,724
Because l checked with the client,
and they said it's okay.

397
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,018
That's great. That's great.

398
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,813
Hey, ain't nothing but a thing.

399
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,565
The herd moves on,
but you're going to be fine, little elk.

400
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,568
You're going to be just fine.
One sky, man.

401
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,785
One sky.

402
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,580
l didn't realize you guys were so tight.

403
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,873
You know what l want you to do
for me, Tod?

404
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,418
Go down to legal
and check something out for me. Okay?

405
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,919
l want to know
what the ramifications are

406
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,547
if l were to stab Johnny Whitefeather.

407
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,263
- Daddy!
- Not now, sweetie.

408
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,098
- But, Daddy!
- Hey, not now.

409
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,350
And listen to me, Liv.
This is where Daddy works.

410
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,185
You cannot come down here
and stand outside my meetings

411
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,854
and flail your arms around.

412
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,150
- Rose!
- Yeah.

413
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,945
Can you take Olivia downstairs
and get her a muffin or something?

414
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,655
- Are you hungry, honey?
- No.

415
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,198
l don't think she's hungry.

416
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,826
She's starving. l can see that.

417
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,120
Come on. Here we go.
Let's go get a muffin.

418
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,038
Have some girl talk.

419
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,296
- Hey, Ev.
- Hey, give me a second, Noah.

420
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,965
l'm trying to find my notes for the 11:00.

421
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:32,636
Actually, it pertains to the 11:00.
Quickly, two things.

422
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:37,057
First, Johnny has just asked me
to join his tribe.

423
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,313
l can't believe it.
He actually calls his team a tribe.

424
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,732
Yeah, it's stupid.

425
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,987
- And you said yes, didn't you?
- No, no, absolutely not, at first.

426
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,822
But then he put
so much pressure on me.

427
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,991
He needed an answer immediately. So...

428
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,328
lt's all well and good, Noah.
But thanks for your loyalty, all right.

429
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,331
Now if you don't mind, l gotta get ready
in about 10 minutes, so if you'd be so...

430
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:04,418
That's the other thing.
About the 11:00, Johnny moved it up.

431
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,086
He had a conflict at 11:00.

432
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,506
Johnny moved my meeting
with my clients?

433
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,716
Yeah. lt started at 10:30,

434
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,721
so l popped in here as a courtesy to you,
because we were so tight for so long.

435
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,557
And thank you so much for hiring me.

436
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,768
- Out!
- Okay, l gotta go.

437
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,604
Rose!

438
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,983
Where are my notes for the 11:00?

439
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,819
- Sorry. l think they're in there.
- They're not in there.

440
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:41,914
Mr. D, l talked to the lawyer guy upstairs
and he confirmed my hunch

441
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:46,293
about the whole stabbing
Mr. Whitefeather thing.

442
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,798
lt's a definite no-can-do
from a legal standpoint.

443
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:55,511
- Go away, Tod. Go very far away.
- Yes. Right.

444
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,350
l can't find them.

445
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,685
Well, they're here somewhere, Rose.

446
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,270
Please, l can't make it happen
without my notes.

447
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,063
- Find my notes. Please.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

448
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,983
All of a sudden, l'm late for a meeting
that l was early for in the first place.

449
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,443
All right. lt's all right.
We're gonna find them.

450
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:19,660
Oh, my God.

451
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,912
Did you draw on my worksheets?

452
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,082
- Qwali said l could.
- Qwali said you could?

453
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,084
Qwali said you could.
But let me tell you something, Olivia.

454
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,877
l'm getting ready to go into
a meeting with grown people.

455
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,170
They're gonna be judging Daddy,

456
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,006
and all of a sudden,
my worksheets have

457
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,009
pictures of flowers and sparkly stuff

458
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,595
and, what is this,
people kissing or something?

459
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,346
Kupida says they might get married.

460
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,558
And why is this sticky?
Why is this so sticky?

461
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,019
lt's sparkle glue. Sparkly.

462
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,604
This is a disaster.

463
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,540
- A horror show.
- Live.

464
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,711
Love. Laugh. Walahala!

465
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,633
Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala!

466
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,138
l have never, guys,
l have never felt so jazzed

467
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,976
about the prospects of our pension fund!
l mean it. l am jazzed!

468
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,936
l wish l could take credit, Fred,

469
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,315
but we gotta give that to the Walahala,
Mr. Waterfall.

470
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,734
Hey, rain down prosperity!

471
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,571
- And how.
- Thank you, Johnny!

472
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:47,206
Evan. Everybody,
you remember Evan Danielson.

473
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,501
l would hope so, after seven years
of working with you guys.

474
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,879
Yeah. Of course.
How's it going there, Evan?

475
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,715
Good to see you.
Hey, look, while we were waiting for you,

476
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,804
Mr. Whitefeather, he made some rather
radical suggestions, as you can see.

477
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,514
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

478
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:07,476
So what do you think, Evan?
You agree with Mr. Whitefeather here,

479
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,690
or do you have some special insight
that you'd like to share with us about

480
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,858
how you would increase the fund?

481
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,530
l think l do have some insight.
l don't agree with Mr. Whitefeather.

482
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,578
What l was going to suggest was

483
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,874
a 4% reallocation
away from convertible arbitrage.

484
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,796
And in addition

485
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,386
to that...

486
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,680
Okay. Good. Thank you.

487
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,059
l don't know about you guys,
but this is good for me.

488
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,477
Didn't l tell you he was good?

489
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,937
Hey, man.

490
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,815
Sometimes the best spear
is the one you don't throw.

491
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,400
Ain't nothing but a thing.

492
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,907
"Ain't nothing but a thing."
What does that even mean, Johnny?

493
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,077
lt's not a thing, but it is?
lt's something, but it's not a thing?

494
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,749
But it's not. But it's something.
What is... l'm confused! What's that?

495
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,085
You're a seeker, brother crow.
You should ride that...

496
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,754
You know what? Stop it right now.
Stop it!

497
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,963
Because l'm not going to be
subjected to your

498
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,382
Dr. Seuss-meets-Pocahontas
stuff today.

499
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,761
"One sky, two sky, red sky, blue sky!"

500
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,473
Evan, that's shadow time. Okay.
Let's keep that in the shadows.

501
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,601
Oh, no. Please, please, please,
make him stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

502
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,480
Lord, Lord, Lord, make him stop, Lord.
Why are you falling for this?

503
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,607
What's the matter? l've been
working for you for seven years.

504
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,735
And you know that, Fred!
l went to your grandson's birthday party,

505
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,029
and l went to Aspen with you
and your wife for the whole weekend.

506
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,197
We got history together.

507
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,699
You gonna throw it all away because
this guy showed you some waterfalls

508
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,117
and got you chanting "Walla Walla"?

509
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,788
Evan, we're always looking for fresh
ideas, and he showed us some.

510
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,164
lt's like Johnny says.

511
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:57,294
You got turtles that live in their shell
and turtles that live out of their shell.

512
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,004
What? What? What did you just say?

513
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,131
What did he say? Johnny just said...
What did he tell you?

514
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,966
What was that?
What did he say? What?

515
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,260
He said turtles with no shell...

516
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,804
Called geckos, man.

517
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,098
That's not even biology!

518
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,685
How could you listen...
What's a frog, Johnny? A short snake?

519
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,063
You want new ideas?
Special new ideas. Okay.

520
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,732
'Cause slow, predictable growth
is so boring.

521
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,068
Let's talk about... Let's talk about
a little company called ChemStar.

522
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,403
Let's talk about this company.
l say go out and buy lots of it.

523
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,241
Buy lots and lots of ChemStar.
You know why? Because it's sparkly.

524
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,993
Everybody knows that
everybody loves sparkly things,

525
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,163
so go out and buy some ChemStar
because it's sparkly!

526
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,915
Okay. Here's fresh new idea
number two.

527
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,543
These companies were so stinky
l had to snip them all away.

528
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,671
Snip! Snip! Snip!
lf you're not good, you got to go!

529
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,131
Okay.
Here's fresh new idea number three!

530
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,259
Look at that.
You got YellowFin and AeroDyne.

531
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,220
What are they doing?
YellowFin and AeroDyne.

532
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,598
They're kissing.
And what does kissing usually lead to?

533
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,687
Marriage! They're getting married!

534
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:02,109
YeIIowFin and AeroDyne sitting in a tree
K- l-S-S-l-N-G

535
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,528
First comes Iove, come on
Then comes marriage...

536
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,780
- Evan. Stop.
- No, don't stop me.

537
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:11,618
l got more. l got more, Tom!
Fresh new idea number four. NeoDyne.

538
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,078
NeoDyne,
that's your biggest holding, right?

539
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,746
6% of your equity is in NeoDyne.

540
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,040
You know what fresh new thinking has
to say about that company?

541
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,709
Pull out! Pull out now. You know why?

542
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,711
Because NeoDyne is about
to have his pants pulled down

543
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,588
and have his underwear exposed.
Know what's in the underwear?

544
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,172
- No.
- Poop.

545
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,466
Poop is in the underwear.

546
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,845
Poop. Nasty doo-doo. Stinky ca-ca.
So here's a recap.

547
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,472
NeoDyne, pants pulled down,
butt exposed,

548
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,850
poo-poo, doo-doo, stinky ca-ca. Okay?

549
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,561
Those are my fresh new...
You take this. You hold on to it.

550
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,605
So those are my new ideas.
Thank you so much!

551
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,483
Raining down!
Fresh ideas and Walla Walla!

552
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,913
- Did you tell them what Kupida said?
- Yeah. l sure did.

553
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,415
Did they like it?

554
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,959
l imagine it was
a lot of fun to watch, honey.

555
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,842
Oh, God. What have l done?
What have l done?

556
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,928
ls everything okay?

557
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,813
Hey, Ev?

558
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,525
Stevens wants to see you. Yeah.

559
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:52,177
- He just kind of flipped out.
- He lost it, man. He lost it.

560
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,347
Look, whatever you heard l said,
it's probably a lot worse.

561
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,226
- l heard you said poop.
- Yeah, l said poop. Twice.

562
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,686
Nice.

563
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,983
l will be back in as much time

564
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,777
as it officially takes to say,
"You're fired," all right?

565
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,341
Evan, what...

566
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,093
Tom, l don't know what...

567
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,680
l'm still trying to process
what just happened in there.

568
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,016
So am l, too. Really, Tom.

569
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,685
How did you know
about all those things?

570
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:46,273
Listen to me, Tom. There's... What?

571
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,483
The two companies
you said were kissing.

572
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,860
AeroDyne and YellowFin.

573
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,696
- What did you mean by that?
- l just...

574
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,449
My brother-in-law
sits on the board ofAeroDyne.

575
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,536
For 18 months, they've been looking for
a partner to offset their overseas debt.

576
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,039
Of the literally
700 companies considered,

577
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,584
there's only one whose financials
actually made sense,

578
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,169
and that's YellowFin.

579
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:11,131
Now, how did you know
about this impending marriage?

580
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,178
- l just...
- Kupida said they might get married.

581
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:20,182
ChemStar.
You said to buy because it was sparkly.

582
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,975
Yes?

583
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,479
- Yeah, okay...
- A data-wire

584
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,734
came in during the meeting.
During the meeting.

585
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,695
"ChemStar finalizes plans to expand

586
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,406
"bauxite excavation
in its New Guinea mine.

587
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,367
"Stock up 18%."

588
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,286
Bauxite.

589
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,662
It's sparkIe gIue.

590
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,081
- Sparkly.
- Sparkly.

591
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,627
NeoDyne. You said to get out.
Do you remember why?

592
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,963
- Do you?
- Yes.

593
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,673
l wrote this down.

594
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:59,554
"Because their pants
were coming down,

595
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,723
"and everyone was going to see
their underwear,

596
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,767
"which was filled with poop."

597
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,811
Yeah, l remember that.

598
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:10,148
Lunchtime today, they were exposed
by the SEC for corporate fraud.

599
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:15,362
Pants pulled down.
And their books? Total poop!

600
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,573
So l'm asking you again.

601
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,409
How did you know all of this?

602
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:28,208
- Are you insider trading?
- No. No, Tom. No way, never.

603
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,793
Then what are you doing?

604
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,464
Where are you getting this information?

605
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,138
- So it's the goo-gaa?
- That's how l go there.

606
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,764
What do you mean you go there?
Go where?

607
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,475
- To where the princesses live.
- Right. The princesses.

608
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,311
That's Kupida and Qwali
and all of them, right?

609
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,646
Qwali's a queen.

610
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,107
Kupida, Mopida and Sopida
are princesses.

611
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,442
- Okay, got you.
- How many times do l have to tell you?

612
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,445
Right. Right.
Okay, let me get this right now.

613
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,907
Now, they tell you things
about companies?

614
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,414
Well, you know what,
l got a couple of other companies

615
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,666
l want you to ask them about.
Do you think they'll be up to that?

616
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,251
You can do it yourself.

617
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,672
l can ask them myself.
l can go there with you?

618
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,591
Yes, it'll be fun.

619
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,720
Okay.

620
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,266
A little more room here.

621
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,392
- Now, l do what now?
- Okay.

622
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,810
- l take the goo-gaa.
- You hold it up to your face.

623
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,189
- Hold it up to my face.
- And rub in little circles.

624
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,609
- Okay, l'm doing it in little circles. Okay.
- Like this.

625
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,279
Now you put it over your head, like this.

626
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,780
Okay. Now what?

627
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:45,702
And you kind of call them in your mind
while you spin around in circles.

628
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,622
Okay. So l call to them in my mind
while l spin in a circle.

629
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,791
- Yeah.
- Okay, l'm spinning. l'm spinning.

630
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,337
Keep spinning. Keep spinning.

631
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,550
l'm spinning around.

632
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,969
Are you calling them in your mind?

633
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,471
Yeah.

634
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,016
Okay. So am l supposed to just
keep spinning and spinning around?

635
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,685
'Cause l'm a tad bit nauseous now.

636
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,232
Okay, we're there!

637
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,495
lsn't it beautiful?

638
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:36,127
Come on, Daddy!
This way, into the forest!

639
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,048
Wow. The princesses
sure live in a beautiful forest.

640
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,759
No, because this part's all burned.

641
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,136
Yes, burned from a big forest fire.

642
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,306
No, Sopida's dragon burnt it all.

643
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,933
Sopida has a dragon?

644
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,061
And if you want to get past her,
you have to sing a song she likes.

645
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,563
l gotta sing a song
to Sopida's dragon, too?

646
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,985
- Hurry. She's coming!
- What? She's coming where?

647
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,112
Sing.

648
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,538
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

649
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,956
Sopida's dragon

650
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,041
You gotta do better than that.

651
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:22,966
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

652
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,759
Try higher.

653
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,763
Sopida's dragon, please let...

654
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,558
- Higher, like a mouse!
- You want me to have an aneurysm?

655
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,562
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

656
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,523
She very hates that.

657
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,484
- l'm with her.
- Try lower, like a frog.

658
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,153
Okay, like a frog.

659
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,991
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

660
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,284
Sopida's dragon...

661
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,662
She very likes that. She fell asleep.
Come on. Let's go.

662
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,081
Now we can go through her cave. Duck!

663
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,751
All right, going into the cave.
That's a big, beautiful cave we're in.

664
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,544
No, it's tiny. Can't you see?

665
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,671
Okay. My eyes are just adjusting still.
That's why...

666
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,881
Jump, Daddy! Jump!

667
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,300
- Jump? Why am l jumping? Okay.
- Jump till you get in!

668
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,676
Okay, you're in.

669
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,637
- Now you're out.
- Okay. What was l in?

670
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,931
- France!
- l was in France?

671
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,601
- Now, we're on the beach.
- Okay. We're on the beach now.

672
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,520
All right. Great! ls it a nice beach here?

673
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,190
Only 'cause mermaids give us
popcorn balls.

674
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:24,569
That's so nice.
Thank you for the popcorn balls!

675
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,784
Oh, no! Someone's coming!
Sopida, no! Sopida, you can't!

676
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,202
Can't what? What happened?
What's going on?

677
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,788
She doesn't trust you!
She's throwing rocks at you!

678
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,373
- Why? Why...
- Duck, Daddy! Duck!

679
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,749
l'm ducking! But what did Daddy do?

680
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,709
Why's she throwing rocks at me?
Don't know what l did.

681
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,294
Up the path!

682
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,546
Go back down!

683
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,591
- This way.
- Okay.

684
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,303
Okay, we made it. There they are.

685
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,431
Hi, Kupida! Hi, Mopida!

686
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,934
- Hey.
- Say something nice.

687
00:39:56,018 --> 00:40:00,105
Hey, Kupida and Mopida, how are you?
Good to see you.

688
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,068
My name is Evan Danielson,
and l'm Olivia's dad.

689
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,612
They already know who you are.

690
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,030
Okay.

691
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,867
lt's good to see you.
You look so nice and pretty,

692
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,663
the two of you.
My, you really outdid yourself today.

693
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,166
l'm here to ask you. l was wondering...

694
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,838
- Are you sure they're...
- Yeah. They're watching.

695
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,508
l was gonna... l have some...

696
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,931
l want to ask about magnesium futures

697
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,893
and their relationship to
Bolivian currency fluctuations.

698
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,150
Specifically, these three companies,

699
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:49,612
La Paz Ore and lron,
and lnternational Mining

700
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,699
and Weston Metallurgy Limited.

701
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,034
Weston Metallurgy.

702
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,622
These three. l was wondering if you...
Can they see them?

703
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,334
l don't want to be in your way.

704
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,962
Okay, what are they doing?
Are they talking?

705
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,130
- Yeah.
- What are they talking about?

706
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,548
They're talking.

707
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,805
Really?

708
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,224
Are you sure?

709
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,185
Okay.

710
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,937
Yes, no, no.

711
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,732
Did they give a reason?

712
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,613
- Because it's fancy?
- That's exactly right, sir. Fancy.

713
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,532
But you're also saying, and this is what
strikes me as contradictory,

714
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,160
that we should abandon all interests
in Weston Metallurgy.

715
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,205
- That's correct.
- Because the boliviano is going to...

716
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,498
What did he say again?

717
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,501
"Be a big, dumb showoff
and fall off its bike."

718
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,087
No. Trike.
And nobody likes a big, dumb showoff.

719
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,173
Well, no offense, son,
but sounds to me like

720
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,342
a load of what you just stepped in.

721
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,011
Well, that's why we brought
Mr. Whitefeather along, right?

722
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,095
What you got, son?

723
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,681
Mr. Rowe, that's funny.

724
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:04,062
The country's entire monetary system
reduced to riding around on a tricycle.

725
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,192
That's a laugh. lt's good to laugh.
lt's good to laugh, man.

726
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,737
But there's a time to be serious.

727
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,574
We're out here in these holy mountains
that we call Rocky.

728
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,119
They're full of predator, prey.

729
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,124
The lion of the mountain
knows when to pounce.

730
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,379
Better watch out, jack-bunny...

731
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,215
- Excuse me, one moment.
- Yeah, okay.

732
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,682
Love the new act, man.

733
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,850
- Fun character.
- Thank you.

734
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,144
You know, there's an old tribal saying,

735
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,064
"lt's not the paint
that makes the warrior."

736
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,526
- What?
- Be well, brother. Be well.

737
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,863
Evan, l ever tell you
about Billy Littlesnake,

738
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,074
a guy l used to go fishing with
in Montana?

739
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,868
l think you spared me that story.

740
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,829
He'd go fishing
where nobody else fished

741
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,748
and always come back with 10 fat trout.

742
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,668
Turned out he was stopping off
at the market and buying them.

743
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,670
l'm not insider trading,
if that's what you're saying.

744
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,257
Whoa, come on. Let's don't go into
those woods. All right?

745
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,719
- There's a lot of bear in those woods.
- Hey, listen. Stop that thing.

746
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,179
lf you're going to talk to me,
don't do that thing you do.

747
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,473
You want me to speak directly?
l can do that.

748
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,891
Then do it.

749
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,353
You want to run with me, Evan,
then run with me.

750
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,189
l accept the challenge. l welcome it.

751
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,944
But if l find out that you're stopping off
at the market and buying your fat trout,

752
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,154
l'm gonna scalp you.

753
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,489
You're gonna scalp me. Literally?

754
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,700
lt's gonna feel literal, yeah.

755
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,536
Nice chatting with you, Johnny.

756
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,748
And you, Evan.

757
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,584
Hey, Ev, good to see you. Okay.

758
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,504
Let me tell you something
about Johnny Whitefeather.

759
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,758
Under all the show,
l'm good at what l do.

760
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,052
l have a gift. l see trends.

761
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,639
l see patterns.
l see things no one else will ever see.

762
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,600
Evan is good, but he's not that good.

763
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,394
l want you to find out
where he's getting his information.

764
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:15,777
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

765
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,528
- She's in a good mood tonight.
- That's great.

766
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,073
We're all in a good mood.
Let's go through the cave then!

767
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,199
Let's get in the cave,
going through the cave.

768
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,825
Ducking down!
lt's a little above my head in the cave.

769
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,870
And now we're coming out in France.
We're in France!

770
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,082
All right.
And now we're back on the beach again.

771
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,292
On the wonderful beach
with Kupida and Mopida.

772
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,128
Hello, Kupida and Mopida!
How are the princesses today?

773
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,547
- They're good.
- They're good. That's great.

774
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,174
That's great.
Hold on to this for a second, honey.

775
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,258
- Yeah.
- Okay, now.

776
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,927
Ladies, l want to talk to you
about something.

777
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,013
First, let me tell you that those gowns
you're wearing look exquisite.

778
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,765
They look exquisite, ladies.

779
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,645
l'll just go right out and say it.
Am l looking in the right direction here?

780
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,021
- Yeah.
- Okay.

781
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,692
l have a potential client
who is in the medical field

782
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,859
and he has a particular company.

783
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,778
He was wondering if
he should hold on to that company.

784
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,531
And l was wondering if you ladies
had any feelings about that.

785
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,617
The company is called VallaTech.

786
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,036
l've just been hearing
so many incredible things about it.

787
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,789
We were just wondering
what you princesses thought.

788
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,001
- What do they think?
- Maybe.

789
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,714
Maybe?

790
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:23,219
Because Kupida very liked it,
and Mopida very hated it.

791
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,679
Okay, so, now what do we do?

792
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:29,976
lf they disagree, we have to see Qwali,
but she's at her mountain castle.

793
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,105
Okay. Well,
where's the mountain castle?

794
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,982
There.

795
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,405
Now, does Qwali have to be out
by this bridge in front of my building,

796
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,532
all these people all over the place,
where everybody can see us?

797
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,075
We are not by a bridge.

798
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,869
We're at the bottom of
Qwali's mountain!

799
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,079
And there's no one here
except you and me,

800
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,207
and maybe Qwali,
if she likes the way you dance.

801
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,126
Dance? l have to dance for Qwali, too?

802
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,255
Yeah. Because there's a ball tonight,
and she has to see who is the best king.

803
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,924
And she will not talk until she does.

804
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:07,930
Okay. Well, let's do a little dance
for Qwali, then.

805
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,809
- Hey, Evan.
- Hey, what's going on, man?

806
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,019
How are you...

807
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,816
- Okay. How's that?
- Horrible.

808
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,986
You have to get on that thing,
so she can see you.

809
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,614
Hey, look. l'm not getting up
on the stage, all right?

810
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,324
She won't talk to you.

811
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,534
Okay, l'm gonna go get up on the stage.

812
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,257
Oh, come on! She can't see that!
She's way, way up there.

813
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,260
Hey, all right, okay. Take it easy here.

814
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,850
More! Bigger!

815
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,604
Like that? Like this? No? Yes?

816
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,482
To the beat! Can't you hear the music?

817
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,609
To the beat? l don't hear the beat.

818
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,735
Check it out.

819
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,571
l hear the snickers.

820
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,242
lt's spinning music!

821
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,704
- Spinning, with your arms out!
- You mean like a waltz?

822
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,084
Like a waltz you're talking about. Okay.

823
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,953
- That's the best l could do.
- No, it was good. She liked it.

824
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,372
You can go to the ball!

825
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,291
Okay, all right.

826
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,960
Qwali said it was good.
l can go to the ball.

827
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:06,132
Now, did you ask Qwali
how she feels about VallaTech?

828
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,428
Bottom line, sir,
is that VallaTech is stuck up

829
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,471
and doesn't play nice with others.
l say we cut it out.

830
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,639
- Really?
- Yeah.

831
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,182
l know this sounds a little unorthodox,

832
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,559
but here's something else
you need to know.

833
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,811
lt has a big butt?

834
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,147
A big ol' butt with a shelf on it.

835
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,650
l think if you look at DarbaCon's
bloated end-of-the-year rollover...

836
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,236
...you'll see it has pretty hair
and all the boys are looking at it.

837
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,323
Well, if he said it wets the bed,
then it wets the bed.

838
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,242
What else did he say?

839
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,495
This little company goes
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

840
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,625
- Did you say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee"?
- Yes. All the way home.

841
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,835
- And people are buying that?
- By the millions.

842
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,671
lcky, icky, icky. Gross. Yucky.

843
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,382
Rose, is Evan seeing a psychic?

844
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,217
Not that l'm aware of.

845
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,886
lt's fizzy like a soda pop.

846
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,513
- ls he a psychic?
- No, l don't believe he is.

847
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,641
lt's old enough to start wearing makeup.

848
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,101
"Ready for makeup." You feeling this?

849
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,730
He says your funds are mature,
and now it's time to start diversifying.

850
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,108
Specifically, for A.l.,
what l'm thinking is Argenteeny Pinkini.

851
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,110
- l'm feeling that.
- Hey, l want some of that.

852
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,278
Back off, dawg. lt's mine.

853
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,490
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! There's enough
lip gloss to go around for everybody.

854
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:17,578
Agroco is a crybaby who always
goes running to Mommy.

855
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,538
- That's your analysis.
- Yes, it is.

856
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,958
- And you recommend l...
- Sell.

857
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,418
- Sell the crybaby.
- Sell the crybaby.

858
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,962
ls this some kind ofjoke, Tom?

859
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,422
- No, Carl. lt's not.
- Because it seems...

860
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,675
- l know, a little different.
- A little?

861
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,052
Why don't we hear
what Mr. Whitefeather has to say?

862
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,762
Yes. Johnny, would you like to

863
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:39,350
toss some spear at some tatonka,
or cast some venison into the potlatch?

864
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,062
No, l wouldn't.
l'd like to take this seriously.

865
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,398
There's a great deal of money
at stake here, Mr. Simons.

866
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,776
l think that you should move forward
on Agroco, aggressively.

867
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,486
lncrease your holdings.

868
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,613
And a gentleman
by the name of Dante D'Enzo

869
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:58,077
happens to concur with my position.
His company, D.D.E. lnvestments,

870
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:02,039
is looking to increase
their holdings by 25%.

871
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,627
So l think if we're going to make a move,
we have to do it rather quickly.

872
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,255
lf you're ready, l'm ready.
Let's make some money.

873
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,092
That's my "venison."

874
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,303
Evan? Your thoughts?

875
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,103
Well, l think that's interesting.
l think that's very interesting.

876
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,564
Very, very, very interesting

877
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,859
that Dante D'Enzo would say in
and l would say out.

878
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,736
That's interesting, l think.

879
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,697
What l'm going to do now
is l'm gonna go to the restroom,

880
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,158
and l'm gonna think this through,
and l'm gonna re-crunch some numbers

881
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,285
and get right back to you, gentlemen.
Excuse me.

882
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,579
So...

883
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,383
These look great.

884
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,968
Evan?

885
00:50:56,053 --> 00:51:01,098
- Hey. Hey. What are you doing here?
- Flyers for Saturday. The Fall Sing.

886
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,808
We're on lunch,
so l'm just dropping them off.

887
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,269
- Hey, how you doing? l'm Rick.
- Rick.

888
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,146
Rick's son, Henry, is in kindergarten.

889
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,399
Yeah, so you're Rick.
You're the sculpture, sculptor.

890
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,319
l saw your little thing that you did
at the Comerica building.

891
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,571
- Yeah.
- Very metallic and pointy.

892
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,073
And unfairly criticized, l might add.

893
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,533
Look, l got some last-minute
parenting thing l gotta do with Olivia.

894
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,702
Nice meeting you, Rick.

895
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,662
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt. lt's Mr. Danielson.

896
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,830
- Can l talk to Olivia for one second?
- Sure.

897
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,624
l'll be brief. Olivia,
come talk to Daddy, please?

898
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,750
Hi, everybody.

899
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,003
l have some quick questions for Qwali
about Agroco. Where should we go?

900
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,463
Come on. Come on. Come on.

901
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,257
Okay. Did you bring the goo-gaa?
All right. Okay.

902
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,220
l knew you would. Okay, perfect, perfect,
perfect. Blanket up. Rub in fast circles.

903
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,598
l smell something burning.
lt's Sopida's dragon! Here she is!

904
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,434
Mopida and Kupida! Good to see you!
Time to dance!

905
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,322
- That's it.
- What are they doing?

906
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,574
l have no idea.

907
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:04,161
- She's really sure?
- And she says you agree with her.

908
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,080
- l do?
- Don't you?

909
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,501
- Yeah, l guess l do, sort of.
- Okay.

910
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,961
Okay, give me a high five.

911
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,129
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

912
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,464
Put this back in. All right, tell no one!

913
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:22,680
So you're saying that Dante D'Enzo
is totally wrong on this.

914
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,806
Yes.

915
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,183
And your inner child says that

916
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,478
we should completely
pull out ofAgroco.

917
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,313
Yes.

918
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,359
Okay. l think l'm going to go with

919
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,154
what Mr. Whitefeather
has put together here.

920
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,906
lt seems better.

921
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:46,328
- l am going to have the venison.
- lt's a savory meat.

922
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,834
Doctor's office.

923
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,629
l know you say Qwali's never wrong,
but l think we both were this time.

924
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,758
lfjust Mopida says it
orjust Kupida says it,

925
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:05,347
it could be wrong.
But if Qwali says it, it's never wrong.

926
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,851
Well, l think
she kind of was wrong this time.

927
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,145
- She was not.
- Yes, she was.

928
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,646
- Was not.
- Yes, she was.

929
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,148
Not.

930
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,026
Actually, not.

931
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,653
Ha, ha, you're just trying to get me
to say "was."

932
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,864
No, she really wasn't wrong.

933
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,325
D'Enzo pulled out ofAgroco,
which is down 12%.

934
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,911
"Agroco cries foul,
hides behind parent company."

935
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,540
Crybaby runs to Mommy.

936
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,340
- How are you doing this?
- lt's easy.

937
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,800
You just overlap them
and it makes a pyramid.

938
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,806
Olivia? We're ready for you, sweetie.
Time for your shot.

939
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,021
You did a really good job in there.
l'm really proud of you.

940
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,649
For that, we're gonna get
a special ice cream treat.

941
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,193
- l cried, though.
- But you did good.

942
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,819
You see, when l was your age
l had to get a shot,

943
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,864
l was running, screaming,
"Don't stab me! Don't stab me!"

944
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,532
No, you wouldn't.

945
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,910
"Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!"

946
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,120
How you doing, sir? What can l get you?

947
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,997
Can we get two juice bars?

948
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,795
- So, who wants pancakes for dinner?
- l do.

949
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,264
Yeah, that's what l say.

950
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,443
No, we're not going to pour it yet.

951
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,988
Put butter on it.
Gotta put a small amount of butter.

952
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,785
- You put too much butter.
- No, that's enough.

953
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,506
Looks like Sopida's dragon
got to this one.

954
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,092
- Hey!
- That's gonna be your stack.

955
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,387
You keep going here
and l'll go set up the restaurant.

956
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,389
The restaurant? What restaurant?

957
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,894
- Allow me to tell you the specials.
- Please do.

958
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,479
Pancakes.

959
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:23,402
We have kind of burnt pancakes
and really burnt pancakes.

960
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,154
Okay, well, how much for the regular?

961
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:30,034
- Let me see. $3,000.
- And how much for the kind of burnt?

962
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,536
- Forty-seven cents.
- Okay, let me have the kind of burnts.

963
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,330
Let me have two kind of burnts, please.

964
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,041
Perfect. Now do we have
any condiments or anything like...

965
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,250
What do you mean by that?

966
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,296
You know, like syrup or some honey
or some jelly or some...

967
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,258
Anything that might cut the taste a bit.

968
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,015
Ketchup.

969
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:59,938
Chocolate syrup. Hot sauce.
And mustard.

970
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,525
You know, l would have just went with
chocolate sauce or honey or...

971
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,904
- Don't worry, it's yummier this way.
- But ketchup is...

972
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,490
Wow. That's enough ketchup.

973
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:15,871
- Now would you like chocolate sauce?
- Well, l guess so, yeah.

974
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,041
- You probably would prefer it.
- Yeah, wow.

975
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,126
Yeah, let's put a lot on.

976
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,921
Mustard.

977
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,716
Excellent choice.
Brown and yellow match perfectly.

978
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,886
l think it's gonna add
some mystery to the dish.

979
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,972
Don't eat it yet. We got the hot sauce.

980
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,144
Hey, where...
What happened to the pancakes?

981
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,523
There. Perfect.

982
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,650
l think we should say our grace and eat.

983
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,984
- Okay.
- Okay.

984
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,029
- So, you pray with Daddy now.
- Okay.

985
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,240
- Dear Lord.
- Dear Lord.

986
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,743
- Please protect my daddy's throat.
- Please protect my daddy's throat.

987
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:59,957
- He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.
- He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.

988
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,500
- Amen.
- Amen.

989
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,586
- And now l'm going to dig in.
- Yeah, dig in.

990
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:10,259
And l think it's time
to ingest this pancake and be a good...

991
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,177
Hey, look, it's Sopida.

992
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,389
She's gone.

993
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,143
That's the best pancake
l ever had in my life!

994
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,688
- Can l please see the bill?
- Yeah, the bill?

995
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,024
$400,000?
You must be out your mind, woman!

996
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,485
You trying to get... Tell you what!
Come back here now! Come back here!

997
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,654
Almost got you! Oh, my God!

998
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,614
Yeah, that's a good one, too.

999
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,533
Hold on, wait, wait, wait,
don't hog the picture now.

1000
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,826
You're gonna hog the picture.

1001
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,329
Wait, the picture's not right
unless Daddy's in the picture.

1002
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,624
That's magic! Come on, it's late.
Okay, come on.

1003
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,711
Daddy?

1004
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,590
l'm scared about
the Fall Sing on Saturday.

1005
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,050
What are you afraid of? Your mother
told me you were excited about it.

1006
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:56,388
Well, everybody has a solo
and mine is on the last song.

1007
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:01,935
And l start it, so if l mess up,
the whole entire song is wrecked.

1008
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,812
What makes you think
you're gonna mess up?

1009
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:04,980
l can't sing.

1010
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,065
- What do you mean you can't sing?
- l can't.

1011
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,902
Yes, you can.
Where's the song you're gonna sing?

1012
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,778
Let me see.

1013
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,655
l'll put it to the right page.

1014
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,990
- What song is it?
- Here, this page.

1015
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,617
All right, All You Need ls Love.

1016
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,118
Okay, that's a good one.
That's The Beatles.

1017
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,286
Tell you what, here's what you do.

1018
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,580
Come over here.
l'm going to get you onstage here.

1019
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,165
- This is the stage.
- l thought you'd play the part.

1020
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,167
No, you're gonna get on stage
and l'm gonna be in the audience.

1021
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,002
This is going to be
just like you're at the play.

1022
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,004
And all the people in the audience
all came to see the show.

1023
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,215
We're all like, "This is great.
Well, l can't wait to see the show.

1024
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,842
"Who's in the show? Well, who's that?
l wonder if she can sing."

1025
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,511
You've got to get ready now.
You got to get ready,

1026
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,346
see, 'cause everybody's watching,
everybody's watching.

1027
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,847
And you're going to say...

1028
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,183
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1029
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,851
- l can't.
- Yes, you can!

1030
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,855
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1031
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,023
Here's how you're singing it.

1032
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,567
You say it and then you take
the last word and just stretch it out.

1033
00:58:50,652 --> 00:59:03,247
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1034
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,915
All right, now, here's the second line.

1035
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:09,962
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1036
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,213
And we go higher now.

1037
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:15,425
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1038
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,010
A little higher though. Higher. Higher.

1039
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,930
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1040
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,224
My baby sounds like Minnie Riperton!

1041
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,017
Okay, let's drop it lower.
Let's do it like a frog.

1042
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,936
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1043
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,522
Daddy, you're just doing
what l did to you.

1044
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,983
Yeah, that's right. l'm doing
what you did to me. Now let's try it.

1045
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:35,237
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

1046
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,322
See, you're doing it.
Okay, here's the next one.

1047
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,448
There's nothing you can say

1048
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,660
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game
It's easy

1049
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,705
There's nothing you can say
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game

1050
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:52,087
It's easy

1051
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,506
That's it! That's it! You're singing!

1052
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,511
Take a bow! She was wonderful!

1053
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,097
- You're going to the top!
- Oh, stop.

1054
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,975
She's going to the top!

1055
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,063
"They finish reading. Olivia's mother
gives her a kiss and says,

1056
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:14,443
"'You know, you really wear me out,
but l love you anyway.'

1057
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:18,614
"Olivia gives her a kiss back and says,
'l love you anyway, too."'

1058
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,659
There you go, sleepyhead.

1059
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,123
Hey!

1060
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,377
We didn't talk to the princesses tonight.

1061
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,964
Yeah, you know what, we didn't,
but that's okay.

1062
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,132
lt's quite all right.

1063
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:41,303
Well, maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

1064
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,722
Really? On my own?

1065
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,683
Qwali says she trusts you now.

1066
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,146
That's very nice of Qwali.

1067
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,191
Tell Qwali thanks a lot.
That means a lot to me.

1068
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,735
Or l could tell her myself.

1069
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,903
You want me to?

1070
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,575
Hey, you want me to?

1071
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,829
Did you fall asleep that quick?

1072
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,905
l send you out to gather
pertinent information.

1073
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,073
You come back with this.

1074
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:46,034
But this is all he does.
He just hangs out with his daughter.

1075
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,453
They sing and they dance
and they laugh.

1076
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,374
They're playing with a blanket.

1077
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,793
The two of them with their faces buried

1078
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,338
in a blanket.

1079
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,135
The blanket.

1080
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:09,057
- It's a wakaIyapi.
- Yeah.

1081
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,563
He's a sharp cat. He is a razor cat!

1082
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,774
- Say that again?
- WakaIyapi.

1083
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,527
A tapestry. A weave.

1084
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,780
lt's how you access a higher eye.

1085
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,868
My people believe it's the way
to achieve closeness to the Great Spirit.

1086
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,912
- Who are you calling?
- You'll see.

1087
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,166
The entire Denver financial community
is talking about you.

1088
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,209
But as your very first client ever,

1089
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,087
you owe it to me to tell me
what the hell is going on.

1090
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,881
l told you, Maggie, l'm just listening.

1091
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,342
To the little voice that whispers to you.
Yeah, right.

1092
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,511
Why don't you just tell her your secret?

1093
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:52,184
- Hi. Johnny Whitefeather.
- l'm Margaret Johnson.

1094
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,437
Evan? Tell her the truth.

1095
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,404
Okay, Maggie, here's the truth.
l have a six-year-old daughter.

1096
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,365
Now, she has what you would
have to call a magic blanket.

1097
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,367
Now, with this blanket,
l can be taken and be transported

1098
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,952
to a mystical, magical place

1099
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,206
where l meet with three
invisible princesses and one queen.

1100
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,250
lncidentally, they all have
remarkable insight to investing,

1101
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,128
except for one,
who mostly wants to throw rocks at me

1102
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,380
and have me burned up by her dragon.

1103
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,884
A securities blanket.

1104
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:30,889
Fine, fine. Keep your secret.
Just keep me in the black.

1105
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,977
l can get a blanket.

1106
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,732
l can. And l'm going to get one.

1107
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,945
l need to see you guys
in my office, please.

1108
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:48,323
You may have noticed l've been doing
things a little differently this past week,

1109
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,701
letting the two of you go head-to-head
a bit more than usual.

1110
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:56,164
And l know you've probably
heard the rumor, and it's true.

1111
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,709
There's an offer on the table,
and it's big.

1112
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,337
lt's the kind of out l've been looking for.

1113
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:08,593
But the buyer wants to make sure that
there's someone worthy to, well,

1114
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,305
to take this office. So...

1115
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,350
Here we go.

1116
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:20,272
Gentlemen, this is
Mr. Pratt of D.D.E. lnvestments.

1117
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,650
- You're Frederick Pratt.
- Yes. Yes, l am. Excuse me.

1118
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,528
- Yes, sir.
- That's the suitor? Dante D'Enzo?

1119
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,530
- He's ready for you.
- Hello there.

1120
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,992
Mr. D'Enzo.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.

1121
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,620
Thank you. Have a seat, gentIemen.
This won't take Iong.

1122
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,039
l assume that Tom
has aIready toId you about...

1123
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,754
- Mr. DanieIson, everything okay?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

1124
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,215
Just had to kill the phone. lt's dead now.

1125
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,968
Okay, l assume Tom
had aIready toId you that

1126
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,346
he's decided to throw away
the rest of his Iife pIaying goIf.

1127
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:58,018
Which means one of you is going to be
running the western division of D.D.E.

1128
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:01,229
Now, you won't be surprised to know
that I've been reviewing your fiIes,

1129
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:05,400
and, frankIy, you're both
appIying quite unorthodox methods.

1130
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:09,404
And I don't reaIIy care, as Iong as you
get resuIts, which you seem to be doing.

1131
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,156
But, unfortunateIy, gentIemen,

1132
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,159
there's onIy one chair
behind the big desk.

1133
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:17,245
So I have a decision to make,
and I'II be stopping in Denver

1134
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,998
on my way back from Beijing tomorrow
to make that decision.

1135
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,084
In the meantime,
you have approximateIy 17 hours

1136
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,296
to suss out what Mr. Pratt
is about to hand you.

1137
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,715
And as far as preparation is concerned,

1138
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,676
I'II just share with you
the best advice that l ever heard...

1139
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,101
No, that's not the advice.

1140
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,772
The advice is, if I had eight hours
to chop down a tree,

1141
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:47,067
I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.

1142
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,444
- Abraham Lincoln.
- You read my book.

1143
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,030
- Three times, sir.
- lt wasn't clear the first time?

1144
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,491
No, that's not what l meant.

1145
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,285
I think I know what you meant,
Mr. Danielson.

1146
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,955
AII right, gentIemen,
it's 2:00 a.m. in Beijing.

1147
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,957
Do you know where your ax is?

1148
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,209
I'II see you tomorrow.
May the best man win.

1149
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,173
These are a few of the strategies
Mr. D'Enzo is considering.

1150
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:14,302
We will require your most
detailed analysis and recommendations.

1151
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,054
l'll leave you with Mr. Pratt.

1152
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,934
Okay, page one.

1153
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:32,028
Olivia! Hey! Olivia!

1154
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,699
Big night! Big, big night tonight! Hey!
Where are you?

1155
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,660
l want to talk to princesses
and Qwali and all your friends!

1156
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,662
Got a lot of questions!
Get to stay up late!

1157
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:44,416
Hey, Olivia! Hey! Where are you?

1158
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,502
Graciella, where is she? You picked
her up from school, didn't you?

1159
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:50,088
Yes, señor. Then Mrs. Trish came
and took her away.

1160
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,091
- What? When?
- About one hour ago.

1161
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,093
Now, why would she do that
without calling me?

1162
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,346
You know why? Because
l took the battery out of my phone.

1163
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,850
Hey, listen!
Hey, did Olivia leave that little blanket?

1164
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,686
- The goo-gaa?
- Let me check, okay, señor?

1165
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,104
- Hello!
- Trish! Hey!

1166
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:07,731
Evan, where are you?

1167
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:11,192
Olivia called you, like, five times,
then she got upset and called me.

1168
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,777
And then l had to leave the pledge drive
to make sure...

1169
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,362
lt's a long story.
l took the battery out of my phone.

1170
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,031
But, listen, you'll never guess
who l was just talking to.

1171
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,991
Not now, Evan. l'm at the party.

1172
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,035
- The party? What party?
- Ella's party.

1173
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,829
- Which you obviously forgot about.
- Forgot it. Forgot all about the party.

1174
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:25,415
Okay, listen, tell Olivia l'm gonna be
there in 20 minutes to pick her up.

1175
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:26,666
Why? I'm aIready here.

1176
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,877
Look, you did your week.
l'll just stay here

1177
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,837
and take her to Ella's for the sleepover.

1178
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:34,299
Sleepover! No, no, no. l don't know if
a sleepover works for me tonight, Trish.

1179
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,969
l actually need Olivia here with me.
Here with me and her blanket, yes.

1180
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,137
Her what?

1181
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,597
Listen, l know this is going to sound
a little crazy.

1182
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,599
l know this is going to sound a little wild,

1183
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,476
but the fact of the matter is...

1184
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:48,938
l need... l need the goo-gaa.

1185
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,067
l don't have a response for that, Evan.

1186
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,985
- No, Trish, Iisten.
- l'm hanging up now.

1187
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,321
- Bye.
- No, no, no, Trish, Trish, Trish!

1188
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,129
Okay, if you're here
for EIIa's birthday party,

1189
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:16,466
make your way to the orange sIide
and into the Kidz Only zone

1190
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,635
for some Fo Fo FiggIey fun.

1191
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,011
Olivia!

1192
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:24,390
- Trish, you want me...
- No, l'll deal with this.

1193
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,977
Olivia!

1194
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:31,439
Evan, what is going on?
What are you doing here?

1195
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,274
l know, l know. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

1196
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,026
Look, where did she go just now?

1197
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,445
She went into the Kidz Only room.
What is this, Evan?

1198
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,905
Nothing. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

1199
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,657
- Hey. How we doing over here?
- What's going on? How you?

1200
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:41,866
l'm good.

1201
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,452
Trish, do you mind helping Lori
with the cake for me?

1202
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,620
Yeah, help Lori with the cake,

1203
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,372
and l'm gonna do
what l was going to do.

1204
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,291
- lt's my daughter's seventh birthday!
- Congratulations.

1205
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,501
You're going to think this is hilarious,

1206
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,920
but l got to go get Olivia's blanket for,
like, six hours.

1207
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,631
- You need her blanket.
- Yes, l need her blanket.

1208
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,967
l see, so that's what you're here for,
to cause a scene.

1209
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:00,426
l'm not trying to cause a scene at all.

1210
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,804
You're making it a scene by stopping
me from going to get the blanket.

1211
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,223
You should just let me go get the
blanket, and there's no scene at all.

1212
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,850
- Let me talk to you for a second.
- What's the problem?

1213
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,310
Now we've all seen what happens
when you take Liv's blanket, right?

1214
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,397
- Okay, that's duly noted.
- And now is not the time nor place for it.

1215
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,316
Let me explain something to you.
Let me say something.

1216
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,277
What l'm going to do
is going to take all of 10 seconds.

1217
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,154
l'm gonna get the blanket,
and l'm going to be gone.

1218
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,489
And that's the end of the deal,
you know what l'm saying, John?

1219
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,284
Let me do my thing.
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1220
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,368
John...

1221
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,912
Hey, what's up
with the football block, man?

1222
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,707
- Hey, be cool.
- You be cool, okay?

1223
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:34,043
l am being cool. l just need the goo-gaa!

1224
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,880
Okay, when a grown man says
"goo-gaa," it's time to go.

1225
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,256
Okay, all right.

1226
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,136
Okay, all right. lt's cool. All right.
You made your point.

1227
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,764
You got it. You gotta be cool.

1228
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,393
l'll tell her you said happy birthday.
Yeah.

1229
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,313
She'll be touched.

1230
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,697
Hey, John. ls everything okay?

1231
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,575
- l took care of it. He's gone.
- What did you say?

1232
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,744
Don't worry about it.
l put my foot down, okay?

1233
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:10,079
That's the last we're gonna see
of Evan today.

1234
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,809
You wanna play, boy? Man, stop.
No, you didn't.

1235
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:35,563
Hey, little brother. Hey, brother.
Hey, my man. Hey, little man.

1236
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,399
Hey, why don't you do me a favor?
l want you to go into the Kidz Only room

1237
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,485
and talk to Olivia Danielson and tell her
her dad's out here.

1238
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:43,071
l'm gonna give you $20. Go in there
and tell her that her dad's out here

1239
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,406
- and needs the goo-gaa.
- A what?

1240
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,784
lt's a goo-gaa. lt's a pet name for
the blanket. l need the blanket.

1241
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:50,286
Just go in, tell Olivia Danielson
her dad's out here and get the blanket.

1242
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,829

1243
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,332
- l'll take $50, my brother.
-50?

1244
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:58,294
Or you can take your grown self up there
and get the goo-gaa on your own.

1245
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,173
Hey, stop it! l'm not in here
to play with you kids. Stop it!

1246
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,093
Look, man, l haven't been to the
cash machine. All l got is $26 in here.

1247
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,637
See, that's more than half of $50.

1248
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:11,140
And l got this.

1249
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,185
A Peet's Coffee card.
l got $15 worth of credit on it.

1250
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,895
You know how much coffee
you can get for $15?

1251
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,398
You drink that coffee, you just keep
playing and playing and playing!

1252
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,650
- l'm a kid. l don't drink coffee.
- They got other things.

1253
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:23,778
They got cookies and cakes and scones.
You like scones?

1254
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,364
Scones? What do l look like,
the Queen of England?

1255
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:29,284
Hey, you stop that right now!
l'm not here to play with you!

1256
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,744
- l'm talking to this child!
- That's a nice Rollie.

1257
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,830
Yes, that is a nice Rollie,
and you just back on up.

1258
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:36,291
You're not getting my Rollie.
Come on, man. This is $26.

1259
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:40,336
$26, a Peet's Coffee card. That's some
easy money. You want it or not?

1260
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,255
Not. Get this fool!

1261
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,550
Hey, stop it right now!

1262
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,889
Grandfather, will you bless the blanket?

1263
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,737
Here's the... This guy?

1264
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,865
The blanket works best
through the innocence of a child.

1265
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,786
Okay. Good. Thank you.

1266
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,500
- lndigo! Wake up, buddy. Hey! Hey!
- What? What?

1267
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,252
Wake up.
You're going on a vision quest.

1268
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,922
- l don't wanna. l'm tired.
- Well, you're gonna.

1269

Your new tribal name, Red Bull.

1270
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:35,183
Okay, l got this. l can do this.

1271
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,517
l'm thinking it through,
and l'm letting it flow.

1272
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,436
And l can do this,
and l do not need the goo-gaa.

1273
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,689
Let it flow, Evan. Just let it flow.

1274
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,276
Okay, l know this company. Yes.
l don't know this company. No.

1275
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,280
l don't need the goo-gaa,

1276
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,823
l don't need the goo-gaa,
'cause this is what l do.

1277
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:56,037
Look at that. All right, how you feel?
How you feel?

1278
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:58,331
- l'm still tired.
- Yeah, you're still tired? Get up there.

1279
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,582
Hey, what is this?

1280
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:04,462
The relationship of this currency
to this company five years out.

1281
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:09,801
Maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

1282
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,430
This is a wakalyapi, okay?

1283
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,059
Star blanket.
l need you to feel the magic.

goo-gaa. Here's my goo-gaa. Okay?

1316
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:37,318
- Hey, Ella. How are you?
- Why are you stealing our blankets?

1317
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:38,486
l'm not stealing them.

1318
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,321
l'm taking them to get them cleaned,
because they're dirty.

1319
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:42,365
You go back to sleep. Night-night.

1324
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:00,675
l'm taking the blankets
to get them cleaned.

1325
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,009
You go back to bed.
You're having a bad dream.

1326
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,552
- This is my sister's blanket.
- Go back to bed.

1327
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:04,679
Be a good little boy,
and go back to bed now.

1328

- No, give it.

For God's sake, Evan!
Have you any dignity at all?

- Yes, l do!

1335
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:27,368
- And now they're up.
- Hey, you are stealing our blankets.

1336
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,537
See? Now you messed with my little girl.

Everybody calm down! Calm down!

Okay, all right. Here you go.

01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:38,879
Here's your blanket! l just want this one!
Okay, it's all good now.

1341
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,881
- You're not taking no blanket!
- l paid for this blanket!

1342
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,217
- l don't care what you paid for!
- Wait, wait. lt's little Evan.

1343
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:45,052
Now you want to whisper? No, no.

1344
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,304
- Come on, man!
- No.

1345
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,390
- Come on, man.
- Get out.

1346
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,268
lt's okay, baby. Will!

1347
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,859
This blanket is mine! lt's mine!

1348
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:04,196
l'm calling Trish.
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

1349
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,657
Evan, get help. Get help!

1350
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,409
l don't need help.
What l need is my blanket!

1351
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:12,037
- Man, you're crazy!
- l am not crazy! l want my goo-gaa!

1352
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,832
l want my goo-gaa!

1353
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,586
- John! John! This is important!
- l'm calling the police!

1354
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,713
l want my goo-gaa! l want my goo-gaa!

1355
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,256
John, come on, man,
this is life and death!

1356
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,259
We're gonna go back to bed.
Everybody, back to bed.

1357
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:39,857
Yeah, man!

1358
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,651
Johnny!

1359
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,946
Come inside before the neighbors
call the fire department again!

1360
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,491
Hey, Cheryl! We're down here working!

1361
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:51,243
You think your new nose
just crawled on your face?

1362
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:55,748
- What's the next one?
- John!

1363
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:56,832
Yeah.

1364
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,960
- l'm sorry. Look...
- What's up, bro?

1365
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,797
Listen, it's getting late.

1366
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,300
l think we need
to rethink this blanket strategy.

1367
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:09,011
- You doubting the wakalyapi?
- No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1368
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:12,014
So, you are saying that
my son's not a seer?

1369
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:16,977
- ls that what you are saying?
- l see beyond, like the great salmon!

1370
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,188
With wings! That flies!

1371
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:20,898
You got tiny eyes, man.

1372
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,901
- You got the eyes of a salamander.
- What?

1373
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,403
You say my kid's not a seer?
He's a Whitefeather!

1374
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,864
Come here, boy! Get over here!

1375
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,283
AampCo! What you feeling
about AampCo?

1376
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,952
AampCo is tight!

1377
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:36,163
- AampCo is tight! Write that down!
- Write that down!

1378
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,374
No, Johnny,
l'm not gonna write it down, okay?

1379
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:41,168
l can't go to Dante D'Enzo and say,
"AampCo is tight

1380
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,087
"because we're listening
to the Great Winged Salmon,

1381
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:46,507
"who's actually a 10-year-old boy
with a $6,000 blanket,

1382
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:48,843
"who's hopped up on Red Bull!"

1383
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:54,765
Listen to me, Johnny.
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

1384
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,852
We can't blow this thing.
You are better than this.

1385
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,813
- Tell him he's out.
- You're out!

1386
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:03,524
- What?
- Tell him he's out of the tribe.

1387
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:05,943
- You're out of the tribe!
- l'm out of the tribe?

1388
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:10,197
You're out of the tribe, because
you're blind to the poetry of smoke!

1389
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,365
Blind to the poetry of...

1390
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:14,535
Stop it! Just zip it! Zip it!
You are a crazy little kid!

1391
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:17,663
And you, you're a liar! l'm out?

1392
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:22,501
Good. Wrap it up! l have never been
so happy to be out, okay?

1393
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:26,630
l didn't go to business school for this!
l graduated from Stanford with an MBA!

1394
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,800
And they don't just give
those things away, Whitefeather!

1395
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:33,846
- Get him.
- Back off, you little freak!

1396
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,640
Get some sleep!

1397
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:40,519
Hey, Trish, it's me!

1398
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:48,527
- Trish, l really need to see her.
- No, no. l just now got her to sleep.

1399
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,779
And with tonight,
and singing tomorrow...

1400
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,490
- Please. Please, Trish.
- She just...

1401
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:57,578
Okay.

1402
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,413
Thank you.

1403
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,630
Can you please leave?

1404
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:13,385
Hey, Liv, l'm sorry about
what happened at the sleepover.

1405
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,179
l want you to go.

1406
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,933
About the concert...

1407
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,268
l'm not going to be able to
come to the concert,

1408
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,395
because it's at the same time
as a meeting l have to...

1409
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,022
l don't want you there.

1410
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,819
Okay. l understand.

1411
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,782
l just want you to know that
l really did want to go.

1412
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:37,952
l don't care. Don't come.

1413
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,704
l won't.

1414
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,415
l won't because you don't want me to.

1415
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:46,502
But...

1416
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:49,213
Liv, l really have to go to this meeting.

1417
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:52,716
lt's really important. lt's a really
important meeting, and l really need...

1418
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:16,198
Promise l'll get it right back to you.
Night-night.

1419
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,215
lt's okay. She's fine. She gave it to me.

1420
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,011
- What?
- She told me, Evan.

1421
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,138
- Everything.
- Okay, well, then you understand.

1422
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,598
No, l don't understand.

1423
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,018
l mean, do you honestly believe that
that blanket

1424
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,687
has something to do
with everything that's been going on?

1425
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:49,648
Look, l don't know what's happening.
l know something's happening.

1426
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,067
l need for it to happen
one more time tonight.

1427
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:55,112
So, now we're back to what you need.

1428
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:56,780
Hey, Trish, what do you want me to do?

1429
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,158
Blow off an opportunity
l've been waiting for since grad school

1430
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:00,534
and lose my job?

1431
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:06,623
Evan, you have two jobs,
and one of those jobs is being a father.

1432
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,916
And she needs to know

1433
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:11,211
that you care as much about that job
as you do the other.

1434
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,590
- l do. Of course l do.
- Then leave the blanket.

1435
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:20,804
l can't. Not tonight, l can't.

1436
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:23,640
l don't expect you to understand.

1437
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,352
How you doing, Feather Man?
Pretty good, brother. How you doing?

1438
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:36,398
Not so bad. A little amped, a little tired.
Ain't nothing but a thing.

1439
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,442
How about another Red Bull?
Wouldn't say no to that.

1440
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,577
- Good luck, Johnny.
- Luck is for losers.

1441
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:38,293
Good. Here we are.
Gentlemen, this is Mr. D'Enzo.

1442
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,754
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1443
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:43,507
Mr. D'Enzo. John Whitefeather.

1444
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,092
Have a seat, guys.

1445
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:56,436
D- Papa-D to the Feather Man.
l think you're reading my signals.

1446
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,105
And l think you're reading them
loud and clear.

1447
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:01,525
You're getting the wisdom.
Diversification.

1448
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,901
Buy long, sell short.

1449
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,987
- Sell short, buy long.
- Hi.

1450
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:07,823
Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to the Fall Sing.

1451
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:10,617
It's so good to see
so many of you here today.

1452
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:13,829
WeII, I can hear a Iot of
very excited chiIdren back there,

1453
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:17,291
who, Iike their parents, are not here
to Iisten to me continue taIking.

1454
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:23,005
So without further ado,
the wonderful Chilton School choir.

1455
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:43,025
Summer fades into the blue

1456
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:46,570
Brand new colors come into view

1457
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,782
Seasons change
I have, too

1458
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:55,078
Just like the leaves of autumn

1459
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:59,249
You know what l see in this room
that nobody else sees?

1460
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,584
Hidden feathers.

1461
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,254
That's what we share, hidden feathers!
Crow feathers.

1462
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,049
Right now,

1463
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,218
l need you to caw with me.

1464
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,014
One crow to another crow.

1465
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:23,690
Bring it. Come on. Bring it in.

1466
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,537
l know you want to let it out,
but l appreciate you keeping it in.

1467
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,666
There it be, brother crow.

1468
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:45,337
Look forward to working with you, man.

1469
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:51,593
Wow.

1470
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:55,722
l've never seen anything like that before.

1471
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,224
l know.

1472
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:59,726
No, you don't know.

1473
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:04,189
Quite frankly, that's one of the
biggest loads of crap l've ever heard.

1474
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,234
What possible excuse can you give us

1475
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:12,030
for wasting our time
with that unctuous stream of drivel

1476
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:14,032
that you call a presentation?

1477
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,912
- My kid.
- What?

1478
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:20,205
My kid.

1479
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:24,126
He's been wanting to get more involved
in my workplace life.

1480
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,753
He's like, "Dad, l'm on a vision quest.
l got some investment ideas."

1481
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,173
l'm like, "You're nine.
How many good ideas could you have?"

1482
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:32,634
He's on a vision quest. l'm like,
"Vision quest, my red butt! But..."

1483
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,261
You're blaming your child?

1484
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:38,265
- Look, don't let it rattle your corn stalk...
- All right, enough!

1485
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,768
l don't mind this lndian business
when it's working.

1486
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:45,856
- When it's not, it's just annoying.
- Whoa!

1487
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:50,026
- That's deep shadow time.
- Seriously, cut the crap.

1488
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:53,947
You're not even a real Native American.

1489
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:56,783
The fact is
you're mostly Finnish-Armenian.

1490
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,786
Your baptismal name
is Johann Hasuvian.

1491
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:03,290
And your great-grandfather
was one half Navajo.

1492
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:06,877
So, what would that make you? 1/32?

1493
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:11,173
Frankly, you are an offense
to true Native Americans,

1494
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:15,093
- and if you have nothing better to offer...
- All right, all right.

1495
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:18,221
Johnny Whitefeather can see
which way this wind's blowing.

1496
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:24,019
lt's your loss! Old croaking toad.

1497
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,611
l'm going this way!

1498
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,534
Well, Mr. Danielson?

1499
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,497
Looks like this job is yours to lose.

1500
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,375
l'll get right to it.

1501
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,391
Mr. Danielson?

1502
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:05,185
Evan?

1503
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,356
l can't do this.

1504
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,608
l'm sorry?

1505
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,069
l messed up. l really have.

1506
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:15,612
Sorry, what?

1507
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:23,119
- Are you walking out?
- l'm really sorry, sir. l just can't.

1508
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,038
You realize what you're giving up?

1509
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,127
Yes, sir, l do.

1510
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,590
Sorry, Tom.

1511
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:44,057
Could l see that brochure, please?

1512
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:51,940
Ain't nothing but a thing, man.

1513
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,185
Next, we wiII sing
a traditionaI Japanese foIk song

1514
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:32,689
about the bIooming
of the cherry blossom, the Sakura.

1515
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:20,612
Sorry! Sorry about that!

1516
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:32,999
The next song is one you aII know,
so feeI free to sing aIong.

1517
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:36,252
Just don't sing Iouder than us.
lt's our concert.

1518
01:34:44,887 --> 01:35:23,633
Love, Iove, Iove

1519
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:29,783
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

1520
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:32,702
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung

1521
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:36,664
Nothing you can say
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game

1522
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:38,833
It's easy

1523
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:43,546
There's nothing you can make
that can't be made

1524
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:47,008
No one you can save
That can't be saved

1525
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:51,221
Nothing you can do
But you can Iearn how to be you in time

1526
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:53,223
It's easy

1527
01:36:55,434 --> 01:37:01,231
AII you need is Iove

1528
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:06,402
AII you need is Iove, Iove

1529
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:09,447
Love is aII you need

1530
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:12,826
AII you need is Iove

1531
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:16,162
AII together now
AII you need is Iove

1532
01:37:16,747 --> 01:37:18,289
Everybody

1533
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:21,417
AII you need is Iove, Iove

1534
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,796
Love is aII you need

1535
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,858
Nice king hat.

1536
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,027
lt's called a crown.

1537
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:54,868
You know,
you were really great in there.

1538
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:57,662
- Thanks.
- Hey, listen, l got something for you.

1539
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:03,293
- l don't need it anymore.
- Really?

1540
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:05,545
l was hoping you would take it,
and, you know,

1541
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:07,881
you'd help me apologize
to the princesses.

1542
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:10,675
- You can do it yourself.
- l can?

1543
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:12,343
Yeah, they're right there.

1544
01:38:14,096 --> 01:38:16,764
Okay. Well...

1545
01:38:18,183 --> 01:38:21,728
Sopida, l wish that l could say
you were wrong about me,

1546
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:24,939
but, obviously,
you and your dragon knew better.

1547
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,357
l'm sorry.

1548
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:30,320
Thank you for protecting Olivia
while l was away.

1549
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,989
And Kupida and Mopida,

1550
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:37,785
l'm sorry for taking you for granted
and just expecting things from you

1551
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:41,247
and not realizing how smart and kind

1552
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,792
and truly amazing you really are.

1553
01:38:45,544 --> 01:38:47,128
Qwali, thank you so much

1554
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:50,924
for letting me come into your mystical,
magical world,

1555
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:56,179
- 'cause it's a truly magical...
- Daddy, they're leaving. They got bored.

1556
01:38:56,722 --> 01:38:58,473
They were bored.

1557
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:02,727
Do you want me to ask them to stay?

1558
01:39:02,811 --> 01:39:04,520
Well, what do they want to do?

1559
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:10,193
They said it's time for them to go.

1560
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:15,323
Well, then l think they should go then.

1561
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,533
Wave goodbye.

1562
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,667
There they go.

1563
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:39,722
Hey, guys. What you doing?

1564
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:43,810
Just waving goodbye to Qwali
and the princesses.

1565
01:39:43,894 --> 01:39:47,021
Really? They're going away?

1566
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:49,899
How about that?

1567
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:55,154
You know, l think
there's somebody here to see you.

1568
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,413
Wow, so, they're really gone?

1569
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:11,504
Nice outfit.

1570
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:16,509
l take it this is why
you walked out of our meeting.

1571
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:23,057
Do you know how many people
have ever done anything like that to me?

1572
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:28,187
- Two.
- Two.

1573
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:32,150
You want to know where they are
in their careers right now?

1574
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:35,403
Each one is running
a key division of my company.

1575
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,991
l don't want any sycophants around me.
l want people with confidence

1576
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:43,286
who are not afraid to make decisions,
even under pressure.

1577
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:46,122
lncidentally, this is very good.

1578
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,126
You are very good indeed,

1579
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:53,755
and l want you
to head our western division.

1580
01:40:54,423 --> 01:40:57,425
l'd like to discuss that with you,
so, please...

1581
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:08,144
Sir, l would love to discuss it now,
but it's Saturday.

1582
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,024
Sure.

1583
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:16,444
- Well, Monday, then.
- Monday.

1584
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:21,449
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1585
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,243
l have a daughter, too.

1586
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,413
l haven't seen her for years.

1587
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:35,505
- So, have a pleasant Saturday.
- You, too, sir.

1588
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,598
So, what are you guys doing
with the rest of the day?

1589
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:46,933
l don't know. What do you want to do?

1590
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:51,479
l think Mommy should get a chance
to try some of your special pancakes.
