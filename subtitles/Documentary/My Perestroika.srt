1
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:38,797
Time and space are not
homogeneous.

2
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:44,636
In the life of every
civilization, every country,
every nation and every person

3
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,672
there are special places and
special points of time -

4
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,842
unusually important, crucial
points.

5
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,514
In my life this special moment,
which I'll never forget,

6
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,518
happened in Moscow, Russia, in
the spring of 1992,

7
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:02,654
right after the fall of
Communism.

8
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:08,007
I came back to my native town after
17 years of forced separation.

9
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:12,831
Moscow was in turmoil, so was I.

10
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:17,569
Allow me to introduce myself:
Alexander Greenberg.

11
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:22,440
That spring I was turning 50 -
time to gather stones.

12
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:26,878
And it just so happened that at
an International Congress on the
"structure of the universe"

13
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:29,914
was taking place in Moscow at
the moment.

14
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:33,585
I am an astrophysicist, so are
most of the people important for me.

15
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:38,356
My entire tiny little world was
getting together in the city of
my youth.

16
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:41,292
So I've decided to come to the
city to face my past

17
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,494
and to reevaluate my life.

18
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,964
At the point it seemed to be a
sound idea.

19
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,700
I was eager to reevaluate.

20
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,802
Reevaluate everything.

21
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:55,873
Not only my own life but also
life of all the other beings
populating our planet.

22
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,176
After lunch we will begin our
regular sessions, but right now,

23
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:02,513
before we take a break, we would
like to show you a short film.

24
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,717
This film is not a scientific
film,

25
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:08,119
but it does include some footage
of our space research,

26
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,622
as well as some visual
references

27
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,758
abstracted from the works of
numerous astrophysicists.

28
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:18,262
May we have the shades drawn,
please.

29
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,766
Let me introduce to you the main
characters of our story.

30
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,236
That woman who keeps looking my
way is Helen.

31
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:28,272
She is my wife. Or, if you
prefer, ex-wife.

32
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,576
In any event, she is always
threatening to leave me.

33
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,946
I need a life. I need a real
life before I am too old.

34
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:37,281
What's so bad about our life?

35
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,084
You call this a life? Right!

36
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,853
And sometimes she does leave,
for a time.

37
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,988
But it looks like she still
cares for me.

38
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,590
My drinking seems to worry her.

39
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,626
Well, she had never seen me
drinking so much before.

40
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,795
The creator of the film you are
about to see,

41
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,396
Jill Stratton, is with us today.

42
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,700
Do you see the beautiful lady
standing by the camera?

43
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,671
That is miss Stratton herself.

44
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:07,011
"The beautiful lady standing by
the camera" is my lover, Jill.

45
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,981
Not that we're really lovers.
Not now, anyway.

46
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:13,250
Sasha, what's the matter? I
don't understand.

47
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,186
Don't you?

48
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:19,724
And that is Natasha. In a way,
she is also my lover. Ex.

49
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:24,095
Go. Leave Russia. Your place is
out there.

50
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:25,463
What about you?

51
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,732
What about me?

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,934
Even though we are very old friends,

53
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,670
our intimate relationship was
brief.

54
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:34,806
As for the past seventeen years,
we not only haven't seen each other,

55
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:37,108
but have not even corresponded.

56
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,178
But I didn't correspond with
anyone in Russia.

57
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:43,348
While the room is being engulfed
by darkness,

58
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:49,387
I would like to read a brief
passage from John Milton's
"Paradise Lost".

59
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:56,628
In this passage, the angel Raphael
is speaking to Adam and Eve.

60
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,596
The imposing gentleman at the podium,

61
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,899
is my professor, Doctor Gross.

62
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,969
I have not seen Henrich Gross
for the past 17 years either.

63
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,771
"...To ask or search I blame
thee not;

64
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,842
for Heaven Is as the Book of God
before thee set,

65
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:14,311
Wherein to read his wondrous
works, and learn His seasons,

66
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,614
hours, or days, or months, or
years.

67
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:19,851
the rest from Man or Angel the
great Architect

68
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:26,991
Did wisely to conceal, to move
His laughter at their quaint
opinions wide Hereafter,

69
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:32,797
when they come to model Heaven,
And calculate the stars."

70
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,801
I remember one of my last
meetings with Gross

71
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,703
before I left Russia.

72
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:44,609
Continue your cosmological
research for God, and make the
bomb - for Caesar.

73
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,878
Well for the last seventeen years

74
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,046
both of us each in the country
of his choice

75
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:55,353
kept calculating the stars for
God and building bombs for the
Caesars of our choice.

76
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,558
In the past two decades,
a microscopic flash of time,

77
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:05,663
we have been able to reveal so
many secrets of the Great Architect

78
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:08,365
that we cannot look at footage
reflecting the results

79
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,768
of this change without utter
fascination.

80
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:17,408
It is debatable how long the
Great Architect can continue to
conceal his secrets.

81
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:25,382
If we may remind him of the old
saying: "He who laughs last
laughs longest."

82
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,453
As in the old days Gross was
challenging God himself.

83
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,956
I must admit, I was surprised to
see how little he has changed.

84
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,492
Perhaps he has discovered the
fountain of youth.

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,064
The city beyond the windows is
my city,

86
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,767
although until the commencement
of our story

87
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,802
I have been away from it for
seventeen years.

88
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,672
I was born in this city, and I
lived here for many years.

89
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,211
It is a living entity to me, so
I hope you are not surprised

90
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:56,214
that I introduce it as one of
the characters of this film.

91
00:06:56,281 --> 00:07:01,485
And this is my planet - Earth.

92
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,721
On the grand astrophysical
scale,

93
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,425
a place just as small and cozy
as one's home town.

94
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,827
Earth is also one of our
characters.

95
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:15,499
Ah, Home, Sweet Home. One does
not choose one's homeland.

96
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:22,573
Our Universe. The way we "model
heaven and calculate the stars"
on our computers.

97
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,811
I have spent my whole life
trying to understand what limits
there are,

98
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,780
and what lies beyond them.

99
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:34,786
Striving to break through the
Iron Curtain hung by God Himself.

100
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:01,312
Why did you walk out on my film?

101
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,782
I have seen it many times
before.

102
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,684
Why did you walk out on your own
film?

103
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:12,824
I have seen it too. You're
trying to escape so you can keep
getting drunk?

104
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,525
You promised to come help me at
the studio.

105
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,160
But you're shooting.

106
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:21,365
I'm done for the day. Wait here,
I'll tell Lynn to pack up alone.

107
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:31,943
Sasha? Sasha Greenberg?

108
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,514
Oh, you don't recognize me!

109
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:41,352
It's me - Kostya Ruemin!
Remember?

110
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,787
It's a shame to forget your
friends!

111
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:47,692
Let's get together! My wife will make
a good dinner. We'll have a good time.

112
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,297
Excuse me. I am sorry. We
haven't been introduced, but I
know who you are.

113
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:57,134
I need to discuss something with
you. My name is Victor Krymsky.

114
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,803
They're all are over him.

115
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,705
I'm afraid he's going to drink
himself into oblivion, and his
speech is tomorrow.

116
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,474
It's wonderful

117
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,576
Sasha, how's tomorrow?

118
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:09,313
He said he'd come to the studio
with me. To help me negotiate
to the Head of production.

119
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,783
OK, if he's with you, he'll be
fine.

120
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,851
Okay, Sasha, let's go.

121
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,887
Hello. My name is Victor
Krymsky.

122
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:21,492
I have a business proposal to
discuss with Mister Greenberg.

123
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,861
Sasha!! I heard you were here.

124
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:27,498
I just dropped everything and
here I am!

125
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,133
That's great! That's great!

126
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,935
Don't forget. Tomorrow!

127
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,705
Sasha, we really have to go.
We'll miss the Head of production.

128
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,073
I'm the president of
cooperative"Knowledge".

129
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:37,875
Do you have a car?
I'll drive you.

130
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:40,211
We would like to discuss the
possibility of working with you.

131
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,916
Excuse me, mister Greenberg is
going to a very important
meeting right now.

132
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:46,650
Sasha, How's tomorrow?

133
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:57,061
I'm Lomova! Asya Lomova! Could
I really have aged so much?

134
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,163
This is my second day in Moscow.

135
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:03,835
So far, I haven't managed to
sleep a wink, or to have a
single moment to myself.

136
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,638
Helen and I were met at the airport

137
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:09,807
by my old friends Tolik and
Natasha, and, also, Jill.

138
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:15,112
Jill was already deep into her new
environmental documentary project,

139
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,483
so she came to Moscow earlier
than last week in search of
footage and co-producers.

140
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:24,088
The whole gang is so excited!
Greenberg is coming!

141
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:28,792
He was the first we knew who
emigrated, and now he is the
first who came back.

142
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,929
Hard to believe it is really
happening.

143
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:36,901
It seems as if all of Moscow has
nothing else to talk about.

144
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,704
Natasha was the prettiest girl
in the entire physics department

145
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,574
so, obviously, everybody
gravitated towards her.

146
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:47,378
Every holiday we would gather at
her parents' house.

147
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:50,581
Each of us fell in love with
her, more or less.

148
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,349
Oh, It's rare for a woman to be
studying physics.

149
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,819
Especially one like you...
It was the same at Harvard.

150
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,990
My parents are still alive, they
remember you.

151
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:05,762
They want to have a party
Wednesday for the whole gang in
honor of your visit.

152
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,532
Like old times.

153
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,634
When I left Moscow 17 years
before this moment

154
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:15,940
I had no inkling or even hope that
I would come back here for a visit.

155
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,177
Back then for the first time in
decades,

156
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:24,849
a door had been cracked open in
the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain.

157
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,820
Of all the soviet citizens some Jews
were allowed to leave the country

158
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,755
to supposedly to unite with
their families in Israel.

159
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,092
And everybody knew if you were
lucky and could leave,

160
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,229
you'd become "an emigrant" to
those left behind.

161
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:41,966
Officially this word sounded
like "An enemy of Russia".

162
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,703
You would never be able to see your
birthplace and your friends again.

163
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:50,307
But recently, under
"Perestroika" (Restructuring)

164
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:55,179
my friends were permitted again
to consider me their friend.

165
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,586
Hello.

166
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:08,359
It's for you. You've been
traced, already.

167
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:12,596
The following day consisted of
three dinners and four suppers.

168
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:16,033
Everybody wanted to see the man
returned from beyond.

169
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:19,003
From where no one they knew had
ever returned before.

170
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,973
They wanted to see but strangely
enough not to hear.

171
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,808
They were no longer interested
in the outside world.

172
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,777
Too many things were happening
in their own.

173
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,681
They just elected the first
president of Russia Boris Yeltsin

174
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:33,717
and said good-bye to the father
of "Perestroika"

175
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,922
the president of disintegrated
USSR Mikhail Gorbachev.

176
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,757
Did you vote for Yeltsin?

177
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,525
Yes...

178
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:48,565
How could you?! Just wait till
you've made him a dictator,
he'll show you.

179
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,968
You have a better alternative?

180
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:54,238
You fear there may be a civil
war. Well, it's already here.

181
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:58,843
Gorbachev was the greatest
leader of our time!

182
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,245
Look at what he's done in
Eastern Europe!

183
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,281
Gorbachev is the same as the
rest, only weaker!

184
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,917
He couldn't revive the economy, he
couldn't give freedom to the republics!

185
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:12,523
Gorbachev is a man of compromise,
a politician without principle.

186
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,294
He cannot be trusted. I don't know
why Americans are so fond of him!

187
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,563
Americans consider compromise a
virtue.

188
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:24,835
Anyway imagine if Gorbachev went
ahead with his reforms without
compromise, and we'd have chaos.

189
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,738
It seems to me we are on the
verge of a collapse.

190
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,072
Perestroika is dead!

191
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,441
Perestroika has just begun.

192
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:33,577
Perestroika never had a chance.

193
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:36,079
No one knows how to work
anymore.

194
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:39,015
Lazy, spoiled slaves, all of
them!

195
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:56,367
Master.

196
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:03,073
All day I waited for your call -
it never came.

197
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:06,143
Tried calling - No answer.

198
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,947
If the mountain won't come to Mohammed,
Mohammed will come to the mountain.

199
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:15,018
Give me a hug. Ahh.

200
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:17,321
What's this?

201
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,561
Couldn't we just unplug it?

202
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,430
No, you're not in America.

203
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,832
Telephones do not unplug here.

204
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,702
That would create too much
difficulty for those listening in.

205
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,441
So, disciple?

206
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,577
Do you think you've won our
argument?

207
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:44,482
Do you think the time has come
for the rats to return from
"unexplored space"?

208
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:49,687
They certainly think so and they
get so exited.

209
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:52,122
A human person has broken an
"iron curtain" twice.

210
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,459
Fourth and back! This is an
event.

211
00:14:55,527 --> 00:15:00,231
And, it is morning, and it is
officially your birthday.

212
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:03,667
Congratulations.

213
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:07,338
Gross was not your average
Soviet physicist.

214
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,406
He had come from America.

215
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:13,144
He had participated in the
creation of the nuclear bomb.

216
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:16,647
America dropped this bomb on the
Japanese.

217
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:21,185
It was the age of McCarthyism
Gross did not wish to serve the
imperialist war mongers.

218
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:26,657
In 1948 he escaped to a "free
country" - the Soviet Union.

219
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:28,926
The "free country" at that time

220
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,762
had twenty million of its
citizens imprisoned in labor camps.

221
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,166
Gross managed to avoid the labor
camp only because the "free country"

222
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:39,703
desperately needed those who
knew how to build bombs.

223
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:43,240
Of course, physicists did not
defect from the Soviet Union.

224
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,844
The borders of the "free
country" were well guarded.

225
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:53,384
After six months in the Soviet
Union, Gross married his housekeeper -

226
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,886
a virtually illiterate country
woman.

227
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:58,255
His colleagues were shocked by
the marriage.

228
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,524
But Gross lived with her for
many years

229
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,594
and always seemed perfectly
satisfied with the union.

230
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:07,731
Good coffee demands precise
preparation.

231
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,303
If, for example, you grind it
electrically instead of manually,

232
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,937
you will never achieve the
proper aroma.

233
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:17,208
Diogenes lived in a barrel.

234
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,811
Why should one care where one
lives!

235
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:27,051
I am convinced, however, that in
his life there were certain
elements of perfection.

236
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:33,457
Perhaps he prepared an ideal
coffee, or drank the best wine.

237
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:39,262
To attain knowledge, one does
not need to live in a palace.

238
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:46,503
One should, however,
periodically measure the quality
of one's thought process

239
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:50,073
against other paradigms of
quality.

240
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:56,146
Master, I've come to share a
secret.

241
00:16:56,214 --> 00:17:00,250
I have applied for emigration.

242
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:09,293
Psychologists at Harvard once
conducted an experiment.

243
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:16,200
They took some rats and placed
them in a labyrinth with tunnels
leading to various rooms.

244
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,571
These rooms contained everything
essential to rat happiness.

245
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:23,807
There were rooms with food,
rooms for sex.

246
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:30,180
One of the tunnels led to a
so-called "unexplored space".

247
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:34,050
The rats had no way of knowing
what lay beyond this opening,

248
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,353
since no rat ever returned from
there.

249
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:41,158
Still, fifteen percent of the
rats would inevitably go into
the "unexplored space".

250
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,795
They were terrified of it.
They shook with fear.

251
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,630
Their fur would stand on end,

252
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,833
they would experience
uncontrollable urine releases,

253
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:53,304
they would howl - but, still,
they would go.

254
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:56,574
As it turns out both you and I
belong to this fifteen percent.

255
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:04,948
Except that in our case the
Great Experimenter has exercised
his sophisticated sense of humor

256
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:08,519
and placed two labyrinths side
by side,

257
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:12,256
calling the door connecting them
"unexplored space"..

258
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,492
It so happens that the presence
of rats from "unexplored space"

259
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,062
does not change the magical
number of fifteen percent

260
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:26,370
and what we end up with is a
perpetual exchange of
urine-releasing bravadoes...

261
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:32,809
So,if they let you go, we will
never see each other again?

262
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:37,080
Who can tell. Maybe you could
visit me there.

263
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,350
Or I could come here.

264
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:43,654
I think not. Rats do not return
from "unexplored space".

265
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,256
That's one of the givens of the
experiment.

266
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:49,292
Otherwise, how "unexplored"
would it be?

267
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,795
Had it turned out that Gross was
wrong?

268
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,054
Was I really now back in Moscow?

269
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:21,892
Was I really going in the car
with my girl friend Jill to the
State Film Studio

270
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,329
to help her to negotiate with
the Head of the Production,

271
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,465
desperately desiring to get
somewhere a sip of vodka,

272
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,134
something that in Moscow I left
17 years ago

273
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,305
was in such abundance as water
in the ocean?

274
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,773
What's the matter?

275
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,842
What does all this madness about
vodka mean?

276
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,845
Gorbachev started a war against
Russian traditional alcoholism

277
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:46,082
and now there is something which
looks like limited prohibition.

278
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,551
I have with me a famous American
physicist.

279
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,452
Good for Russians and bad for
me.

280
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,789
You should have called this morning,
we could have got you a table.

281
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:57,060
We can't do anything just now. We
take reservations ten days in advance.

282
00:19:57,128 --> 00:20:00,397
I wish he'd take us to the
Studio already, and disappear.

283
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,634
My friend! The American doesn't
wish to have a table at all.

284
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:07,437
All he wants is a bottle of vodka. And
he's willing to pay ten times your price.

285
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:11,141
Well, that's normal. That's what
everyone pays.

286
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:17,013
It's funny. When I used to live
here everybody couldn't manage
without drinking but me.

287
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:20,651
Now I am back and desperately need
a drink, there's a vodka shortage.

288
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:26,222
There you are. You can get anything
in Moscow, it just takes know-how.

289
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,526
Our organization is called
"Success"

290
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:34,230
and in our joint venture, we are
guaranteed success.

291
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,766
But I am not a businessman.

292
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,036
We'll put together a group of
Soviet scientists

293
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:44,575
who'll generate scientific ideas
for sale and develop ideas
generated by American clients.

294
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:46,810
We'll make lots of hard
currency.

295
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,912
Excuse me. Aren't we going to
the studio?

296
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,614
The Head of production is
expecting me there.

297
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,284
He'll wait. His studio is not a
private company like mine.

298
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,921
It's a government agency - no
one does any work there anyway.

299
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:20,243
They say our studio is not up to
world's standards in terms of equipment.

300
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:21,912
That is not so.

301
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,349
Right now, for example, we're
shooting ten films simultaneously.

302
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,083
Take a look at this!

303
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm so pleased you've come to
help your girl-friend, but, as
you can see,

304
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:53,309
it is not an interpreter she needs.
I know enough English for that.

305
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,713
It is a more delicate matter,
She wants to do a co-production.

306
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,983
Okay. Great. I'm all for a
co-production.

307
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:02,586
She needs some specific
documentary material.

308
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:08,191
Fine. We'll get it for her, but
not all of it. But something.

309
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:10,560
But now she's asking to see our
copyright to this material.

310
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,662
What copyright?

311
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,967
I talked to every attorney in
Moscow - no one knows whether we
have this copyright or not.

312
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:19,102
What's a copyright anyway?

313
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,941
Don't take it personal, but it's
so difficult to work with Americans!

314
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:54,538
Sex and Jews are our two most
popular subjects today.

315
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,073
Everyone wants to film what used
to be forbidden.

316
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:00,944
These Jewish looking actors
never used to have any work -
now they're all hot property.

317
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,914
Everyone of them is under three
or four contracts at once.

318
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:07,584
They're the envy of all other
actors.

319
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:17,794
Unfortunately, I have to tell you
that there is no mistake in our lists.

320
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:21,364
You have not been accepted to
the Physics/Math Department.

321
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:26,937
But isn't there a law that says
everyone graduating high school
with a gold medal

322
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:29,372
must be accepted without
entrance examinations?

323
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,977
Why wasn't I accepted? Because
I am a Jew?

324
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,412
Have enough courage to tell me
the truth!

325
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,219
Sit down. You snotnose!!

326
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:50,260
I am not the least bit afraid to
tell you that you weren't
accepted because you're a Jew.

327
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:55,699
Because we have twice as many
applicants like you - Jews with
gold medals -

328
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,402
than there are spots available
at the University!

329
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:07,044
And even if I followed the law
and turned this institution one
hundred percent Jewish,

330
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:12,849
there would still be no place
for you, personally.

331
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:16,352
I am prepared to take the
examinations along with the
other applicants.

332
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,590
That I cannot forbid you to do.

333
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,969
May I answer right away, without
preparation?

334
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:38,141
Are you sure you do not want to
think over your answer first?

335
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:41,144
I got lucky.
I pulled my favorite question.

336
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:43,080
Well, what is that question?

337
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:45,982
The modern concept of the
structure of the Universe.

338
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:57,728
All right, then. Let's hear
what you know about this.

339
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:01,732
The modern concept of the
structure of the Universe

340
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,401
is based upon Einstein's general
theory of relativity.

341
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:10,607
In 1917, the same year that the
Great October Revolution took
place in our own country,

342
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:12,876
another revolution also took
place.

343
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:17,214
Einstein claimed that all three
of the space Dimensions were curved

344
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:21,451
and that a spaceship travelling
in the same direction for a long
enough period of time

345
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:24,520
would return to its point of
origin.

346
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:27,290
In 1922, the Soviet
mathematician Alexander Friedman

347
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,759
offered another model.

348
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:31,428
In his model, the Universe
expands.

349
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:34,831
Expansion began at a point.

350
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,668
All of of today's models allow
for an expanding Universe.

351
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:41,238
Although I must add that not all
scientists are pleased with this.

352
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:44,474
I am not sure I like it either.

353
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,943
The idea of the Universe
appearing from nothing

354
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:49,445
and perishing into collapse is
somewhat unnerving to me.

355
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:50,981
How is it possible?

356
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,350
Did the Universe begin at the
point?

357
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:56,386
Did matter evolve from nothing?

358
00:25:56,453 --> 00:25:59,122
What was there before the
creation of the Universe?

359
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,160
Do you know, young man, that
that particular question has
already been answered?

360
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:07,597
Long before the birth of Albert
Einstein.

361
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:10,600
No, I didn't. By whom?

362
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,869
By St. Augustine.

363
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:16,973
And what, in his opinion, was there
before the creation of the Universe?

364
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:21,144
In his opinion, before the
creation of the Universe

365
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:31,421
there was already a hell for
those asking such questions.

366
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:33,990
But you are a world-renowned
physicist.

367
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:39,996
So what? There are no positions
available at the University for
head of project.

368
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:42,432
Shiffman will not have me.

369
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,168
He has already let too many Jews
into his school,

370
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:48,071
he's a Jew himself, he's afraid
to let anyone else in.

371
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,873
Logov has never let Jews in and
is not about to start now

372
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,809
and Sarkisian is far too poor.

373
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,578
I will not be able to continue
my research there.

374
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,681
There really is no place for me
to go.

375
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,415
The only one who wants me is
Burkov.

376
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:02,919
So, where is the problem?
Go work for Burkov.

377
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:05,588
He has plenty of money and
you'll be able to continue your
research.

378
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:07,990
Burkov is making the bomb.

379
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,592
And what of that?

380
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,730
Do you really believe that if
you refuse to make it, it will
not be made?

381
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:19,703
I suffered under that illusion
in my youth as well,

382
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:25,742
the end result of which was that
I helped build the bomb both
here and over there.

383
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,545
You cannot stop progress, Sasha.

384
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:33,249
There will always be someone
willing to use scientific discovery

385
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:35,418
to further causes of evil.

386
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:36,586
What does that mean?

387
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,555
That science should be outlawed?

388
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:44,127
Do you think that if you don't
work for Burkov now,

389
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,898
some other Burkov in the future
will not find a way

390
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:51,634
to use your achievements for
more efficient warfare?

391
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,736
Or something even worse?

392
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:56,373
If that's the case, why not just
quit altogether?

393
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,776
I am only interested in the
structure of the Universe.

394
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,811
Why can't I be left alone to
study it?

395
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:04,681
Be left alone - in Burkov's
employ.

396
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:08,418
Even Christ, that shining beacon
of morality,

397
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:12,455
preached to "render unto Caesar
the things which are Caesar's

398
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:15,658
and unto God the things which
are God's".

399
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,895
Continue your cosmological
research for God,

400
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:24,167
and make the bomb - for Caesar.

401
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:28,338
I had another alternative in
mind - emigration.

402
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:32,142
At nights, I wandered the
streets,

403
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,410
saying goodbye to my beloved
city.

404
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:39,482
That summer in Moscow was hit
with an unprecedented heat wave.

405
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,685
The sidewalks practically melted
under one's feet.

406
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,989
The streets in Moscow were
swirled in acrid smog.

407
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,460
All around the city underground
swamps were on fire.

408
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:54,730
The "refusniks" would jokingly
remark that the Egyptian plagues
had begun.

409
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,535
Applying for emigration was
risky.

410
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:03,506
One might never get permission
to leave and be forced to remain
in Russia an outlaw -

411
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:06,809
"a refusnik" with your career
and life ruined.

412
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:11,114
Still I wasn't afraid. Somehow I
was sure of my luck.

413
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,985
Our committee reviewed your
application to change your
permanent place of residence

414
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:20,523
to the country of Israel and
decided that permission should
not be granted.

415
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,158
On what grounds?

416
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:25,828
On the grounds that you were
involved in classified work.

417
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:28,965
But the Institute where I worked
was not classified.

418
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,901
You cannot know that.

419
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:35,172
Our committee only can know
which organizations are
classified and which aren't.

420
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:37,540
I suggest you find some other
work.

421
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:40,676
You may return to us in not less
than three years.

422
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:44,314
What will happen if I find work
and in three years

423
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,449
you again decide that it is
classified?

424
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:49,552
Then you will again be refused.

425
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:59,862
The woman who works for me has all
the footage you are looking for.

426
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:04,400
She shot it herself, so there won't
be any problem with the copyright.

427
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,504
Let's go right now to the
editing room in my church.

428
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:09,805
In 15 minutes we are expected to
be at the Congress banquet.

429
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:14,210
Then you'll come to my place tomorrow
first thing in the morning. Agree?

430
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,818
Ladies and gentlemen! We have a
very special guest with us today!

431
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:25,388
For those of you who don't know,
he like many others,

432
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,358
had to leave us during the years
of stagnation.

433
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:32,295
And he is the first of
immigrants we knew, who has come
back to visit us.

434
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:36,399
It is Sasha Greenberg!

435
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,770
This is especially difficult for
me,

436
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:43,773
as you all know Greenberg is my
pupil.

437
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,475
But treason is treason.

438
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:48,878
Therefore, we'll all have to
tear the traitor from our hearts.

439
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:54,017
I confess I should have
exercised more foresight,

440
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:59,289
I should have recognized
Greenberg as a future traitor
right away. I am guilty.

441
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:01,558
I only hope never to repeat this
mistake.

442
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,026
We are proud of Sasha's success
in America,

443
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:09,131
his achievements are ours, for
he is flesh of our flesh and
blood of our blood.

444
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,237
All the more joyous this day,
when we can again be together.

445
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,339
Sasha, come over to my house!

446
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:19,309
You can't refuse, I've already
got a lamb!

447
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,211
Does anyone else want to say
anything?

448
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:30,253
Comrades, comrades, what is
happening here?

449
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:34,925
Greenberg wants to emigrate to
Israel

450
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:41,030
and professor Gross can find
nothing better than to accuse
him of treason?!

451
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:44,801
Of course, we all know that
Greenberg is a traitor.

452
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:51,841
Our nation fed him, nourished
Greenberg, spent money for his
education,

453
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:56,012
and now he wants to emigrate to
Israel,

454
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,515
to give his knowledge to our
imperialistic enemies,

455
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:03,119
to the enemies of the all
progressive humankind!

456
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:07,990
Comrades, I think we should
petition the authorities not to
allow this!

457
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:12,395
Greenberg's place is not Israel,
it's prison!

458
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:19,169
What do you think about that?

459
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:24,073
You, Tolik Gurov!
You used to be his friend!

460
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:32,047
Come up here!
Tell us what you think!

461
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:40,890
This is true. Sasha was my
friend... I am sorry...

462
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:47,597
Who could have known?
Who could have guessed?

463
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:55,871
I will try to not have friends
again... I mean, such friends.

464
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:15,024
This is better, with the water.
In case it's bugged.

465
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:16,726
You're not mad at me, are you?

466
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,628
He just left me no choice.

467
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:23,032
It doesn't matter what I say.
You're leaving anyway.

468
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,034
I'm the one who has to stay
here...

469
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,837
Maybe I should leave too?
What do you think?

470
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,107
Just because Galileo publicly
denied his beliefs,

471
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,677
the Earth did not stop orbiting
the Sun.

472
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:41,351
It is all, like Hamlet said,
words, words, words.

473
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,628
Thanks.

474
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:53,530
For what?

475
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,665
For being the only one to not
say anything.

476
00:33:55,732 --> 00:33:57,600
Was I?

477
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,502
Yes.

478
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,172
It's alright. It's just a
ritual, anyway. No one really
thinks like that.

479
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,042
Yeah. Right.

480
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:10,680
Want to come over? I have some
vodka... OK? Let's go.

481
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:14,350
No shame! No shame at all!

482
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:23,293
Now they're bringing men to the rooms...
Oh, wait till I call the police.

483
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:31,534
Don't pay any attention.
She's totally harmless.

484
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,304
You know, I was in love with you
our freshmen year.

485
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:37,940
I suspected it.
Why didn't you say something?

486
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:39,375
Everybody was in love with you.

487
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:44,547
Swarms of Casanovas...
I was too shy.

488
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:49,152
Shall we drink to your
departure, yeah?

489
00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:59,862
It's a little strange -
everybody wanted to be with you
and you're still not married.

490
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:06,703
Yeah, I'm too picky.
Why aren't you married?

491
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,571
I guess I'm too picky also.

492
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,609
To the picky ones.

493
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:19,181
You may stay here, if you want.

494
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:26,255
It's hard to believe you're
leaving us.

495
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:33,796
We'll never see each other
again. "Never".

496
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:37,433
Never-never-never-never

497
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:41,671
It's a strange word...Never.

498
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,841
It's not definite yet.

499
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:53,383
I'm the first PhD physicist to
apply for emigration. They may
not let me out.

500
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:59,689
Oh, you will leave.
And a good thing too.

501
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,724
You'll be happy there...

502
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:08,264
Just don't try being noble right
now and asking me to marry you
so we could leave together.

503
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:15,338
My life's already planned out.
I'll never make a good wife, I'm afraid.

504
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:23,012
I can't serve astrophysics and a
man too at the same time.

505
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,850
I would like to have a baby,
though...

506
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:34,957
and I think sometimes: what if I
pick one of you guys, one of the
best, and get pregnant.

507
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:39,028
I would hide it from the father,
of course.

508
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:44,299
It's easier to care for a child without
having to care for a man too, huh?

509
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,669
So, there is theory in your
solitude.

510
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,439
Well, then, in mine too.

511
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:54,076
I have thought of leaving many
times,

512
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,779
I just couldn't figure out how.

513
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,948
I've thought of defecting even.

514
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,651
What would I do with a wife?

515
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:09,125
It's just pure luck for me that
emigration started when it did...

516
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:28,578
What? Oh, are you afraid I'm going
to try and get pregnant right now?

517
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:35,084
Don't worry. Not tonight.

518
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:00,142
Do you like her?

519
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,245
She is my daughter.

520
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:05,147
You see, I did it.

521
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:10,019
I had a child and I raised her
without a husband.

522
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:15,257
I had this certain plan.
Sasha knew about it.

523
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:17,793
Doesn't her father know he has a
daughter?

524
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:18,861
I didn't tell him.

525
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:19,862
And her?

526
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,031
I didn't tell her either.

527
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:27,970
Once, when she got especially
persistent, I told her she
couldn't meet him anyway.

528
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:31,607
She wanted to know why. I said,
"because he is an American".

529
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:37,613
She got stuck on the idea, she tells
everyone her father is an American,

530
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:40,616
she speaks to everybody in
English...

531
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:42,351
So it goes.

532
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:44,219
Is he actually American?

533
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:46,288
In a way.

534
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:48,290
Let me introduce you two.

535
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:54,797
Sasha, Jill, this is Elena.

536
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,967
Elena, as you know, Sasha is my
old friend.

537
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:01,203
Mom has told me lots about you.
And not just Mom.

538
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:03,739
You're sort of a legend around
here.

539
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,875
To my surprise, I am discovering
this for myself.

540
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:10,913
As well as some other things.

541
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,082
Why did you name her Elena?

542
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:16,118
Why not?

543
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:18,754
I see you've met my namesake.

544
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:22,124
We've become quite good friends
in the past few days.

545
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:24,927
I don't have any friends!

546
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:30,833
I'm sorry.
Don't take it personally.

547
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:34,937
I really don't have any friends.

548
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,639
Why don't you have friends,
Elena?

549
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,540
Do you?

550
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,409
As a matter of fact, yes.

551
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,478
That's just because you're
American.

552
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,580
Around here, we don't do that.

553
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,882
What nonsense you're saying!

554
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,717
Don't you know how many friends
I have?

555
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:57,159
I know. That's why I said it.

556
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:59,028
She's so difficult lately.

557
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:00,696
Adolescence, you know.

558
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:03,298
Comrades! Comrades! Ladies and
Gentlemen!

559
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:10,740
Sasha Greenberg is not the only
old friend we are greeting today
after years of separation!

560
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:16,045
There is another person, well
known to most of you here,

561
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,881
whom we haven't seen in just as
many years as Sasha.

562
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:25,220
Friends, let us drink to the
ever beautiful Helen of Troy!

563
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,529
Excuse me, are you... Helen
Preston?

564
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,665
Yes, yes I am.

565
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:14,036
You called... Asked me to
come... Here I am.

566
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,872
I am Sasha Greenberg.

567
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:19,375
Of course! Of course! You're
the famous Greenberg!

568
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:20,810
Famous? How?

569
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,778
The first physicist refusenik.

570
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:24,213
The freedom fighter.

571
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,883
So, you came over from America
on an exchange program?

572
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,420
Citizen, you are violating laws
here.

573
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,089
Let's see your pass!

574
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:38,127
You've been fired from this
institute.

575
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:41,330
You should've turned in your
pass a long time ago.

576
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:43,299
I'll be leaving in a few
minutes.

577
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:44,700
What few minutes?

578
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:49,305
Chromov, Come on, take his other
arm!

579
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:50,806
Sasha!

580
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:52,374
This is a serious offense.

581
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:56,145
This is a scientific facility, we
have classified information here.

582
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,181
Lucky for us, a comrade called
and informed us.

583
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:02,618
Otherwise, we'd be taking the
heat for this.

584
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:06,521
Is that the spy?
Let's have him!

585
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:10,325
Sasha, I will be behind you.

586
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:14,196
You're Greenberg?

587
00:42:14,264 --> 00:42:15,064
I am.

588
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,832
You can go.

589
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,801
Why was I detained?

590
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,303
Why don't you ask your buddies
at the institute.

591
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:24,140
Suddenly, there's this racket -
spy, spy, spy!

592
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,909
The director of the institute
says "he's no spy".

593
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,279
So go on, get out of here before
someone else gives an opinion!

594
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:31,880
Oh, thank God, it's you!

595
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:34,850
I called the embassy, I called
Gross.

596
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:37,486
I guess Gross he must have got
through to them. Thanks.

597
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:40,589
Did you know this could happen
if you showed up?

598
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:43,125
I didn't entirely discount the
possibility.

599
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,527
So why did you come?

600
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:48,430
You asked me to.

601
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:52,501
Until the end of last century,
Moscow was a completely unique city.

602
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:57,506
All green and white, yellow and
gold.

603
00:42:57,573 --> 00:43:01,110
Hills were covered with gardens,
white and yellow mansions

604
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:04,780
and palaces with green roofs
drowning in the gardens,

605
00:43:04,847 --> 00:43:08,850
golden domes crowning churches
and cathedrals..

606
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:14,423
So, you were saying that your
experiments support my hypothesis?

607
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:19,128
Now, if gamma is less than one

608
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:21,897
you must increase the mass by a
factor of two.

609
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:26,101
Right. But gamma is more than
one in this case.

610
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:32,441
Can we see your house from here?

611
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:35,610
My house? Ah, it's over there.

612
00:43:35,678 --> 00:43:38,547
You see the yellow high-rises
right behind there.

613
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:43,285
Let's go there?

614
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:50,960
God, I've never felt so happy.

615
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,592
Happy Birthday!
You gonna let me in?

616
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,930
Of course... Come in, I didn't
invite anyone.

617
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,800
Didn't plan anything.
Thanks for remembering.

618
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:33,202
You're not supposed to invite
anyone.

619
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,972
A birthday party should only be
for those who remember.

620
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,108
You think anyone remembers me
now?

621
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,844
We'll see about that.

622
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,650
You see! And you said no one
would remember!

623
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:52,421
Oh, Sasha! Happy birthday!

624
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:04,033
Sasha, I want to make a toast!

625
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,369
I'd like to talk to you in
private.

626
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:11,040
Right now? OK, go ahead.

627
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:15,845
I want to make a toast!

628
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:17,980
Where's Natasha?

629
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,049
Where's Helen of Troy?

630
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:21,683
I'll get them.

631
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:23,752
I want to tell you I'm in love
with Sasha.

632
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:28,624
I want everything to be in the
open between us.

633
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:33,428
Wonderful! Why tell me, of all
people?

634
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:36,765
Because I thought you were
together.

635
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,901
Sasha and I are old friends.

636
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:45,241
If you mean sex, then, yes, we
did sleep together... once.

637
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:47,910
You have my permission.

638
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:52,147
Even if I were in love with him,
maybe even he with me,

639
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:54,950
I would still tell you to go
ahead.

640
00:45:55,017 --> 00:45:55,850
Why?

641
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:58,420
Because Sasha's destiny is not
with me.

642
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:01,857
There is nothing I can do to
help him, but you can.

643
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:04,526
What about you?
Don't you wanna leave?

644
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:11,266
No, It's very hard for a woman to
attain any sort of position in science.

645
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:19,508
I've achieved a lot here and
Gross appreciates me.

646
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:23,612
And anyway where would I go?
For what?

647
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,617
Where the hell did everybody go?
I want to make a toast already.

648
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,181
Your application is accepted.

649
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,418
The trial period is three
months.

650
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:05,287
Come back in three months and we
will marry you.

651
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,089
Three months! What do you mean,
in three months?

652
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,959
Her visa expires in two weeks!

653
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:13,229
Couldn't you speed it up, in
view of the circumstances?

654
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:18,234
Young man, we do not make
exceptions or "speed things up"!

655
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:22,137
The law is the same for
everybody!

656
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:24,773
I know their tricks. You won't
be able to get a visa for longer
than a month

657
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,475
and we'll never be able to get
married.

658
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,910
Fine! I'll contact the Senate.
I'm going to get you out of here!

659
00:47:28,978 --> 00:47:30,712
The American Senate? What does
it have to do with anything?

660
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,913
Everything.

661
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,125
Sasha, this is Rabbi Katz, this
is Sasha.

662
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:44,926
Shalom.

663
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:46,695
Shalom.

664
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:52,234
The rabbi has kindly agreed to
marry us.

665
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,136
But you're not even Jewish!

666
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,505
Now I am. I converted.

667
00:47:56,572 --> 00:48:00,041
Soviet authorities will not
recognize a marriage performed
by an American rabbi.

668
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:03,845
But the American Senate will, and
I think the American people will.

669
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:09,884
And then we'll see what your
authorities will have to say.

670
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,963
It was my mother's...

671
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:59,501
Who knows what's hidden inside
this little figurine.

672
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,190
Who is this?

673
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:25,527
That was my father. He was killed
in 1945. That's his last picture.

674
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,630
Pictures of military uniforms are
forbidden to leave the country.

675
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:30,432
But it's from World War Two!

676
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:36,838
I don't make up the laws. You can
leave it behind or I can cut it.

677
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:40,542
Go ahead. Cut.

678
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:55,457
Do you think you've outwitted
the experimenters and returned
from unexplored space?

679
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,159
I wasn't thinking that at all,
Master.

680
00:49:58,227 --> 00:50:01,663
On the contrary, you were right
all along:

681
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:05,000
one does not return from
unexplored space.

682
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:10,172
I have merely made another pass
into a new unexplored space.

683
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,846
How long's it been since you've
been here?

684
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:19,181
Seventeen years.

685
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,816
I'll bet you can't wait to see
your friends!

686
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:23,719
I can't.

687
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:27,522
They're gonna tell you how great
everything has become, how
things have changed.

688
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:32,727
Don't believe them. Our lives
are still pretty hard.

689
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:46,808
You're a guest? Go right ahead,
I'm not even going to open it.

690
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:50,846
Go on, your friends are waiting.

691
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:58,019
Your labyrinth has changed so much,
I can't keep a sense of reality.

692
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:02,657
I have a persistent feeling I'm
in a dream.

693
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:07,362
Reality can get a little hazy
when one consumes such vast
amounts of alcohol.

694
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,833
That's why I drink, partially,
to regain a sense of reality.

695
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:13,735
Reality!

696
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:17,606
Obviously this word still had
some clear meaning for Gross.

697
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:21,910
As for me, all such words as
reality, logic, sanity,

698
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:26,448
time, place lost their sense a
long time ago.

699
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:31,787
It's amazing. Can I really live here?
Can you really be my wife?

700
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:34,289
I'm really your wife, and I have
some news for you.

701
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,025
We're going to have a baby!

702
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,098
She found him? Thank God.
Where was he?

703
00:51:43,165 --> 00:51:44,766
What happened?

704
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,769
Brenda lost the baby!
She found him.

705
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:54,876
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm coming.

706
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:58,547
I'm going to have to quit my
job.

707
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,782
If that's what you really want.

708
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:03,118
I don't think I have a choice.

709
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:06,622
I, I used to get so angry
whenever people said

710
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:10,024
women they only go to college to
get husbands,

711
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:14,996
but, maybe, they were right.

712
00:52:15,064 --> 00:52:20,101
Daddy has to stay home and work
today and tomorrow too...OK?

713
00:52:20,169 --> 00:52:24,072
We'll play later. I have to work
on the phone.

714
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:25,307
Anything?

715
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,210
No, it's useless. There are no
open positions anywhere.

716
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,246
How about universities? They are
always looking for someone.

717
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:36,318
Not all universities have the
means and facilities I need to
continue working on my model.

718
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,354
So, now what?

719
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:43,825
I don't know.
Hughes wants to hire me.

720
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:47,496
He keeps calling back.
He's got tons of money.

721
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:51,667
I remember once you preferred
emigration

722
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:53,968
to working for the military.

723
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:57,606
Yes, I had somewhere to emigrate
then.

724
00:52:57,673 --> 00:53:06,548
Oh well, if it's a chance for
you to keep working on your
model, how can I say "no"?

725
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:10,452
By the way, he is paying triple
of what I get now.

726
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:44,352
I'm, I'm so tired. So much work
in the house.

727
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,728
God, if you only knew how much I
hate you!

728
00:53:53,796 --> 00:53:57,566
I hate your face, I hate your
voice, I hate the air you breathe!

729
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:01,402
But most of all I hate that
Universe of yours that consumes
absolutely everything.

730
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,873
It sucked away every single drop
of my life! I've had it.

731
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,075
You go sacrifice somebody else's
life for it.

732
00:54:07,142 --> 00:54:08,610
Just go! Worship it.

733
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:12,681
Go, go! Fuck it for all I care!
Have fun!

734
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,615
I love you. You know that.

735
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,350
Me?! You love me?!

736
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:20,722
The only thing you worship is
your Universe and your own mind.

737
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:32,433
Yes? Yes, this is... Sasha
Greenberg.

738
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:37,739
You called before, right?
I remember.

739
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,208
You're making a film about
science.

740
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:44,813
Your wife?

741
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,181
Umm... maybe not.

742
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:48,683
What does that mean?

743
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:50,652
It means that I am not sure.

744
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,756
I am afraid I can't give you
definite answers on everything,
not even science.

745
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,659
So, be forewarned.

746
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,696
Scientific progress is a pretty
ambiguous concept.

747
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:05,801
After Hiroshima, it is very
fashionable to give up science.

748
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:08,169
It may have been a sixties'
cliche.

749
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,105
But you didn't give up?

750
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:15,343
I know that and smoking and
drinking are bad for me, but I
haven't given them up.

751
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:20,181
Besides, I've already mentioned
an ambiguity, an uncertainty.

752
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:23,818
Science has done a lot of good
too.

753
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:26,087
So, if I understand you
correctly,

754
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:29,290
that a science is much like the
presence of your wife:

755
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:31,726
a definite "maybe". Agree?

756
00:55:31,794 --> 00:55:39,034
Agree. What're you. Would you
like to have dinner with me?

757
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:48,677
Maybe... There is a certain ambiguity
involved here, an uncertainty.

758
00:55:48,744 --> 00:55:51,646
And you do not approve?

759
00:55:51,714 --> 00:55:54,649
Strangely enough, I kind of like
it.

760
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:04,259
The Universe is boundless.

761
00:56:04,326 --> 00:56:10,298
Imagine that on a small planet
orbiting a tertiary star,

762
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:14,969
one of billions of such stars in
an insignificant galaxy,

763
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:20,374
a group of microscopic creatures
dares to grasp in their minds

764
00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:24,612
the entire extent of the
Universe!

765
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,983
Let us drink to ourselves,
friends,

766
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:33,688
the most daring representatives
of the daring race of humankind!

767
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:38,026
What's there to be proud of?
Man's a dirty animal!

768
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:41,195
The only species with the bent
and ability to self-destruct,

769
00:56:41,263 --> 00:56:43,665
taking the rest of the planet
with it!

770
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:48,469
I know, I know. Our atmosphere
is polluted.

771
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,005
Our waters are poisoned.

772
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:52,941
Entire species of animals are
being annihilated!

773
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:58,446
We are living on a bomb with the
lit fuse, and still we dare to
be proud of ourselves!

774
00:56:58,514 --> 00:57:04,485
And all human family values and
social traditions have collapsed.

775
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:09,658
For real, do you have a wife or
not?

776
00:57:09,725 --> 00:57:12,727
In the past two years, she's
left four times and come back
three times.

777
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,529
And why?

778
00:57:14,596 --> 00:57:21,636
Why did she come back? We have
a son together, I asked her to...

779
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:25,573
and, I guess, she does love me.

780
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:28,276
Why'd she leave?

781
00:57:28,343 --> 00:57:31,245
She says I ruined her career.

782
00:57:31,313 --> 00:57:38,252
She was a scientist before I...
before she had the baby and quit
work to stay home.

783
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,956
You're a male chauvinist?!

784
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:43,758
Bullshit! I hate those labels!

785
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:46,962
For the past two years she's
been working anyway.

786
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:49,698
And before that she's always
done what she's wanted.

787
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:53,835
I've yet to see a married woman
who does whatever she wants!

788
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,871
You two should get along
splendidly.

789
00:57:56,939 --> 00:57:59,674
My God! You're so beautiful!

790
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:07,949
Are you Helen?
Nice to meet you. I'm Jill.

791
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:13,888
In eighteen years, he's never once
said thank you for anything I've done!

792
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:16,724
What're you talking about?

793
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:20,528
Did you thank me every time I
came home with a paycheck?
It's ridiculous.

794
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:24,465
No, it's not. You earned your
paycheck doing what you loved best!

795
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:26,201
What did I get for my work?!

796
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:28,870
You've done what women have done
for centuries.

797
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:32,173
You're such a Male chauvinist!

798
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:34,275
I never asked for your
sacrifices.

799
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,745
You wanted me to give up my
career!

800
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:41,716
To compromise all my principles
and live on blood money you got
for making bombs!

801
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:45,987
Nobody, absolutely nobody forced
you into any of it!

802
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:50,391
Besides, if you want to talk
about sacrifices, you should
try eating one of your dinners!

803
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:52,894
I'm an astrophysicist Sasha.
I'm not your cook!

804
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:57,832
So be an astrophysicist!
Nobody's stopping you.

805
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,371
Professor, you know how much
respect I have for you,

806
00:59:03,438 --> 00:59:07,575
but there is something I wish to
steal.

807
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:09,144
It is Sasha?

808
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:12,914
The very one.
Will you permit me?

809
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,150
What can I do?
I can refuse you nothing.

810
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:18,052
Thank you, professor.

811
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:25,860
It's so stuffy in here. Let's go
outside for a few minutes.

812
00:59:25,928 --> 00:59:27,929
Come on, let's go.

813
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,830
We'll be back in a minute.

814
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,599
It's right around here.

815
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:36,938
Moscow. The familiar city of my youth,

816
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,874
and at the same time completely
different.

817
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:42,310
We've been driving for half an
hour.

818
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:45,680
A whole half hour without
alcohol.

819
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,682
It might actually be good for
your health.

820
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,487
I hoped to find here the answers
to the questions

821
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:57,725
I am struggling with, instead
I've got more questions.

822
00:59:57,792 --> 01:00:01,629
Will I manage to find answers to
them?

823
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:07,201
And this is where we live these
days.

824
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:13,007
When my daughter was born, I
applied for a new place.

825
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:18,146
It took three years. You remember
my old communal apartment -

826
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:22,650
what a rough time I had with
Elena there.

827
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:27,688
Now we have two rooms. It's
pretty far, but it's alright.
The Metro is fast.

828
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:29,990
Is Elena coming right back?

829
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,428
Uh uh. She is spending the
night at her grandparents'.

830
01:00:33,495 --> 01:00:37,398
There's your vodka.

831
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:39,700
Is she my daughter?

832
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:43,504
What difference does it make?

833
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:47,041
What do you mean, what
difference? I want to know.

834
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:55,349
Don't bother asking, I'm not
going to tell you anyway.

835
01:00:55,818 --> 01:01:02,056
Let's drink to the mysteries in
life, um?

836
01:01:17,072 --> 01:01:19,174
Natasha, wait...

837
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:24,813
Don't say a word, Sasha. I am
not blind, I have seen your
harem of women.

838
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,365
Look at me. Look at me.

839
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:48,169
My body is just as good as
twenty years ago.

840
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,704
Aren't you happy I brought you
here?

841
01:01:50,772 --> 01:01:54,909
Tomorrow we'll dance the tango
at my parents'.

842
01:01:54,976 --> 01:02:00,814
You won't believe this. All the
old records are still there.

843
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:03,884
Nothing has changed at their
house.

844
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:06,620
Do you remember the old church
next door?

845
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:11,859
The one that used to be all
nailed up?

846
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:14,062
We used to sneak in at night?

847
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:21,169
It's being restored.
It looks like new.

848
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:25,073
We'll go there,
I'll show you around.

849
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:29,177
Mom! It's me.

850
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:35,850
This girl. She did not even
exist when I left.

851
01:02:35,917 --> 01:02:38,419
Everyone hardly changed at all,
but out of nowhere,

852
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:41,355
as if out of sea foam - there
she was.

853
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:44,892
There was something mystical
about that.

854
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,760
Don't come in here.
I am not alone.

855
01:02:46,828 --> 01:02:50,098
I know you're not.

856
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:52,100
Why did you come back then?

857
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:55,036
It's my house too.

858
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,772
It is. Now go to sleep, darling.

859
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,876
All my days in Moscow I couldn't
stop thinking about Elena

860
01:03:01,943 --> 01:03:04,278
and, look, here she was.

861
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:08,016
Now she will move furniture all
night long.

862
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:11,719
The presence of this girl

863
01:03:11,786 --> 01:03:14,955
was definitely changing my
perception of the world.

864
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:17,625
Do you know how it is in science
fiction,

865
01:03:17,692 --> 01:03:20,395
when you return from a trip to
the past

866
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:23,197
to find out you accidentally
changed something?

867
01:03:23,265 --> 01:03:26,300
Both your past and your present
are no longer yours.

868
01:03:26,368 --> 01:03:28,869
They may seem the same at first
glance,

869
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:32,340
but you look closer and no -
there is this girl.

870
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:39,080
So, you inevitably start
re-examining everything else,
including yourself.

871
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:46,554
We cannot be the same, life
cannot go on as before.

872
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:54,995
Good morning.

873
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:59,800
Good morning. Although I am not
sure it is morning yet.

874
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:02,903
I've wanted to talk to you.
Let's walk.

875
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:08,776
Sure, let's. After all, what
else is there to do around here
at this time?

876
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:16,184
Oh, sure. In America, you can
probably go to a cafe at three
in the morning,

877
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:18,319
at 5 in the morning, at 7
o'clock.

878
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,620
Yes.

879
01:04:19,688 --> 01:04:24,392
I hate it! I hate all of this.

880
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,427
Because there aren't any cafes?

881
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:33,234
Because there isn't any life.
Don't make jokes, sir.

882
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:37,005
Do you think you're my father?

883
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:44,012
I don't really know.
What do you think?

884
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,716
I don't know. But I don't think
so.

885
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:51,252
According to my papers, I am
sixteen.

886
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:56,457
Which means that you left at least
six months before she got pregnant.

887
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,893
Of course, she could've forged
them.

888
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,495
Who?

889
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:04,232
My mother. She can do anything.

890
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:07,402
You're so harsh.

891
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:13,975
I hate her.
She is an old lying bitch.

892
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:18,546
Well, obviously our perspectives
are a little different.

893
01:05:18,613 --> 01:05:21,515
Want to know what I think of
your mother?

894
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:25,486
Yeah.

895
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:28,189
She's a lovely, talented woman.

896
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:33,094
A hard worker. Alone, she
managed not only to have a
career in science,

897
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:37,098
but to raise you as well.
That's a miracle in itself.

898
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,302
Through all this she's retained
a youthful sense of romanticism.

899
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:46,374
You call her a liar, but I'd
rather think of her as romantic.

900
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,910
Because she lies? Yeah?

901
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:53,914
We were talking about tomorrow.
You know what she wants to do?

902
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,884
She was dreaming of showing me
an old church.

903
01:05:56,952 --> 01:06:01,589
I'm sure. She takes all her men
to that stupid church.

904
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:03,891
She's been there a thousand
times.

905
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,526
You are cruel.

906
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,062
You're cruel! Don't you see?

907
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:13,734
If you loved her even a little
bit, you wouldn't make her sound
like such a saint.

908
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,436
I don't think I understand.

909
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,272
And what do you do understand?

910
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:24,378
I want to tell you about myself.

911
01:06:24,446 --> 01:06:29,717
I grew up under the portrait of
a man I never met.

912
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:32,553
He was a hero, they said.

913
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:37,925
A man who wasn't afraid to apply
for emigration when his chances
were nil.

914
01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:42,096
But mostly, he was going to
conquer the Universe.

915
01:06:42,163 --> 01:06:46,934
A genius. The new Einstein.

916
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:53,441
Kiss me.

917
01:06:53,508 --> 01:07:02,550
Not like that. For real.

918
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:06,654
Elena.

919
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:12,727
You're supposed to know how to
take a risk.

920
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:19,800
This is my cab. Yours is the
next one. See you tomorrow.

921
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:41,989
Hi.

922
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:42,956
Morning.

923
01:07:43,024 --> 01:07:44,925
Were you waiting for me?

924
01:07:44,993 --> 01:07:50,397
Yeah. You want to get some
sleep?

925
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:53,701
It's already morning.
Why bother?

926
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:59,473
What do you want most of all
right now?

927
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:01,342
Seriously?

928
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,076
Absolutely.

929
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,879
An interesting question.

930
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:08,115
There's no rush.
Think about it.

931
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:12,920
I'd really like to see the house
where I grew up.

932
01:08:12,987 --> 01:08:19,059
Something has definitely changed
here.

933
01:08:19,127 --> 01:08:22,897
I can't believe this.
We're finally alone.

934
01:08:22,964 --> 01:08:29,269
To think that, in this yard, I
spent several thousand of my
childhood days.

935
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:32,773
I recognize it, but, at the same
time, I don't.

936
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:37,645
I have this strange feeling I'm going
to wake up in New York any minute now.

937
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:43,518
You know, I can't find our
windows.

938
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,620
It's as if they disappeared.

939
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:50,491
Maybe I am sleeping?
Or losing my mind.

940
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:55,262
The window has been bricked up. The
building was remodeled five years ago.

941
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:58,699
They were going to tear it down,
but changed their minds.

942
01:09:03,738 --> 01:09:05,806
Stop, kike!

943
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:07,441
Stop. kike! Stop kike!
Kike-take a hike!

944
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:08,709
We've got you now!

945
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,310
Ugh! I smell garlic!

946
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:14,048
Ugh! The kike stinks of garlic!

947
01:09:14,115 --> 01:09:16,551
You're Sasha Greenberg, aren't
you?

948
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:18,452
Yes, I am.

949
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,321
I'm Volodya Listov.

950
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,890
We've got you now, you dirty
kike!

951
01:09:22,957 --> 01:09:25,560
On your knees, kike!
Down, I said!

952
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:28,696
Do you recognize me?

953
01:09:28,763 --> 01:09:34,902
We haven't seen each other in,
what, since we were twelve or
so, when you moved away.

954
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,337
I recognized you, though.

955
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:39,407
We used to be friends when we
were kids.

956
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:43,911
When we were little, we used to fight,
of course, but kids are supposed to.

957
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,680
Repeat after me:
"I am a dirty kike..."

958
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:48,081
I am a dirty kike...

959
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:49,249
"I stink."

960
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,318
I stink.

961
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:52,620
"I am gross."

962
01:09:52,687 --> 01:09:54,555
I am gross.

963
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:57,792
"I am begging you to beat the
shit out of me."

964
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:00,360
I am begging you to beat me.

965
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,697
Then we used to share a desk at
school.

966
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:09,970
I, a young pioneer of the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics,

967
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:22,349
here, before my comrades, do
solemnly swear to always uphold
the ideals of Lenin and Stalin

968
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:28,556
and to fight for Victory of
Communism everywhere.

969
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:34,261
To fight for the ideals of Lenin
and Stalin. Be prepared!

970
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:37,164
Always prepared!

971
01:10:51,713 --> 01:10:57,751
You're lucky you ran into me. I am
the only one left of the old tenants.

972
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:02,356
Everyone's been moved out to the
new developments.

973
01:11:02,423 --> 01:11:05,092
The building's not the same,
either.

974
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,427
All the walls have been moved
around.

975
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:11,331
I can't even show you your old apartment
- it doesn't exist anymore.

976
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:15,335
I am the only one who could get
a place here after they renovated.

977
01:11:15,403 --> 01:11:21,641
And that, um, only because it was mainly
my efforts that saved the building.

978
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,445
You must be pretty powerful to
be able to save buildings.

979
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:28,115
Don't you know? I'm a writer.

980
01:11:28,182 --> 01:11:31,819
Pretty famous too, in a way.
Where do you live, What do you do?

981
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:34,955
I live in America. I'm in
cosmology -

982
01:11:35,023 --> 01:11:38,058
that's a science about how the
Universe works.

983
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:43,530
Interesting stuff! Do you want
to come in for a while?

984
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:46,100
We can talk, have a drink over
old times.

985
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:49,236
I really don't think so.
We're on a very tight schedule.

986
01:11:49,303 --> 01:11:50,905
We have to meet someone in a
half hour.

987
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:54,341
Krymsky. At his church. Then
Sasha has to give his report.

988
01:11:54,409 --> 01:12:02,082
Krymsky, the millionaire? I know
him a little. If you don't mind,
I'd like to join you.

989
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:08,989
Morning. Hello.
Hello. Good morning.

990
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:17,230
Ah, my worst enemy!
Good of you to join us!

991
01:12:17,298 --> 01:12:19,066
What brings you here?

992
01:12:19,133 --> 01:12:23,103
I've long been curious to see what
you do here. You have an objection?

993
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:25,673
Not at all! Welcome, welcome.

994
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:30,477
Any tongue-lashing by your magazine
is just free publicity for us.

995
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:40,220
You see, he calls me his worst enemy!
And he's not far from the truth.

996
01:12:40,288 --> 01:12:42,856
Why, of course, I am.

997
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:47,060
Look! He's turned God's house into
a honky-tonk, for Christ's sake!

998
01:12:47,128 --> 01:12:50,397
You people want me to be happy
about it?

999
01:12:50,464 --> 01:12:52,933
Would you prefer if it were
still a warehouse for boots?

1000
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,269
I didn't turn it into a
warehouse.

1001
01:12:55,336 --> 01:12:58,839
I would prefer it to still be a
house of God.

1002
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:03,477
Him and his lot, you wait,
they'll be calling me a
reactionary and an anti-Semite.

1003
01:13:03,544 --> 01:13:06,379
Well, if you want, I am a
reactionary.

1004
01:13:06,447 --> 01:13:10,584
Now they're poisoning our youth
with this rock'n'roll crap.

1005
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:14,688
By "they" you mean Jews, of
course?

1006
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:18,792
You see, what did I tell you?

1007
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:22,563
You know, there are Jews and
there are Jews.

1008
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:28,769
I have friends who are Jews.

1009
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,004
A profiteer like him, who's
Russian,

1010
01:13:31,072 --> 01:13:34,541
why, he's just as revolting to
me as a Jew profiteer.

1011
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:39,580
Anyway, nobody can deny that
there's a disproportionately
large amount of Jews

1012
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:43,584
in this new "private sector". Just
as there was in the revolution.

1013
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:47,054
And just who do you think made
warehouses out of churches?

1014
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:51,324
Jews are so overly sensitive to
criticism.

1015
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:59,467
At Nuremberg they tried such
critics! Understand?

1016
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:04,738
Yes, no doubt Russia of 1992

1017
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:07,508
was drastically different from
Russia prior to Perestroika.

1018
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:12,312
In the churches boot warehouses
were replaced with
freedom-loving rock singers,

1019
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:16,649
and Krimsky was running business
activities which in the Russia I left

1020
01:14:16,717 --> 01:14:20,821
were punishable by years of
imprisonment or even execution
by firing squads.

1021
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,791
So, what does your company
really do?

1022
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:27,595
Are you a scientific research facility,
a film studio, or a rock theatre?

1023
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:30,965
It's like a daisy flower
- in the center is the main enterprise

1024
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:33,834
from which sprout separate
ventures and petals.

1025
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:36,636
Our major petal I'll be showing
you tomorrow.

1026
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:39,873
Site seeing tours of Moscow on
"troikas" with gypsies.

1027
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,409
"Troikas"? What's "troikas"?

1028
01:14:42,477 --> 01:14:44,678
They're carriages drawn by three
horses together.

1029
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:48,315
Very Russian.
Very Russian.

1030
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:52,619
They're waiting for us in the editing
room, ready to start, I believe.

1031
01:14:52,686 --> 01:14:54,822
And now we were going to see footage,

1032
01:14:54,889 --> 01:14:58,558
that not long ago was banned
from any screening at all.

1033
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:01,461
So why didn't all these changes
in Russia thrill me?

1034
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:05,766
This is just raw footage.

1035
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:09,870
I understand you're gathering footage
like that from all over the world.

1036
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,305
I'll comment as we go along.

1037
01:15:12,373 --> 01:15:18,311
Every year Soviet factories release
over sixty million tons of pollutants.

1038
01:15:18,379 --> 01:15:21,615
In sixty-eight different
industrial centers,

1039
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:25,819
the air pollution level exceeds
the norm by 100 times.

1040
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:30,958
Twenty percent of Soviet citizens
live in ecologically critical areas

1041
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:36,763
and another thirty five to forty
percent in areas "ecologically unsafe".

1042
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,970
This is about 175 million people
- approximately eight times the
population of Canada.

1043
01:15:43,037 --> 01:15:47,140
The Black sea is overloaded with
pollutants.

1044
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:50,344
Every year they dump 30 tons of
mercury in there,

1045
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:54,948
not to mention about dozens of
other poisons. The sea is dying.

1046
01:15:55,016 --> 01:15:58,719
Two and a half million dolphins
that used to live here not long ago,

1047
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,221
are now survived by only eighty
thousand.

1048
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:07,294
The great Russian Volga river, it
contains approximately 700 times

1049
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:10,931
the allowed con-centration of
oil-industry wastes.

1050
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:15,468
Most of Soviet rivers are in
much worse condition.

1051
01:16:15,536 --> 01:16:19,306
A farmer passing by threw his
cigarette butt in this river.

1052
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:26,213
Is anyone tired? Should I stop?

1053
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,215
These things aren't only
happening in Russia.

1054
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,317
I'd like to show you some of my
footage.

1055
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,352
"The time is out of joint" -

1056
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,454
Shakespeare said it half a
millennium ago

1057
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:38,025
and we are happily repeating it
century after century

1058
01:16:38,092 --> 01:16:40,961
and keep switching it out of
joint endlessly.

1059
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:43,731
How long can it go on?

1060
01:16:43,798 --> 01:16:48,669
The planet life was healthier in
the time of Shakespeare.

1061
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:52,940
And family life is definitely
deteriorated since then.

1062
01:16:53,007 --> 01:16:57,511
I hate you. I hate your face, I hate
your voice, I hate the air you breathe.

1063
01:16:57,578 --> 01:16:59,212
At least if I judge by mine.

1064
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,248
Sasha, marry me!

1065
01:17:01,315 --> 01:17:05,052
You know... I love Helen.

1066
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:15,162
It's crazy! You told me you've
never had sex like this before!
With anybody!

1067
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,897
And I'll say it again.

1068
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,999
You said you couldn't live with
Helen.

1069
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,167
I did.

1070
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:21,935
And she left you?

1071
01:17:22,003 --> 01:17:23,503
She did.

1072
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:26,106
Then marry me... I'll stop
making films if you want.

1073
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:32,546
I can be a really good wife.
I'll make breakfast for you
every morning. Want me to?

1074
01:17:32,613 --> 01:17:34,514
No.

1075
01:17:34,582 --> 01:17:36,283
Why?

1076
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:39,753
Because this is like a deja-vu!
Because I've been through this
with Helen!

1077
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:43,023
And the recurrence of this
pattern scares the hell out of me.

1078
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:46,259
Helen and I have been through
enough insanity.

1079
01:17:46,327 --> 01:17:47,861
I don't want that for you.

1080
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,429
But I won't be like that.

1081
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:52,099
If you marry me you will.
I know.

1082
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:54,534
Why?

1083
01:17:54,602 --> 01:17:57,036
Because the world's gone crazy!

1084
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:02,275
Because the traditional family
has crumbled and there's nothing
left to replace it!

1085
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:09,216
Everyone - women, nations,
Soviet physicists - everyone
wants freedom

1086
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:14,521
but, sometimes, the price of
freedom is collapse.

1087
01:18:19,794 --> 01:18:24,397
Before I deliver my paper, I
would like to say a few words.

1088
01:18:24,465 --> 01:18:28,301
The world is changing at an
incredible pace.

1089
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:34,508
When I was younger, scientists were
the undisputed heroes of my time.

1090
01:18:34,575 --> 01:18:39,813
The 19th century philosophy still
prevailed, war, famine, and disease

1091
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:45,119
would all magically disappear if we
could only educate people properly.

1092
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:51,291
The Biblical parable of Adam and
Eve's banishment from the garden
of Eden after

1093
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:57,030
eating forbidden fruit from the
tree of knowledge was reduced to
a silly fairy tale.

1094
01:18:57,098 --> 01:19:05,505
The very thought that knowledge
could bring anything except
absolute bliss was laughable.

1095
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:11,645
The curiosity that is the essential
characteristic of every scientist

1096
01:19:11,712 --> 01:19:15,882
was regarded as a moral virtue.

1097
01:19:15,949 --> 01:19:22,689
It was referred to as "sacred
curiosity".

1098
01:19:22,756 --> 01:19:26,326
My own professor, Doctor
Heinrich Gross,

1099
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:30,764
would do everything in his power to
instill this quality into his students.

1100
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:34,168
I do the same thing now, with my
new students!

1101
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:36,904
It is the only moral basis of
humanity,

1102
01:19:36,971 --> 01:19:40,473
the only thing that separates us from
the animals, this sacred curiosity!

1103
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:44,711
This is correct. Animals do not
have this quality.

1104
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:52,585
Perhaps that is why animals haven't
tried to annihilate the human race,

1105
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:57,457
and humans, are even now,
successfully ridding the planet
of all animal life.

1106
01:19:57,525 --> 01:20:09,769
My friends, tell me honestly,
have you ever thought that man
is the plague of the Universe?

1107
01:20:09,837 --> 01:20:16,143
God's punishment, an implement
of death and destruction,

1108
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:21,982
something akin to a virus or a
cancerous growth that exists
only to destroy all life?

1109
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,850
Demagogy!

1110
01:20:23,918 --> 01:20:30,657
Do not fear, Master, I am not
calling for the banishment of science.

1111
01:20:38,299 --> 01:20:45,205
I felt I had to say these words.
Thank you for indulging me.

1112
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:55,215
Ah, let's now get down to
business.

1113
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:03,890
How close is your model to a final
understanding of the Universe?

1114
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,458
I feel it's very close.

1115
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:07,560
Excuse me, I think I missed
something:

1116
01:21:07,628 --> 01:21:10,497
does your theory offer an
immediate solution for any of
today's problems?

1117
01:21:10,564 --> 01:21:12,032
I need a drink.

1118
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,867
You need some sleep.

1119
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,969
Do you really think I could
sleep? I need a drink first.

1120
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,671
You should try. Call room
service.

1121
01:21:18,739 --> 01:21:20,673
But you probably won't get it
until tomorrow.

1122
01:21:20,741 --> 01:21:22,809
Was I really that bad?

1123
01:21:22,877 --> 01:21:24,945
Everyone seemed to like it.

1124
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:26,613
I feel horrible.

1125
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,383
Get some sleep, Sasha.

1126
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,952
If I don't have a drink I'm
going to throw up.

1127
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:35,522
I heard your parents are giving
a party for Sasha this evening.

1128
01:21:35,589 --> 01:21:37,524
Um um. Yes, they are.

1129
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:40,494
Are you expecting a lot of
people?

1130
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:42,595
A dozen or so...

1131
01:21:42,663 --> 01:21:47,567
We're going to have a trial run
of our Moscow tours on troikas
with gypsies right now,

1132
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:50,870
and I would like to invite your
group.

1133
01:21:50,938 --> 01:21:52,905
Sasha and Jill are coming.

1134
01:21:52,973 --> 01:21:54,807
Thank you.

1135
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,744
I'd also like to ask if you
would invite us to your little
gathering this evening.

1136
01:21:57,811 --> 01:21:59,879
Eh.

1137
01:21:59,947 --> 01:22:01,414
Thanks. Yeah.

1138
01:22:01,482 --> 01:22:03,317
It was awful. Just awful.

1139
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:07,387
Sasha, you're a hero here and
you want to be one.

1140
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:11,624
I guess you had to think of
something to impress the little girl!

1141
01:22:11,692 --> 01:22:16,196
Now, why did you say that?
Supposedly, you brought me up
here with good intentions.

1142
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,399
Weren't you trying to help, not
make it worse?

1143
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:23,003
Cut it out! I am not your
mother! I'm not even your wife.

1144
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,372
Leave, then.

1145
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,673
Fine!

1146
01:22:28,242 --> 01:22:29,542
Come in!

1147
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,645
What happened to you? The
gypsies are waiting!

1148
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:30,470
Stop here for one second. I see
they just got a vodka delivery.

1149
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:51,858
What, are all these grandmothers
alcoholics or something?

1150
01:23:51,925 --> 01:23:55,261
They get forty rubles a month
pension.

1151
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:59,066
If you remember, we paid thirty
for a bottle of vodka the other day.

1152
01:23:59,133 --> 01:24:05,538
Tonight, each of them will sell
a bottle and raise their
standard of living almost twice.

1153
01:24:05,606 --> 01:24:09,809
It's called survival.

1154
01:24:09,877 --> 01:24:13,647
Forty rubles! That's enough for
one dinner at a restaurant!

1155
01:24:13,714 --> 01:24:19,452
With no drinks. But why would
grandmothers go to restaurants anyway?

1156
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,657
Aye, brave beautiful new world!

1157
01:24:23,724 --> 01:24:32,399
We are worrying about having too
much freedom

1158
01:24:32,466 --> 01:24:35,401
and the old ladies are fighting
to survive on the monthly pension

1159
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:38,571
that can't buy one diner in a
restaurant!

1160
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,942
Where are we headed?

1161
01:24:48,849 --> 01:24:51,350
More sanctions they are imposing
on us!

1162
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:55,222
A month ago, they permitted
selling at the Rizhsky Market,

1163
01:24:55,289 --> 01:24:57,457
and now they're forbidding it
again!

1164
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:01,428
What are people supposed to do
with all the goods they
manufactured to sell there?

1165
01:25:01,495 --> 01:25:04,598
How's anyone going to make any
money this way?

1166
01:25:04,665 --> 01:25:06,566
That's a weak government for
you.

1167
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,769
Those helpless liberals don't know
whether they're coming or going.

1168
01:25:09,837 --> 01:25:14,507
If it were up to me, I'd shut that
Rizhsky Market down once and for all.

1169
01:25:14,575 --> 01:25:18,411
It's a joke! A fur hat costs
three times my pension!

1170
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,681
Who's going to buy it? Only
another speculator, like themselves!

1171
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,551
So! In a government store you'd
never even see a hat!

1172
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:26,452
So, who needs hats anyway!

1173
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,823
First it was the party bigwigs
who went around in fur hats, now
it's the speculators.

1174
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:32,959
It's never the plain folk.

1175
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:37,263
I don't care if I'm being
exploited by Brezhnev or a
speculator - it's all the same!

1176
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:40,767
We need justice, equality.
Everyone should be the same.

1177
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:42,902
There! The true voice of Russia!

1178
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:47,274
Wait a minute! If you don't let
anyone make the hats, you'll all
be going around bareheaded!

1179
01:25:47,341 --> 01:25:50,209
Better without hats than without
justice!

1180
01:25:50,277 --> 01:25:52,178
Where did you get that?

1181
01:25:52,245 --> 01:25:56,149
We'll spare no expense when it
comes to our own flesh and blood!

1182
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:59,085
You bought it at a private
market. You can't get piglets at
a government store.

1183
01:25:59,153 --> 01:26:02,889
So let them grow pigs!
But not at these prices!

1184
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,891
What prices?!
They start from nothing!

1185
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:09,161
If they don't survive, you'll
never see any piglets at all!

1186
01:26:09,229 --> 01:26:11,964
During Stalin you could get
piglets in the stores!

1187
01:26:12,032 --> 01:26:16,836
During Stalin twenty million
were slaving away in labor camps!

1188
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:20,674
And if you were ten minutes late
for work they'd put you away too!

1189
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:22,709
At least there was order.

1190
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:24,611
You see! I rest my case!

1191
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,947
Chaos! Disaster! We're headed
for civil war!

1192
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:32,786
I must say, I don't envy Gorbachev.
Trying to get this country to budge.

1193
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:37,089
You've budged it enough.
Fortunately it won't be much longer.

1194
01:26:37,157 --> 01:26:38,524
What's that supposed to mean?

1195
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,394
We're going to set things
straight.

1196
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,496
And who died and left you boss?

1197
01:26:43,564 --> 01:26:49,435
We don't need your blessing. As
soon as these liberals bring the
country to complete collapse,

1198
01:26:49,503 --> 01:26:52,705
it will fall into our hands,
like a ripe fruit.

1199
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:07,354
May I have this dance?

1200
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:09,356
I can't dance to this.

1201
01:27:09,423 --> 01:27:18,798
Oh, it's simple. Come, come,
I'll show you. Come.

1202
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:24,537
What is the reason for all this
gloom?

1203
01:27:24,605 --> 01:27:33,380
It's all so boring. All these
stupid arguments and now this
ridiculous tango.

1204
01:27:33,447 --> 01:27:36,482
You can leave if you're bored.
No one's keeping you from being
with kids your own age.

1205
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:39,686
Kids my own age! What a joke!

1206
01:27:39,753 --> 01:27:48,895
Professor, you're a wise man.
Tell me, why is it all so awful?

1207
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:51,464
Why is everybody so mean?

1208
01:27:51,531 --> 01:27:58,705
Whenever I tell someone I want
to go to America, they tell
"it's no better over there"!

1209
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:02,675
Like they want to leave you
nothing to hope for.

1210
01:28:02,743 --> 01:28:09,181
In Chekhov's play, the three sisters
want to get away from the boonies,

1211
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:11,885
they keep saying "we want to go
to Moscow",

1212
01:28:11,952 --> 01:28:18,958
and in the whole play there's no
villain mean enough to tell them
"it sucks there too".

1213
01:28:19,026 --> 01:28:24,330
Happiness is not found in Moscow
or New York. It's here.

1214
01:28:24,398 --> 01:28:26,733
You just need time to find it.

1215
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,402
Have you?

1216
01:28:29,069 --> 01:28:31,203
I have.

1217
01:28:31,271 --> 01:28:39,646
Want to go see the old church?

1218
01:28:39,713 --> 01:28:40,980
What's the matter?

1219
01:28:41,048 --> 01:28:46,653
My mother's interest in
architecture is amazing!

1220
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:51,590
She has just invited Greenberg
to see an old church!

1221
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,493
A church! What church?
Where is it?

1222
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:58,765
That's right! There's a famous
old church near here.

1223
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:01,400
Let's all go see it together!

1224
01:29:01,468 --> 01:29:06,405
Many years past since this
glorious morning in Moscow,

1225
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:12,512
but I still remember it as it
happened only yesterday.

1226
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:18,150
You seem troubled, my man. What
have you to be troubled about?

1227
01:29:18,218 --> 01:29:22,922
Master, life has somehow lost
much of its luster.

1228
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:29,261
It's called a mid-life crisis.
It's much similar to adolescence.

1229
01:29:29,329 --> 01:29:31,063
It's a troubled time. Difficult.

1230
01:29:31,131 --> 01:29:34,501
But It will pass. You'll get
over it. Everyone does.

1231
01:29:34,568 --> 01:29:37,770
I feel like my mid-life crisis
is also happening to Russia,

1232
01:29:37,838 --> 01:29:40,707
to America, to the whole human
race.

1233
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:44,511
And if you believe the theory that
man is a reflection of the Universe,

1234
01:29:44,578 --> 01:29:48,381
than, it's also happening to the
Universe.

1235
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:52,485
I don't understand this world,
this life.

1236
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:59,926
There's a story, of a woman who
asked Thomas Alva Edison to
explain electricity

1237
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:02,896
because she did not understand
it.

1238
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:08,067
He answered, that he didn't
understand it either and told
her to "Just use it!"

1239
01:30:08,135 --> 01:30:12,604
Here it is called "perestroika"
- the restructuring.

1240
01:30:12,672 --> 01:30:16,308
Although some people seem to think
it's a complete collapse, an end.

1241
01:30:16,376 --> 01:30:21,080
If you look at the film Jill is
making you'd think the whole
planet was doomed for sure.

1242
01:30:21,148 --> 01:30:25,584
You tell me it's only a phase,
that I'm going through a
"restructuring" of my own,

1243
01:30:25,652 --> 01:30:28,888
but I feel like my life is
ending.

1244
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:35,762
Adolescents feel that way. Some
of them even go so far as to
actually commit suicide.

1245
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:40,166
But there are few of those.
Most restructure and survive.

1246
01:30:40,233 --> 01:30:46,405
Look at Elena. How she suffers!
That's also a "perestroika", of sorts.

1247
01:30:46,473 --> 01:30:51,077
And it's not so bad. It's, in
fact, what makes her so attractive.

1248
01:30:51,144 --> 01:30:53,145
To you, for example.

1249
01:30:53,213 --> 01:30:55,648
Master, I am old enough to be
her father!

1250
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:57,249
So what?

1251
01:30:57,317 --> 01:31:00,186
Why do you tell me all this?

1252
01:31:00,253 --> 01:31:04,824
To ease your conscience about
your attraction to Elena.

1253
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:09,695
It's not so easy! It's quite possible,
you know, that she is my daughter.

1254
01:31:09,763 --> 01:31:12,298
No, she is not.

1255
01:31:12,366 --> 01:31:14,433
What makes you so sure?

1256
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:19,005
Because she is my daughter.

1257
01:31:19,072 --> 01:31:24,443
My loss, your luck.

1258
01:31:36,589 --> 01:31:39,225
Enjoying the architecture?

1259
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:44,864
There is something interesting I
can show you, even my mother
doesn't know about it.

1260
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:50,837
Interested? Let's go.

1261
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:33,880
I come up here a lot. At dawn.
Alone. I like to be alone.

1262
01:32:33,947 --> 01:32:42,722
You know, Professor Gross told
me that happiness must be found
within oneself. Do you agree?

1263
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:43,756
I guess.

1264
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:44,957
Did you find it?

1265
01:32:45,025 --> 01:32:46,159
I'm afraid not.

1266
01:32:46,226 --> 01:32:47,426
Why not?

1267
01:32:47,494 --> 01:32:49,662
I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.

1268
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,798
Sometimes it's like some outer
force prevents it:

1269
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:58,104
how can I be happy when the
world's gone mad and everything
around me is collapsing.

1270
01:32:58,172 --> 01:33:04,177
Is it the people? Why they don't
want to understand? Why they
don't want to hear?

1271
01:33:04,244 --> 01:33:05,778
Yes.

1272
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:11,317
They don't hear. Not you, not
each other. Not themselves.

1273
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:17,456
Nobody listens. But we can make
them hear!

1274
01:33:17,524 --> 01:33:23,662
Come on! Help me! You said you
heard me!

1275
01:36:07,074 --> 01:36:08,074
