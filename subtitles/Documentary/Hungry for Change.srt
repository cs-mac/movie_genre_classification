00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:59,785
It seems really odd in today's world 
that we have more than ever before,

9
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:02,934
and yet, I think, in a very lax state, 

10
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:06,293
it is a world of abundance and an attitude of lack.

11
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:09,579
The truth is that we are no longer eating food any more,

12
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,301
we are eating food-like products,

13
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:15,792
and they are adorned, they are made to look better,

14
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:17,209
and smell better,

15
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,420
so that people are attracted to them.

16
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,896
"More than 60 billion dollars is spent each year 

17
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:23,525
on diet and weight loss products in the US."

18
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:25,941
Marketing essentially lies to you,

19
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:28,434
because it presents you with the promise

20
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:30,826
that you'll be sexy, popular and cool

21
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:35,096
but in reality you'll be obese, miserable and sick.

22
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:41,199
I think we are barking up the wrong tree.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,201
People are looking for a result that is 

24
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:47,191
superficial, just to look good.

25
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:51,239
And they don't really consider that 
that could be done 

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,213
from the inside out.

27
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,695
"Up to two-thirds of those on a diet" 

28
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,787
"regain more weight than when they started."

29
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,288
University of California, LA.

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,664
The first chapter of the first book I ever wrote was called

31
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:05,118
"Diets Don't Work", because they are temporary.

32
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,081
They have failure built right in to them.

33
00:02:08,382 --> 00:02:10,224
You can lose weight on a diet,

34
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,744
but it's a little bit like borrow from Peter to pay Paul.

35
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:15,970
You can get 4 kilos off your body from sheer force,

36
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,832
but you'll have to pay back with interest.

37
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,235
People know this,

38
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:21,445
Then why highly intelligent people do not stop it?

39
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:23,845
Because they don't know the nature of the trap.

40
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:28,501
There was a point where I allowed myself to get to 300 pounds [136 kg],

41
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:32,562
and that world, as opposed to the current world,

42
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:34,863
is vastly different.

43
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:37,039
Life was just not fun.

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,638
The only fun I had, you know,

45
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,786
was watching people on TV having fun.

46
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:42,754
I was over 400 pounds [181 kg].

47
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:44,647
I had very bad sleep apnea,

48
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,142
I was borderline type 2 diabetic.

49
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:49,329
I was a cheeseburger away from a heart attack.

50
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,330
And I said "no more."

51
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:54,072
This is how we are, as mammals.

52
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,617
It's not your fault.

53
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,297
You are programmed to put on fat 

54
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,382
whenever there is food available.

55
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:02,100
I was 31 when I realized 

56
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,425
I don't know what I am doing,

57
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:05,587
I don't know how to take care of myself.

58
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:07,158
And I am sick.

59
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,238
So I had to go back and learn 

60
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,570
all the things that I wish I had known as a child.

61
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,213
"The average American consumes"

62
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:16,616
"more than 150 pounds [68 kg] of sugar 
and sweeteners each year."

63
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,168
U.S. Department of Agriculture.

64
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,560
Sugar is without question *the* cocaine of the food world,

65
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:25,043
but they're trying to get a way of hiding that drug 
within "food".

66
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,056
Sugar is in everything.

67
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:30,491
In America,

68
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:33,631
we are eating about 22 teaspoons of sugar a day.

69
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,432
When we get on to a real diet,

70
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,927
in the sense of what a species habitually eats

71
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,343
to sustain itself,

72
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,258
Not to think about these things any more

73
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,259
This is really the problem today,

74
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,160
because people are overfed,

75
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,039
but they're also starving to death.

76
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:56,349
Pool party this Saturday. I hope you can make it!

77
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,450
Jason will be there. Amanda

78
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:03,418
Won't be coming.

79
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,851
Having a bad fat week.

80
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,900
We are violating our body's basic survival laws.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,032
The whole dieting paradigm is flawed.

82
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,133
HUNGRY FOR A CHANGE

83
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:21,439
It's not just what you're eating, it's also what's eating you.

84
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:31,306
All through our history as a species,

85
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,304
the big challenge is to find calories.

86
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,331
And so, our bodies 

87
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:36,852
are biologically adapted to this.

88
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:38,563
We seek calorie sources.

89
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:43,054
When I say that, particularly what I'm talking about 
are fats and sugars.

90
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,825
If we taste something fatty or something sweet,

91
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:51,000
Daniel Vitalis : 
the immediate signal is "yes, I want more of this."

92
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,317
Because for our hunter-gatherer ancestors,

93
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,667
and that goes right up to a few hundred years ago,

94
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,690
anywhere they could find fat or sugar,

95
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,867
meant survival for those people.

96
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,068
And carrying forth their genetics.

97
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,927
Dr. Christiane Northrup : 
It's not your fault.

98
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,807
This is how we are as mammals.

99
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:11,536
We've lived on the Earth for millennia 
where there was a food shortage.

100
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,215
You are programmed to put on fat

101
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,402
whenever there is food available.

102
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:20,905
But now there is a lot of food available, 
but it's the wrong kind.

103
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:23,392
And so we've been programmed for millennia,

104
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,016
to store up for the winter,

105
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,590
but winter doesn't come.

106
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,210
Jon Gabriel : Thousands of years ago,

107
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,884
when we lived outdoors and we didn't know where 
our next meal was coming from,

108
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,356
if there was a famine 

109
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,848
because it was a cold winter or whatever reason,

110
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:39,725
your body is going to want to hold extra weight to protect you from that.

111
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:41,439
And famine is a stress.

112
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,892
And if you go through that stress, your body is going to say,

113
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:47,270
"We need an extra 10 lbs [4 kg] to protect us from famine."

114
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:50,119
One of the really interesting things about hunter-gatherers

115
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,940
or people who do a very moderate amount of agriculture.

116
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,550
We can call them hunter-gatherer gardeners.

117
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,132
What we see in those people is that

118
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,613
they have an extremely high amount of nutrition

119
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:03,710
And an extremely low amount of calories in their food

120
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:07,717
Compared to people in modern civilizations

121
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,352
which have a very high amount of calories

122
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,811
and a very low amount of nutrition available to them.

123
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,822
Today we have so many calorie sources,

124
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,866
but we still have the same signal.

125
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,125
So if somebody bites into a burger 

126
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:21,879
or they take a sip off a milk-shake,

127
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,340
and they get those fats and those sugars,

128
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,742
and their body says "Yes, more",

129
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:27,999
because it is used to behaving in 

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,255
an environment where there are feasts and there's famine.

131
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,581
The problem is that we've got feasts like nobody's business,

132
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:34,992
and we just don't have any famine.

133
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,002
Nutrition Facts

134
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,950
You can eat to your heart's content,

135
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,999
you can eat 10,000 calories a day.

136
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,176
And if you are not getting the specific nutrients 
your body needs 

137
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:48,117
in a way that it can digest and assimilate them,

138
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,476
then you are starving on a nutritional basis. 

139
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,247
And as long as you're starving on a nutritional basis 

140
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,886
your body is going to stay hungry, 

141
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:56,117
to get those specific nutrients.

142
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,020
Now, man-made foods, like bread and sugar,

143
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,580
trick your body into thinking (...and table salt)

144
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,224
trick your body into thinking 

145
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,769
you're getting specific nutrients.

146
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:08,340
And so your body stays hungry for them, but

147
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:11,491
then the cells don't get nourished. 
And as long as the cells aren't getting nourished

148
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,687
you're starving on a cellular level.

149
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:15,629
So what happens for the average person,

150
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,714
today in our civilization 

151
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,239
is they're not getting enough, say, vitamin A. ..

152
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,599
or they're not getting enough vitamin D, 
they're not even getting enough vitamin C.

153
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,084
They are chronically starved of nutrients. 

154
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,559
So they keep eating and eating and eating.

155
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,216
But the foods that they keep eating 

156
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,417
don't have enough of these nutrients 

157
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,379
for them ever to get the stock that they need.

158
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,978
But what those foods do have, is a lot of calories.

159
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,115
So what happens is that they start to pack 

160
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:42,150
these calories onto their body in the form of body fat

161
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,269
And the body starts to accumulate or bio-accumulate,

162
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:47,793
too much, not just fat, but also

163
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:50,788
all the associated pollutants that are in that food supply.

164
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,759
We see things like diabetes,

165
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,253
we see blood sugar imbalance issues,

166
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,199
and we see a lot of weight gain.

167
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,326
So this is really a problem today,

168
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,270
because people are overfed,

169
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,170
but they're also starving to death.

170
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:10,346
Kris Carr : Author of "Crazy Sexy Cancer", 2007.

171
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,481
Kris Carr was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer 

172
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,068
in 2003 at age 31.

173
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,296
KRIS CARR : I was 31 when I realized 
I don't know what I am doing,

174
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:25,039
I don't know how to take care of myself, and I am sick.

175
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,870
So I had to go back 

176
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:30,589
and learn all the things I wish I had known as a child,

177
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,685
as a teenager, as a young adult.

178
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,536
Step 1 was just going back and understanding 
how do I take care of myself

179
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:42,570
what do I put in this body, 
that is compromised at this point? 

180
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,774
How do I boost my immune system,

181
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,230
how do I increase my longevity?

182
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,254
And again, that comes back to what you eat,

183
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:50,769
what you drink and what you think.

184
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,552
David Wolfe : 
From a very cursory surface perspective

185
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:56,830
what's actually happened is that we left farms,

186
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,534
we got to living in cities, and forgot about our instincts.

187
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,830
And that's led to an obesity crisis,

188
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:10,602
it's led to a crisis of misunderstanding 
of what a natural diet includes

189
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:12,449
and it's also left us with a little bit of ...

190
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:17,936
a disparity and confusion. We don't know what to do now.

191
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,159
Dr. Alejandro Jünger : 
The problem is that we are not eating food any more,

192
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,020
we are eating food-like products.

193
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,489
And they are adorned, they are made to look better,

194
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:50,344
and smell better and be presented

195
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,593
so that people are attracted to them.

196
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,055
And not only that,

197
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:57,956
they are also made so that they can have a long shelf life.

198
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:01,429
Otherwise the supermarket would be losing money,
and the manufacturers as well.

199
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,944
So the objective is not really to give you ...

200
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:08,680
a healthy product,

201
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,932
it is to give you a product that will make you buy it, 

202
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,630
that will last long, 

203
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,454
and will make a lot of profit for 
the company that's producing it, right?

204
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,451
Ugh!

205
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:27,861
Okay, 9:15, it could be worse.

206
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,460
Oh yeah, it's worse.

207
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,666
Oh my goodness, it's Jason.

208
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:44,971
- Hi there. 
- Hi.

209
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,089
Your hair looks nice today.

210
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,940
He likes my hair.

211
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,040
What's that supposed to mean? What about every other day?

212
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,640
He's looking at you. Quick, say something!

213
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,316
Thanks, you too.

214
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,955
Mike Adams : We've got these processed junk food diets,

215
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,818
that people are on ...
but it's also combined 

216
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,779
with this relatively new indoor lifestyle. 

217
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,014
Our bodies were not designed to sit at desks,

218
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:32,520
under fluorescent lights, in office cubicles 

219
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:35,580
and chow down processed junk food all day long

220
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,428
without getting exercise.

221
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,645
If you do just one of these things, 
it may not be so bad

222
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:45,099
but by combining them both, 
then you end up with a disaster.

223
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:48,144
Where you've got way too many calories, 
not enough nutrients,

224
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:51,490
and not enough use of those calories. 

225
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,406
David Wolfe : And those particular factors,
when combined together 

226
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,338
create an obesity epidemic, 
they create a low energy epidemic,

227
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:01,489
they create a fog in cognition,

228
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:04,773
they create an environment where people begin 

229
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,711
to lose the will to take self-responsibility,

230
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,570
so then they turn it all over to a doctor 

231
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,397
who is only able to prescribe a pharmaceutical pill

232
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:19,502
which doesn't address the real symptoms,
which are varied and complex.

233
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:45,299
Jason Vale : For me, the biggest cause of obesity, 
bar none, is addiction. 

234
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,032
But to understand the level of addiction that we've got 

235
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,092
might be challenging for some because 

236
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:53,079
people can understand addiction to cigarettes,

237
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,777
because that has now been proven,

238
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,468
they can understand the addiction to alcohol ...

239
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,242
But with food, people say "look, I can stop eating".

240
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,586
But unfortunately, like the tobacco companies, 

241
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:06,099
if you go back to the late 60s and early 70s,

242
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,979
who knowingly added more Nicotine

243
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,040
to cigarettes in order to make them addictive.

244
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,759
I used to smoke 40 to 60 cigarettes a day. Why did I?

245
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,789
One cigarette led to a chain reaction, 

246
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,700
which then led to another one, another and another.

247
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,935
I said to people that the reason why I smoke 
is that I enjoy it,

248
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:33,653
that I love it. 
But I would hit my head 

249
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:35,271
on the pillow praying that I would wake up 
and become a non-smoker every day.

250
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:39,800
Every smoker on Earth would love to 
not want cigarettes, if they could.

251
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,633
There is an invisible prison

252
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:45,149
that catches people in the Nicotine trap.

253
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,509
The need for a cigarette is only caused by the last one,

254
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,799
because when you have a cigarette,

255
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,613
Nicotine goes in your system, 
Nicotine has to get out of your system

256
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,070
or you would die.

257
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,836
When somebody has a cigarette, after the 
withdrawal from nicotine

258
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:02,130
it replaces the Nicotine back into their bloodstream.

259
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,740
And they feel better, they feel good.

260
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,120
But that's like putting on a pair of tight shoes 

261
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,970
to get the pleasure of taking them off.

262
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,100
And the way that cigarettes are addictive

263
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,019
is much the same in the way that certain foods are addictive.

264
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,050
They know why they shouldn't do it,

265
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,394
but they have no idea why they *are* doing it.

266
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,970
The food companies engineer addictions, 

267
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,899
I believe, into many of the foods.

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,319
Dr. Joseph Mercola : 
The food industry is worth tens of billions of dollars.

269
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,029
And they have the wherewithal and the science resources 

270
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,929
to really identify very carefully

271
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,995
what appeals to the average consumer,

272
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,480
and as a result of that, they can 
use these chemical derivatives 

273
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:48,994
to create these concoctions which really taste quite good.

274
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,427
And it can have an addictive component.

275
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:54,713
"MSG and free Glutamates "

276
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,256
"are used to enhance flavor in about 80%" 

277
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:57,698
"of all processed foods."
Raymond Francis.

278
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:01,042
SOY PROTEIN HYDROLYSED,

279
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,140
Glutamic Acid, Sodium caseinate 

280
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:05,803
MSG and free glutamates can be hidden 

281
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,388
behind over 50 different names.

282
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:09,993
MSG is in 80% of all flavored foods 

283
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:13,441
that you get in a restaurant, get in a grocery store.

284
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:16,990
It makes you want to eat more, but it does something else.

285
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,798
It actually excites a part of your brain 

286
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,880
that's in charge of the fat programs.

287
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,219
The chemical MSG excites the brain,

288
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:28,060
and due to that excitation,

289
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,390
your body actives the fat programs

290
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:33,760
and gets fatter. And everybody knows this.

291
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,495
Everybody... scientists know this.

292
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:39,098
Everybody knows this and no one is saying anything.

293
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,907
How do I know that everybody knows this?

294
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:44,539
When you want to study obesity, and you want to study a fat mouse,

295
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,210
you've got to make a mouse fat, because mice aren't fat.

296
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,059
So the way you make a mouse fat is you feed it MSG. 

297
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,838
And there is even a term for it,

298
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:55,129
"MSG obesity induced mice".

299
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,819
If you do a search for MSG obesity induced mice,

300
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,480
you will see tons of research reports 
where they talk about ...

301
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,173
The protocol was we make the mouse fat

302
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:05,629
feeding them this much MSG bla, bla, bla 

303
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,830
And then we study this, this and the other thing.

304
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,309
They are not studying that,

305
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,780
that is the protocol for making the mouse fat,
feeding it MSG.

306
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,624
And this is in 80% of modern-day foods.

307
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,903
"Help yourself"

308
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,519
A food... let's say a ...

309
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,639
a processed or refined sugar food, or a soda.

310
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:41,497
You will deliver something, a bio-chemical change in your brain,

311
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,909
it will make you momentarily up-lifted,
or momentarily happy.

312
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,740
And people get used to that feeling,

313
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,845
and they want to slam cookies, or cake, or soda 

314
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:54,819
to get that momentary feeling of ... feeling elated.

315
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:59,541
But then that feeling soon, very quickly drops off,

316
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:03,259
and you're left empty, wondering 
"where's the food, where are the nutrients?".

317
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:07,139
Where are the things that the body and the mind really crave?

318
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,389
And the answer from the food companies' point of view is to go back and buy another can.

319
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,178
If I was in the food industry? What am I looking to do?

320
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,220
I want to sell you more food. That's all I want to do.

321
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,810
Now, how I can do that?

322
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,046
I can manipulate the chemical structure of the food, 

323
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:33,000
so that now it becomes not fulfilling, but empty.

324
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,876
But gives the impression, when they're very first ingested 

325
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:40,320
that it is the most fulfilling thing they've ever had.

326
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:47,760
Nothing else does it in your brain quite like a diet cola.

327
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,377
That's because there's a deadly combination there

328
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:54,503
of Aspartame and Caffeine.

329
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,870
And those two together create a very unique blend 

330
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:03,219
of Excitotoxin that kills off brain cells.

331
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,635
But before they die, they have this ...
excitement

332
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,549
like a buzz.

333
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:13,007
So what you find with the diet cola addicts,

334
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:17,170
is that they'll drink sometimes a liter, 2 liters a day.

335
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,430
And, particularly women, do it as a way 
to keep their weight down.

336
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,451
Then don't eat, they just have the next buzz

337
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,373
of diet cola.

338
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:29,674
Foods containing Aspartame: mints, gum, cereal,

339
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,879
canned fruit, gelatin diets, sorbets 

340
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,875
Aspartame causes formaldehyde build-up in the brain,

341
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:38,731
it causes frontal lobe inflammation.

342
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:42,817
Migraines can be a common one, visual disturbances.

343
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:45,806
Symptoms that mimic multiple sclerosis,

344
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,239
there's headaches, there's neurological problems.

345
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:50,319
Seizures, in more serious cases,

346
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,800
Cognitive problems, and can in fact lead to different types of cancers.

347
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,953
Actually most pilots are aware 

348
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,032
that they can't drink diet sodas,

349
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:02,949
because it is well recognized within the Pilots Association,

350
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,080
that you just don't drink this, because it

351
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,051
could really cause severe aberration to your vision 

352
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:10,240
that will potentially lead to problems when you fly.

353
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,653
If you look at the studies that examine 

354
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,430
the toxicity of Aspartame, done by Dr. Walton 

355
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,937
Of the ninety studies that were done 

356
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,785
that showed that there was no side effects 

357
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:26,270
from Aspartame,

358
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,710
over 90% of those were funded by industry.

359
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,430
And we have almost the same number of other studies, 

360
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,490
that were independently funded,

361
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,517
finding the exact reverse

362
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:38,040
90% of them showing problems with it.

363
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,738
"Research studies suggest that artificial sweeteners" 

364
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,700
"contribute to weight gain".

365
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,299
Yale Journal of Biology.

366
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,395
Some of the artificial sweeteners have been proven

367
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:50,469
not only to have terrible side effects, 
over a long period of use,

368
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:53,769
but they cause carbohydrate cravings.

369
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,090
So if someone has a diet drink 

370
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:58,100
and they wonder why they're not getting thin,

371
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
and why they're craving even more carbohydrates,

372
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,580
it's because those substances have been very very 

373
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,789
carefully designed, not to help you,

374
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:08,259
they're into just selling and marketing.

375
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,289
So, yes, there are zero calories in diet soda,

376
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,097
but studies have shown that if you drink diet soda,

377
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,721
within a couple of years,

378
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:18,083
you'll be fatter than when you first 
started drinking the diet soda.

379
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:32,819
Unfortunately,

380
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,307
when a food additive, like Aspartame,

381
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,880
or any artificial sweetener is manufactured,

382
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,599
the process of getting approval is really...

383
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,000
the manufacturer, the company that's making it,
is the one that funds the studies. 

384
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,915
And those are the studies submitted to the Regulatory Agency 

385
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,479
to provide approval.

386
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:54,158
So it's not this independent third party, 

387
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,695
objective evaluation that's being done, 

388
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,140
as is most people's impression.

389
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,110
I think most people believe the FDA 

390
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,172
have their own scientists that do this analysis,

391
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,810
but nothing could be further from the truth.

392
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,289
It basically evaluates the studies 

393
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:11,259
that the industry submits that they funded.

394
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:14,929
We know that the food companies realize

395
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,899
that many of their ingredients are very addictive.

396
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:22,599
And the tobacco companies did for decades, they're still doing it.

397
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,341
If you addict a customer,

398
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,139
you have a customer for life.

399
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,185
The food companies do much the same thing,

400
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,010
with different chemicals.

401
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,065
It's not Nicotine, it's the MSG,

402
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,707
it's the processed sugars, it's the Aspartame,

403
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:37,830
it's these other chemicals, but it's the same idea.

404
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,601
It's just like selling cigarettes.

405
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:42,589
They're selling food that's harmful.

406
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:44,393
And you want people to keep coming back,

407
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,852
so you put in those chemicals that 
make them want it again, and again.

408
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:55,032
"Leave your worries behind. Diet soda".

409
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:58,449
The Marketing essentially lies to you,

410
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:02,609
because it presents you with this image of a can of soda, let's say,

411
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,903
and it doesn't tell you what's in the can.

412
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:07,540
What that says is that this can, if you drink it,

413
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,336
it's going to bring you these benefits by association.

414
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:13,652
You're going to be cool, you're going to be sexy, you're going to be happy. 

415
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:17,037
You're going to be surrounded by friends wearing skimpy bikinis, 

416
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,869
or whatever their message happens to be.

417
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,284
This is a lie. The truth is if you drink that soda,

418
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:24,694
you're going to lose bone mineral density,

419
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:26,876
because of the phosphoric acid it contains.

420
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,570
If it's a diet soda,

421
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,259
you may suffer neurological problems due to the chemical sweeteners.

422
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,456
And if it's not a diet soda,

423
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,114
it probably is made with high fructose corn syrup,

424
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:39,969
in North America and elsewhere around the world,

425
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,583
and that's going to promote diabetes type 2 and obesity.

426
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,319
So, on one hand, here's the promise 

427
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,815
"you're going to be sexy, and popular and cool",

428
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,350
but in reality you're gonna be obese, and miserable and unhealthy, and sick.

429
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,150
The Marketers are telling you this, but what they deliver is this.

430
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,182
We are now coming to a point where we are wary,

431
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:06,649
more and more people are wary about this falling

432
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:11,939
into this marketing of "zero calories", no fat,

433
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,279
no sugar type of messages.

434
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,323
Many of the food labels at the grocery store 

435
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,890
are very deceptive.

436
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,013
For example, there's a cereal, made by General Mills, 

437
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:26,510
called "Total Blueberry Pomegranate Cereal".

438
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,569
It contains no blueberries and no pomegranates.

439
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:32,640
you might wonder, "how did they come up with the name?"

440
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,568
And the naming of food products 

441
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,379
often is a little too loose and creative.

442
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,897
It's almost as if they're naming these products,

443
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,170
and this is from the major food companies 

444
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,964
whose products are in every major grocery store 

445
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:47,659
all around the world.

446
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,209
It's almost as if they're naming them based on what 

447
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,894
they hope you might imagine you're eating,

448
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:56,699
rather than what's really in the box,

449
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,989
because a lot of times it's not in there.

450
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:03,539
And then there's stuff that *is* in there, that they don't want you to see on the label.

451
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:08,199
So they don't put it on the label, 
such as Propylene Glycol.

452
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:12,249
This chemical is used in a lot of blueberry muffins.

453
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:14,782
It's part of what makes up the blueberry bits,

454
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,500
that aren't blueberries.

455
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,691
They're made of Propylene Glycol, partially hydrogenated oils,

456
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,109
liquid sugars, and artificial colours.

457
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:24,053
You can also use Propylene Glycol 

458
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:26,350
to winterize your RV.

459
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,830
It prevents the pipes from freezing in the winter.

460
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,512
It's also used to clean out your colon 

461
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:33,059
before a colonoscopy.

462
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,106
So there are multiple uses for this ingredient 

463
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,924
that you get in your blueberry muffins.

464
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:42,807
"99.9% Fat Free. LIGHT, 97% Fat Free".

465
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:45,889
America loves enemies.

466
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,530
When America chooses an enemy 

467
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,830
it deploys all it's forces against him, right?

468
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,640
So at some point, when we were noticing

469
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,569
that we were getting fat as a population,

470
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:58,922
we attacked, we made the enemy was fat.

471
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:03,285
And everything became "fat-free", fat-free this and fat-free that

472
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,709
And the calories that fat was occupying,

473
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,179
were replaced by, mostly, carbohydrates.

474
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,537
That resulted in the fattest country in the world.

475
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,021
"68% of US adults are overweight or obese"

476
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:19,327
The Journal of the American Medical Association.

477
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:24,000
"Fat-Free" normally means it's loaded with sugar.

478
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,350
I can get a 1 kilo bag of sugar, in my hand now,

479
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,539
and I can put a label that says 100% fat-free.

480
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:35,329
The fact that once the sugar is ingested,

481
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,019
will turn into fat in the body, because why?

482
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,649
Because it sends the sugar levels sky-high.

483
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,743
What does the pancreas do? It has to secrete insulin 

484
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:46,039
in order to bring that down so you don't die.

485
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,259
Insulin is the fat-producing hormone.

486
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,199
So the 1 kilo bag that I put "100% fat-free",

487
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,489
although factually correct, is unbelievably misleading.

488
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,159
So all this excess energy 

489
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,079
comes along and says "where we can store it?".

490
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:05,109
In the short term, in places like the liver.

491
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:07,486
But what do we do with the excess?
I know what we will do: 

492
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:09,320
we'll produce some fat cells.

493
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,260
Store them in there, use them later.

494
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,400
The problem is: there's never a later.

495
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,620
Fat is really good for you, if it's the right kind of fat.

496
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,849
And that's the key, it's getting the right kind of fat into your body.

497
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:22,119
If you are in a low-fat diet of some kind,

498
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:23,889
you are constantly hungry.

499
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:26,840
Why? Because you need the correct fats and proteins 

500
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,415
to feel satiated.

501
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:33,516
So therefore if you negate that side of what the body is crying out for,

502
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,710
you'll be constantly looking for it.

503
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,930
We know that the cheap low-grade fats 

504
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,139
such as soybean oil, even canola oil and the corn oils,

505
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,645
these are not healthy for you to consume 

506
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:46,609
in large quantities over the long term.

507
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,660
The worst kinds of fats are the partially hydrogenated fats.

508
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,491
These are the hydrogenated oils that are used in many baked items 

509
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:57,160
and crackers and cookies, and margarine spreads,

510
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,959
the butter spreads.

511
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:01,849
Oh, those are some of the worst foods you could possibly eat.

512
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:03,483
If you want healthy fats,

513
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:05,523
then you've got to get into the natural plant-based fats,

514
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,290
from avocados,

515
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,330
and chia seeds and flax seeds

516
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,290
and even the healthy fat from salmon, 
wild-caught salmon. 

517
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,280
That's a healthy fat for you.

518
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,190
- Want a bite? 
- I thought you loved me.

519
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,740
- I do! Take two bites.

520
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,890
- It's got high-fructose corn syrup in it.

521
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:25,994
- So? 
- Well, you know what they say about it.

522
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,934
- What? 
- That ...

523
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,383
When it comes to high-fructose corn syrup 

524
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,168
a lot of people don't realize the dangers of 

525
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:38,260
refining and concentrating ingredients from a product.

526
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,698
In the 70s,

527
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,229
Japanese scientists developed a technology 

528
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,530
to separate fructose from corn,

529
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,353
thus radically reducing the cost

530
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:50,983
of this high-fructose corn syrup, 

531
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:52,700
relative to traditional forms of sugar.

532
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,080
So high-fructose corn syrup comes from corn, obviously,

533
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,641
but it's not natural, because it's so concentrated and so refined 

534
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:01,150
it's an isolated nutrient.

535
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,570
For example,

536
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,119
cocaine is probably not good for your health

537
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,575
but it comes from the coca leaf. 

538
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,329
And coca-leaf tea is perfectly safe for your health.

539
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:13,119
I drank it when I was hiking in the Andes mountains, and

540
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,130
it's used throughout the culture there

541
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:18,938
and it's a very important nutra-ceutical medicinal plant,

542
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,960
that's used throughout South America.

543
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,945
And there is no harm in drinking coca tea 

544
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:24,830
and it's not addictive. Nothing like that.

545
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,770
But you wouldn't want to snort cocaine from the highly refined coca leaf.

546
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,963
Well, eating high-fructose corn syrup, in my view,

547
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,450
is a lot like snorting cocaine.

548
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,979
It is the highly refined, isolated, concentrated, chemically manipulated version 

549
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,119
of something that's found in corn and grown in corn.

550
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,496
It's very similar to what white sugar is.

551
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:49,920
White sugar is the purified sucrose extracted out of

552
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:53,479
beets or sugar cane. 
It's a pharmaceutical sugar.

553
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:57,144
White flours are pharmaceutical carbohydrate 

554
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:02,146
in the same way that cocaine is extracted out of the coca plant,

555
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:06,670
so you have the native cocaine in the matrix of the plant itself,

556
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:08,781
or you have the pharmaceutical version.

557
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,406
To me, white sugar, cocaine, white flour 

558
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:15,589
they all fall into the same category of a whitened extracted 

559
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:18,809
purified substance drawn out of the plant kingdom,

560
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,306
all of them create imbalances in the body 

561
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,499
and lead to a host of problems.

562
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:27,080
But if you eat corn, it's fine.

563
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:29,610
You will not get that much high as when you eat a dose of corn syrup.

564
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,979
The number one source of calories in the U.S. is fructose,

565
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,408
and fructose is highly addictive.

566
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:39,085
In the 1900s,

567
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,546
the average person was exposed to about 15 g. Fructose,

568
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,559
and another term for that is fruit sugar,

569
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,370
and of course it's why most fruits are sweet.

570
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,684
And fructose in small amounts, 

571
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,100
15, 25 g., which is less than an ounce a day,

572
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:54,903
is probably OK and healthy,

573
00:29:55,004 --> 00:30:00,585
but the average person is consuming 70-80 g. a day.

574
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:02,947
And there are many kids, primarily teenagers,

575
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,379
who are taking 120-150 g. of fructose a day.

576
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:08,313
Literally, ten times the amount 

577
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:10,149
that they were taking a century ago.

578
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,319
So when you abuse that type of sugar,

579
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,050
and you have that exposure, it has very severe metabolic consequences,

580
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,258
that can lead to these addictive processes and change brain chemistry.

581
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,859
And, really, make it very difficult 

582
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,684
to get out of this cycle where you have these food cravings,

583
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,389
and really addicted to food that's not going to make you healthy.

584
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:33,832
In terms of just the glycemic index

585
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,245
high-fructose corn syrup 

586
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:38,250
is like jet fuel for your body.

587
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,850
If you pour jet fuel into your car,

588
00:30:40,951 --> 00:30:44,565
into your car's gasoline tank, you're going to ruin your engine. You'll burn it out.

589
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,559
Much the same thing happens in the human body.

590
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:49,755
You can find high-fructose corn syrup in 

591
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,100
so many products in the stores it will amaze you.

592
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,665
If you turn them around and look at the ingredients 

593
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:56,999
"No way, I can't believe it's in here".

594
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,189
Salad Dressings will have it.

595
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:02,694
You have high-fructose corn syrup in

596
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:06,479
pasta sauces, and pizza sauce especially is loaded with it.

597
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:10,490
You really have to watch out with everything in the grocery store.

598
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:14,220
Read it and make sure it doesn't contain this high-fructose corn syrup,

599
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,739
and other ingredients that are dangerous.

600
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:19,179
Stay away from the isolates.

601
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,420
Stay away from high-fructose corn syrup.

602
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,119
Stay away from anything that is an unnatural,

603
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,300
and highly concentrated chemical 

604
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:29,653
from a plant that should be consumed 

605
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,379
in its full spectrum bio-available nutrient complexity.

606
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,470
That's the way nature delivers food,

607
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:37,250
as a nutrient complex

608
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,220
not as one isolated nutrient.

609
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,852
One of the most important realizations 

610
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:51,799
that people need to get onto here when they're eating,

611
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,799
is that the breads and any of these fluffy carbohydrates 

612
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,695
they're converted into sugar right in your body.

613
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:02,490
So within minutes after you eat them they become sugar.

614
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,692
So a lot of people say "I'm avoiding sugar" 

615
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:09,030
because they're not eating crystallized sugar in that form, or drinking liquid sugar,

616
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,580
but they're eating a bread, or a pancake, or a muffin or a corn bread.

617
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,907
Corn bread used to be made out of corn,

618
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:18,139
and not sugar, and now it's like a corn cake.

619
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:20,179
It's sugarized corn cake.

620
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:23,118
And when you eat that, it becomes sugar internally

621
00:32:23,219 --> 00:32:25,087
and has a very high glycemic index.

622
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:26,661
And a high glycemic load.

623
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,657
- I'm just going to lunch.

624
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,930
So when you're thinking about what to eat if you're working to reduce the sugar,

625
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,738
your definition of what is sugar really needs to expand. 

626
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,445
It's more than just the white powder.

627
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:10,889
There's breads, pasta, cereal, rice, potatoes, corn,

628
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,842
waffles, pancakes ...

629
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:15,969
Pretty much any food for breakfast that most people eat 

630
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,459
In America,

631
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:23,359
we're eating about 68 kg. of sugar per year, each person.

632
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:27,409
35 kg. of high-fructose corn syrup.

633
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:31,310
That's about 22 teaspoons of sugar a day.

634
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,460
There's nothing moderate about that.

635
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,430
Sugar is in everything,

636
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:41,976
from cough syrup, to crackers to sushi.

637
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,359
I mean it's very hard to avoid.

638
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:47,450
The more sugar that we're consuming,

639
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,024
the more increased chronic diseases that we're experiencing,

640
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:53,542
and also these incredible ups and downs and mood swings.

641
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:58,239
Because, what sugar does is it increases beta endorphin in the brain,

642
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:01,431
and that's a feel good natural opiate,

643
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:03,029
morphine-like substance.

644
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:06,459
And so, when you are depressed or under stress,

645
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,679
you want to eat what we call "comfort food",

646
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,188
macaroni and cheese,

647
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:16,509
all the foods that have a virtual delivery system of sugar,

648
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:18,830
right into body fat.

649
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:23,490
So, it is not fat that makes you fat, it's sugar that makes you fat.

650
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,859
And it is very easy and cheap to produce foods

651
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,812
that become sugar quickly.

652
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,569
Think of something like a croissant.

653
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,547
Many people I know that just say 

654
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,425
"You know I've gone on a sugar-free diet",

655
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:37,140
and they say it while eating a croissant.

656
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,710
And I think, that sugar, what do you think is going to happen? 

657
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,980
As soon as it enters the bloodstream, that *is* sugar.

658
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,487
What we're really talking about is, getting that hit, 

659
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:47,590
getting that sugar high,

660
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:52,779
getting that beta-endorphin rush, that people are looking for 

661
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,799
to soothe themselves when they are under stress.

662
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:57,908
But once you understand 

663
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:03,288
that sugar is a drug, just like alcohol is a drug.

664
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:06,138
And so what happens with any addiction is this:

665
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,940
you become habituated to the effect.

666
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,306
And therefore you need more and more and more, over time 

667
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,438
to give you the same effect.

668
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:17,888
It is no different than it is with sugar.

669
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:22,739
We know the problems caused by something like cocaine, purified cocaine.

670
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:25,869
We know that causes problems. We're comfortable with referring to that as a drug.

671
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,162
We're becoming culturally more comfortable 

672
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:30,439
with recognizing white sugar as a drug.

673
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,270
I think people are starting to understand how addictive a substance it is.

674
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,887
If you walk the aisles in the average grocery store,

675
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:40,407
and you look at the amount of sugar 

676
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:43,169
in a child's breakfast cereal.

677
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:48,287
You might as well be rolling up the kid's sleeve and putting in heroin.

678
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,762
Because it's the same.

679
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:54,239
Jamie Oliver TED Talk, February 2010

680
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,570
Milk ain't good enough any more

681
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,474
because someone at the Milk Board,

682
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,449
don't get me wrong, I support milk,

683
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,723
but someone at the Milk Board probably paid a lot of money 

684
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,419
to some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings and colourings 

685
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,800
and sugar in milk, right, more kids will drink it.

686
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,003
For me, there ain't no need to flavor the milk.

687
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:14,320
There's sugar in everything.

688
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:17,309
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients - it's in everything.

689
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:21,110
Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems.

690
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,176
There's our milk, there's our carton.

691
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:26,976
In that, is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,

692
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:28,690
and they're having two a day.

693
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,848
So, let me just show you. We've got one kid here 

694
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:38,640
having, you know, 8 tablespoons of sugar a day. 

695
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,741
There's your week.

696
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:44,436
There's your month.

697
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,319
And I took the liberty of putting in 

698
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,498
just the 5 years of elementary school sugar.

699
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,166
Just from milk.

700
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,320
Now I don't know about you guys, but judging from circumstances,

701
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,876
any judge in the whole world,

702
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,510
would look at the statistics and the evidence,

703
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,860
and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.

704
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,460
That's my belief.

705
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,030
The challenge we have with food, and in particular sugar 

706
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,715
is because it's illegal to give a child a cigarette, 

707
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:22,230
and so it should be.

708
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,429
It is illegal to give a child alcohol.

709
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,880
It's not illegal to give a child white refined sugar, or refined fats.

710
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,678
Food, as far as I am concerned,

711
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:34,770
kills more people than all drugs on earth combined.

712
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,149
And again, to go back to the beginning,

713
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,462
people know this, so why are highly intelligent people

714
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,979
not stop it?

715
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,539
Because they don't know the nature of the trap.

716
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,953
I used to be so addicted to sugar that I would literally 

717
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:48,864
throw my food out and take to the garbage.

718
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,019
So I would go get ice cream and cherries, and donuts,

719
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,009
I'd have a pig-out fest.

720
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:57,289
And I had to throw my food in the garbage and ...

721
00:37:57,389 --> 00:38:01,069
then I would go dig through the garbage and get the sugar.

722
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:03,554
And then I got to a point where the only way I wouldn't take to the garbage 

723
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:05,569
was to spray it with Windex.

724
00:38:05,669 --> 00:38:10,019
So, you tell me that that's healthy and imbalanced?

725
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,193
Now, we think about: "Wooo, cocaine, heroin?"

726
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:17,369
All those big drugs, but the truth is that premature death 

727
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:21,619
is coming from sugar and alcohol, and smoking of course.

728
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,354
So if you begin to think about these massive doses of sugar 

729
00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:28,358
as no different from drugs and alcohol,

730
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:31,170
then you get a handle on the situation.

731
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:34,309
Hey everyone. Welcome back.

732
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:37,979
Now I would like to introduce you to our special guest I have with me in the studio,

733
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,109
Harvey Diamond, health guru and the author of "Fit for Life".

734
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:46,989
Harvey is here to talk to us about something he is very passionate about: Dieting.

735
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,599
Harvey, tell us what you think about diets.

736
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:53,135
So many people want to know about diets,

737
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:56,139
because people are going to try them, but they don't work.

738
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,779
The first chapter of the first book I ever wrote 

739
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,509
was called "Diets don't Work" because they're temporary.

740
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,501
What they're doing is taking one of the food categories that

741
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:08,109
we must have to live: Protein, fat, carbohydrate.

742
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:10,531
And one of those is eliminated and if you do that,

743
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:13,454
some weight will be lost temporarily.

744
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:15,099
Let me ask you something:

745
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,199
Do you want to be healthy temporarily? No.

746
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,498
But you want to lose weight temporarily.

747
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,502
They have failure built right in to them.

748
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:26,501
There was a study done at UCLA once

749
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:30,759
that said 90-95% of the people who go on a diet 

750
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:33,575
will not only gain that weight back 

751
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:35,989
they will add more weight,

752
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:38,323
because they're so happy to be eating again 

753
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,411
that they don't eat intelligently.

754
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:42,838
Maltodextrin, cocoa, artificial flavor,

755
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,448
Gum Arabic, ANS, ... 

756
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,801
Sodium phosphate, aspartame, acesulfame-K 

757
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:58,758
colour, caramel,

758
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,223
Phosphoric acid, aspartame, potassium benzoate,

759
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:03,326
Natural flavors, caffeine, sodium benzoate 

760
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,034
You can lose weight on a diet,

761
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:14,559
but it's a little bit like borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.

762
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:18,589
I mean, you can get 4 kg. off your body through sheer force,

763
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:22,019
but you're going to have to pay back with interest. You will pay back with 6 kg.,

764
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,930
because every time you force yourself to lose weight,

765
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,306
your body is going to want to have extra weight 

766
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:29,700
to protect you from a "perceived famine".

767
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,415
And I've lived through this, where I'd lose 4 kg. gain 6 kg.,

768
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,150
lose 4 kg., gain 6 kg,

769
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,449
until I had gained over 90 kg.

770
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:40,386
When I say I tried every diet 

771
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:43,431
besides meeting face-to-face with Atkins, going to a Pritikins,

772
00:40:43,532 --> 00:40:46,099
I had naturopaths, homeopaths, acupuncture.

773
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,790
I had these seeds taped to my ears from an acupuncturist.

774
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,530
It was supposed to be an acupressure point.

775
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:52,392
So every time you're hungry you're supposed to press it.

776
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,980
I walked through the streets of New York, every time I'd smell pizza,

777
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:57,591
I'd sit there and press these seeds in my ear.

778
00:40:57,692 --> 00:41:00,819
This is what I lived with, and I really did work at it.

779
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,280
You know, people think that overweight people 

780
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:06,050
are just weak and lazy and overindulgent.

781
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,800
I am a very disciplined person, 

782
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:10,135
but when my body wanted to be fat,

783
00:41:10,236 --> 00:41:11,739
I could not lose the weight.

784
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,949
Dr. Alejandro Jünger: I think we're barking up the wrong tree.

785
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:20,459
People are looking for a result that is superficial,

786
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,389
just to look good.

787
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:26,722
They don't really consider that that could be done 

788
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:28,659
from the inside out, right?

789
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:34,191
So people go into diets, and all these fads,

790
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:38,379
in order to lose weight, and lose weight fast.

791
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,989
And that's just not the way to approach it.

792
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:43,709
The results prove it.

793
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:46,219
We are violating our bodies' basic 

794
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,129
survival laws, over and over and over again.

795
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:52,030
The whole dieting paradigm is flawed.

796
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,410
And every diet that comes out, every week there's a new diet, 

797
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,559
based on the same idea that you could somehow 
force yourself to lose weight.

798
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:02,599
And it's flawed, it's based on a fundamental flaw

799
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:05,047
that every time you force yourself to lose weight, 

800
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,960
your body will force you to gain weight.

801
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,568
So I think what happens is we set ourselves up for failure,

802
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:14,989
because yes, you can manipulate the ratios of calories,

803
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,161
you can manipulate the ratios of fat to protein,

804
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:21,344
to carbohydrates infinitely. 
We keep seeing all these variations.

805
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:24,529
I remember the high carbohydrate low fat,

806
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:27,836
and then it switched to "well, let's go high protein low carbohydrate",

807
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:30,357
and then it switched to high fat moderate carbohydrate.

808
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:33,109
It just keeps switching around. And all all of these things have an effect 

809
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:35,859
because what you're doing is restricting calories from people,

810
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,322
or you're manipulating the way the metabolism works.

811
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,949
And that's why the Atkins diet was so miserable for me,

812
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:43,549
because I was so addicted to carbs.

813
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:45,559
You know, to what I call now "dead food".

814
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,638
I was so addicted to it, to try to go off that 

815
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:49,224
at the end of the day

816
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:52,040
I was just miserable, and what I used to do I used to swap diets,

817
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:56,420
because the Atkins diet is zero carbs,

818
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,809
And then the Pritikin diet is all carbs.

819
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:04,370
My wife used to joke with me that

820
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,088
I was on the Atkins diet during the day 

821
00:43:07,189 --> 00:43:09,653
and the Pritikin diet at night,
because I would come home at the end of the day

822
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:12,679
and I just couldn't take going a whole day without carbs.

823
00:43:12,779 --> 00:43:14,579
I had to have bread.

824
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:17,312
The definition of a diet, is the foods 

825
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:21,009
that an organism habitually eats to sustain itself.

826
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:23,334
So what we are talking about is a real diet,

827
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:26,259
in the sense of what a species eats.

828
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:28,295
When we get on to a real diet,

829
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:30,110
we will not have to think about these things any more.

830
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,880
But if we're going to eat from those sweetened foods that exist in the supermarket,

831
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,940
we're going constantly to have problems, and we constantly have to monitor ourselves,

832
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,649
because these foods make you fat.

833
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:39,059
So, if you look around the world,

834
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,179
we see human beings have been able to inhabit the whole globe.

835
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,460
And they have been able to do it on a host of different foods. From the extreme Arctic,

836
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,601
where people eat almost exclusively 

837
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:52,009
animal fat, and muscle and organ meats,

838
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:56,253
to the jungle, where people had access to far more fruits, and far more plant material. 

839
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:59,349
We see people thriving and people staying lean and healthy,

840
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:02,905
and avoiding degenerative disease and not putting on extra weight,

841
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:04,920
almost no matter what they eat.

842
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,290
Now, we are eating a diet that no longer resembles that.

843
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,040
So it's kind of like if we lived in a zoo.

844
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,920
If you put a human being in a zoo,
the way you put a chimpanzee in a zoo,

845
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,231
the question would be: what do we feed that human in the zoo?

846
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,850
We don't feed chimpanzees in zoos 

847
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:22,249
Captain Crunch cereal, Twinkies and donuts.

848
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,919
We feed them a diet that looks like the diet they eat in their ecosystem.

849
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:28,869
We sort of live in a zoo-like environment now,

850
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,429
we live in this artificial environment.

851
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:32,302
And unfortunately, we are not feeding ourselves 

852
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,251
the foods we're biologically adapted to.

853
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:36,849
If you cut down on any food, regardless of what the food is,

854
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,542
you say "as of Monday ...", it's always a Monday.

855
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,965
Everyone's always going on a diet on a Monday.

856
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:44,450
They tend to consume enormous amounts of food,

857
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,168
from Friday to the Sunday.

858
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:50,620
Sunday, they tend to go shopping,

859
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,796
and they put in stuff that they wouldn't ordinarily, if ever, put in,

860
00:44:53,897 --> 00:44:56,120
fruits and vegetables, as an example.

861
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,136
And it's funny, because I've been on a million diets,

862
00:44:59,237 --> 00:45:03,110
and, in the past, when I went on those diets,
when I was overweight myself,

863
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,830
I would arrive at the check-out, on the day before my diet would begin,

864
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,720
I would have so much healthy stuff.

865
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,610
I would be so proud of my trolley.

866
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,837
And I'd wanted the check-out person to say something,

867
00:45:12,938 --> 00:45:15,081
"Look, this isn't ordinary. Look how much fruit and veg I've got."

868
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,160
I would then start on the Monday morning,

869
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,776
and I would immediately start to feel deprived.

870
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:22,360
Now think about this.

871
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:25,570
I could have gone sometimes till 2 o'clock in the afternoon

872
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:28,312
not thinking about food, when I wasn't "on a diet"

873
00:45:28,413 --> 00:45:31,760
without consuming any food. Sometimes I'd grab some water, or ...

874
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,650
sometimes nothing. I hadn't thought about it.

875
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,717
But the very second 

876
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:39,580
I told my brain, that I was on a diet,

877
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,740
I went into the mode of CAN'T.

878
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:45,970
If you go through "I want that but I CAN'T have it"

879
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:48,270
to "I CAN have it but I don't want it",

880
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,870
there's a massive paradigm shift.

881
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,740
Don't turn in to a diet.

882
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,456
Keep the focus always on adding, 

883
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:59,076
if it's for example ... the types of food we need 

884
00:45:59,177 --> 00:46:01,453
are foods that were not man-made, because man-made foods 

885
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:04,690
our body doesn't know how to process, 
doesn't know how to digest

886
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,097
and it causes hormonal chaos that causes us to gain weight.

887
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,540
David Wolfe : The best strategy we've got is to just add in the good stuff.

888
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,660
Eventually, it's going to crowd out the bad stuff,

889
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,158
and that works for everybody.

890
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,768
It makes everything so simple 

891
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:20,602
it completely deactivates all the mental neuroses we have about diets 

892
00:46:20,703 --> 00:46:23,059
and what we have to eat and all that kind of stuff.

893
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:24,939
Let's just add in the cucumbers.

894
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:28,100
Let's add in the apples. 

895
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:32,419
The simple foods: the plant foods, the fruits, the nuts, the seeds,

896
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:35,176
the vegetables, the animal foods of high quality.

897
00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:38,729
Start looking at the foods in your house and asking yourself,

898
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,151
"Could I replace this food with a well-grown

899
00:46:41,252 --> 00:46:44,019
local option, that is not as processed?"

900
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,570
For instance, if you are used to making pancakes out of white flour,

901
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,121
can you go to a farm locally that

902
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:52,799
produces flour and stone grinds it? 
Can you find that?

903
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:55,739
If you look in your fridge and you've got milk in there

904
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,699
and you know it's processed milk, and it's got growth hormone in it,

905
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,694
and you know it's pesticide laden, you know there's pus in it.

906
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,267
Can you find a farm locally 

907
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:07,191
that can produce that food for you the way people used to get it?

908
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,430
If you've got bananas in your house from the supermarket,

909
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:12,169
can you replace them with an organic option? 

910
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:16,269
Can you move in a direction that brings you towards 

911
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,500
the re-approximation of your Natural diet?
Can you do that?

912
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:22,830
If you start adding that in, all of a sudden all those other choices start moving away.

913
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,525
Inevitably 

914
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:28,437
you're going to feel so much better eating the good stuff,

915
00:47:28,538 --> 00:47:32,420
that the choice for the bad stuff is no longer valid.

916
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,959
I had very bad sleep apnea, I was borderline type 2 diabetic,

917
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,879
elevated triglycerides and cholesterol.

918
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:50,499
I'd worked with Dr. Atkins face to face in New York 

919
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:52,754
and in the end the best he could do was yell at me for being 

920
00:47:52,755 --> 00:47:54,909
so fat and because I was killing myself.

921
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:57,277
"What are you doing? You're killing yourself."

922
00:47:58,069 --> 00:48:01,313
And I thought to myself, "You've sold two-hundred million copies of your books, 

923
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,816
do you think I'm going to lose weight because you're mad at me,

924
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,917
that's the best you can do?"

925
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:09,699
I was over 180 kg.

926
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:14,820
After I had that sort of epiphany and changed my focus from diet to

927
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:18,469
finding the real reasons why my body wanted to be fat,

928
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:24,279
I then went on to lose more than 100 kilos over a two and a half year period.

929
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:26,502
That was 7 years ago.

930
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,765
Hey gorgeous,

931
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:46,538
thought you might find this interesting 

932
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:48,267
after our chat this morning.

933
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,674
www.hungryforchange.tv

934
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,385
Hope you're all good. Amanda.

935
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:57,978
There was a point when I had allowed myself to get to 136 kg.,

936
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:02,739
and that world, as opposed to the current world,

937
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,673
is vastly different.

938
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,610
When I was overweight and when I was sick,

939
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,166
I didn't even know that I was sick.

940
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,059
But I just thought that life was passing me by,

941
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,310
life was just not fun.

942
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:19,479
The only fun I had was watching people 
on TV having fun.

943
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,761
It's a very dispiriting thing, 
you wake up in the morning and you ...

944
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:26,300
I was immediately aware of my body.

945
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,300
And I was immediately aware that I didn't like it.

946
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,660
It felt a little bit like being wrapped in a blanket,

947
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,250
with 3 holes in it.

948
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,001
Two to watch TV and one to eat. And that's it.

949
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,991
I got to this point where I was 40 years of age,

950
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,289
I was fat, sick and nearly dead.

951
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:49,489
I was 310 lbs, (or 141 kg.),

952
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,115
I was taking high doses of steroids 

953
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:54,039
every day, day and night, for 8 years.

954
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:56,509
"I was a cheeseburger away from a heart attack."

955
00:49:56,609 --> 00:49:58,489
And I said, "No more.".

956
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:00,973
"Got to do something about this, Joe.".

957
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:03,349
"You're not as smart as you thought you were.".

958
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:06,027
What actually happened after that 
period of time was that

959
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:10,825
my body gave up to the pressure 
of what I was putting it under.

960
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:14,959
When I talk about the pressure I was putting it under,
it was like: lack of sleep, 

961
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:16,688
poor diet, too much alcohol,

962
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:20,729
smoking, no exercise. I mean, you know ...

963
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:23,235
throw everything in, I had it all.

964
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,467
Now, a lot of us have some healing to do.

965
00:50:30,568 --> 00:50:33,445
We have recovery to do, because the world we grew up in

966
00:50:33,546 --> 00:50:36,009
has been such a barrage against our nervous system,

967
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:39,779
our endocrine system. Our health has been under attack.

968
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,809
So sometimes there's going to be a period of healing.

969
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,228
We decided, as a race, to experiment with chemicals.

970
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:52,245
We've created over 75,000 synthetic chemicals since 1940.

971
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:55,633
We've released them wholesale into the environment.

972
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,700
They're in the food chain, they're in us,

973
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,199
they've contaminated every single creature on Earth.

974
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,379
We now have to clean up.

975
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:05,669
Now we have to actually turn it around

976
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,834
and decide that we're going to move away from "better living through chemistry" 

977
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:14,668
and move towards the idea of better living through working with nature 

978
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:16,289
and natural laws.

979
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:20,100
And the body has two ways of defending itself,

980
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,939
which are generic ways.

981
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:24,696
One of them is the production of mucus 

982
00:51:24,697 --> 00:51:27,354
to coat these chemicals,

983
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:31,230
so that they buffer the irritation,

984
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:36,149
or it retains and even generates more fat

985
00:51:36,249 --> 00:51:37,617
because, as we said,

986
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:41,585
most of these chemicals are lipophilic, or fat-loving.

987
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:44,300
They don't dissolve in water, they dissolve in fat,

988
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,100
so they attach to fat.

989
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,609
Now, if you just sweat it off,

990
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:51,820
and force the body into burning fat,

991
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,475
without creating the conditions for the 

992
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:57,030
body to be able to cleanse and detoxify 

993
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,066
and neutralize and make these chemicals water-soluble so that they can be 

994
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:03,529
sweated off and peed off,

995
00:52:03,629 --> 00:52:07,825
you're burning fat, but not really getting rid of the toxins.

996
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:13,011
These toxins are left to cause the damage 

997
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:16,680
that they were not causing because they were surrounded by fat.

998
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,974
So as long as you are taking in more toxins than you're eliminating, 

999
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,559
your body is not going to let you burn fat. 

1000
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,709
Because burning the fat will just put more toxins into your body.

1001
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:31,700
So you have to address the fact that you're being assaulted with toxins 

1002
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,580
before your body will allow you to let go of weight.

1003
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,059
The body only wants to heal, it's crying out to heal,
that's all it wants to do.

1004
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,622
It wants to naturally detoxify 

1005
00:52:42,723 --> 00:52:44,949
Only the body can detoxify itself, 

1006
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:48,250
provided there's no toxins coming in.

1007
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:51,090
Probably the best thing a person can do in the beginning 

1008
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:55,670
is kind of clean themselves out, get on it like a detoxification program.

1009
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,950
Foods that detoxify the body,

1010
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,059
some are really obvious and some are not.

1011
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,270
Some of the more obvious ones are green vegetables. 

1012
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,179
Chlorophyll-rich foods. In hospitals, chlorophyll 

1013
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,461
was used as an "internal deodorant". 

1014
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,490
For people who had a lot of body odour.

1015
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,922
Chlorophyll is a great way to clean our bodies out. 

1016
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:18,199
So, those are of course all of our well-grown organic vegetables 

1017
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:20,691
These are fantastic for cleaning our bodies out.

1018
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,819
There's some less obvious stuff as well though,

1019
00:53:22,919 --> 00:53:28,080
like gelatinous plant foods, for instance things like Chia seeds, 

1020
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,850
or Aloe Vera or the seaweeds.

1021
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,739
These foods that have a gel that they secrete when they get wet. 

1022
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,756
What those do: those gels move through our intestinal tract. 

1023
00:53:36,857 --> 00:53:38,874
If we eat something like chia seeds.

1024
00:53:38,975 --> 00:53:42,918
If we can blend that into a drink some way or something like that and get it into our bodies,

1025
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,050
these gelatinous fibers move through our intestinal tract 

1026
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,776
absorbing things, binding them and passing them through.

1027
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:53,444
Particularly what they do is they absorb the bile salts 

1028
00:53:53,545 --> 00:53:55,085
that are released by the liver, 

1029
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,842
bind those up and pass those out with all the fat-soluble 

1030
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,920
toxins that the liver is trying to get rid of.

1031
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:03,083
If you don't have these gelatinous fibers, we tend to re-absorb a lot of that.

1032
00:54:03,184 --> 00:54:05,150
So, our liver tries to get rid of something, 

1033
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:07,860
puts it in bile and dumps it into the small intestine 

1034
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,475
hoping that it eventually gets out of us, but it gets re-absorbed.

1035
00:54:11,476 --> 00:54:15,480
So gelatinous fibers can really do a lot to clean out the liver.

1036
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,996
I want to mention two other ingredients 

1037
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,410
that are specially useful for detox.

1038
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,560
That is: parsley and cilantro.

1039
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,590
Parsley cleanses your entire blood supply

1040
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,620
and it also gives you fresh breath.

1041
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,870
Parsley has so much Chlorophyll that it just cleanses your whole system.

1042
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,389
Cilantro binds with heavy metals.

1043
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,770
A lot of people are getting mercury 

1044
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,050
especially through the fish that they're eating 

1045
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,130
or through their dental fillings.

1046
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,533
And if you eat cilantro, it can bind with that 

1047
00:54:46,634 --> 00:54:48,480
and remove it from your system,

1048
00:54:48,558 --> 00:54:51,066
so that the mercury doesn't get lodged in your body's cells.

1049
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:53,929
And mercury, as you know, is very toxic.

1050
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,610
It's a neurotoxin.

1051
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,460
You don't want that anywhere in your brain cells, right?

1052
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,821
But cleansing our bodies is not complicated, it's not difficult.

1053
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:05,605
It's just going to require high quality green plant food. 

1054
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:09,120
It's going to require gelatinous fibers, it's going to require good water.

1055
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,067
It's going to mean needing good air, 
it's going to mean getting sunlight.

1056
00:55:12,068 --> 00:55:14,589
Our body *wants* to cleanse itself.

1057
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:17,289
It's looking to cleanse itself and knows *how* to cleanse itself. 

1058
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:19,316
You don't even have to do very much.

1059
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:22,757
Just input gentle foods, be out in nature, 

1060
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:24,761
your body will cleanse itself very easily.

1061
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:27,025
And when the weight starts coming off

1062
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:29,169
people become so excited they don't want to stop.

1063
00:55:29,269 --> 00:55:33,889
And then eventually, starting to add more and more foods back in, from healthy sources, 

1064
00:55:33,989 --> 00:55:36,422
that looked like the foods they used to eat,

1065
00:55:36,523 --> 00:55:40,260
but are actually more satisfying and more nutritive.

1066
00:55:40,361 --> 00:55:43,383
And they'll find that they can live a life of

1067
00:55:43,484 --> 00:55:46,180
not just being fit and trim, 

1068
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,485
but actually feeling how they've always wanted to feel,

1069
00:55:48,586 --> 00:55:50,387
in a body that works properly 

1070
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,189
and that stays healthy for ever.

1071
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,425
For me, it's back to nature and it's back to the garden.

1072
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:04,310
If it's made in the garden, then I eat it.

1073
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:07,749
If it's made in a lab, it takes a lab to digest.

1074
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:11,129
If it has a shelf life longer than me, I don't eat it.

1075
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:12,609
That's just common sense.

1076
00:56:12,709 --> 00:56:15,488
The simpler I get, the healthier I get.

1077
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:19,380
Dr. Joseph Mercola: So, as you seek to improve your health 

1078
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,758
you're going to want to include certain types of foods, classes of foods 

1079
00:56:23,859 --> 00:56:26,567
that are typically ignored in the American culture.

1080
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:28,459
Now this is not controversial.

1081
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:31,842
The most conservative Nutritionist 

1082
00:56:31,943 --> 00:56:35,182
will recommend that we need 6 to 8 servings of fruits and vegetables.

1083
00:56:35,283 --> 00:56:38,459
I always twist that around, it should be vegetables and fruits. 

1084
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,400
Because vegetables are really the most beneficial food group that we can have access to

1085
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,680
and most people are not getting enough.

1086
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,882
They just aren't. I mean you need a lot of good vegetables 

1087
00:56:50,983 --> 00:56:54,111
because they're full of the full range of vital nutrients 

1088
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,829
and Antioxidants and everything that you need to stay healthy.

1089
00:56:56,929 --> 00:57:00,226
Now one of the ways that I cheat this,

1090
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:03,587
because getting vegetables is a challenge, 

1091
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:05,649
is that I do vegetable juicing.

1092
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:11,700
So I'll typically buy 20 lbs. [9 kg.] of vegetables a week, maybe more,

1093
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,477
and juice a few pounds a day, 

1094
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:16,689
essentially a quart [1 lt.] of dark green vegetable juice 

1095
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,399
that consists of, as a base

1096
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,430
I like celery and cucumber as the base, 

1097
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,014
and I add the dark deep green leafy vegetables,

1098
00:57:24,115 --> 00:57:27,220
like kale, or collards. There's a number of different types of kale.

1099
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:28,631
Those are the two big ones 

1100
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:31,039
but then you can also use other dark green vegetables.

1101
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,259
Jason Vale : Juicing is important for two main reasons.

1102
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,220
People often say to me, you know, "why don't we just eat it?".

1103
00:57:37,305 --> 00:57:38,809
That's a good question first of all.

1104
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:42,250
Why don't we just eat it? 
We don't. That's the first thing to address.

1105
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,555
The point is that most people don't consume 

1106
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,431
enough raw fruits and vegetables in the spectrum of colours.

1107
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:49,120
That's the number one.

1108
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,822
Secondly, 

1109
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:54,139
most people are overfed and they're undernourished.

1110
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,489
And so their digestive system is beaten up 

1111
00:57:57,589 --> 00:58:00,932
over years and years of trying to digest, 

1112
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:03,551
extract the nutrients and dispose of the waste 

1113
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:05,597
of the wrong kind of foods.

1114
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,109
Juicing is important as well because it's easy to absorb.

1115
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:17,189
It's the ultimate fast food.

1116
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,220
If you say you want a fast food diet, get juicing.

1117
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,145
Because if you think the average 

1118
00:58:22,246 --> 00:58:24,789
dinner will take anything from 4 to 16 hours 

1119
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:28,479
to leave the stomach and the body try to digest it.

1120
00:58:28,779 --> 00:58:33,830
Freshly extracted juice is the 15-minute nutrient express to health.

1121
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:34,708
That's what it is.

1122
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:37,930
It goes into your stomach and in 15 minutes into your cells.

1123
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,431
And also let's be fair 

1124
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:43,435
you'll consume far more raw, fresh vegetables

1125
00:58:43,536 --> 00:58:45,309
the kind of vegetables you 
wouldn't ordinarily eat. 

1126
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:49,223
Juice, mix with a little bit of apple, pineapple, a bit of lime. 

1127
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:53,812
You can jazz up some of these juices so they taste divine.

1128
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,900
So, can you imagine, you remove refined sugars 

1129
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,141
refined fats, junky-type foods, 

1130
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:13,319
all the wheat, the breads, the man-made foods coming in to your body.

1131
00:59:13,419 --> 00:59:15,169
And all of a sudden, overnight 

1132
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,570
you replace it with high water content, that's what it is, 

1133
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:21,845
pure high water content, organic-rich mineral 

1134
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:25,841
Vitamin-rich fuel, going into every single cell of your body. 

1135
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:29,289
And it's easy to digest and absorb forms 

1136
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:33,810
With the spectrum of colours, with everything the body requires.

1137
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:38,110
What do you think the body is going to do? 
It's not going to reject this at all.

1138
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,110
It's going to look and say: "Now I'm on board.",

1139
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,966
"Now you are good for me," 

1140
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:44,763
"let me shine for you".

1141
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,969
Joe Cross : Twenty years ago, this is what I saw when I looked in the mirror.

1142
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:53,500
Looking good. Well the years rolled by 

1143
00:59:53,501 --> 00:59:56,860
and I kept seeing that same fit-looking bloke looking back at me.

1144
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,657
Who was I kidding? I didn't look like that any more.

1145
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:04,957
I looked like I'd swallowed a sheep.

1146
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:10,117
So now I started a switch to alternative paths.

1147
01:00:10,218 --> 01:00:14,339
I tried everything. I did witch-doctors, I did mud-baths, I did ... 

1148
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:17,200
acupuncture, I did the lot. 

1149
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:22,734
The one thing which I was really afraid to face up to

1150
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:25,798
was changing what I put into my mouth.

1151
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,408
Frank Ferrante : I'd never heard of a raw food restaurant.

1152
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,809
Raw food? How do you cook raw food?
 
1153
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,499
- Look at that breakfast!
- This looks like it should be mowed.

1154
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:34,959
- It actually was mowed and then turned into that.

1155
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,456
I didn't know anything about vegetarians. 

1156
01:00:37,557 --> 01:00:39,239
I knew Gandhi was a vegetarian.

1157
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:41,820
Vegan? I thought vegan was a planet.

1158
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,956
I had no idea of that world.

1159
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:47,408
Evita Ramparte was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2000.

1160
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:49,050
Evita Ramparte : So I decided to experiment.

1161
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:53,119
I was fighting for life here. What if it worked?

1162
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:57,147
So I went to a farmer's market and got a lot of veggies, beets, and kale 

1163
01:00:57,248 --> 01:01:00,509
and all sorts of things. They all didn't look attractive to me 

1164
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:02,899
because there was no dessert there.

1165
01:01:02,999 --> 01:01:07,599
And then I cleansed for three days, juicing, juicing, juicing 

1166
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:09,520
and detoxifying my body.

1167
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,849
Joe Cross: I guess the way I looked at it was I'd turned my back on Mother Nature.

1168
01:01:12,949 --> 01:01:16,100
And I wanted to conduct an experiment where I was the lab rat.

1169
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,590
What would happen if I ran towards her full steam,

1170
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,100
would she open her arms and embrace me? And would I be healed?

1171
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,789
I went straight to juicing and a plant-based diet.

1172
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:31,839
Now within basically ten to fifteen days 

1173
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:36,089
the fog had lifted and I was on the path.

1174
01:01:36,189 --> 01:01:39,640
After about two weeks, I did notice my energy coming back.

1175
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,429
Colours just a little bit brighter.

1176
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,490
Just after three days of plan, I lost 7 lbs. [3 kg] 

1177
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,801
After four months, while continuing a healthy diet 

1178
01:01:50,902 --> 01:01:54,110
I was cancer-free, my skin clear.

1179
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,725
It was the first time ever that I lost weight naturally so fast.

1180
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,830
At the end of the day 

1181
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:06,869
This is kind of like your last area of control in the world.

1182
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:10,118
What you do with it is what you take and what you put in here. 

1183
01:02:10,422 --> 01:02:12,404
Nobody can control you on that.

1184
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:31,330
Dr. Alejandro Jünger : Cleansing and detoxification has a side effect.

1185
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,296
It will make you lose weight. 

1186
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:36,210
It will make your eyes white, 
it will make your skin glow.

1187
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,760
There's no need to think about that, right?

1188
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:42,430
Those are side effects of cleansing and detoxification.

1189
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,269
Whatever you're going for 

1190
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:46,255
I think you can ultimately get it 

1191
01:02:46,356 --> 01:02:48,470
when you start to change your diet and lifestyle.

1192
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,790
A lot of people look at me and tell me you must be in your twenties.

1193
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,490
Well, no, I'm not.

1194
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,964
And that's always a nice compliment.

1195
01:02:55,065 --> 01:02:57,780
I love hearing that people think I'm a lot younger 

1196
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,620
than I am, and I am headed into my 40s.

1197
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,070
And certainly I think that this lifestyle 

1198
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:07,990
has helped me not only live 
with a chronic disease, but also

1199
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:10,379
feel young, feel young in my skin 

1200
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,720
and depending on the light, it looks pretty good too.

1201
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,155
The truth is that we were programmed as a species 

1202
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:21,262
to be attracted to the people who look good.

1203
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,570
Why? Because they are the healthiest ones.

1204
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:27,333
We are naturally designed to "screen" each other for health 

1205
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,470
for reproductive purposes.

1206
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:32,789
When we look at each other and we see glowing skin, we see shining eyes 

1207
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,490
and that's sexy to us. A confident person is sexy to us.

1208
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:38,723
Unconsciously, people look for symmetry, 

1209
01:03:38,824 --> 01:03:41,930
they look for skin tone, 

1210
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,670
steady skin tone, 

1211
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:47,160
not a lot of splotchy type of colours on your skin.

1212
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,469
Why? Why is this built in to our definition of beauty?

1213
01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:54,009
Why does the beauty industry spend so much time 

1214
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:57,600
trying to create products that you put on your skin 

1215
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,010
to make your skin look artificially monotone?

1216
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:03,030
The answer is because those are the cues that we pick up on. 

1217
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,442
It makes you look younger or more sexy.

1218
01:04:05,543 --> 01:04:08,930
Ultimately, that, to me, is what we're striving for: 

1219
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,800
is a deep richness of skin tone.

1220
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:17,319
A deep richness of hair, a lustre in our nails, 

1221
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:22,569
an overall feeling of shine and glow, even almost an aura.

1222
01:04:22,669 --> 01:04:25,299
This is possible through natural foods. 

1223
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,438
This is possible through certain strategies of using natural foods 

1224
01:04:29,539 --> 01:04:30,990
and certain supplements.

1225
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:34,191
Through juicing especially. If by avoiding fried foods

1226
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,586
and avoiding the highly oxidated foods 

1227
01:04:36,687 --> 01:04:40,623
that destroy your skin and destroy your internal organs.

1228
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,278
Fried foods are the worst, in my opinion.

1229
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,099
And barbequed foods. They're highly toxic 

1230
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,219
and loaded with carcinogenic chemicals.

1231
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,977
If you can avoid those or at least greatly reduce those 

1232
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,230
and increase your intake of super-foods: 

1233
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:58,006
Chlorella, Spirulina, fresh juice from vegetables and fruit

1234
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,039
that you can make in your own kitchen.

1235
01:05:00,139 --> 01:05:04,249
And your skin within 30 days, it will turn around completely.

1236
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,829
Your friends will ask you what's your secret.

1237
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:10,329
And when you tell them "I've been juicing fresh produce"

1238
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:13,427
they will say "well, I was going to buy a skin cream", 

1239
01:05:13,528 --> 01:05:15,609
because they want the easier way. 

1240
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:19,109
But if you have good friends, they might start juicing with you. 

1241
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:22,739
Because your juice beats their skin cream.

1242
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:25,968
The skin is a true symbol of our health 

1243
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:28,179
because it is the last place to get nutrition.

1244
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:32,433
If you can drive all those nutrients all the way through to the skin 

1245
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,843
then you know it's gotten everywhere else too.

1246
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:37,299
And that's something that we all recognize.

1247
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,764
If somebody's got beautiful skin 

1248
01:05:39,865 --> 01:05:42,632
it tells us and invites us to a deeper understanding 

1249
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:44,973
of what's going on inside the body.

1250
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:48,150
We know that they're generally having a healthier liver, 

1251
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,669
kidneys, heart, lungs, etc.

1252
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:54,390
So, let's take vanity.

1253
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,286
It is a very good entryway, 

1254
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:58,379
because your skin looks better 

1255
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,793
when you're eating a diet that is low glycemic, 

1256
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,702
where the blood sugar is stable.

1257
01:06:03,803 --> 01:06:06,709
As a matter of fact, that's one of the first things that happens.

1258
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,388
Your skin, your hair and your nails begin to look better.

1259
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,605
One of the reasons that I personally stopped eating 

1260
01:06:12,706 --> 01:06:15,803
so many grains and high-glycemic foods 

1261
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:18,489
is over the years I noticed a couple of things.

1262
01:06:18,589 --> 01:06:20,930
First of all, there was weight gain. 

1263
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:22,379
Every year, a little more.

1264
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,750
And every year harder and harder to keep off.

1265
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,922
Second, me and my patients 

1266
01:06:27,023 --> 01:06:31,216
all started to have fingernails that broke, 
hair that broke

1267
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:36,449
and skin that was getting all red, and broken blood vessels and all that stuff.

1268
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:40,097
When you eat well, that goes away.

1269
01:06:40,198 --> 01:06:43,619
We can only eat so much in a day. Therefore, the idea of eating for beauty is: 

1270
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:45,967
let's make those foods beauty foods. 

1271
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,868
Like olive oil and olives, 

1272
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:53,079
cucumbers, radishes, hemp seeds 

1273
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:56,419
Aloe vera, coconut products.

1274
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:59,280
Properly fermented food, talking about yoghurt, 

1275
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,379
talking about kimchi and talking about sauerkraut.

1276
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:04,918
We use those foods to help us digest 

1277
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:08,529
and to replenish the bacteria that colonizes our intestinal tract.

1278
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:12,669
Let's focus on the beauty minerals, like Silica 

1279
01:07:12,769 --> 01:07:16,709
and Iron and Manganese that give glow and charisma. 

1280
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:19,811
Sulfur and what it does to our connective tissue 

1281
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:23,049
and how it reverses age-related lines 

1282
01:07:23,149 --> 01:07:25,910
and how it fills out our protein make-up

1283
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,830
so that our musculature and our overall build 

1284
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,190
reflects the higher qualities 

1285
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,139
almost the symbolical qualities that beauty points to.

1286
01:07:41,155 --> 01:07:43,460
The cosmetic industry 

1287
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:45,766
seems to be a wholesale dumping ground 

1288
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:49,009
for just about every single type of chemical that exists.

1289
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:52,421
From Lead compounds, Mercury compounds 

1290
01:07:52,522 --> 01:07:57,599
compounds that are made from horse urine, namely "urea".

1291
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:00,226
There are all different kinds of synthetic compounds 

1292
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:02,599
that make it into the cosmetic industry 

1293
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,899
Like sodium lauryl sulfate 

1294
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:07,230
and other sudsing agents 

1295
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:12,220
that are used in detergents, that are used in shampoos and body lotions. 

1296
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,790
All this kind of stuff.

1297
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:16,014
Mike Adam : The skin creams that you buy are almost all

1298
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,270
loaded with toxic chemicals.

1299
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:20,859
Most of them contain fragrance chemicals.

1300
01:08:21,159 --> 01:08:24,635
We did a lab analysis of a popular perfume product 

1301
01:08:24,636 --> 01:08:28,752
and it showed that it contains 21 different toxic, 

1302
01:08:28,853 --> 01:08:31,209
potentially carcinogenic chemicals, 

1303
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,680
none of which are listed on the label.

1304
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,849
So if you think about it: How do you want healthy skin?

1305
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:40,249
Do you want your skin to be treated 

1306
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,519
with Nutrition from the inside out, 

1307
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:45,377
or do you want it coated with petrochemicals 

1308
01:08:45,478 --> 01:08:48,527
and toxic chemicals, and artificial fragrance products 

1309
01:08:48,628 --> 01:08:51,439
from the outside, which will be absorbed in? 

1310
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:55,060
And then they will get into your liver, and your heart, and your kidneys and your brain 

1311
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,686
and they will cause disease inside.

1312
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:07,585
200 lbs. [88 kg]

1313
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:11,315
Kris Carr : It's not just what you're eating, it's also what's eating you.

1314
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,209
So, where is the sweetness missing in your life?

1315
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:17,519
What else is going on? What kind of suffering are you going through?

1316
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,129
What's going on between this ear and this ear?

1317
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:22,567
Dr. Christiane Northrup : There is an interesting study, called "The A Study", 

1318
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:25,160
the "Adverse Childhood Experiences" study 

1319
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:30,490
done by Vincent Felitti, at Kaiser Permanente in San Diego.

1320
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,989
And they were working with obese people 

1321
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:36,561
and what he's coming to the conclusion of is 

1322
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:42,000
that obesity is not the problem, it's a solution.

1323
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,495
So let's take a look at that.

1324
01:09:43,587 --> 01:09:45,500
It's a solution to chronic stress. 

1325
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,843
It's a solution in many people to sexual abuse,

1326
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:51,429
dysfunctional family situations and so on.

1327
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:52,910
Jon Gabriel : You know, I've talked to so many people 

1328
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:55,499
that have been overweight all their life,

1329
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:58,149
and I always ask them "when did it start?".

1330
01:09:58,349 --> 01:10:01,085
- "When I was 4 years old." 
- "What happened when you were 4 years old?"

1331
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,609
- "Well, my father was an alcoholic and he beat me."

1332
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:07,507
Or "we moved to another country and I was really scared".

1333
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:09,833
Let's look at why you're not satisfied.

1334
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,230
Are you in a dead-end job?

1335
01:10:11,305 --> 01:10:13,389
Are you married to someone who treats you like crap?

1336
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:18,429
Are you suffocating under the weight of too much pressure in your life?

1337
01:10:18,829 --> 01:10:23,369
Are there some old residual traumas and dramas 

1338
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:24,964
that need to be attended to,

1339
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,549
some unfinished business, that's getting you stuck,

1340
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:30,751
and making you keep spinning your wheels,

1341
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:34,690
that are ultimately encouraging you to make poor food choices.

1342
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:40,141
"Dear diary, today I feel very sad 

1343
01:10:40,242 --> 01:10:42,310
And I want to eat *everything*.", right?

1344
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,965
I think a lot of people when they're stressed 

1345
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:47,798
or sad they turn to food for comfort.

1346
01:10:47,799 --> 01:10:51,735
Especially all foods that they ate growing up.

1347
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:54,940
Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, cake, cookies,

1348
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:58,868
all those things that you ate or you got from your mom.

1349
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,114
And it goes back to that time of

1350
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,639
being nurtured and nourished and what-not.

1351
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:07,947
One of the best pieces of advice I ever got from my spiritual teacher was 

1352
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:09,928
"If you're upset, don't eat."

1353
01:11:10,129 --> 01:11:12,170
And I think it's so profound 

1354
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,878
because, often times when we are upset,

1355
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:19,378
we have no connection to whether or not we are satiated or not.

1356
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:20,835
Whether or not we're full,

1357
01:11:20,936 --> 01:11:23,129
because we're trying to fill

1358
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:26,350
a void that can never be filled with food.

1359
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:29,307
So the type of stresses are like nothing that 

1360
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:32,079
you would ever associate necessarily with waking,

1361
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:36,031
sleep deprivation, dehydration, mental and emotional stress.

1362
01:11:36,132 --> 01:11:38,893
You're driving to work, you're stuck in traffic, 

1363
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:40,523
your boss is going to get mad at you.

1364
01:11:40,624 --> 01:11:42,069
That's causing chemistry.

1365
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,010
Every time you have a mental or emotional stress 

1366
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:48,100
it's causing chemistry in your body. Real chemistry.

1367
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,705
And when that chemistry is the same 

1368
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:51,210
chemistry as a famine, 

1369
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:55,529
your body is going to want to gain weight. It's trying to protect you from the stresses in your life.

1370
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,159
It doesn't know what to do.

1371
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:01,070
We're living in a world that's so different 

1372
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,630
from the way it was thousands of years ago,

1373
01:12:03,731 --> 01:12:06,949
where all we had to worry about was not being eaten by a tiger 

1374
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,670
and where our next meal was coming from.

1375
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:12,063
Now we've got to worry about how we're going to pay our mortgage,

1376
01:12:12,164 --> 01:12:14,490
or our credit card, or if our kids are going to go to school,

1377
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:16,420
or if the world will get blown up.

1378
01:12:16,521 --> 01:12:18,350
All these stresses are causing chemistry 

1379
01:12:18,351 --> 01:12:20,180
and our bodies are trying to protect us.

1380
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,808
People get so mad, we get so mad with our bodies.

1381
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:24,502
We hate our bodies 

1382
01:12:24,603 --> 01:12:27,782
because we think that the body is trying to sabotage us, it's out to get us.

1383
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,740
No. It's just a protection mechanism. It's nothing more.

1384
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,671
When you are under stress,

1385
01:12:32,772 --> 01:12:34,760
you have the stress hormones cortisol and epinephrine.

1386
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,481
And if you've ever seen anyone on steroid medication,

1387
01:12:38,582 --> 01:12:40,010
such as Prednisone,

1388
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,238
you see that the first thing that happens is they gain 20-30 lbs [9-14 kg.],

1389
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,870
no matter what they're eating.

1390
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,540
In fact, when your cortisol, stress-hormone levels, are high enough,

1391
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,269
they've documented the fact that looking at a donut

1392
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:54,487
actually changes your metabolism.

1393
01:12:56,899 --> 01:12:59,622
The number one best way to digest stress hormones 

1394
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:01,209
is sleep.

1395
01:13:01,409 --> 01:13:03,016
And deep sleep 

1396
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:06,570
will metabolize excess cortisol and epinephrine,

1397
01:13:06,671 --> 01:13:08,120
better than anything else.

1398
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,962
So I want people to try something.

1399
01:13:10,063 --> 01:13:14,429
If you've been under stress, and you sleep for only 3-4 hours a night,

1400
01:13:14,529 --> 01:13:18,540
you will gain 2 lbs. [1 kg.] just from that alone,

1401
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,729
because the stress increases fluid retention.

1402
01:13:23,129 --> 01:13:25,099
So I call those "liquids pounds."

1403
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,101
You want to take care of these "liquid pounds" 

1404
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:30,421
before they turn into real pounds, which they inevitably will.

1405
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:32,509
Many many people are sleep-deprived now.

1406
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:35,827
So I'd first like to give people permission to sleep,

1407
01:13:35,928 --> 01:13:38,949
and sleep as long as you need to, whenever you can.

1408
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:40,340
So that's sleep.

1409
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,259
The second thing that really metabolizes stress hormones,

1410
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:45,516
and this is how the body was designed,

1411
01:13:45,617 --> 01:13:51,439
is exercise. When you lift weights or you simply take a long walk,

1412
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:56,904
You're doing a couple of things: one is you're increasing those feel-good hormones 

1413
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:59,469
that you would normally have gone to sugar for.

1414
01:13:59,545 --> 01:14:03,880
So, Exercise. Taking a walk 3 or 4 times a week

1415
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:09,085
is as good as antidepressants for mild to moderate depression.

1416
01:14:09,186 --> 01:14:11,643
I mean this is insane, just exercise alone.

1417
01:14:11,744 --> 01:14:14,847
And you know when you get out there and you do it when you're out in the fresh air.

1418
01:14:14,948 --> 01:14:17,802
You feel much better, and that's biochemical.

1419
01:14:17,903 --> 01:14:21,609
Anything that is sustainably pleasurable 

1420
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:23,619
will decrease stress hormones.

1421
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,812
Laughter decreases them enormously.

1422
01:14:26,913 --> 01:14:30,646
So I would recommend that you have some funny movies lying around.

1423
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:34,979
And that's been clinically shown to improve immunity 

1424
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:37,945
and also decrease pain.

1425
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,839
I like to look at my before and after pictures

1426
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,615
and I wonder how I did.

1427
01:15:06,716 --> 01:15:09,063
I can tell you that the body I have now 

1428
01:15:09,164 --> 01:15:11,209
is exactly the body that I visualized having.

1429
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,589
And I'm not sure that's a coincidence.

1430
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:19,530
And I thought about why is visualization so powerful for weight loss. 

1431
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:22,260
And visualization for body changing in general.

1432
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,266
Arnold Schwarzenegger said he used to use visualization 

1433
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,388
to become a champion bodybuilder 

1434
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,590
and he was one of the best bodybuilders.

1435
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:32,973
I've talked to so many other people that have been so successful in visualization, 

1436
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:36,669
but what I realized is visualization is like a language 

1437
01:15:36,769 --> 01:15:40,680
that you can use to talk to your subconscious.

1438
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,721
Your subconscious is the part of your brain that's 

1439
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:46,895
in charge of a lot of things, but one of the things it's in charge of 

1440
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,083
is your body's unconscious processes.

1441
01:15:49,184 --> 01:15:51,839
How much oxygen you need, it's not a conscious thought.

1442
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,911
You don't think how much you need to breathe,

1443
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,489
that's unconscious.

1444
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:57,629
How much your heart beats, that's unconscious.

1445
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,890
And how fat or thin you should be, 
is an unconscious decision,

1446
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,589
but it is a decision.

1447
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:06,896
And the problem with this subconscious 
or unconscious part of us

1448
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:09,089
is that it doesn't speak English.

1449
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,462
And so we're being run by a brain 

1450
01:16:11,563 --> 01:16:13,139
that we can't talk to.

1451
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:16,568
But when I realized that visualization is like a language 

1452
01:16:16,669 --> 01:16:19,130
that you can use to talk to your subconscious

1453
01:16:19,231 --> 01:16:21,684
because, just like you can't talk to someone 

1454
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,340
who doesn't speak your language ...

1455
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,990
say you have to go to the bathroom in a foreign country,

1456
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,468
You could ask a thousand people where the bathroom is, they won't tell you.

1457
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,551
But if you draw a picture of a bathroom, on a napkin 

1458
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:33,119
in the restaurant or something, and show it to anyone

1459
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,560
instantly they know what you mean.

1460
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,549
Visualization is the universal... or symbols

1461
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,156
is the universal language, for people that don't speak your language.

1462
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,880
Your body doesn't speak your language.

1463
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:49,345
When you make a visual image of the way you would like to look,

1464
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,712
it could be you at another time,

1465
01:16:51,813 --> 01:16:53,969
when you were fit and healthy and happy,

1466
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:56,089
or it could be somebody else, doesn't matter.

1467
01:16:56,189 --> 01:16:58,756
Just look at the picture for 30 seconds,

1468
01:16:58,857 --> 01:17:01,030
with kind of like as if you're looking through the picture,

1469
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:03,844
and unconsciously, don't look with your eyes, look through it.

1470
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:05,989
Let your subconscious absorb it.

1471
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,562
For just 30 seconds.

1472
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:11,106
And then close your eyes,

1473
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,490
and either see yourself, feel yourself,

1474
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:15,800
imagine yourself being in that body.

1475
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,929
Imagine yourself walking on the beach with that body.

1476
01:17:19,429 --> 01:17:21,610
Whatever way you can do it,

1477
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:26,549
and you do it when your mind is calm and powerful, and relaxed.

1478
01:17:26,649 --> 01:17:28,610
Your subconscious understands.

1479
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,641
And it understands that it doesn't need fat,

1480
01:17:31,742 --> 01:17:33,518
and that it's confusing the stresses.

1481
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:36,630
Because it really doesn't know what to do with the stresses of modern-day life.

1482
01:17:36,715 --> 01:17:38,372
"Do I get fatter, do I get thinner?"

1483
01:17:38,473 --> 01:17:40,489
"How do I protect this person who is so scared?"

1484
01:17:42,089 --> 01:17:43,630
So sometimes it uses fat,

1485
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,915
but when we can communicate with our subconscious 

1486
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,709
and say "no, that's not the answer",

1487
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,259
"I appreciate it, but that's not what's happening".

1488
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:52,359
"OK, I'll turn the fat programs off".

1489
01:17:52,759 --> 01:17:55,219
Just like that, everything changes.

1490
01:17:56,501 --> 01:17:59,830
"Whatever you hold in your mind on a consistent basis,

1491
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:02,421
is EXACTLY what you will experience in your life."

1492
01:18:02,522 --> 01:18:04,022
Anthony Robbins.

1493
01:18:04,589 --> 01:18:06,889
Joe Cross : Unfortunately, most people 

1494
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:10,249
and when I say "most" that's like over 50% 

1495
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:12,809
of people get out of that morning shower 

1496
01:18:12,909 --> 01:18:15,969
have a look at themselves in the mirror, when they're alone,

1497
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:18,099
and they're not happy with what they see.

1498
01:18:18,799 --> 01:18:20,279
They're just not happy.

1499
01:18:20,379 --> 01:18:22,819
And they start out their day

1500
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:26,399
by berating themselves, telling them they are losers

1501
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,849
they are no good, they gotta lift their game and all these things.

1502
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:33,799
Now, if you had someone who was with you 24/7

1503
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,229
that was just whispering that in your ear all the time 

1504
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:39,500
I mean, I don't know about you, but they wouldn't last 5 minutes with me.

1505
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,829
Yet, we allow ourselves to do it to ourself.
We do it to ourselves.

1506
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:46,982
Frank Ferrante : There's a group that I go to that says 

1507
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:49,609
"Let us love you, till you love yourself"

1508
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,850
And when I first heard that

1509
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:58,089
I was so sad.

1510
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:01,570
I became aware of the depth of my self-loathing.

1511
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:04,578
Death seemed, at least ... 

1512
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:06,339
I wasn't suicidal.

1513
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:08,939
I occasionally had thoughts.

1514
01:19:09,139 --> 01:19:13,960
But it was like, I wasn't suicidal, but I welcomed death.

1515
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,649
You know what? Like just turn the switch,

1516
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:21,090
you know, flick the off button.

1517
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,790
"I'm ready for the big sleep, man"

1518
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,160
And it takes ... 

1519
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,565
But it's at that point, the genesis of willingness emerges.

1520
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:35,130
That was the genesis of willingness.

1521
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:38,880
And, that crack, as Leonard Cohen says 

1522
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,976
it's the crack that lets the light in.

1523
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:42,840
That crack let the light in.

1524
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,714
Evita Ramparte : Something miraculous, something powerful

1525
01:19:45,715 --> 01:19:47,789
happens when you take care of yourself.

1526
01:19:47,889 --> 01:19:51,779
You realize you're precious,

1527
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:56,140
you become in love with yourself, basically.

1528
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,270
And it shines, it overflows to others, it becomes contagious.

1529
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,079
You give others the permission to be in love with themselves and in love with life.

1530
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,849
What was the most important thing 

1531
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,339
to keep off the weight? 

1532
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,381
What do I believe was the most crucial component? Without question, love.

1533
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:18,930
Love for myself and love for other people.

1534
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,740
When we think about love, what love is really,

1535
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,870
is love is safety.

1536
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:27,870
Because when you're zero years old, you're a couple of weeks old 

1537
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:30,550
if your mother doesn't love you, you're going to die.

1538
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:33,396
Your mother has to take care of you, has to feed you.

1539
01:20:33,485 --> 01:20:35,020
You are totally helpless.

1540
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,030
So from the moment we are born,

1541
01:20:37,131 --> 01:20:39,129
we equate love with safety.

1542
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:42,750
So when you feel like you're not being loved because your partner

1543
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:44,984
or boyfriend or girlfriend doesn't love you,

1544
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,010
or because someone out there doesn't love you 

1545
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:51,771
then your safety, your primal feeling of safety

1546
01:20:51,872 --> 01:20:53,650
has been triggered and activates the stress.

1547
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,240
That's going to make you want to hold on to weight.

1548
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,480
Thousands of years ago, if your community didn't love you,

1549
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:01,200
you were excommunicated.

1550
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,447
If the tribe didn't love you, you were excommunicated.

1551
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:09,786
And so, then you die, because you can't survive on your own

1552
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,470
in a tribal world.

1553
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:16,147
So it's totally hard-wired into us, that love equals safety.

1554
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,848
SLEEP MORE, EXERCISE, LAUGH MORE!

1555
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:21,431
DETOXICANTS FOODS: CILANTRO AND PARSLEY

1556
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:28,345
DETOX: SPIRULINA, CHIA SEEDS, ALOE VERA

1557
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:41,151
I actually think that the concept of loving yourself 

1558
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,820
is key to all of it.

1559
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,515
Without that, nothing else is going to be sustainable,

1560
01:21:45,616 --> 01:21:48,129
because if you have a message in your head:

1561
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:50,639
I'm a worthless piece of crap,

1562
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:56,324
and my life doesn't count for anything, and I'm always a failure and I screw up all the time,

1563
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:58,941
and I'll never be good enough, and I'll never make it

1564
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:00,429
and no one loves me.

1565
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:03,580
The first thing you do is you know that they're probably there.

1566
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:08,422
And Louise Hay, Hay House, has a wonderful practice.

1567
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:12,109
And if anyone would just do this, really do it, for 30 days. And for years

1568
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:16,009
I wrote it out on a prescription. So here it is:

1569
01:22:16,109 --> 01:22:19,928
"I accept myself unconditionally right now."

1570
01:22:20,029 --> 01:22:21,419
Write it on the prescription.

1571
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:23,989
Their job was to paste it on the bathroom mirror 

1572
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:27,918
and twice a day, look deep into their eyes and say 

1573
01:22:28,019 --> 01:22:32,429
I accept myself unconditionally right now.

1574
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:34,735
Then you wait.

1575
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:36,979
Then you wait, for the messages to arrive.

1576
01:22:37,179 --> 01:22:40,509
"You're a piece of shit, there's no way that you can love yourself."

1577
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,039
"Look at your size."

1578
01:22:42,139 --> 01:22:45,249
"See all that cellulite? What about that body of yours?" 

1579
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:46,956
"You're 30 lbs [13 kg] overweight."

1580
01:22:47,057 --> 01:22:49,609
"You're unmarried, you're a middle-age woman with cats."

1581
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,486
"There's nothing acceptable about you."

1582
01:22:51,587 --> 01:22:54,059
That's what's going to come up. That's okay! That's okay.

1583
01:22:54,259 --> 01:22:56,309
If you do this for 30 days,

1584
01:22:56,409 --> 01:23:00,449
right about day 28, something shifts inside.

1585
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:02,916
And you begin to believe it,

1586
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:06,109
because you're planting a new affirmation.

1587
01:23:06,209 --> 01:23:07,852
Rudyard Kipling said 

1588
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:11,261
"I am, by nature, a dealer in words,

1589
01:23:11,396 --> 01:23:13,583
and words are the most powerful drug 

1590
01:23:13,684 --> 01:23:15,299
known to humanity."

1591
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:19,376
So you are giving yourself different messages,

1592
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,329
and when you start to do that,

1593
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:25,509
you begin to have, you develop, like a muscle,

1594
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,989
this witness-self that listens to you talk.

1595
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:31,639
And the stronger that witness-self gets,

1596
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,538
the healthier you get.

1597
01:23:33,939 --> 01:23:37,669
As a doctor, let me tell you what self-love does.

1598
01:23:37,769 --> 01:23:41,565
It improves your hearing, your eyesight, it lowers your blood pressure,

1599
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:45,439
it increases pulmonary function, cardiac output,

1600
01:23:45,539 --> 01:23:47,914
helps wire in the musculature.

1601
01:23:48,015 --> 01:23:52,689
So if we had a rampant epidemic 

1602
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:54,636
of self-love,

1603
01:23:55,437 --> 01:24:00,089
then our health care costs would go down dramatically.

1604
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:04,788
This isn't some little fru-fru New Age notion

1605
01:24:04,889 --> 01:24:07,299
"Oh, love yourself, honey",

1606
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:10,462
this is hard-core science.

1607
01:24:16,109 --> 01:24:19,939
So you can improve your life, and your mind,

1608
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:22,820
and your mindset, your outlook on life 

1609
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:26,339
can improve. You've got to ask just basically three simple questions:

1610
01:24:26,439 --> 01:24:28,287
Where does my food come from?

1611
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,310
What went into the food in terms of attitude 

1612
01:24:31,311 --> 01:24:34,090
or care, or love or compassion?

1613
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:36,880
And then, thirdly: What is my intention 

1614
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,990
of doing with the food?

1615
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:42,289
Is the food to support me, for a good purpose,

1616
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:45,189
to do something productive, or is it just entertainment?

1617
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:49,338
Your body was designed to be healthy, health is the natural state.

1618
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:52,170
If we let our body do what it wants to do

1619
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,789
in an environment where all the foods are healthy choices, all of them,

1620
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:57,240
we don't have to be concerned with these things any more.

1621
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,579
We can live without fear of weight gain 

1622
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,660
and without fear of degenerative disease.

1623
01:25:07,074 --> 01:25:08,400
"Hey Gorgeous!

1624
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:11,469
"Dinner party at mine tonight."

1625
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:13,250
"Don't think Jason knows. Amanda."

1626
01:25:15,051 --> 01:25:17,851
"Don't worry. I'll tell him."

1627
01:25:28,383 --> 01:25:30,585
- Hi. 
- Oh, hey.

1628
01:25:42,129 --> 01:25:43,802
- I'm sorry, did you say something?

1629
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:48,893
- Actually, it doesn't really matter any more.

1630
01:25:55,486 --> 01:25:57,200
ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR CHANGE?
