1
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,109
We don't have much time.
Go to work

2
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,075
Saya??

3
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,917
Something wrong?

4
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,997
Every blood-sucker you kill
brings us one step closer

5
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,032
I'm not here for those bottom feeders?!

6
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,152
It's only a matter of time...
and patience?!

7
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,918
Jesus Christ?!

8
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,911
Hey?! Something's not right.

9
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,119
What??

10
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,154
There ain't no blood-sucker in there.

11
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,031
He's human.

12
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,032
It didn't have the time to transform, that's all.

13
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,951
You're gonna take her word for it??

14
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,035
What if she just screwed up?

15
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,916
Saya. That's enough.

16
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,951
Get some rest.

17
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,031
I'll be at the hotel tomorrow.

18
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,154
The little bitch is out of control?!

19
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,109
We need her.

20
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,031
Saya is all we've got.

21
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,912
Michael?!

22
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,115
Let's go.

23
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,909
Saya sama!

24
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,111
Tell me about my father.

25
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,110
He was a warrior.

26
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,998
The bravest hunter there was.

27
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,078
How did he tell
demons apart from humans?

28
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,914
He stared straight into their eyes,

29
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,912
and he could see they had no souls.

30
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,032
Demons can assume human flesh,

31
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,119
but they can't conjure up human soul.

32
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,116
Heaven put demons into the world,

33
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,032
If Heaven intended
for demons to live among us.

34
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,913
Why do we kill them?

35
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,116
In life we all have duties.

36
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,034
To fulfill our duties is serving
Heaven's will.

37
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,954
The rest is not for us to question.

38
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,989
Saya!

39
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,033
Your father was slain by

40
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,033
Onigen,the oldest,
vilest demon of them all.

41
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:38,995
It's your destiny to avenge for him,
to continue his mission.

42
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,110
Are you determined, my girl?

43
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,992
Yes, Kato!

44
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,037
Three deaths on the American
air base within a week.

45
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,036
Our Cleaners got there in time.

46
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,951
No one saw the bodies.

47
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,149
The underlings are feeding.

48
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,075
Well you know the old saying:

49
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,992
"when the hungry demons feed
without discretion..."

50
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,996
...Onigen is near

51
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,156
You're about to get your wish.

52
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,912
To face the leader of the pack.

53
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,956
The plan?

54
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,958
The council wants you on the base.
To find more leads.

55
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,076
I don't investigate. I kill.

56
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,910
Be my guest. Kill the bottom feeders
and lure out Onigen.

57
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,037
But this time, let the blood mutate

58
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,917
I was never wrong.

59
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,996
Doesn't hurt to be cautious,
that's all.

60
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,959
And, don't blow your cover
unless absolutely necessary.

61
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,156
The Elder pulled up all the
strings to arrange this.

62
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,909
Cover?

63
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,115
What's that?

64
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,155
It's a new outfit...

65
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,073
1,2,3,4...

66
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,077
You know, dad, you don't have to
drive me to school everyday. I can walk.

67
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,072
Don't be silly. It's my only chance
to spend some time with you.

68
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,991
Everyone else walks.

69
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,109
You're not everyone, sweetie.

70
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,955
I'm not a kid either.

71
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,109
Is that why you did it??

72
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,151
To prove that you're all grown up??

73
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,035
Did what?

74
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,036
I was hoping you'd come clean.

75
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,116
That's what grown-ups do, you know?

76
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,154
I don't know what you're talking about.

77
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,957
Well l...

78
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,031
I guess it must've been Franck.
What do you say, Franck?

79
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,149
Sir??

80
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,952
Was it you who took my car
out for a spin last night?

81
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,113
No, Sir.

82
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,157
Did you sneak off the base and boogie
at the Hippy Shake until four?

83
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,119
No, Sir.

84
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,072
I can not believe this.
You're spying on me?

85
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,957
I don't have to Alice.

86
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,995
You're my daughter.

87
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,110
People know you and people talk.

88
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,118
Ok, yeah, I'm... sorry,
I should have told you. Just...

89
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,952
You're always busy, day and night,
working on your second star.

90
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,036
You've got to understand?
We're at war.

91
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,036
We're all at risk, even here.

92
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,991
This is your war, not mine.

93
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,951
That's enough, Alice.

94
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,996
Hey?! Watch where you're going, damn'it?!

95
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,911
Yes, sir?!

96
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,036
Momma, Momma can't you see?

97
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,115
Alice?!

98
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,993
Alice would you come back here!

99
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,992
The Air Force made a man of me.

100
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,109
Alice!

101
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,112
I'm so happy, I'm so proud

102
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,111
So class, let's give our new classmate
a warm welcome.

103
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,159
Here we go... hem... Saya,
would you care to take that desk over there?

104
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,955
Good?! Now I know you've all been
doing your homework, and you've prepared.

105
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,158
...today's readings, which will be
from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

106
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,028
Okey dokey we're gonna start on page 135.

107
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,075
She must be lost...

108
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,155
thinks it's a navy base?

109
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,996
I can't believe they let a jap enroll here.

110
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,992
Oh, next thing you know
they'll think they own the place.

111
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,077
Like Adam, I was created...

112
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,109
Yes sir,

113
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,036
Our story stands

114
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,031
They think it's a ClA plan.

115
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,996
Frankenstein's monster compares himself
with both Adam and Lucifer.

116
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,078
Can you tell me why, Liz?

117
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,999
Hem... Cause both Adam and Lucifer
were created by God?

118
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,989
Yes, but these are opposite
ends of good and evil... Uh,

119
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,116
to which end does the Monster belong?

120
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,073
To whom, does he reach out in his anger?

121
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,112
Saya, would you care to join our discussion??

122
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,152
Me no english...

123
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,949
Yes Alice??

124
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,949
Anger is what makes the monster human.
It's neither good or evil.

125
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,993
Uh, he was abandonned by
his creator just like lucifer

126
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:16,079
So God and Victor Frankenstein both deserted
their creations not because they were imperfect,

127
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,119
but because they reminded them
of their own imperfections...

128
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,951
That's very interesting.

129
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:29,037
So, do you think that God is
an irresponsible father figure??

130
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,957
She must be thinking about her dad.

131
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,910
What did you say??

132
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,151
Piss off the princess and next thing
you know her dad will court-marshall you?!

133
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,070
Oh, it's not my fault,
please don't send me to the chair...

134
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,036
Grow up?!

135
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,078
Yes, now can we settle down please,
come on, let... Iet's be nice.

136
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,992
Uh, George,
could you read the next paragraph??

137
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,991
Accursed creator?!
Why did you form a monster so hideous

138
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,956
that even YOU turned from me in disgust??

139
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,076
God, in pity made man
beautiful and alluring...

140
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,109
Concentrate Alice,

141
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,071
Iet the mind lead the body.

142
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,075
Good!

143
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,149
That's it for today.

144
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,155
What's our motto, team Lupin?

145
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,116
BE A WOLF, OR BE GONE!

146
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,912
That's the spirit.

147
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,030
I need your help with this,
ok, for the team, understand?

148
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,995
...I think so

149
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,912
Alice!

150
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,029
Sir?

151
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,996
You're dragging down the whole team.

152
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,110
I want you to stay and, practice.

153
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,070
But I have to...

154
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,038
Don't think you'll get a special treatment
just because you're the general's daughter.

155
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,911
I didn't say that.

156
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,069
I'll spar with Alice.

157
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,951
And I will be the ref.

158
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,951
No I'll, practice on my own.

159
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,911
Gotta think of the team.

160
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,916
Think of the tournament next week.

161
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,075
Make a wolf of Alice for me girls.

162
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,997
Yes, Mr. Powell.

163
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,035
Bring it on...

164
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,951
What are you doing?

165
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,111
We tried very, very hard, to ignore you.

166
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,911
But you just keep getting on our nerves!

167
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,951
Are you insane!

168
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,035
Go!

169
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,069
Secure that vehicle?!

170
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,109
Who are they?

171
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,949
We don't know yet sir.

172
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,955
Step out?!

173
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,992
Unlock the doors
and step out right now?!

174
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,956
Hey pal?!

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,113
What do you think you're doing??

176
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,909
Stop right there, fellow.

177
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,035
Ho ho, easy, big guy!

178
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,155
Do we look like viet-congs?

179
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,069
You keep your hands
where I can see 'em, wiseass!

180
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,957
Is that necessary?

181
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,955
General.

182
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,157
Michael Harrison,
Director of Operations, C.I.A

183
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,991
Those men work for us.

184
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,116
What are you spooks doing on my base?

185
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,079
That's classified.

186
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,072
Langley sent us to assist with the war effort.

187
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,109
In what capacity?

188
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,993
Last time I checked, D.O.
doesn't come under you jurisdic...

189
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,035
Am I talking to you?

190
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,996
General!

191
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,913
My superior will call you shortly.

192
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,956
Now I suggest we all calm down
and handle this like the professionals we are.

193
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,155
Shall we?

194
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,109
You keep an eye on 'em, Franck.

195
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,149
Yes sir.

196
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,115
They were here...

197
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,075
I saw them.

198
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,991
Sharon and...

199
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,991
Linda's head was....

200
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,110
It's ok sweetie, you're safe now.
That's all that matters.

201
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,075
I saw them.

202
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,958
The japanese girl, Franck.
Why was she in our school?

203
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,069
Washington arranged her enrollment sir.

204
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,029
Washington?

205
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,954
Well, registrar says her name is Saya,
she's the daughter of Motoki Shishikura,

206
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,956
a soon-to-be appointed ambassador to D.C

207
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,076
You confirm that with our local liaison.

208
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,911
You get a warrant issue to find her.

209
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,995
They cleaned it all up?!

210
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,038
Dad look, it's still wet.

211
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,992
We've got to find out what
these guys are doing, Franck.

212
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,032
That could be a problem, sir. We don't
have the authority to detain Agency personnel

213
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,917
I'll deal with that.

214
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,036
...I respectfully disagree, Sir?!

215
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,117
Then I will have to file an official complain
with the Pentagon...

216
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,116
I understand, Sir.

217
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,950
Dad, Whoever they are, they've covered up
two murders, you can't let them go!

218
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,911
Cut'em loose, Franck.

219
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,159
Alice.

220
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,909
Yes sir.

221
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,069
Stand down?!...

222
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,951
you son of a bitch?!

223
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,155
What's wrong with you?

224
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,029
Taunting Mckee like that?

225
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,038
In case you didn't notice,
they pulled their guns on me.

226
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,112
We've got to clean up this mess,
or the council will have our heads!

227
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,072
What was the Elder thinking anyway sending
Saya into a high school??

228
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,031
She's older than all of us combined?!

229
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,075
Yeah.

230
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,989
Christ?!

231
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,957
The Elder wants to see us.

232
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,116
Something was wrong with them!

233
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,116
Linda's blood was...

234
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,115
Sweetie...

235
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,151
You're still in shock, it's understandable.

236
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,069
You go get some sleep.

237
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,952
You have to believe me!
Mr. Powell knows something!

238
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,116
How can he know anything
if he wasn't even there?

239
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,913
Now would you just go get some sleep?!

240
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,951
Dad, you're wrong!

241
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,913
Alice, that's enough?!

242
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,956
Look?! Would you just leave it
to the grown-ups!

243
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,109
We'll talk in the morning.

244
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,957
Yes?

245
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,037
Frank! What do you have??

246
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,113
Ya, just as I said. If there were to be a new
ambassador, I would have been briefed.

247
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,919
Guys with sunglasses and funny hats wave
their cheaps badges around,

248
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,076
and I'm supposed to believe
they're sent by Langley??

249
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,997
Do whatever you have to,

250
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,112
find out who they are and
what the hell they're doing on my base?!

251
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,957
Sir.

252
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,911
Sit.

253
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,154
Everything according to plan?

254
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,029
Yes, sir.

255
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,917
Rumor has it McKee was calling Langley and
Washington, very curious about both of you.

256
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,076
Was that part of your plan?

257
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,914
We had a run-in with him, yes.

258
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,072
Having American friends in high places
doesn't mean I'm Uncle Sam.

259
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,112
A little discretion would be nice.

260
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,993
The Council has to remain anonymous.

261
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,152
Our American connections
cannot risk exposure.

262
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,157
Don't get too cozy playing ClA.

263
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,075
I'll take care of it.

264
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,957
Leave it to me.

265
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,911
You have my word, sir.

266
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,075
Hungry??

267
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,149
Starving.

268
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,913
Here's something to curb your appetite.

269
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,948
A plane crashed in the Okutama Mountains
this morning.

270
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,956
Those are the crew members on board.

271
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,115
What's left of them, anyway.

272
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,997
This is Onigen's work.

273
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,999
Those photos were taken before
we cleaned up the scene. No one else knows.

274
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,029
She's here.

275
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,035
She took the bate.

276
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,069
Yes.

277
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,950
Now, Onigen's here, blood will be shed.

278
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,116
I'm sorry sir. Ma'am.

279
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,994
The Onsen opens twenty four hours.
Feel free to enjoy anytime.

280
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,031
Anything else you need??

281
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,997
I see you have no luggage.

282
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,996
Observant and caring.

283
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,991
Your wife is a lucky lady.

284
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,035
Yes...

285
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,997
If only she thinks so?!

286
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,114
She and my daughter are preparing dinner.
It will be ready soon in the dining hall.

287
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,149
I can't believe that?!

288
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,991
I'm sorry.

289
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,038
Come out and play, my children.

290
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,958
The feeding season has begun.

291
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,991
Ho, Mr Powell?! How are you??

292
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,035
How's life?

293
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,069
Six pence half a shilling.

294
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,917
You can do the conversion to yen.

295
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,910
Usual??

296
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,949
On the rocks?!

297
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,908
Hi, dear Alice, welcome?!

298
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,996
So, what's your poison tonight??

299
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,029
Leave us Hide.

300
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,029
You lied.

301
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,919
You knew Linda and Sharon were gonna
hurt me and you lied to my dad.

302
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,069
Why me?

303
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,029
What did I do?

304
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,035
What...

305
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,109
what do you want from me?

306
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,071
It's all about you you you, isn't it,uh?

307
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,032
What if you're wrong? Delusional.
You ever thought about that?

308
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,149
I know what I saw.

309
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,117
What you see, has got nothing to do
with what's real.

310
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,993
You look around, you see an air base,
run by daddy,

311
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,068
flying his B fifty-two's to wipe out gook farmers
in rice paddies, fighting his righteous war.

312
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,030
But you don't see the real war.

313
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,033
The one that's been going on since the
beginning of time between your kind and mine.

314
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,036
And the end is upon you.

315
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,952
Brought on by your self-deceiving godliness,
and your pretentious moral high ground.

316
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,116
We will come out the victors.

317
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,992
Welcome to the other side
of the looking glass?!

318
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,036
And now, it's time to die!

319
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,072
hey stop?! Stop now please?!

320
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,077
No... oh no?!

321
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,118
AAAAh?! aaah?!No?!

322
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,997
Let her go?!

323
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,029
NO, no?!!

324
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,149
Get down.

325
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,997
He's getting away?!

326
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,029
He's wounded?!

327
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,155
Get closer?!

328
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,115
Faster!

329
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,955
Faster!

330
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,997
Get closer!

331
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,029
Closer?!

332
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,911
I'm a demon???

333
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,989
NO?!

334
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,038
You have a human soul?!

335
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,030
What is it?? She's near??

336
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,114
Mr. Powell...

337
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,996
Sharon and Linda...

338
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,989
All of them.

339
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,996
They never existed.

340
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,917
What exactly were they?

341
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,957
Blood-suckers

342
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,916
They take on human form.

343
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,111
It's the way they live.

344
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,990
So I guess you're not really
a student, aren't you??

345
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,993
Are there more of those things out there?

346
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,951
More than you can imagine.

347
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,997
Anything I can do?

348
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,029
It's not your war.

349
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,109
Go home.

350
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,951
And forget everything.

351
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,956
And leave you fighting them alone?

352
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,996
I can take care of myself.

353
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,996
My dad is the general at the base.

354
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,075
I can tell him, and he may...

355
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,115
Don't tell anyone!

356
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,119
Why?

357
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,072
You want to live,
you want your father to live?

358
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,997
Then don't?!

359
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,913
All right he wouldn't believe me anyway.

360
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,152
Saya, be really careful. Okay?

361
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,075
Did they see you?

362
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,149
No, sir.

363
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,035
Are these weapons?

364
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,155
No, I don't think so.

365
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,075
There were a total of four cases.

366
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,076
More seem like standard issues,
as far as I can tell, Sir.

367
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,075
From the Agency?

368
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,072
Well, that's if these guys are actually
from the agency at all.

369
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,995
Call up the tech guys!

370
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,071
What in God's name are these things?

371
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,958
Slugs, snails and puppy dog tails

372
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,915
Easy, I'm here to talk, that's all.

373
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,030
How dare you enter my home uninvited??

374
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,035
My apologies.

375
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,155
Old habits die hard.

376
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,958
I've been with the Agency
one day too long I guess.

377
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,149
What do you want?

378
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,912
Did you authorize the burglary, General?

379
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,989
You're not taking it back.

380
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,950
It's evidence.

381
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,995
Of what?

382
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,156
That's for Central Command to decide.

383
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,955
Wait?!

384
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,989
General

385
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,959
I know we started off on the wrong foot,
it's... my fault.

386
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,109
But we're on the same side,

387
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,995
I assure you.

388
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,032
The side that murdered two high school girls?!
I don't think so!

389
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,998
I have come here to give you Saya,
General

390
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,109
She's not with the Agency.

391
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,072
I can't be held responsible,
she's out of control.

392
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,990
Where is she?

393
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,075
Get this down, Franck.

394
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,152
Hotel Yuzuya. Togoshiginza Street.
Ni-Cho, five seven

395
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,109
Hang on. Tell me the street

396
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,031
To-go-shi-gin-za

397
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,035
I know it.

398
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,116
It's in the Shinagawa ward.
About thirty minutes from here...

399
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,076
You left me with no choice, General

400
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,037
I can't leave the case with you.

401
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,116
Who... are you... people?

402
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,991
Saviors of the human race.

403
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:07,077
The Council has been around since before your
grandad's grandad stole his land from lndians.

404
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,111
We walk a higher path, General

405
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,076
RUN, ALlCE, RUN!

406
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,109
Dad!!

407
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,912
Dad?!

408
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,035
Dad?!

409
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,919
Oh...Dad... Oh

410
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,115
Dad...

411
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,997
Get off the base!

412
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,076
You're... not safe... Here

413
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,997
I don't know what to do.

414
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,957
Alice, leave...

415
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,069
Leave...

416
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,911
I...Iove you, sweetie.

417
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,153
Dad!

418
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,910
DAD!

419
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,956
dad...

420
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,951
Fuckin'A!

421
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,951
They were taken at the Onsen Hotel

422
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,991
Onigen

423
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,031
She's looking for you.

424
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,037
It's time we fight back.

425
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,149
Everything is being arranged.

426
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,918
It's not going to be easy.

427
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,155
I don't care!

428
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,952
The Council finds Onigen for me,
that's the deal

429
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,149
It's already taken too long.

430
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,111
You ever think about the future,

431
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,997
after this?

432
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,993
There is more to life than Onigen.

433
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,076
Not for me.

434
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,989
Damn!

435
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,069
How did you find me?

436
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,075
They killed him!

437
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,993
You were right. She showed.

438
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,149
Copy that. I'm on my way.

439
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,155
Take her out now! Do it now?!

440
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,029
Do it?! Now?!

441
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,109
Hurry up?!

442
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,997
The people you work for!

443
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,029
They killed my dad!!

444
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,069
I don't work for them!

445
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,075
YOU'RE LYlNG!

446
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,915
Thank you.

447
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,069
I kill the blood-suckers.

448
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,918
They provide me
what I need to survive.

449
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,912
That's all!

450
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,155
Why my dad?

451
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,949
WHY?!

452
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,116
I'll find out from Michael.

453
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,949
DOWN!!

454
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,155
Give me the girl, Saya!

455
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,075
No!

456
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,076
This has nothing to do with you!

457
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,037
Don't mess with me, halfling!

458
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,995
Luke!

459
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,035
Michael...

460
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,109
Put down the gun!

461
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,029
Put it down!

462
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,917
He killed MCKee

463
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,150
Are you insane?! What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

464
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,915
My job!

465
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,989
I've cleaned up the mess, haven't l?!

466
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,109
You're making a bigger mess!

467
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,154
Not upon I'll get that girl!

468
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,035
No!

469
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,117
Luke! I'm not gonna tell you again!

470
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,154
You're not really gonna shoot me Michael?!

471
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,957
Try me!

472
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,032
Okay, you win.

473
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,953
But don't think I'm not gonna tell
the Elders all about this.

474
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,989
Be my guest

475
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,116
Cause lim not the
one jeopardizing our mission

476
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,951
Youire getting soft, old man.

477
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,956
Maybe. But not stupid!

478
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,075
You all right?

479
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,116
Who's stupid now?!

480
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,149
We have to go!

481
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,995
Wait?!

482
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,949
You drive!

483
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,956
Radio free Japan. Top of the hour.

484
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,991
The commanding officer of right
Air Force base

485
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,036
General Howard R. MCKee has
died from a heart attack.

486
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,954
The general was discovered in critical condition
at his home a few hours ago

487
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,918
but doctors on the scene were
unable to resucitate him

488
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,112
Authorities are asking your help in
finding his daughter Alice MCKee,

489
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,954
who fled the base in an air force truck
shortly after earing the news

490
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,991
A base's psychiatric describes the teen as

491
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,958
unstable and cautions that
her life may be at risk.

492
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,072
Saya?! Are you okay??

493
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,989
Wake up!

494
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,996
Saya! Wake up!

495
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,951
Your blood...

496
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,116
Why did you save me?

497
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,996
I'm not your kind.

498
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,911
It was the right thing to do.

499
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,071
The right thing...

500
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,116
I used to know right from wrong.

501
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,036
Life used to feel right.

502
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,998
Kato raised me, in that moutain village,

503
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,031
where I called home,

504
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,118
Where I found the only friend in my life

505
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,072
Happiness and love was within reach.

506
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,078
But then, the dark dream came?!

507
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:03,070
In the dream, I killed him, love was gone,
replaced by BLOOD.

508
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,118
Saya! Saya sama!

509
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,032
Then I woke up, and it was not a dream.

510
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,075
What's happened??!

511
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,997
Come, my girl.

512
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,951
We have to go.

513
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,908
Take your father's sword!

514
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,149
I don't understand.

515
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:08,997
This sword has gathered dark powers
from all the demons it has slain.

516
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:14,035
It's a blessing, and a curse.

517
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,992
One you're yet ready for.

518
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,116
But we have no time:

519
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:27,073
demons have found us.

520
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,072
Kato, Kato...

521
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:40,910
Sh.... Don't come out till I tell you to!

522
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,116
Don't follow me?!

523
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,957
We go together?!

524
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,995
No!

525
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,995
Kato...

526
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,993
It's time to be on your own my girl.

527
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,995
What are you going to do??

528
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,152
My duty.

529
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,035
No, Kato?!

530
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,954
Stay out of sight until you're truly
ready to face the demons;

531
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,989
Now go and don't look back?!

532
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,109
You're okay?

533
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,072
You're thinking about your father?

534
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,911
Just...

535
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,911
just all the little things.

536
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,115
What about you?

537
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,115
Your family?

538
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,951
My mother,

539
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,036
I never knew her...

540
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,916
My father,

541
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,959
he died, days after I was born.

542
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,951
How?

543
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,911
Onigen murdered him.

544
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:53,036
The oldest, most powerful demon.

545
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,951
My father's most loyal retainer, Kato,

546
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:14,952
saved me, he took me into the mountains.

547
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,069
Cared for me...

548
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,037
Trained me to be strong.

549
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,111
To be like my father.

550
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,953
At the end, he died for me.

551
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,110
Kato?!!!!!!!

552
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,119
Many a night Kato told me
about my father's murder.

553
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,079
How demons deceived him
in the most dispeakable way.

554
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,078
That day I finally understood?

555
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:23,036
I'm my father's daughter,
but I'm also the evil that killed him.

556
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:29,990
Since that night, time stopped.

557
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:38,154
I live for one purpose,
and one purpose only.

558
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,071
To kill Onigen...

559
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,109
That's my duty!

560
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,951
Kato was right.

561
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,032
Demons can't conjure up human souls.

562
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,070
Promise me one thing also,

563
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,150
Never doubt yourself.

564
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,111
You're human.

565
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,991
I promise.

566
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,989
So much pain.
So much struggle. Silly girl

567
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,117
She's close by. Bring her to me

568
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,109
Alive?

569
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,075
Still holding a grudge?

570
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,991
The halfling owes me!

571
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,155
Don't be ridiculous.

572
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,036
Her power is far beyond
what it used to be.

573
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,109
We will see about that!

574
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,075
Let me out.

575
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,912
What?!

576
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,989
You go alone.

577
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,071
Too dangerous to stay with me!

578
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,035
No!

579
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,037
It's our war now!

580
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,035
Come on?!

581
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,029
Come on?!

582
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:56,915
Start?!

583
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,075
Are you okay??

584
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,115
Yeah?!

585
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,995
Yeah... Yeah

586
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,955
Alice?!

587
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,075
Dad...

588
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,036
Don't go.

589
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,109
It's me?!

590
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,991
It's me Alice?!

591
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,075
Please wake up?!

592
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:05,949
Okay, let's go?!

593
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,029
Saya!

594
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,037
Alice!

595
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,037
Alice!

596
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,116
This isn't really happening.

597
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,149
Any of it.

598
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,150
You?!...

599
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,118
You're alive?!

600
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,949
Saya! He isn't real?!

601
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,911
This isn't really happening

602
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,075
None of it!

603
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,115
No...

604
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,035
He's alive.

605
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,115
No?!

606
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,030
You finally found me.

607
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,917
And I found you.

608
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,951
Look at you, my girl.

609
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,112
Eaten alive by guilt over a single human.

610
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:06,996
Yet, not a glimmer of regret for having
slaughtered so many of your own kind.

611
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,911
I'm not your kind!

612
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,914
Denial. Stubbornness

613
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,948
You are, after all, your father's child.

614
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,150
I see you've taken good care of his sword.

615
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,951
Show me your true form Onigen!

616
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,997
What do you want to see?

617
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,115
The demon...

618
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,916
...who murdered my father

619
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,031
The demon...

620
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,957
...who I'll kill!

621
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,996
You knew all along, didn't you?

622
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,071
Deep down in your heart.

623
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,951
I, gave you your strength...

624
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,070
I, gave you your power...

625
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,995
I, gave you immortality, my daughter!

626
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,109
No!!

627
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,917
Silly girl

628
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,991
You've suffered long enough.

629
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,115
Come to me.

630
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:59,112
I've waited a long time, Saya.

631
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,036
For you to gain your strength.

632
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,115
To be ready.

633
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,030
You think the more "demons" you kill,

634
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,958
the more "human" you become, don't you?

635
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,951
How naive...

636
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,111
The truth is, the more you kill,

637
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,156
the more you unleash your power

638
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,953
You come to your true nature.

639
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,116
Don't you see?

640
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,158
You've been doing everything you could,
to become what you don't want to be.

641
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,949
To become me...

642
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,075
Never!

643
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,030
It's your destiny, silly girl

644
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:45,077
Leaves fall, forest grows on.

645
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:50,079
The future, lies in you.

646
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,951
Let her go!

647
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,913
Alice! Alice!

648
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,149
Alice!

649
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,029
Don't you see now?

650
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,111
Which half of you gives you strength,

651
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,116
which half makes you feeble?

652
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,115
Let it all out.

653
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,109
Unleash yourself...

654
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,035
You gave birth to me.

655
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,951
And you can kill me.

656
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,996
But you're nothing to me!

657
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,999
You don't know
what it means to be a mother!

658
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,071
Kill me, my daughter...

659
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,951
Kill me.

660
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,111
And become me!

661
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,115
Saya...

662
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,155
Are you okay??

663
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,991
What's the point?

664
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,951
You don't believe me.

665
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,913
These monsters...

666
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,997
You said one of them attacked
the army truck you stole.

667
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,039
But when we found you at the
bottom of the ravine, you were alone.

668
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,951
They cleaned it up.

669
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,955
They?

670
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,035
The Council...

671
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,996
They killed my father.

672
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,119
Yes, General McKee.

673
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,914
Mortally wounded by the side arm
of the Sergeant Frank Nielsen.

674
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,037
Sergeant Nielsen lost his son
in the war three months ago.

675
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:20,955
His psyc evaluation show, instability.

676
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,998
And this girl, you mentioned...

677
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,957
Saya I believe

678
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,959
Her name, her identity were false.

679
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,953
In fact we believe
she's not even Japanese.

680
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,951
Where is she right now?

681
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,075
She's out there.

682
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,996
Searching...

683
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,071
Searching for what?

684
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,036
Searching for her way back.

685
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,913
From the other side of the looking glass.
