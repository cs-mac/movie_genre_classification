This programme contains
strong language from the start

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,160

# Is the end near?
When is the final day? #


14
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,760
Rock'n'roll's
definitive crazy person.


15
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,560
# What's the future of mankind?


16
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,480
# How do I know?
I got left behind. #


17
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,640
Ozzy Osbourne, who is known for
biting the heads off of bats...


18
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,640
Hey, he's twisted
but he's all right, man.


19
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,800
Another scientific mystery
that's stumping scientists.


20
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,240
How is Ozzy Osbourne still alive
after decades of drugs and alcohol?


21
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,440
# Everyone goes through changes

# Don't look at me for answers


24
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,680
# Don't ask me
I don't know. #


25
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,840
What was that?

APPLAUSE AND CHEERS


27
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,840
Happy birthday!


28
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,240
Well, we made it, Bill.


29
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,160
Good to see you, good to see you.


30
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,840
Nice to see you too.


31
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,320
It's good to see you, man.


32
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,960
It's fucking amazing.


33
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,800
I never thought that.


34
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,280
You look great.


35
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
I do.


36
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
Nice smile.


37
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,440
Come on, Ozzy - smile,
it's your birthday!


38
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,120
I don't feel like fucking smiling.
Shut the fuck up.


39
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,640
Come on, smile, it's your birthday.
There you go.


40
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,120
'Looking back, I should have died
a thousand times, but I never did.


41
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,160
'I never thought I'd make it to
fucking 40.'


42
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,480
By 12 o'clock in the old days
I'd have powder up my nose,


43
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,880
fucking shit in my veins
and all kinds of stuff.


44
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,280
One, two, three.


45
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,880
Nice smile, ladies,
come with your brother.


46
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,280
There's like one or two ways
to get in this world,


47
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
but there are so many
fucked-up ways to go out.


48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
Once you're dead, you're gone.


49
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm just a very fortunate man


50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
to be still here
talking to you about my life.


51
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
One, two, three.
Louis, smile!


52
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,040
I am smiling!


53
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,720
'I've had a crazy life,'


54
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,080
and it ain't over yet.


55
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,080
# Happy birthday to you


56
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,320

'I was born John Michael Osbourne,


62
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,800
'December 3rd, 1948.'


63
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,080
'I was raised in Aston,


64
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,320
'a working-class suburb
of Birmingham, England.'


65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,440
'A lot of the city was destroyed
by the Germans in World War II.'


66
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
I used to play on
a bombed building site,


67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
thinking it was the name
of a place that you go and play,


68
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,800
not realising it was a building
that had been bombed in the war.


69
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,040
That's my grandma, my mother,
and Gillian, my sister.


70
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
My three sisters.


71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,400
My sister Jean, my sister Iris
and my sister Gillian.


72
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,200
We're a working-class family.
There wasn't a lot of money about.


73
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,000
We lived in a small terraced house.


74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,400
Six children had to share
the same bedroom.


75
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,960
We were the poorest kids in the
street, there was no doubt about it.


76
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,560
'I didn't come from fucking royalty.
I didn't come from'


77
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,400
a middle-class
or upper-class background.


78
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
Where I came from was like...


79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,560
the very bottom end of the scale,
you know?


80
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,840
'We were all from the same area
in Birmingham in England.'


81
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,160
It was very much a working-class
area, uh,


82
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,360
I don't think any of us had,
like, hot water


83
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,520
or indoor toilets or...
things like that.


84
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,680
My mother and father.


85
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,960
He was a good guy.
He was, um, you know, he was a...


86
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
He worked hard all his life,
you know?


87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,880
Would never miss a day from work.


88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,280
If he ever missed a day off
you knew he was fucked.


89
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,640
He used to work nights at a factory.


90
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,560
'John used to go out'


91
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,560
and have a drink, get in fights
and that was it.


92
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,720
From what I saw, Johnny
was always in and out of trouble,


93
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
Dad was always telling him off.


94
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,600
And one day, Dad says he'll either
get killed or, you know...


95
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,560
He'll die one way or the other,
you know what I mean?


96
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,600
A lot of the kids turned to crime,
and I did for a time,


97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,840
but I wasn't really good at it.
I didn't want to do it, really.


98
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,040
"John Michael Osbourne,
aged 18.


99
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,000
"Break and enter
the shop of Clara Sharpe


100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,400
"and steal therein two coats,
20 pairs of stockings."


101
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,680
Fined 20 quid.


102
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,120
Cut a long story short,
the police come around


103
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,160
and says to Mr Osbourne,
"Does John Osbourne live here?"


104
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,680
And our dad says,
"There he is - take him."


105
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,360
I got locked up in Winston Green
Prison for about six weeks.


106
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,160
When I eventually got out of prison,
life still felt hopeless for me.


107
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,600
I'd let my family down
for being arrested.


108
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,440
I had no idea what I wanted to do.


109
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,120
Really there were about three or
four choices when we were teenagers.


110
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,600
One was... We would either
probably go to prison,


111
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,520
or go in the factories
or go in the army.


112
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,320
'I remember being in a factory'


113
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,640
and one bloke I said to, "How long
have you been working here?"


114
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,040
And he goes "Oh, 35 years this year,


115
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,880
"and I'm retiring -
I'll get a gold watch."


116
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
I thought, a fucking gold watch?


117
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,080
35 years of your life
have been in this fucking factory.


118
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,120
And I just couldn't handle it,
you know.


119
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,480
I had job after job after job.


120
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,920
I could never hold a job down,
I didn't want to.


121
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,280
I couldn't, I couldn't...
I used to think, "Fuck this.


122
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,840
"Is this me
for the rest of my life?"


123
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,680
John wanted things
which he couldn't have.


124
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,160
Something inside him
wanted to get out.


125
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,000
Nothing really happened to me in
my life until the Beatles happened.


126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,280
And then it was like someone
had turned the world on for me.


127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,840
They played She Loves You
on the radio


128
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,640
and I remember thinking to myself,
"Fucking hell, this is incredible."


129
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,320
From that moment on, when
I first heard She Loves You,


130
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,040
I knew I wanted to be a rock star
for the rest of my life.


131
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,760
Come on!

Adrenaline from the gig.

Hello, is Sharon about?


144
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,120
Just tell her
the gig was phenomenal.


145
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,280
The crowd was fucking unbelievable.


146
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,960
It's fucking...undescribable.


147
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,640
It's like a divine experience,
you know?


148
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,680
All right, I'll call back.
Speak to you later. Bye.

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,240
and people still want to see me.


153
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,440
CHANTING: Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy!


154
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,480
It's Ozzy night, man.
It's the night of the living dead.


155
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,080
I've been fucking listening to him
since I was nine, ten.


156
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,480
Yeah, man, I got those ones.


157
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,280
I got that one
and then I got that one.


158
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,720
A big Black Sabbath cross on my leg.


159
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,920
Number one Ozzy fan.


160
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,880
Since Black Sabbath days.
Check this out.


161
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,280
Fucking love it, man.


162
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,880
CHEERING


163
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Crouch down.


164
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,880
I remember
when I was a fan of the Beatles,


165
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,360
and I always had my fantasies.


166
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,360
if it's going to make somebody's
day a little bit better to say,


167
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,360
"Wow, I met Ozzy Osbourne today,"
I mean, that's my job, you know?


168
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,640
Can you get this, please?


169
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,720
Sure.


170
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,600
Just right down, right down there.


171
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
Sharon goes to me,


172
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,040
"You get back there
and sign that fucking autograph."


173
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I, I go, "What do you mean,
my darling?"


174
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,920
And she says, "Well, one day
you're going to be...


175
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
"If they don't ask
for your autograph


176
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,760
"that's when we got a problem."
Check out my shirt.


177
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
You can't fuck it up
no more than President Bush.


178
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,400
I have something for you.
Here's your own.


179
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,640
Thank you!


180
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,800
'I go down the road
and if I get recognised,'


181
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
I get pissed off. But if I don't
get recognised, I get pissed off.


182
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,400
People have recognised me
for a lot of years


183
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
and for a lot of different reasons.


184
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
I just want my audience to know


185
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
that I have not abandoned them
to become a fucking weatherman.


186
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,720
Wonder how many signatures
you've signed.


187
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,160
LAUGHTER


188
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,240
MUSIC: "War Pigs"


189
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,560
# Generals gathered in their masses


190
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,640
# Just like witches at black masses


191
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,440
# In the field the bodies burning


192
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,520
# As the war machine keeps turning


193
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,040
# Evil minds that plot destruction


194
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,360
# Sorcerer of death's construction


195
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,960
# It's the same wherever you go


196
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,560
# To the war pigs people know


197
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,520
# Oh, Lord, yeah... #


198
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,160
Sabbath was monumental.


199
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,840
A huge influence on Metallica.


200
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,200
'Black Sabbath
was a big deal for me.'


201
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,360
Man, we worshipped those records.


202
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
'They were like pioneers
on so many levels, you know,'


203
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,360
doing new things with rhythm
and with musical interaction.


204
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,360
'I mean, listening to it now,'


205
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,400
it doesn't sound that crazy at all,
you know?


206
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,040
But then it was quite sort of...
off the wall.


207
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,960
'My very first memory
of Black Sabbath,'


208
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,440
I just remember hearing...


209
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,880
COUGHS


210
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
BEATBOXES HEAVY DRUMMING


211
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,400
I was like, "Oh my God,
this is insane!"


212
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,280
Thank you very much.


213
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,480
Before Black Sabbath, I was in
a band


214
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,640
with Tony Iommi and Geezer.
What we...


215
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,320
What was next needed really
was a singer.


216
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,720
So, uh, we went to this music shop
in Birmingham


217
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,920
where all the musicians
used to hang out.


218
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,760
'Ozzy had put
this little calling card


219
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,760
'in a music shop called
Jones & Crossland'


220
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,080
and he had written,
"Ozzy Zig needs a gig."


221
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,000
The first time I ever met Ozzy
was at school.


222
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,360
He, he, he was like... For want
of a better word, a nuisance.


223
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,120
And so when Bill and I
walked up to Ozzy's door


224
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,760
I saw him in the back room walking
in, and I said to Bill, "Forget it."


225
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,240
I just thought,
"This is going be a joke."


226
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,320
Ozzy wrote the magic words,
"has his own PA",


227
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,000
because nobody could afford PAs
back then.


228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,920
If you sang and had a PA,
you got the job.


229
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,520
We didn't even have to hear him.


230
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,800
Although money was very scarce
in the household,


231
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,920
I asked my father to buy me
a PA system.


232
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,520
It was the best gift I ever had,


233
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,320
because had he not got
that PA for me


234
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,440
I don't think I would ever have
got a gig.


235
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,800
The first time we got,
we got together it went down great.


236
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,360
And, uh... No, it was good.


237
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,000
In the early days it was just


238
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,880
fucking guys having a blast,
you know.


239
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,480
You know, if we had never have made
anything of ourself


240
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,760
it was a good time for me
just to be around a bunch of guys


241
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,400
with fuck all to lose and everything
to gain. It was great.


242
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,240
We used to rehearse across
the street from a movie theatre.


243
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,440
And, um, I think it was Tony
who said, "Ain't it weird


244
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,840
"that people go, go to movies
to get scared?


245
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,840
"Why don't we start doing
scary music?"


246
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,520
THUNDER ROLLS


247
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,680
MUSIC: "Black Sabbath"


248
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:54,760
# What is this
that stands before me?


249
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,960
# Figure in black
which points at me... #


250
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,520
And that's how the beginnings
of Sabbath started.


251
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,360
# Oh, no! #


252
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,840
'And when we used to play that song
live in the early days,'


253
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,040
kids would just fucking scream
and run out.


254
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,800
# People running
cos they're scared... #


255
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,480
'And we started getting invites
to fucking black masses


256
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,400
'in fucking Highgate
fucking cemetery'


257
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,000
at fucking 12 o'clock. And we're
like, "is this for real?", you know.


258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,480
We never thought it was real.


259
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,080
In life we know about the dark side
and the light side,


260
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,920
the good side and the bad side.


261
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,760
I think that's the attraction,
it hadn't been dealt with


262
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,960
till Black Sabbath
started dealing with it


263
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,280
and people go,
"Oh yeah, this is great."


264
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,520
You know, "Well cool." It's like the
attraction of Dracula and vampires.


265
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,800
It's, uh, it's a rich source
for exploration, I would think.


266
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,600
'What happened with Sabbath...'


267
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,640
For instance, Black Sabbath 1,
the first album,


268
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,000
we recorded that in 12 hours,
believe it or not.


269
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,480
The whole thing was done in 12 hours
on an eight-track machine


270
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,120
in a little backstreet studio
in London


271
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,760
and cost, like, ten bucks to make.


272
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,480
It was one of the biggest-selling
albums I ever did.


273
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,240
'And the manager comes up to me
and he goes,'


274
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,280
"Your album is going in the chart
next week at number 17."


275
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,640
I says, "Fuck off, you're joking,
you're winding me up." "No."


276
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,640
When I got my first record
royalty advance in money


277
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,680
I got £105, which is about 220.


278
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,640
I went out and bought myself
some shoes and some socks,


279
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
some trousers,


280
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,000
and a bottle of Brut cologne
which I liked the smell.


281
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,920
I've always liked to smell nice.
I used to stink.


282
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,440
Coming from having nothing,
literally fucking zero,


283
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,320
no socks on my feet,


284
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
walking around in fucking
open sandals in the winter.


285
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,600
From that to
a pair of fucking socks and shoes.


286
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,120
Big time, you know?


287
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Then the next one, Paranoid,
comes out.


288
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,880
The song Paranoid
went up the English charts.


289
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
The album went straight in
at number one in England.


290
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,120
It was like, "Fucking hell, what?"


291
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,680
That was our second album
we got our number one album.


292
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,280
We were like "Fucking hell, man."


293
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,280
The real rock star vibe,
you know, hit us.


294
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,480
This is the first one I ever got.


295
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,760
Gold disc from...


296
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,800
It's fucking spelled my name
O-S-S-I-E, which is fucking great.


297
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,160
But those early days
were fucking fantastic.


298
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,560
We all had a laugh,


299
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,640
we'd fuck around, we'd fucking
smoke dope, drink beer, you know.


300
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,240
Going around with him
was a total adventure -


301
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,560
we never knew
what was going to happen.


302
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,320
Ozzy would often
walk into a room naked.


303
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,720
In the early days
he was absolute bedlam.


304
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,400
Me and Oz were kind of like
a wrecking crew in the hotel room.


305
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,760
So we'd dismantle the bathroom
completely.


306
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,080
Just have big sledgehammers,


307
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,840
and toilet, sink, all gone, put it
outside, everything goes outside.


308
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,520
I remember I got a picture early on


309
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
of him setting fire
to Bill Ward's beard.


310
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,840
And Ozzy'd be laughing
and Bill would just sit there.


311
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,640
'Growing up,
Ozzy was a real prankster,'


312
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,840
but especially in his twenties
with Sabbath,


313
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,400
he was like the band clown.


314
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,120
He always, like,
got everyone going, laughing.


315
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,320
He did that
because that was his shield.


316
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,400
That protected his insecurities.


317
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,600
Ozzy had low self-worth.


318
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,120
He always considered himself
"less than".


319
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,760
That's how, you know,
he survived everything,


320
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,480
was just being the prankster.


321
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
And what do you do to relax?


322
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,120
Smoke marijuana.


323
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,160
LAUGHTER


324
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,880
You were joking when you said that,
of course? Yeah, right.


325
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,440
'With the success of the albums
came more money,


326
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,760
'which enabled us to buy
a better class of drug, basically,'


327
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,600
which is basically what we were all
doing it for at the time.


328
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,720
Cocaine and acid
and stuff like that.


329
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,080
This is a good old cocaine shot.
We were all fucked up on this.


330
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,680
Look at the face.


331
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,120
When you took cocaine you just lose
all expression in your face.


332
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,920
'We did the album Volume 4,
and we'd been in Los Angeles'


333
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
recording that
for about three months.


334
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,120
We used to have it in...cereal boxes
of cocaine delivered to the house.


335
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,760
We'd just tip it into this big bowl
and sort of...


336
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,160
A bit like Scarface,
kind of thing.


337
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,360
For a while we used LSD
before we played.


338
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,200
And so we would go on stage,
you know, tripping.


339
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Come on!


340
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,360
Let's party!


341
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,320
Oh, yeah!


342
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,320
MUSIC: "Children of the Grave"


343
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,920
SCREAMS AND CHEERS


344
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,480
# Revolution in their mind


345
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,480
# Children start to march


346
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,040
# They hate the world
in which they have to live


347
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,520
# Oh, the hate that's
in their hearts


348
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,480
# They're tired of being
pushed around


349
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,080
# And told just what to do


350
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,120
# They'll fight the world
until they've won


351
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,160
# And love comes
flowing through, yeah... #


352
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,440
'I was young, had money, I had cars,
I had a fucking house.'


353
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,880
I was fucking king of the world
at fucking 23.


354
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,480
Thank you VERY much!


355
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,480
We'll see you again soon.


356
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,120
'Shortly after I became successful'


357
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,960
with Black Sabbath,
I met Thelma in a nightclub.


358
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,680
Then we got married and we had
two children, Jessica and Louis.


359
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,560
And this is a picture of my parents.


360
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,680
That was actually
at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas.


361
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,680
There are some lovely ones.


362
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,520
Him looking very young and handsome
and sultry.


363
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,920
This is a nice...
These are nice ones -


364
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,000
before we had our house decorated,


365
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,520
so this must have been
very early 1972.


366
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,000
Got a Black Sabbath sticker
on the telephone.


367
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,360
'My recollection from my childhood
with Dad is that he'd be away for'


368
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,720
very long periods of time.
Um, and there would always be


369
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,760
a period of adjustment
when he came home.


370
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,040
And then it would get to normality
and then he'd go again.


371
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,520
So it was a very erratic childhood
with Dad.


372
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,960
This is Dad, Dad got into
the local newspaper


373
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,920
for prize green beans
that he had grown.


374
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,480
Nice picture of the house
and our vegetable garden.


375
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,400
'He was always
a very big social drinker'


376
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,120
so the pubs in the villages
where we all grew up


377
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,320
were a very big part of the social
scene. So he would go to the pub.


378
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,840
The only thing in the English
countryside really back then


379
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,400
was pubs. So I'd, I'd go,
"Oh, there's a pub there,


380
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,680
"the house is
just down the road. Ideal.


381
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,320
"I haven't got a driving license.


382
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
"If I want to, I can walk to the pub
and back."


383
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,560
My idea of going for a drink
was to go to a pub,


384
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,760
get as much poured down my neck
as I could, and stumble out.


385
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,200
That was my idea of a drink.


386
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,000
When he was around and he wasn't
pissed, he was a great father.


387
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,480
But, you know, that was
kind of seldom, really.


388
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,120
I just have a lot of memories of him
being drunk.


389
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,160
Fucking just random shit.
Fucking driving cars across fields


390
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,760
and crashing them in the middle of
the night and stuff.


391
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,760
It's just... It's not good
for family life, really, you know.


392
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,360
When you drink alcohol and someone
goes, "Dad, help me do this math,"


393
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,440
you go, "What the fuck are you even
bothering me for?" you know.


394
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,000
It just gets a big ugly scene, but
that's the way your life becomes.


395
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,320
I don't remember being
put to bed or bathed,


396
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,880
or that kind of thing by Dad.


397
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,360
Um, I wouldn't say he was there
for us, no - never on a sports day


398
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,240
or school trip, a parents' evening,
he wasn't, he wasn't like that, no.


399
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,080
It just pissed me off that Dad
never remembered my birthday.


400
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,680
Just a fucking phone call to say,
"Happy birthday, Lou."


401
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,240
That was all I wanted,
but he couldn't remember that.


402
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,840
When was Jessica born?


403
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,520
Sorry?


404
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,240
When was Jess born?


405
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,520
I think it was '71, '72.


406
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,920
Before... maybe before...


407
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,560
I don't... I don't really know.
I can find out for you.


408
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,240
Do you, do you think
he was a good parent?


409
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,560
No.


410
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,480
'I did the best I could
in that situation.


411
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,800
'I was fucking twenty fucking two'


412
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,280
and I had the...
I mean, people knew who I was.


413
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,920
I could drive the fucking Mercedes,


414
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,160
fly on Concorde to New York
fucking first class.


415
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,720
Stay at a nice hotel.
You know, I mean, I was a rock star.


416
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,640
When you become
a successful rock star


417
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,080
they don't give you a handbook and
say, "You should learn these rules,


418
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,800
"here's what you gotta stick by."


419
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,320
It's the fucking world.


420
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,320
You know, you're young,
you got money, you're successful,


421
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,960
chicks want to be seen with you.


422
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,600
You know it's, it's...
What more can you say, you know?


423
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,160
It's just probably stress
or anxiety.


424
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,480
I don't know.
I'm not anxious, I feel OK.


425
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Well, you don't...


426
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,080
You've told me before
that you get wound up at gigs.


427
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,800
No, but the last I was great.


428
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,880
I mean, I just went out
and did it, you know.


429
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,520
I'm not wound up at all.


430
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,600
TAPE: OK there, Ozzy, here we go.


431
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,200
Now give me muhm, muhm, muhm,
M-U-H-M.


432
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,520
# Muhm-muhm-muhm muhm-muhm-muhm-muhm
muhm-muhm-muhm... #


433
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,560
Now we're going to give it the
"gee, gee, gee," slightly hooty.


434
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,480
End with the long one and say...


435
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,160
# Gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee,
gee, gee, gee, gee, gee... #


436
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,840
Now, Oz, give me a plain old "ooo"
and the same thing. Say...


437
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,440
# Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo. #


438
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,440
# Na na na na na na... #


439
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,760
OK, we're going to give you a chance
to rest for a little bit


440
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,640
and then we'll start again.


441
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,960
'I love my job, you know.'


442
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm very fucking passionate
about it.


443
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,600
When I can't give a good show
I get pissed off about it, you know.


444
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,960
When I can't do my job I'm, I'm...


445
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,800
I suffer from
terminal perfectionism.


446
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,320
I'm going to flip-flop Bark at
the Moon with Suicide Delusion.


447
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,640
Um, Crazy Train,
and leave it as the old set.


448
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,800
Yeah. I mean, if you want
to get your pipes in shape


449
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,040
we can do Fire in the Sky


450
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,320
because that's low for you to sing,
you know what I mean?


451
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,480
Yeah, but... I'll know when I get
there, you know, if I can sing.


452
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,280
Exactly, you know.


453
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,080
But I'm not going to fucking
do all this shit. Ironman.


454
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,680
I mean, we're going to
go over everything.


455
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,080
We'll be here until fucking midnight
going over all this shit.


456
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,840
We've gotta have a little while.


457
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,480
Just keep going
until we get it right. All right.


458
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,400
# The light in the window
is a crack in the sky


459
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,640
# A stairway to darkness
in the blink of an eye


460
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,920
# A levee of tears to learn
she'll never be coming back


461
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,920
# The man in the dark
will bring another attack... #


462
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,440
Not every night I'm great,
and not every night I'm half-great.


463
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,920
Sometimes I'm terrible - my voice
goes out like everybody else's.


464
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,040
But the show goes on.


465
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,880
DISTORTED VOCALS


466
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,920
People can't get...


467
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,160
Fucking, I'm deaf. Next year
I'll be like fucking Braille, man.


468
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,760
TURNS TV ON


469
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Here you are.


470
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,640
You're so tired, that's why.


471
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,520
'I first met Ozzy
when Black Sabbath'


472
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,640
asked if my father was
interested in managing them.


473
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,560
Black Sabbath was a phenomenon.
It just instantly happened.


474
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,120
And for guys that just came
from a poor background


475
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,200
to suddenly money everywhere
being thrown at them,


476
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,520
they were really out of
their comfort zone,


477
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,640
those guys, they really were.


478
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,600
When you think, you know, they were
all so young - terribly young.


479
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,240
Towards the late '70s
we were very high, high, high.


480
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,000
There was a lot of cocaine.


481
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,800
I know was I using cocaine
regularly, on a daily basis.


482
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,040
We were doing it every day,
like 24 hours a day practically.


483
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,440
So I didn't realise at the time


484
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,880
all the management was interested
was ripping as much money off of us


485
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,160
as they possibly could.


486
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,400
I mean, Sabbath was royally fucking
ripped off, royally ripped off.


487
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,440
I mean, we didn't know anything
about royalties or...


488
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,520
I didn't even know you GOT royalties
for, for writing the music.


489
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,200
Circa about 1976,


490
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,520
I produced this report,
quite a long report,


491
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,240
basically saying how their money
wasn't quite as they thought it was.


492
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,000
For example, they all had houses,
but they didn't own them.


493
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
We had all these million
platinum-selling albums


494
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,720
and everything and, um,
and nothing to show for it.


495
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,680
No money, we were all
out of our brains on dope.


496
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,640
Um, so the band was
just, like, split anyway.


497
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,440
Uh, it had been broken, really.


498
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,520
Hello. Welcome to Top of the Pops,


499
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,880
and right now here is a rundown
of the brand new Top 30.


500
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,360
Right now, Never Say Die.


501
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,560
That's the brand new one
from Black Sabbath.


502
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,760
# People going nowhere
Taken for a ride


503
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,560
# Looking for the answers
that they know inside


504
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,400
# Searching for a reason
Looking for a rhyme


505
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,560
# Snow White's mirror said
Partners in crime... #


506
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
'The last album I did with Sabbath
was Never Say Die.'


507
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
And it was the worst piece of work


508
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,800
that I've ever had anything
to do with.


509
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,400
I'm ashamed of that album.
I think it was disgusting.


510
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,680
APPLAUSE


511
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,400
He puts everything he's got into it.
That's Black Sabbath right there.


512
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,440
John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John


513
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,800
have gone straight in at number 23
this week...


514
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
'When his dad passed away,'


515
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,880
it really, really, really,
really knocked the shit out of him.


516
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,240
It nearly destroyed him.


517
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,880
We were all devastated.
We all loved Jack.


518
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,160
It was Jack, uh,
that had given us the crosses.


519
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,120
This is the original, original,
original Sabbath cross.


520
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,920
My father made that
when he was at work.


521
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,240
And then when he,
when he come back with it,


522
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,040
everyone in the band wanted one,
and he made another.


523
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,440
Bill Ward wore his right up
to relatively recently.


524
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,240
I always wanted a man-to-man
conversation with my father


525
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,080
but I was too into drugs
and alcohol before he died.


526
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,360
I miss my father a lot, you know.


527
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,200
Uh, but I was young,
I was, you know, I was doing...


528
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,520
I was riding the fame game
for a long time.


529
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,520
'Oz was in absolute turmoil'


530
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,560
and he, he put his self
right inside the bottle, you know.


531
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,160
He stayed there for a while.


532
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,160
And, uh, so we got on with
trying to make a another record.


533
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,280
And we all came over to LA to do
the album after Never Say Die


534
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,920
and Ozzy didn't turn up
for two weeks.


535
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,360
Two weeks later he, he just, like,


536
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,760
rolls through the door,
smashed out of his head.


537
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,840
He'd beaten somebody up on the plane
coming over from England


538
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,960
and Customs had arrested him
for beating this person up.


539
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,320
And by the time he got to the house
he was just, like, obliterated.


540
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,880
And we started, like, rehearsing.
He just wouldn't sing on anything.


541
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,640
"That's shit,
a load of crap, that is."


542
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,000
Ozzy just wasn't into it.
He really wasn't into it then.


543
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,600
Most of the time,
he'd be on the couch asleep.


544
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,120
Done some Quaaludes or whatever
it might have been at that time.


545
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,120
I mean, he wasn't happy.


546
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,080
He was doing too much of everything.
As we all were,


547
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,240
but some people can handle it
better than others, and he couldn't.


548
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,600
'The conversations began'


549
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,920
about the possibility of
looking at another singer.


550
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,800
He just didn't want to be there.
And we knew it was like


551
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,320
either the whole band split
or we get somebody else in.


552
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,080
It was me that actually says to him,
you know,


553
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,160
"Oz, we're going to move on,
we're going to move on without you."


554
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,120
Broke my heart.


555
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,960
We all cried our eyes out
for about a week


556
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,920
when Ozzy had gone because we...


557
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,880
I swear to God if he hadn't have...


558
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,160
If he hadn't have been
fired from the band


559
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,040
he'd have been dead, like, within...
within a month.


560
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,280
It was tough for Ozzy when he first
got let go from Sabbath.


561
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,360
He had no... Very low self-esteem.


562
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,400
He had no confidence whatsoever.


563
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,520
When I got fired from Sabbath
I didn't know what, what to do.


564
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,120
I didn't know where to go.


565
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,920
I thought, well, you know, it was...


566
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,200
I thought it was
the end of the dream, you know?


567
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,960
I never, I never ever dreamed
I would do it again on my own.


568
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,440
I was like, "This is it."


569
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,360
So what money I had, I just
got fucked up and bought drugs


570
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,760
and stayed in an apartment
for three months and got loaded.


571
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,080
You'd go into Ozzy's room


572
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,480
and he'd be curled up on the floor
covered in piss,


573
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,760
beer bottles all around him,


574
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,200
you know, drug paraphernalia
everywhere.


575
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,280
And what could be sadder,
what could be lower than that?


576
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,520
His dignity had well gone.


577
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,520
Ozzy did feel very alone,
lost and broke.


578
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,280
Suddenly he was out of the band and,
you know, would he get picked up


579
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,760
and who was interested in him
and was his career over?


580
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,360
For, for a guy like me
who's got self-esteem issues,


581
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,000
the idea of going solo
was very, very scary.


582
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,720
I knew he had great talent,


583
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,360
and I just felt in my gut
that he could make a huge comeback.


584
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,240
It was then that I became
his actual manager, properly.


585
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,600
And first thing,
we had to find that band.


586
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,240
We auditioned
hundreds of guitar players.


587
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,720
Literally we would turn up
at the rehearsal rooms


588
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,000
and there would be
lines around the block


589
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,640
of musicians waiting to see Ozzy.


590
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,720
It was a bit of a slow process
at first


591
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,000
until I met someone who put me
in touch with Randy Rhoads.


592
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,280
Randy had like a deepish voice
for a little guy, "wow", you know.


593
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,320
So he goes into the studio
and I'm fucking sitting there


594
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,720
in the studio window thing like that
looking out.


595
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm fucking zonked and he goes,
"What do you want me to do?"


596
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,480
I says, "Play any fucking thing."


597
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,160
He said, "I have a solo,"
and he played his fucking solo


598
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,560
and I was like, "Am I that fucking
stoned or am I hallucinating?


599
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,760
"What the fuck is this?"


600
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,920
GUITAR SOLO


601
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,920
# Heirs of a cold war


602
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,680
# That's what we've become


603
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,360
# Inheriting troubles


604
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,200
# I'm mentally numb... #


605
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,240
So he was very lucky
to run into Randy Rhoads.


606
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,920
And the guitar sound
really reinvented Ozzy's voice.


607
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,080
# ..Driving me insane


608
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,920
# I'm going off the rails
on a crazy train. #


609
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,440
And he had a true writing partner
and a friend.


610
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,400
And they really clicked.


611
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,720
Everybody thought
maybe he'd be down and out


612
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,560
because of what happened
with Sabbath.


613
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,080
And he just shocked the world.


614
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,320
Especially with Randy Rhoads
and the,


615
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,680
the magnitude of
what this guy was doing.


616
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,680
I mean, this guy is giving Eddie
Van Halen a run for his money.


617
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,240
Everybody thought that
Eddie Van Halen was the king.


618
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,560
Well, I knew instinctively that
he was something extra-special.


619
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,360
He was like...a gift from God.


620
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,480
And having that fucking thing,
having a gift from a higher power...


621
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,400
Oh, I don't know
what the fucking deal was,


622
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,040
but this guy did something to me.
And one thing that he...


623
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,680
One thing that he gave to me
was hope.


624
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,280
He gave me a reason for carrying on.


625
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,440
Blizzard of Ozz, the first record,
was done in six weeks.


626
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,840
It was just, you know, instantly,
instantly blew up everywhere.


627
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,400
# Steal away the night... #


628
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,760
He went right on tour
through Europe with the band.


629
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,240
Then back into the studio


630
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,720
three months later to do
Diary of a Madman.


631
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,240
Less than a year after being fired


632
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,440
from Black Sabbath,
Ozzy was a rock star again.


633
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,840
CHEERING


634
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,440
HOWLS


635
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,480
Can't hear you!


636
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,080
Diary of a Madman Tour
was just massive.


637
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,840
It was the loudest show
I've ever been a part of.


638
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,440
Come on!


639
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,800
# Over the mountain


640
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,320
# Take me across the sky


641
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,720
# Something in my vision


642
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,360
# Something deep inside


643
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,160
# Where did I wander


644
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,200
# Where d'ya think I wander to?


645
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,440
# I've seen life's magic


646
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,720
# Astral plane I travel through


647
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,560
# I heard them tell me that


648
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,000
# This land of dreams was now


649
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,600
# I told them I had ridden
shooting stars


650
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,560
# And said I'd show them how. #


651
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,760
'That show was
just like a magical time.'


652
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,280
I think Randy and Ozzy
gelled together like,


653
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,960
like left and right hand.
It was just amazing.


654
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,280
Their friendship was...


655
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,480
It was just like two best mates
hanging out and laughing.


656
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,800
But yet, that passion for music...


657
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,640
I mean, everything was the albums
that they were writing and the gigs


658
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,840
and just music talk the whole time.


659
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,280
You know, Randy
was able to achieve a lot


660
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,440
in a very short period of time


661
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,640
and a lot of it was due to
Ozzy's mentorship.


662
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,880
Randy, on behalf of
the over half-million readers


663
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,920
of Guitar Player magazine in the US


664
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,560
and in 70 countries
throughout the world


665
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,840
I'd like to present you with
the 1981 Best New Talent Award.


666
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,280
Congratulations.


667
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,320
Thank you.


668
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,360
Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.


669
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Give him a kiss, Ozzy.


670
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,840
'I've got a lot of work to do.'


671
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,600
It makes you realise this is
a lot of responsibility,


672
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,560
and this, this tour I want to
really get myself together


673
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,640
and work harder, you know,
cos I'm really proud and honoured.


674
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,520
And I don't want to stop here,
you know?


675
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,400
TV: Randy Rhoads,
the 25-year-old lead guitarist


676
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,920
for Ozzy Osbourne's group, was
killed in a plane crash this morning


677
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,840
along with two other people - Andrew
Aycock, the pilot of the plane,


678
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,720
also Rachel Youngblood,
the group's hairdresser.


679
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,040
Ozzy Osbourne himself was in the van


680
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,120
when one of the plane's wings
clipped it,


681
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,560
but Ozzy escaped injury,
we understand.


682
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,040
25-year-old Randy Rhoads
is dead today.


683
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,680
The morning that Randy was killed
I'll never forget.


684
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,560
I never forget... We...
When, when... You know, we had...


685
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,720
We were there for so many hours
because it took so long for...


686
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,280
for the authorities who came down,
the police and the fire department.


687
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,560
We finally went to a nearby hotel


688
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,960
and I just couldn't stay in my room
so I went down.


689
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,480
I went out in the street
and I found a church,


690
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,320
right down the street.


691
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,360
All I wanted to do was
just sit there and be...


692
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,800
and just, you know, make some sense
of what was going on.


693
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,320
And I didn't even look up.


694
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,440
And I'm sitting there


695
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,920
and I hear this sobbing
and this, and this crying and...


696
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,720
And I thought, "Wow, this,
this person has got to be


697
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,880
"in more pain than I am."


698
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,160
And I look up
and there's Ozzy sitting there.


699
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,640
The craziest day of my life
was the day that Randy Rhoads died.


700
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,400
I couldn't believe that one...
You gotta deal with that, you know.


701
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,840
People tend to forget people
in this business so quickly.


702
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,320
That guy was my brother, man,


703
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,440
that guy was like a part of my life,
you know, and he's dead.


704
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,400
Why don't people start talking to me
about the death of Randy Rhoads


705
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,760
instead of asking me the craziest
prank that I've ever done?


706
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,800
That was the craziest prank
that I've ever witnessed,


707
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
was seeing that guy burn, you know.


708
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,480
And the day that Randy Rhoads died,
it was a day a part of me died, man.


709
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,760
And Rachel Youngblood,
my, my seamstress.


710
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,560
I can't forget that, you know.
It just gets kind of weird.


711
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,520
OZZY DOES VOCAL EXERCISES


712
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,440
It's Friday... Saturday, yeah?


713
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,360
Today is Saturday, yes.


714
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,880
I don't know what country I'm in
half the time.


715
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,280
I don't know what fucking time
it is. Tell me about it.


716
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,880

# Oh, Mr Crowley

# Did you talk to the dead?


721

# With the thrill of it all


723

# You fooled all the people

# Uncovering things that were sacred

# Manifest on this Earth

# Conceived in the eye of a secret


732
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:07,560
# And they scattered the afterbirth

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,800
# Mr Crowley


737
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,560
# Won't you ride my white horse?


738
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,280
# Oh, Mr Crowley... #


739
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,880
After the Diary of a Madman Tour,


740
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,760
I went to Barbados with my family.


741
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,320
My ex-wife told me on the plane
coming back, "I want a divorce."


742
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,120
But, you know,
that's very ugly for a while.


743
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,320
My children still wanted
their father, their dad, you know.


744
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:18,440
And that's a fucking dreadful
feeling that you have to go through.


745
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,920
I remember going to my house one day
and Louis, my son, was a little kid


746
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,200
and he, and he got me in a...


747
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,040
I can remember him
sticking his fingernails in


748
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,520
and tears were
streaming down his face


749
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,800
and he says, "Daddy, please
come home, we can work this out."


750
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,760
That one incident tore my heart out.
Tore my fucking heart out.


751
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,480
It's, it just fucked me up.


752
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,320
I don't know...
Anyway, it really devastated me.


753
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,280
Ozzy and I were friends.


754
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,000
We worked together and that was it.


755
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,360
But it wasn't until August of 1980


756
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,440
that we actually
had a relationship going.


757
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,560
We were at... The first night
that we were actually together


758
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,440
in Shepperton in 1980,


759
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,120
and then the next day I thought,
well, you know, it just happened.


760
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,800
Drunk, we were, you know,
in the moment, it will all be over.


761
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,760
And each night after the show...
It happened again.


762
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,400
It happened again and again
and again.


763
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,840
And then we'd be...


764
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:37,600
It was either we were in the pub,
in bed or on stage. That was it.


765
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,160
That's about it, isn't it? Yeah.


766
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,000
I didn't know they had
a relationship or anything,


767
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,280
and I'm shooting Ozzy in the bed
and then all of a sudden


768
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,920
Sharon, uh,
goes under the covers.


769
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,360
All of a sudden, Sharon
is down there like she's...


770
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,600
doing the deed, you know, like,
and Ozzy is just, like, freaking.


771
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,200
Ozzy and I got married
in 1982 in Maui.


772
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,440
And we wanted to start a family -
that's why we got married.


773
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,440
We both wanted our own family.


774
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,360
Dad was there for me when I was
growing up, and there were...


775
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,120
There were times, like chunks.


776
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,200
You know, but then again
there were loads of times


777
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,840
where he, you know, he wasn't
a great father


778
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,880
and he wasn't, you know, there,
you know, there when I needed him.


779
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,760
Meaning, you know, the fact that
he was messed up a lot of the time.


780
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,480
Well, when he was drunk,
he was mostly tearful.


781
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,280
Um, and sometimes
he'd get a bit angry


782
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,840
and a bit like, "I work hard,
I should be able to do what I want."


783
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,240
Um, but mostly tearful.


784
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,600
I don't honestly think that Ozzy
knew how to be a father.


785
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,480
The drinking, you know,


786
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,520
the huge success
that was going on in his life.


787
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,520
The turmoil of leaving one family
and starting another family -


788
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,440
he was just, you know,
he was like treading water.


789
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,720
And that caused the behaviour
to get even worse.


790
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,920
So his pranks that he used to play


791
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,360
would get bigger and larger
and crazier


792
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,400
and his whole behaviour
on and offstage was over the top.


793
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,000
And it was like, um,


794
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,080
insanity just going around
and around and around -


795
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,320
complete insanity.


796
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,520
TV: Rock star Ozzy Osbourne,


797
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,320
who is known for biting the heads
off of bats at his concerts...


798
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,200
Osbourne was arrested for
urinating on the Alamo.


799
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,440
Reunion Arena was filled
with the anticipation


800
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,400
of a cat slaughter tonight.


801
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,800
Rumour was that punk rocker
Ozzy Osbourne


802
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,120
was going to release
hundreds of cats here


803
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,320
and expected the audience
to kill them


804
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,160
before his appearance on stage.


805
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,920
The lyrics from one of his songs


806
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,360
encouraged a young man
to commit suicide.


807
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,360
His father claims John was listening
to Ozzy Osbourne music at the time.


808
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,400
You have a reputation for being rock
and roll's definitive crazy person.


809
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,640
Well, I suppose you could say that.


810
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,360
Can we talk about you being crazy?


811
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,680
I'm not crazy.


812
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,440
'In the '80s,'


813
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,960
I was the craziest guy
in rock and roll.


814
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,840
If you... If you wanted me to do
something, tell me not to.


815
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,760
That was about the order
of the fucking...


816
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,360
I was drunk and fucked up
on a daily basis.


817
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,640
So when you get drunk and fucked up,


818
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,280
you hardly expect to fucking


819
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,080
tiptoe through the tulips
or whatever the fuck.


820
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,640
And when you're loaded,
you do crazy things.


821
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,640
MANIACAL LAUGH


822
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,120
It was the first time


823
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,120
that Ozzy met the A&R staff,
promotional staff,


824
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,760
at CBS in Los Angeles.


825
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,080
And, um, you know,
Ozzy's deal was a cheap deal -


826
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,760
they didn't want Ozzy.


827
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,800
It was a favour
that they signed Ozzy.


828
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,560
It was just a favour.


829
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,280
You know, 65 grand
they paid for the album.


830
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,880
So he wasn't on their high list
of priorities, you know.


831
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,920
They had fucking Michael Jackson,


832
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,280
and it was like "OK, well,
they've got to remember you."


833
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,840
And so then we said, "Oh, the doves
of peace - that'll be nice,"


834
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,960
you know, go in and let the birds go
and then it'll be lovely


835
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,720
and, you know, they'll remember.


836
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,840
Maybe it'll shit on somebody's
desk and that'll be funny.


837
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,360
And then we leave.


838
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,720
She wanted me to go in there
with two doves -


839
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,680
a peace offering, you know.


840
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,520
She says, "You blow this
and we're completely fucked."


841
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,800
We go into the meeting and there's,
you know,


842
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,440
the big conference table
and there must have been,


843
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,400
I don't know,
20, 30 people in there.


844
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,000
And he's sat there
and he lets this bird go


845
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,320
and everybody is, "Ooh!" You know,
"Magic trick!" "Oh, is that real?"


846
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,400
I threw the one up in the air,
sat on this girl's lap


847
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,320
and snapped the other one
in my mouth and bit its head off.


848
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,480
There is a photo somewhere of me,
of the actual event happening.


849
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,720
He just picked it up,


850
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,880
and ripped its head off
and spat it out on the girl.


851
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,400
And she went absolutely
fucking insane.


852
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,200
They suddenly called the security


853
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,480
and we were, like,
yanked out of the conference room.


854
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,760
It was not a publicity stunt.


855
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,920
I was just out of my fucking face on
drugs and alcohol, you know.


856
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,800
What is the truth behind Ozzy
biting a head off of a bat?


857
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,600
The bat started because of the dove.


858
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,560
Kids kept hearing these stories
so they would bring him animals


859
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,760
to the gigs...


860
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,400
thinking that he
would want to eat them.


861
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,800
And somebody threw a bat...


862
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,360
To find someone who goes to
a concert with a bat in their...


863
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,960
a real bat. You always get
the joke ones, you know.


864
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,120
You get the rubber ones
you buy from the corner joke shop.


865
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,600
And I picked it up and
I thought, "This will be good."


866
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,760
Bit into this bat.


867
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,200
You bit it?!


868
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,400
Believe me, if I'd have known
it was a real live bat,


869
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,560
I would never have picked it up.


870
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,560
But I'll tell you what,


871
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,280
afterwards, the rabies shots
were horrendous.


872
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,640
Oh, God, yes.


873
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,200
It went out on the wire that Ozzy
had bitten the head off a bat


874
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,240
and had to have these rabies shots.


875
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,560
And then suddenly, Ozzy is this
larger than life character.


876
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,800
When we were on tour with Ozzy,


877
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,760
we'd always have
these crazy parties backstage.


878
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,240
He would come onto our bus


879
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,080
and say, "I'm riding with you guys
to the next city!"


880
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,240
And he'd fucking reach into his...


881
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,000
into his coat pocket or his pants
and pull out, like,


882
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,360
two huge bags of cocaine


883
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,760
and he goes,
"I've got bags of this shit!"


884
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,160
And we would, fucking...


885
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,080
All of us would go
to the back of the bus


886
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,000
and we would fucking snort cocaine


887
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,560
for fucking, you know,
ten-hour bus rides.


888
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,240
And we're walking into hotels
like the Four Seasons


889
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,960
or the Ritz-Carltons
where like, you know, mom and dad
were a happy family


890
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,920
or out by the pool and everybody
is like, "the little resort"


891
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,440
and here comes Motley Crue and Ozzy
just fucking blasted.


892
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,840
And it was like this,
"who can out-gross" contest


893
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,440
which Nikki kind of started,
and all of a sudden,


894
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,080
we're sitting out by
the pool having drinks


895
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,240
and Nikki pisses on the ground
and goes to lick up his own piss


896
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,720
to freak Ozzy out.


897
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,040
Well, Ozzy beats him to the punch
and starts licking up Nikki's piss.


898
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,400
And we're like, "Oh, fuck!"


899
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,000
"This is fucked up!
What is wrong with you two?!"


900
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,240
And the hotel is freaking out.


901
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,720
The security is kicking us
out of the pool.


902
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,040
This is like, they're doing the
out-gross contest, snorting ants,


903
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,480
fucking licking up piss.


904
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,960
I'm like, "Dude, let's just go
to the fucking room,


905
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,600
"let's just chill out, come on."


906
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,440
(MIMICS OZZY) "I'm in the fucking
right and fucking..."


907
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,440
I'm like, "Dude, please."


908
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,720
I fucking grabbed him like, "Come
on!" I take him to the elevator.


909
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,320
I find his room, put the key in.
I'm like, "OK, bud."


910
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,680
I, like, push the door open,
"OK, bud, you're in your room, bye!"


911
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,120
He's like,
"No, fucking come here, mate!"


912
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,920
And I'm like "Oh, fuck,
I almost got out of here."


913
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,640
And he pulls me
into his room, pulls his pants down


914
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,680
and just shits on the fucking floor.


915
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,440
A fucking big shit on the floor.


916
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,920
And I'm like...
HE RETCHES


917
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,920
"OK, dude, I've got to go."


918
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,880
(MIMICS OZZY)
"No, fucking come here!"


919
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,280
And he fucking drags me back in and
he picks up the shit in his hands


920
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,720
and he's just smearing
it all over the walls


921
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,240
of this fucking hotel room.


922
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,360
I'm like, "Dude,
I've got to go, this is fucked up."


923
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,320
And I just...


924
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,320
I just remember turning around
and I just saw his back


925
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,040
and he was just painting
with this shit on the walls.


926
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,640
And I just, fucking,
was like, "Now is my chance."


927
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,280
And I fucking pinned it
out of there, dude.


928
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,800
I was like, this is on some
other, next level shit.


929
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,000
Like, I'm not really ready
to compete at this level.


930
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I'm cool with, you know,
taking a shit in the toilet.


931
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,400
HE LAUGHS


932
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,480
I think that Ozzy's behaviour
in the '80s...


933
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,240
I think it's a fact of...


934
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,600
Um, everything,
Ozzy had always lost.


935
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,840
You know, he'd lost Sabbath,
he lost his first wife,


936
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,240
he lost his first kids, he's...


937
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,800
you know,
everything would come and go.


938
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,800
So he was, like, fucking everything
that fucking had a pulse.


939
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,800
Sniffing everything he could sniff
because he thought that it


940
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:37,040
was all going to end so he was going
to go out on a high.


941
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,240
# Screams break the silence


942
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,320
# Waking from the dead of night... #


943
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,000
I hated this video.


944
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,840
It's so fucking lame.


945
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,840
I don't like it.


946
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,480
Fucking stu... Everybody was fucked
up and drunk and everything.


947
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,680
Look at it!
I don't even know what drugs


948
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,040
I was addicted
to at the fucking time.


949
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,880
# Buried in a nameless grave... #


950
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,400
So, next, come on.


951
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,920
# Well I know


952
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,560
# I could be just
another stranger... #


953
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,640
It's a cliched
fucking '80s video, that is.


954
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,760
# I guess I'm just another fool... #


955
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,560
I can't remember doing
this fucking thing.


956
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,080
I was a mess in the '80s.


957
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,760
I was doing fucking morphine,
um, Vicodin,


958
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,360
fucking booze... all kinds of shit.


959
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,520
I can't remember. I just can't
remember it at all.


960
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,000
Never happened.


961
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,680
# I'm breaking all the rules
Breaking all the rules... #


962
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,400
Next!


963
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,680
It's hokey.


964
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,160
# And that's the ultimate sin... #


965
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,960
"Whose idea was it?"


966
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,280
How the fuck do I know?!
This is boring.


967
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,000
You know, it's fucking hard
to go back there, you know


968
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,600
and a lot of it, I don't want to go
back there, you know.


969
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,280
# Anyway, I look into you


970
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,840
# The doors are closing
Cannot be opened... #


971
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,880
Where are you going?


972
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,760
I'm getting up and walking around.


973
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,800
I don't fucking want
to watch this shit.


974
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,480
# Your momma told you that


975
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:54,560
# You're not supposed
to talk to strangers


976
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,800
# Look in the mirror, tell me


977
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:05,920
# Do you think your life's
in danger here?


978
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,240
I can't fucking hear you!


979
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,120
# No more tears. #


980
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,800
APPLAUSE


981
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,920
Let's get on with this, then.


982
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,640
What does it feel like tonight?
You have a tour starting tomorrow.


983
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,280
Is it always like this
or this is an exception?


984
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,720
Yeah.


985
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,640
Yeah, it is. Come on, come on!


986
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,280
Yeah.


987
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,960
No, no, no, it's like...we do...


988
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:18,000
uh, what, 16 days ago,
we got over from Japan...


989
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:28,480
When Ozzy was drunk,
he was fucked up beyond belief.


990
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,080
I mean, to the point
where he would drink


991
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:36,120
until he couldn't drink anymore.
Where he would be unconscious.


992
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:40,480
That's the only thing
that would stop him drinking.
He'd be unconscious or asleep.


993
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,320
He was blacking out.


994
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,440
He was drinking
and going unconscious on the floor.


995
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,240
He couldn't move.


996
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,760
His eyes would be open but he would
be, like, unconscious. It was weird.


997
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,640
I passed out with a bottle
of fucking Vicodin in my mouth!


998
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,920
Mainly, I was concerned about him,
like, choking on his vomit,


999
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,840
falling asleep when he was drunk
and choking on his vomit.


1000
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,880
This is me on my stag night.
I'm fucking blasted.


1001
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,600
I think it was in Memphis,
Ozzy disappeared


1002
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,440
and, you know, he got
found in the middle of a freeway.


1003
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,760
You know, he crossed over half of
a freeway and stopped in the middle


1004
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,680
and he was in the central
reservation and he was sleeping.


1005
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,280
And he woke up
and he had to cross the other half.


1006
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,520
I mean, how he didn't get
knocked over


1007
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,040
because he was
absolutely shit-faced.


1008
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,640
This is when I clocked
Sharon, I think. I think so.


1009
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,160
We were always fucking fighting,
me and Sharon.


1010
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,520
That's when I smacked her, Sharon,
in the eye...


1011
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,680
for over what, I don't know.


1012
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,440
It had been coming for a while.


1013
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,440
Ozzy was on a bender, you know.


1014
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,080
He was, he was really on a roll.


1015
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:15,560
He'd been very bad
for the last couple of weeks


1016
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,920
and we'd had a couple of fights
where we'd beaten each other


1017
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,120
and, you know, it was nasty.


1018
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:27,440
But you kind of get the, you know,
when anyone who knows, who lives


1019
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,240
with an addict, that there are
times when it's worse than others.


1020
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,680
And it was just building
to something,


1021
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,840
you could just feel it in
the atmosphere between us.


1022
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,400
And, um, my God, it did.


1023
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,160
And he put...


1024
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,880
I'd put the kids to bed.


1025
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,960
You know, we were sat down,
I was reading and, um, he came in.


1026
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,600
He'd been laying down.


1027
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,920
He'd actually drunk himself
into one of those, you know,


1028
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,680
like, comatose things on the bed.


1029
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:01,640
He'd passed out and woke up,
came downstairs and


1030
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,280
I knew when he came in that
he was, like, looking for trouble.


1031
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:11,880
And Ozzy is very rarely calm,
very calm,


1032
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,240
and his eyes, the kind of shutter
had gone down on his eyes.


1033
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,760
You couldn't really... you know.


1034
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,800
I had no idea who was sat across
from me on the sofa,


1035
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,080
but it wasn't my husband.


1036
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,560
Um, and then he just said
that he had made a...


1037
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,760
"they" had come.


1038
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,400
He said "they" had made a decision
that I had to die.


1039
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,360
And I'm like, "They?"


1040
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,240
"Yes, they've made the decision,
we've made the decision


1041
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,240
"you're gonna have to die."


1042
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,680
And then he just, um...


1043
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,840
got up from the sofa
and just dived on me


1044
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,480
and started to choke me.


1045
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,240
Fabulous(!)


1046
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,600
All I remember was waking up
in Amersham Jail.


1047
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,280
And I asked the cop why I was there.


1048
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,720
"Excuse me," I said,
"Why am I here?"


1049
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,320
And he says, "You want me to
read your charge?"


1050
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,920
So he read, "John Michael Osbourne,
arrested for


1051
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,640
"attempted murder of his...
of Sharon Osbourne."


1052
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,280
I'm like, "Is this a joke?"


1053
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,800
He says, "I'm not joking.


1054
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,120
"You're going to court in a minute."


1055
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,840
That hit me like a... like a fucking
hammer between the eyes.


1056
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,800
It was like, I was like...


1057
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,800
I remember getting this,
this dull feeling in my heart,


1058
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,640
which is like...
And I thought, I thought...


1059
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,720
I didn't know
whether she was in hospital


1060
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,680
or what I had done, you know.


1061
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,920
Oh, I know where we are.
That's where we used to rehearse.


1062
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,240
That's where we used
to rehearse, there.


1063
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,280
That's the pub
I used to go to, right over there.


1064
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,320
Just down there is Whitton Road.


1065
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,720
I used to walk all the way up here
to get off at Lucas car factory


1066
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,760
to go to work for my...
with my mum.


1067
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,040
Fucking hell.


1068
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,760
We're just coming up
to Lodge Road now.


1069
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,120
Fucking hell, man.
It's so small, it's unbelievable.


1070
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,360
I can't believe how small it is.


1071
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,040
Fucking... Jesus Christ.


1072
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:37,080
When I was a kid, it used
to be like the longest road in
the world, you know.


1073
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,640
'When you're a young kid and
you get successful like I did,


1074
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,680
'you get very arrogant
and your ego runs the world.


1075
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:48,720
'You think it's you, you know.
You forget your upbringing.'


1076
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,680
It took me till now to kind of
realize that, you know.


1077
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,920
Wow.


1078
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,480
Wow.


1079
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,880
Oh, this is...


1080
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,640
Wow, this is unbelievable.


1081
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,640
It's amazing.


1082
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,200
Wow.


1083
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,000
That was Mrs Clarke's shop
I broke into.


1084
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,120
That was my rear bedroom up there.


1085
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,520
As my sisters, as my family,


1086
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,920
my sisters would get older
and get married,


1087
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,240
you were allowed to go in the
back room and have it to yourself.


1088
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:36,320
And this is right here,
I lived in here for a while and,


1089
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,040
this is unbelievable.


1090
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,680
I hated school.


1091
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,800
I fucking hated it.


1092
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,800
'I had dreadful,
dreadfully bad, uh, dyslexia.


1093
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,720
'When I was at school, nobody knew
what it was about, you know.


1094
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,920
'Somebody would go,
"Look, one plus one equals two."


1095
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,080
'You look at him and you go, "Well,
what the fuck does one mean?"'


1096
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,320
I couldn't retain any information.
My attention deficit was so bad.


1097
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,160
It still is.


1098
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,640
I go rambling on, you know,
it's like I don't know what


1099
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,120
I'm talking about half the time,
I just talk.


1100
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
'I was very low on self-esteem.'


1101
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,160
I used to get picked on by bullies.


1102
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,240
But I just... it just pushed me
further inside myself.


1103
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,440
Where you came from... Yeah.
..did everyone drink?


1104
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,400
Coming from the background
that I come from I thought


1105
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,880
that was, um, what you do.


1106
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,520
You get successful,
you get married, you have kids


1107
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,040
and you get to go to the pub.


1108
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,360
And I used to think everybody, as
they get older, gets fucking pissed.


1109
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,120
The first time I got drunk
I was about 14.


1110
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,120
I, I, I didn't stop.
I drank it and I got the feeling


1111
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,240
and I drunk until I pissed my pants
in this fucking pub.


1112
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,160
And that's where, from
the first drink, I wanted...


1113
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,840
I didn't drink for a drink,
I drank for the effect.


1114
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,120
How many rehabs?


1115
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,000
I've been in a bunch.


1116
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,920
Between detoxes and rehab
this will be about ten or 12.


1117
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:55,240
Ozzy tried to get sober,
I would say between 40 to 50 times.


1118
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:00,760
But he had been in and out
of rehabs about,


1119
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:04,680
I can think of ten different rehabs
he went to over the period of time.


1120
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,120
Well, see I used to go 90 days,
I'd go, "Fuck this, it's crap,"


1121
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,280
and go out and get stocked up again.


1122
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,200
One minute he'd be sitting here
sober,


1123
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,960
the next minute you would see him
be fucked up, you know.


1124
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,720
He'd disappear somewhere or
he would go to the fridge


1125
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:22,440
and get a beer or he'd go for
a walk up the drive to the pub.


1126
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,280
I just knew...
I just knew the cycle.


1127
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,880
It would be like, my dad would
to treatment,


1128
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,120
he'd stay sober for maybe 60 days
tops and then he'd start


1129
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:34,320
messing around with pills and
then he would do that for a while.


1130
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,760
And then he would
just go right to the drink


1131
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,840
and it would get really bad.
Then he would go back to treatment.


1132
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,680
I don't actually believe
that he was ever fully sober.


1133
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,080
He was just drunk.
He was just not a dad.


1134
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,520
He was drunk
and he was fucked up all the time.


1135
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,800
I came home from school
every single day to see him


1136
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,800
lying on a couch, drooling,
with a pill bottle on the floor


1137
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,120
or a vodka bottle on the floor.


1138
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,480
Or, you know...


1139
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,800
opening up the oven to make
a cake with my friends


1140
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,560
to find that that's
where my dad would hide...


1141
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,240
hid the bottles of alcohol.


1142
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,160
One thing about drugs and alcohol -
they make you lie.


1143
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,440
You start lying and covering up
your tracks and hiding things
and fucking...


1144
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,080
I used to have to wait for
the guy to drop my drugs off


1145
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,360
and I'd be, like, running in and out
of the fucking house all day long,


1146
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,600
thinking that nobody would suspect
I was waiting for dope


1147
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,120
to be delivered, you know.


1148
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,080
When The Osbournes first started,


1149
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,600
he was probably at his worst
peak of drinking.


1150
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,360
I mean, like, pretty much
going through the worst times.


1151
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,440
..That you pick up the fucking phone
and call.


1152
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,520
That was the worst thing I'd ever
do, I was never off the phone.


1153
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,840
Sometimes, you know, he'd be popping
pills from numerous different


1154
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,520
disgusting doctors that would
give him whatever he wanted and...


1155
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,040
I don't know, sometimes he'd be
on downers,


1156
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,760
sometimes he'd be on uppers.


1157
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,840
So like, that obviously will make
anyone behave a little bit off


1158
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,880
and, you know, scary sometimes.


1159
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,800
Why do we have three brown fingers?


1160
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,680
Three brown?


1161
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,200
Oh, because I put brown dye
in my hair.


1162
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,640
I think it was affecting...
Well, it was affecting his speech.


1163
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,920
It was affecting the way he walked.


1164
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,840
It was affecting the way he stood.
It was just everything.


1165
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,440
Part of his fame came from how
he looked.


1166
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,800
People thought it was funny,
thought it was cute.


1167
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,080
What the fuck is this shit?


1168
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,840
This is not allowed.
What's happened to it?


1169
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,680
How do I get this fucking thing on?


1170
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,080
What they thought was funny
was kind of sad because


1171
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,920
he was actually destroying himself
and also destroying the family.


1172
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,560
I mean, there is hours
and hours of footage of stuff


1173
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,280
that just couldn't show.


1174
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,960
It just... It was too, too...
It was too real.


1175
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,000
You know, granted The Osbournes
was not scripted, but people don't


1176
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:24,520
want to sit home on MTV and watch
alcoholism tear apart a family.


1177
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,320
When we first started filming
The Osbournes,


1178
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,920
it was no secret my dad did drugs,
he was an addict,


1179
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,400
but he was kind of
a functioning addict.


1180
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:38,080
But when my mum was diagnosed
with cancer, it very quickly...


1181
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:44,720
He was out of control,
out of control.


1182
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,440
He never came out of his room
that we called the Bunker.


1183
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:52,360
He couldn't stand up straight,
he couldn't walk properly,


1184
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,680
he couldn't hear, he shook,
he stuttered.


1185
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,280
I mean, everything that
you could imagine.


1186
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,120
I mean, he was a zombie.


1187
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,600
I was taking drugs too during
that time when my mum had cancer.


1188
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,000
I was using too.


1189
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,080
I got through that experience


1190
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,720
by hiding my emotions
through using drugs.


1191
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,280
I'll go get you a bottle of water.


1192
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,560
Just sip on water, Kelly.


1193
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,240
I got that interview on the phone.


1194
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,040
On the phone? She's holding on.


1195
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,480
I had to hang up
because I was throwing up.


1196
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,960
Let me get, let me get you
a bottle of water.


1197
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,360
Jack and Kelly started using
and doing drugs and alcohol


1198
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,040
and whatever at a very early age.


1199
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,920
Things started
happening in my family.


1200
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,760
I mean, it was my son, Jack,
who got sober first.


1201
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:52,400
When I got sober, we were sat
at a table and he's like,


1202
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,800
"Oh, you know, I threw away all
my pain medication the other day."


1203
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,880
And I was like, "Well, why did you
have them in the first place?"


1204
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,920
And this whole argument erupted
and he, you know,


1205
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,320
the one excuse my dad always
went to when he was getting


1206
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:10,120
messed up was, "You guys
never needed for anything.


1207
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,040
"You never, you know,
whatever you wanted I gave you."


1208
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,160
I said to him, "What the fuck are
you always pissed off at me for?


1209
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,400
"You've never ever wanted
for a fucking thing from the day...


1210
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,640
"the moment you took
your first breath."


1211
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:26,040
And he went, "Oh yeah?
What about a father?"


1212
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,640
And that hit me straight
between the eyes like


1213
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,520
fucking David and Goliath,
and he's got that slingshot.


1214
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,000
He just knocked me on my arse.
I just... "Oh, fucking hell."


1215
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:44,280
I honestly think that the turning
point for Ozzy was Jack's sobriety.


1216
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,120
Jack learned how to deal
with life sober.


1217
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,720
And I think it shamed Ozzy
that he couldn't do it.


1218
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,200
He could never get it.


1219
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:58,440
And that's what was
his big turning point in life.


1220
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,760
That was the start of the journey
of him being sober.


1221
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,080
You know, the evidence
proves the fact


1222
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,040
because he hasn't drunk or
abused for over five years now.


1223
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,800
I'm clean, I'm sober.


1224
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,680
I don't smoke, I don't do drugs,
I don't do alcohol anymore.


1225
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,560
I haven't done for a long while.


1226
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,200
But, uh, I like being sober,
I like being straight.


1227
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,480
I don't want to smoke
tobacco anymore.


1228
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,240
He blew us all away.
I mean, we didn't...


1229
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,680
None of us ever really thought
that he'd maintain it


1230
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,240
for as long as he has now.


1231
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,000
It really seems like
he's come through the other side.


1232
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
When you really, when you really
let go it's like somebody takes


1233
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,120
that chain off you,
you know, and you just go.


1234
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,280
And you don't...


1235
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,760
When you're involved in it,
you don't realize


1236
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,320
how much hard work it is to be
a fucking alcoholic.


1237
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,320
But when you get fed up with
you behaving the way you do,


1238
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,760
I mean, sometimes I go
this is what it's all about,


1239
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,520
I want to get fucked up,
but I don't.


1240
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:06,240
His face is alive and he stands up
straight and he walks tall


1241
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,760
and with confidence and he's not
ashamed of himself anymore.


1242
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,200
He has nothing to hide anymore and
he has nothing to lie about anymore,


1243
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,160
which makes him...


1244
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,680
I think he's really proud of
himself.


1245
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,240
I think it's the first time
he's proud of himself.


1246
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,360
Do you like it, being clean?


1247
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,840
I like it, yeah.


1248
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,320
With a bit of time, you, um,


1249
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,600
you start to go, what did
I ever think about that was fun?


1250
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,360
What was fucking fun about waking up
in a police station,


1251
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,880
in the back of
a fucking police car?


1252
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,840
I have a laugh now,
I mean naturally.


1253
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:49,160
I mean, if I could...if I could
sprinkle this on the fucking world,


1254
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,040
it would be a much better place.


1255
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:01,040
I spent 19 years of my life praying
that I would wake up one day


1256
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,440
and have the father I have today.


1257
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,920
And most people can't turn around
and say that


1258
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,440
that has happened for them
and it happened for me.


1259
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,920
And I love...


1260
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:14,000
I am so proud of him
because I know how hard it is.


1261
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,520
It's fucking fantastic.


1262
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,200
Our relationship has improved
over the last few years
since he's been sober.


1263
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm actually quite
amazed at how much...


1264
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,080
how fit he is and how more astute
he is than he was.


1265
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:30,960
He is changed a lot.
He's lost a lot of weight.


1266
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,960
He's very health conscious.
He works out nearly every day.


1267
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,720
Ozzy has grown up.


1268
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:40,240
You know, it took him longer than
most people, but he's got there.


1269
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,600
He's here.


1270
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,160
He works really hard for
his sobriety and he deserves it.


1271
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:50,080
'Sobriety has totally changed him
as a person.'


1272
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,560
You know, he's just got...


1273
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,400
He just seems like he's a lot
more at ease with himself.


1274
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,600
Whereas before it was, he was
just kind of all over the place.


1275
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:03,480
But now he'll just sit with his
headphones on quietly, just drawing.


1276
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,800
It's not art. I do it
for therapeutic reasons.


1277
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:19,240
I always find it stops my head of
hand grenades going off, you know.


1278
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,320
It's, um, it slows my head down.


1279
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,320
I've always worried.


1280
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,960
Sometimes I worry cos
I've got nothing to worry about.


1281
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,640
That's how bad it is sometimes.


1282
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,360
I don't go to bed at night thinking,


1283
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,680
I shouldn't have painted that
because people will get pissed off


1284
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,520
at me and they ain't going
to buy another painting.


1285
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,840
It's just something,
out of all this chaos


1286
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,280
and all this anxiety that I live in
and all this fear,


1287
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:59,120
stops everything in its tracks
and it's mine.


1288
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,120
And so when you ask me a question
about it, I have no answer,


1289
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,680
because I don't think of it
anything more than it's mine.


1290
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:18,720
He really talked for years about
wanting to have his driving licence


1291
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,720
and never thought
he could do it, you know.


1292
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,800
Well, he wouldn't have
been able to do it


1293
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,600
in his drinking days obviously.


1294
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,720
But since he become sober,
he had talked about it quite a lot


1295
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,960
about getting his driving licence.


1296
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,840
I'm getting my licence
so I don't feel like
a fucking terminal prisoner,


1297
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,360
meaning that when everybody leaves
the house I'm stuck, you know.


1298
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:52,520
Um, I can't go anywhere.
I just want...


1299
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,360
It's, it's a way of feeling free,
you know.


1300
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:04,600
I don't depend on everybody to
drive me wherever I want to go.


1301
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,800
That's the reason I want
a driving licence.


1302
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,120
I'm not intoxicated
and I don't want people to...


1303
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,080
I want a part of my life where
I can say, I'm in the car,


1304
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,040
driving my car where I want to go
and not be sitting there


1305
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,800
having an argument with
someone over some shit.


1306
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,840
I just want to get the freedom
of being able to drive


1307
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,760
in with my head, you know.


1308
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:27,280
When I first got successful,
right, I bought the...


1309
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,080
I bought the guns,
the fucking knives,


1310
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,280
the fucking archery sets,
motorcycles.


1311
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,560
All the things that
I felt that was... I didn't...


1312
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:41,000
I couldn't afford to have when I was
younger, when I was younger.


1313
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,040
So I got all that out of my system.


1314
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,800
Now, I've always really wanted
to drive,


1315
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,000
but I've been too fucked up
to get there.


1316
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,760
So I'm done...


1317
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,960
I'm fulfilling all the things that
I wanted to do.


1318
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:56,760
I've had a one of a kind life,
you know.


1319
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,400
I mean, I've had a lot of ups
and downs in my life.


1320
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,680
But people say if I could change
any one thing, what would I change?


1321
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,920
I don't know.


1322
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,320
I think everything...everything
is there for a reason, you know.


1323
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,120
And life is a learning process.


1324
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,720
And I don't know what the fucking,
uh, what the secret of life is.


1325
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,880
I don't know the thing.
It's just been...


1326
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,240
I've had a good run, you know.


1327
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,880
I love my wife, I love my family,
I love my, my...


1328
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,960
I'm beginning to love me
a lot more than I ever used to.


1329
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:34,400
It's the first person you should
always learn to love is yourself.


1330
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,000
ALL ABOARD!


1331
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,320
WILD CHEERING

MUSIC: "Crazy Train"


1333
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,240
# Crazy


1334
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,000
# But that's how it goes


1335
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,120
# Millions of people


1336
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,480
# Living as foes


1337
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,920
# Maybe


1338
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,080
# It's not too late


1339
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,280
# To learn how to love


1340
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,920
# And forget how to hate. #
