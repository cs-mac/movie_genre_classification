1
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,280
Dre, you ready?

2
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,990
- Yeah, one second.
- Almost forgot.

3
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,619
Dre, I am so excited.

4
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:23,248
It's like we're brave pioneers on a quest

5
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,877
to start a new life in a magical new land.

6
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,129
You could say that.

7
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,763
Okay. All right, let's go.

8
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,353
And don't forget to use the bathroom.

9
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,479
Okay.

10
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,609
I know, I know, I know, I know.

11
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,027
Okay, okay.

12
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,154
I just got my hair done.

13
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,284
Okay, be very careful with that. Okay.

14
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,665
- I'll see you later, Uncle Charlie.
- I love you.

15
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,792
Come on, Dre, we can't miss this plane!

16
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,336
Bye. See you later, Dre.

17
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,839
Bye, guys. We're gonna miss you.

18
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,095
Naw, man, it's yours.

19
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,556
Come on, Dre, just take it.

20
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,936
Thanks, man.

21
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,525
Okay, Dre, come on, we have to go.

22
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,820
Okay, bye, guys!
We'll call as soon as we land!

23
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,087
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to flight...</i>

24
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,381
- You got it?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,716
<i>...with service to Beijing.</i>

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,594
Dre, look. We're already on lesson 10.

27
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,431
How are you?

28
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,895
Remember what that one is?

29
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,063
No.

30
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,982
Dre, you're killing me.

31
00:03:54,275 --> 00:04:01,156
Mom, look, in China, everything is old.
There's old houses, old parks, old people.

32
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,202
Look. This guy is at least 400 years old.

33
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,996
Dre, please focus, okay?

34
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,876
What's your name?

35
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,004
You need to practice.

36
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,547
- Yeah, you need to try it.
- No, Mom.

37
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,675
- Yes, Dre. Dre.
- Mom.

38
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,886
Ask him. Go ahead.

39
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,348
Ask him, "What's your name?"
And "How are you?"

40
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,808
Do it now.

41
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,824
Dude, I'm from Detroit.

42
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,039
What's up?

43
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,556
<i>Our flight time will be 13 hours
and 30 minutes.</i>

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,726
<i>We will be serving dinner and breakfast.</i>

45
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,696
She said to meet her at number five.

46
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,948
What is that?

47
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,450
Mrs. Packer?

48
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

49
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,038
It's "Parker. "

50
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,375
Apologies, Mrs. Parker. Welcome to Beijing.

51
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,814
And this is your electricity card. Same thing.

52
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,565
You think you might have one in English?

53
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,444
Look! There's Olympic Village!
Isn't it beautiful?

54
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,780
Yes.

55
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,991
I guess there's
nothing old in China, huh, Dre?

56
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,014
Look at that, Dre. Beverly Hills.

57
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,725
We always talked about living there, huh?

58
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,562
But I think we were talking about
the other one, Mom.

59
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,647
I got a good feeling about this.

60
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,323
Oh, yeah.
You must be the new dude in 305. I'm Harry.

61
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,950
Hey. What's up? I'm Dre.

62
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,453
- Here, let me help you.
- Thanks, man.

63
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,582
So how come you guys
are moving to China?

64
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,542
My mom got transferred.

65
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,710
Passport, please. Thank you.

66
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,879
- She works at the car factory.
- Okay.

67
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,510
Can you please explain this electricity card?
Because we don't have these in America.

68
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,017
Know any Chinese?

69
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,935
Nah.

70
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,396
This is China. Might not be a bad idea.

71
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,610
That's our park. You should come.

72
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,363
Look at you, making friends already.

73
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,742
- Hi, I'm Dre's mother.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

74
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,702
Nice to meet you, too.
You can call me Miss Sherry.

75
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,746
- I'm Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

76
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,832
So I guess I'll see you later, then?

77
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,293
- Maybe.
- Okay, cool. See ya.

78
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,515
Okay, this is your rental agreement
in English.

79
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,519
So the landlady is Mrs. Wang.
Her English is not good.

80
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:45,190
But if something goes wrong,
you go to Mr. Han. His English is very good.

81
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,441
- Okay.
- Okay.

82
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,902
- So welcome to Beijing, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you.

83
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,905
- So I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, sure. Thank you!

84
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,323
Wait, wait.

85
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,409
You mentioned something
about going to the police...

86
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,006
Wow, this is perfect, Dre.

87
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,301
Everything we need is in walking distance.
You know what?

88
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,471
We could have lunch together every day
at your school if you wanted to.

89
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,557
Negative. Not a chance.

90
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,648
Dre, we are not doing this in Beijing.

91
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,276
Dre, pick up yourjacket.

92
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,697
Mom, I'm tired, okay? I have airplane lag.

93
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,078
"Airplane. "

94
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,791
It's jet lag.

95
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,503
I know, baby, I got it, too.

96
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,133
But we can't go to sleep.

97
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:57,220
'Cause then we'll be up at 2:00 a. m.
And you have school tomorrow.

98
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,150
Dre! Can you please
go find the maintenance man?

99
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,484
I need to take a shower

100
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,445
- and the hot water's broken!
- Yeah!

101
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,324
Excuse me.

102
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,075
I'm looking for the maintenance man.

103
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,870
Mr. Han?

104
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,249
Thanks.

105
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,346
Mr. Han?

106
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,686
Hi.

107
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,028
We just moved into 305.
Hot water's not working.

108
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,827
No hot agua.

109
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,212
Looking for Mr. Han.

110
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,589
Han?

111
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:28,103
Mr. Han?

112
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,024
Me and my mom, we just moved in. 305.

113
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,276
The hot water's not working.

114
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,614
Mr. Han?

115
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,870
Okay.

116
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,249
Or I could just come back another time.

117
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,421
Or you could just show me how to do it
so I could get outta your hair.

118
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,784
That's nasty.

119
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,413
I'm gonna go throw up.

120
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,791
In 305, where the hot water's not working.

121
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,502
I think he's busy.

122
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,710
Hey, man, you made it. Welcome.

123
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,878
Thanks.

124
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,880
- You play, right?
- Yeah.

125
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,215
Come on.

126
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,387
- Okay, it's us three against them four.
- All right.

127
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,847
All right.

128
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,982
Good job, good job.

129
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,734
Pass!

130
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,201
Sub! Sub!

131
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,080
My shooting hand has got some jet lag,

132
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,082
so I'm gonna just...

133
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,266
You want this?

134
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,018
You want me to play?

135
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,771
You know I have no problem
beating old people.

136
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,444
Back where I come from,
they call me Ping Pong Dre, all right?

137
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,905
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

138
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,895
Come on, man. I'm 12.

139
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,408
He's really good.
I've never seen him lose to anybody.

140
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,659
Yeah.

141
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,165
Dude. Are you gonna talk to her or what?

142
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,000
- To who?
- To her.

143
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,754
- The girl you've been staring at.
- I wasn't staring at her, dude.

144
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,505
Yeah, you were.

145
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,843
You should go talk to her.
Unless you're scared.

146
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,762
I'm not scared of anything.

147
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,972
Then do it. Go. Come on.

148
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,518
Cool. Right now.

149
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,526
Hey.

150
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,947
What's up?

151
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,451
I forgot, no English.

152
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,836
What language was that?

153
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,214
You speak English?

154
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,549
Me, too.

155
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,552
So, what are you listening to?

156
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,888
Bach.

157
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,225
Bach. I listen to them all the time.
They're tight.

158
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,643
Wait, you ever heard of this?

159
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,236
Oh, yeah, you like that, huh? Wait.

160
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,710
Wait, whoa. It's going over here.

161
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,672
It's going below. Wait, wait.

162
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,258
- It's coming back.
- May I touch your hair?

163
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,679
You wanna touch my hair?

164
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,766
Sure.

165
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,531
You should be practicing.

166
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,699
I am practicing.

167
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,285
What you're doing you won't need these.

168
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,453
What's your problem?

169
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,620
Leave it.

170
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,962
Come on, dude!

171
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,801
I said leave it!

172
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,918
Go get him.

173
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,294
Go, go, go!

174
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,675
Yeah!

175
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,215
Still want to fight?

176
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,792
- Are you okay? Let me help.
- Just leave me alone. I'm fine.

177
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,798
- Dre.
- Dude, leave me alone.

178
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,812
Dre, are you ready?

179
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,648
'Cause we gotta be there in like 20 minutes.

180
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,399
I know, Mom.

181
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,151
And you have your uniform on, right?

182
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,319
Yes, Mom.

183
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,488
Don't wanna break any rules on the first day.

184
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,534
Okay. Come on. Waiting for you.

185
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,129
You know, you don't have to come in.
I mean, I can handle it.

186
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,840
Dre, don't be silly. It's your first day.

187
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,261
Plus, we both have to meet
the assistant principal, Mrs. Po.

188
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,180
I can find her.
And you need to get to work, right?

189
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,183
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, Mom.

190
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,686
Mrs. Po?

191
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,479
Hi, Mrs. Po.

192
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,481
Ms. Parker. We've been waiting.

193
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,734
I am so sorry we're late.
We just flew in from Detroit last night.

194
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,236
This is my son, Dre.

195
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,487
- Hello.
- Hi.

196
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,657
We only wear uniforms on Uniform Day.

197
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,409
That's my fault.

198
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,413
I didn't have a chance
to read the school packet you sent me.

199
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,081
We'll be better tomorrow. Yeah.

200
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,709
And hats are not permitted.

201
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,170
Yeah, I should have read up
on the dress code.

202
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,006
Dre, is that makeup?

203
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,549
What is that?

204
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,426
Mom, I ran into a pole.

205
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,429
No, you have a black eye.
You got into a fight?

206
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,639
Fighting's not tolerated here.

207
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,559
You heard him, he ran into a pole.
Come here, Dre.

208
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,269
- Mom, don't start.
- Who did it?

209
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,937
Nobody, Mom. I ran into a pole.

210
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,939
And I didn't tell you 'cause I knew
you would act like this.

211
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,026
Dre, you know I don't play that.
Somebody hit my baby, I will tear through...

212
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,903
I know, Mom.
That's why I don't tell you stuff.

213
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,741
- Just relax. I just ran into a pole.
- Yeah, yeah, you ran into a pole.

214
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,539
All right, Dre. All right, all right.
Look, go to class.

215
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,417
Go to class, but we will talk about this later.

216
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,960
- Okay? All right. Go.
- Okay.

217
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,964
I love you.

218
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,633
Mom!

219
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,261
I said I love you.

220
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,722
Okay, I love you, too.

221
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,766
Okay, have a good day.

222
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,910
- Hi.
- Hey.

223
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,922
You know, we only wear our uniforms
on Uniform Day.

224
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,175
Oh, yeah. I so got that one.

225
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,807
Thanks.

226
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,142
I'm Mei Ying.

227
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,186
I'm Dre.

228
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,112
Sorry about Cheng.

229
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,199
So that's his name.

230
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,201
Is he your boyfriend?

231
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,994
No.

232
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,664
Our parents are very close.

233
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,332
Well, he definitely likes you.

234
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,210
I have to go practice.

235
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,504
Wait.

236
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,923
You eat and practice at the same time?

237
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,049
Yes.

238
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:52,221
But my mom says if you eat standing up,
it gives you gas.

239
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,849
You're funny.

240
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,694
Sorry.

241
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,405
- Come on, dude!
- Mr. Parker! Stop it!

242
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,532
He just slammed the tray all over me!

243
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,660
Whatever he's saying, he is lying!

244
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,371
Mr. Parker, go.

245
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,833
Mr. Cheng, go.

246
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,713
I hate this place!

247
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,595
<i>Four. Five.</i>

248
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,263
<i>Six.</i>

249
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,015
<i>Seven.</i>

250
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,433
<i>Eight.</i>

251
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,185
<i>Nine. Ten.</i>

252
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,603
Come to fix hot water.

253
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,188
It's in there.

254
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,133
Kid.

255
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,696
Did you just hit me in my neck
with a toothpaste cap?

256
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,781
Hot water fine.

257
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,907
Flip switch.

258
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,702
Wait half hour. Take shower.

259
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,537
Flip switch off.

260
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,372
Why don't you just leave it on?

261
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,876
- You leave on in America?
- We don't have a switch in America.

262
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,546
Get switch. Save planet.

263
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,841
What happened to eye?

264
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,427
I ran into a pole.

265
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,054
Interesting pole.

266
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,267
- Dre? I'm back.
- That's my mom.

267
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,686
And the door handle's messed up.

268
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,230
- Are you ready for school?
- Yeah!

269
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,276
Hey, let me help you.

270
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,029
They have your favorite cereal here.
I found it.

271
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,287
Dre.

272
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:08,584
For the one hundredth time,
can you please pick up yourjacket?

273
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,919
- One second, Mom.
- No!

274
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,047
Not in one second. Now.

275
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,214
This program's about to be over.

276
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,758
- Give me two minutes.
- Dre, I don't care!

277
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,801
Come pick it up now!

278
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,845
God, how many times do I have to ask you?

279
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,013
Once.

280
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,724
- That's right, make it happen.
- What's it with you and this jacket?

281
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,392
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Nothing.

282
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,311
Okay, just what I thought. Nothing.

283
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,898
Thank you.

284
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,812
No.

285
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,647
From the top again.

286
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,091
Okay. That's enough, please.

287
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,802
You're rushing it.

288
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,555
You must play the pauses.

289
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,434
Do you know how important this is
for your family?

290
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,394
What it'll mean for your life?

291
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,229
We have to work this weekend.

292
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,856
I'm calling your father.

293
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,196
Well, continue.

294
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,374
How'd that sound?

295
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,627
Almost like Chinese.

296
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,795
Yeah, I'm fluent.

297
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,880
And I don't know
what that guy was talking about.

298
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,590
I thought you sounded great.

299
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,716
Thank you.

300
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:16,480
So are you practicing for anything?
Like a show or...

301
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:21,902
Yes. I have an audition next month
for the Beijing Academy of Music.

302
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,073
Beijing Academy of Music.
Sounds important.

303
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,158
You know,

304
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,578
their initials spell "BAM."

305
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,917
What?

306
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,670
Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,922
Gotta go.

308
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,152
Hey.

309
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,780
Can I touch your hair?

310
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,496
Gonna do something?

311
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,679
Just stay away from us.

312
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,850
All of us.

313
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,665
Baby.

314
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,545
Dre, are you asleep?

315
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,286
Hey, can you sign this?

316
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,331
You're going to the Forbidden City?

317
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:43,961
I think it's funny that you have to get
my permission to go to the Forbidden City.

318
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,837
I got pull in Beijing.

319
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,297
That's not funny, Mom.

320
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,341
Cut it out, grumpy.

321
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,593
I'm serious, Dre, this ice cream,

322
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,554
I don't know what they do to it,
but it's more flavor-istic.

323
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,722
What?

324
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,391
Mom, this is you.

325
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,893
"Oh, my goodness,
this ice cream here is so good,

326
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,230
"and everything in China is
so much better than everything else... "

327
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,940
Mom, come on!

328
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,361
First of all, I don't sound like that,
and I don't move all like that.

329
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,905
We should've got you some ice cream,
it's really good.

330
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,074
- Mom, Mom, come on.
- Dre.

331
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,701
- Mom, come on!
- Wait!

332
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,452
Wait for me, Dre. Wait.

333
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,705
Mom, come on.

334
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,790
- Dre, wait!
- Stop!

335
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,792
- Wait, wait!
- Mom!

336
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,380
Boy, you gonna get a nut
for running from me.

337
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,924
<i>Wow.</i>

338
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,593
Kung fu.

339
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,389
What do you learn here?

340
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,351
No Weakness! No Pain! No Mercy!

341
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,229
What do you learn here?

342
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:30,358
No Weakness! No Pain! No Mercy!

343
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,277
Begin!

344
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,292
Hi, precious.

345
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,462
- Mom. Mom, come on, let's go.
- What? What? Dre, we just got here.

346
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,089
Come on, Mom.

347
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,675
Dre, what's going on?

348
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,010
Nothing.

349
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,596
Dre, what happened? What happened?

350
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,722
Nothing.

351
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,599
Something happened.

352
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,018
What, you don't like that karate class, baby?

353
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,978
It's not karate, Mom.

354
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,818
Okay, all right. Karate, kung fu, whatever.
Dre, what happened?

355
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,529
We moved to China!

356
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,989
That's what happened!

357
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,629
Okay, stop.

358
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,593
Don't be like that, Dre.

359
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,015
What do you want me to do?
We've been here less than a week

360
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,685
- and I feel...
- I feel like it's a year!

361
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,019
I hate it here!

362
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,153
Dre, please let me help you.

363
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,825
I can't help you if you don't tell me
what's wrong, so please...

364
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,785
You don't care what's wrong!

365
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,874
All you care about is "how happy I am"
and "how great the ice cream is"!

366
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,709
Well, I'm not happy!

367
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,836
I hate it here!

368
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,264
I wanna go home!

369
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,560
Dre, we can't go home. Okay?

370
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,438
There is nothing left for us in Detroit.

371
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,149
This is what we got.

372
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,445
This is home.

373
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,699
Okay?

374
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,056
<i>Hi, guys. Gather around here.</i>

375
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,476
<i>As the emperor was considered to be divine,</i>

376
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,229
<i>no mere mortal was permitted access.</i>

377
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,855
<i>Hence the name</i>

378
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,690
<i>the Forbidden City.</i>

379
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,023
You touch them for good luck.

380
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,045
- I wish someone would just...
- Yeah, me too.

381
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,050
- Just tell someone.
- Yeah, I got it.

382
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,886
Thanks a lot.

383
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:41,234
<i>The floors of the palace were reinforced
with brick 15 layers deep</i>

384
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,154
<i>to prevent anyone from tunneling in.</i>

385
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,449
<i>Even if an outsider managed to get in...</i>

386
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,285
- Mr. Parker?
- Yes?

387
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,995
Is everything okay?

388
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,750
Yes, thank you.

389
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,290
You're fast.

390
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,502
Not fast enough.

391
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,218
He's had enough.

392
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,888
Don't you remember what we learned?

393
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,807
No weakness! No pain!

394
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,726
No mercy!

395
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,227
Cheng, stop!

396
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,872
Go home.

397
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,207
Come on.

398
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,224
What's up with the light bulbs, Mr. Han?

399
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,347
I thought you were just a maintenance man.

400
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:35,101
You think only with your eyes,
so you are easy to fool.

401
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,313
It doesn't hurt.

402
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,150
Ancient Chinese healing.

403
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,653
How'd you do that out there?

404
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,823
You, like, didn't even punch them.
They beat each other up.

405
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,576
When fighting angry, blind men,

406
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,287
best to just stay out of the way.

407
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,250
So where'd you learn kung fu?

408
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,835
From father.

409
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,461
Have you ever taught anybody?

410
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,423
No.

411
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,175
Would you?

412
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,971
- Depends.
- On what?

413
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,015
Reason.

414
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,309
What about to kick somebody's ass?

415
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,815
Best fights are the ones we avoid.

416
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,484
What if I wanna avoid
getting my ass kicked?

417
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,819
Stop saying "ass. "

418
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:27,987
Sorry.

419
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:39,665
Kung fu is for knowledge, defense.
Not to make war, but create peace.

420
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,500
That's definitely not what they're taught.

421
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,255
No such thing as bad students,
only bad teacher.

422
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,965
Oh, that's great.

423
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,428
Well, I guess we'll just stroll in their school
and talk to their teacher.

424
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,680
- Good idea.
- No, bad idea.

425
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,891
If I go in there, I'll get my ass kick...

426
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,646
I'll get beat up.

427
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,731
You'll get beat up anyway.

428
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,820
Will you go with me?

429
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,658
No, sorry.

430
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,869
But you said it was a good idea.

431
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,663
For you. Bad idea for me.

432
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:23,584
Come on, it's not like you're super busy
or anything, and I don't even speak Chinese.

433
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,044
Very sorry.

434
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,884
Okay.

435
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,054
All right, whatever.

436
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,113
Wait.

437
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,113
What are you doing?

438
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,823
Why did you stop?

439
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,325
Finish!

440
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,041
Come here!

441
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,393
Okay, Mr. Han, let's get outta here.

442
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,403
We do not stop when our enemy is down.

443
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,489
No mercy...

444
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,742
No mercy in the studio...

445
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,118
No mercy in competition...

446
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,995
No mercy in life!

447
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,500
Our enemies deserve pain.

448
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,049
What are you looking at?

449
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,676
He's the one that attacked me.

450
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,526
We are here to make peace.

451
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,030
Let your little thing mind himself.

452
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,034
One to one, no problem...

453
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,704
...six to one, too much to ask of anyone.

454
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,706
I see...

455
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,209
Prepare for match.

456
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,382
Whoa. Mr. Han, does he want us to fight?

457
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,387
We are not here to fight.

458
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:30,354
You attack my students
and disrespect my studio?!

459
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,398
You want to leave? Not so easy!

460
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,569
Master Li...

461
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,908
You both came here.

462
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,746
One of you fights now.

463
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,296
The boy will fight there.

464
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,770
We accept your challenge.

465
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:18,319
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

466
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,155
Attention!

467
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,994
From now on, this little thing
is to be left alone...

468
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,538
...until the tournament.

469
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,873
Understood?

470
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,467
If he does not show up for the competition...

471
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:46,639
...I will bring pain to him and to you.

472
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,152
So, that go pretty much how you planned it?

473
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,280
There's good news and bad news.

474
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,407
Good news is
they promise to leave you alone.

475
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,785
Really?

476
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,662
While you prepare.

477
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,831
Prepare for what?

478
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,458
Tournament.

479
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,211
You'll fight them all one-on-one.

480
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,552
So the bad news is
now they get to beat me up in public.

481
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,720
Yes.

482
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,139
Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

483
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,517
They're gonna kill me.
You saw their kung fu.

484
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,769
That's not kung fu.

485
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,896
That's a bad man
teach them very bad things.

486
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,942
Well, that bad man
teaching very bad things hurt. A lot.

487
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,738
More good news.

488
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,157
I will teach you real kung fu.

489
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,662
Yes!

490
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,340
See you later, Mom.

491
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,427
Hey, wait.
This is early for you for a Saturday.

492
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,179
- Mr. Han's teaching me kung fu.
- The maintenance man?

493
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,265
It's China, Mom. Everybody knows kung fu.

494
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,143
Dre, you know how I feel about you fighting.

495
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,479
Kung fu's not about fighting, Mom.
It's about making peace with your enemies.

496
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,732
- Be careful, Dre.
- Okay.

497
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:24,254
Mr. Han?

498
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,298
Back here.

499
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,260
You know, you have a car
in your living room, Mr. Han.

500
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,558
Okay, I was thinking about yesterday.

501
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,436
I know that I was kind of freaking out
about the tournament,

502
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,189
but I realized something last night.

503
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,857
I'm an athlete.

504
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:50,531
My number one asset is I'm fast, okay?
I'm quick, all right? I'm quick. Got speed.

505
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,990
Cat speed.

506
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,743
See? I'm quick, yeah?

507
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,912
See, and I used to take gymnastics at PAL.

508
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,831
That's the Police Athletic League,
so check it, right?

509
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,792
Boom! You see that?

510
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,461
Boom! You see that? Yeah.

511
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,257
See, my Uncle Remy used to date
this Brazilian girl.

512
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,176
And he learned jiu jitsu,
and he taught some of it to me.

513
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,138
And it's like locks and holds and stuff.
So, okay, attack me.

514
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,059
Right here.

515
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,646
See that? Feel that?

516
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,940
I could break it. I'm choosing not to.

517
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,859
It's a pressure lock. Dangerous.

518
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,194
And he also taught me capoeira, so...

519
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,905
You can't touch me, you can't...

520
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,246
That antique?

521
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,082
Pick up yourjacket.

522
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,006
So, basically, Mr. Han,
what I'm trying to say is

523
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:53,343
I've got a good foundation here.
You know, like I said, I'm just...

524
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,888
Might not be as hard to teach me
as other people, you know?

525
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,014
Hang it up.

526
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,391
Okay.

527
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,226
All right, but now...

528
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,603
Take it down.

529
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:06,940
But you just...

530
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,525
Take it down.

531
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,739
Put it on.

532
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,454
Take it off.

533
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,082
- I already did all this.
- Take it off.

534
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,502
- Can you just tell me why I'm doing this?
- Take it off.

535
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:31,965
Hang it up.

536
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,846
Take it down.

537
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,098
Put it on the ground.

538
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,852
Pick it up.

539
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,689
Hang up.

540
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,442
Take it down.

541
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,988
Put it on.

542
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,533
Take it off.

543
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,410
Put it on the ground.

544
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,330
Pick it up.

545
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,291
Hang it up.

546
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,378
Take it down.

547
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,755
Put it on.

548
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,633
Take it off.

549
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,261
Hang it up.

550
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,813
Mr. Han?

551
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,483
Why do you have a car in your living room?

552
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,443
No street parking.

553
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,287
Hey.

554
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,456
So how did it go?

555
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,250
What'd you learn?

556
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,043
Nothing.

557
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,749
Uniform on Uniform Day.

558
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,209
You are fighting in the tournament.

559
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,919
Yeah. How did you hear?

560
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,921
Everybody knows.

561
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,427
I hope you have a good teacher.

562
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,930
Yeah, me too.

563
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,184
He's a maintenance man.

564
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,645
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

565
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,521
Well, I know that you're practicing,

566
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,776
and I think I'm practicing.
I mean, I don't know what I'm doing.

567
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,862
But we're both kind of practicing,
you know, and...

568
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,615
Are you going to the Qi Xi Festival?

569
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:07,579
Yeah, I mean, I haven't missed
a Shi Vi festival since I've been in China.

570
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,793
Go to the Shadow Theater.

571
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,796
Okay. Want me to meet you?

572
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,175
So, like, Shadow Theater. Okay.

573
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,553
Chi Fi Shi Festival, Shadow Theater.

574
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,389
Okay, cool.

575
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,015
- Okay.
- When is it again?

576
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,934
Tomorrow. Show starts at 7:00.

577
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:33,772
Okay, so tomorrow, Shadow Theater,
Shi Shi Festival, at 7:00.

578
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,399
See you tomorrow.

579
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,900
Ki Shi Festival.

580
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,902
Festival.

581
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,362
Shi Shi Festival.

582
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,030
- Okay.
- Okay.

583
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,761
Mr. Han.

584
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,888
Mr. Han!

585
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,433
- May I come in?
- You may come in.

586
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,189
Where's yourjacket?

587
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,444
I thought... I was warm enough without it.

588
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,028
Go get it.

589
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,448
Want me to go all the way back
just to get it?

590
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,700
Yes. All the way back where you hide it.

591
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,395
It's not right.

592
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,731
What? I'm doing it.

593
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,651
No.

594
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,904
Something is missing.

595
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,697
Nothing's missing.

596
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,458
You forgot this.

597
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,169
Attitude.

598
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,798
Jacket off.

599
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,342
Okay.

600
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,804
Attitude.

601
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,473
Yes. That's it.

602
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:36,394
Okay, Mr. Han, I get it. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have treated my mom like that.

603
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,646
You were right.

604
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,318
Put it on the ground.

605
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,904
Hello?

606
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,573
Oh, hey, Mom.

607
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,243
Did you get the tickets?

608
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:56,998
Yes, I got the tickets.
And I got an extra one for Mr. Han.

609
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,877
- But I didn't say you...
- Dre, stop it.

610
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,673
Mr. Han, would you like to go
with us to the Shi Shi Festival?

611
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,091
No, thank you.

612
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:07,759
Too many people.

613
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,428
Yeah, Mom, way too many people.

614
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,722
Yeah, but I already bought the tickets.

615
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,559
- I don't go.
- Mr. Han, I'm not taking no for an answer.

616
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,769
You'll have fun.
You need to get out of the house, okay?

617
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,065
Here are your clothes, Dre.
Come on, hurry up and change.

618
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,611
Dre?

619
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,448
Pick up yourjacket!

620
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,089
You were right, Mr. Han.
There are a lot of people here.

621
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,259
Chinese Valentine's Day.

622
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,430
Wow.

623
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,980
This is beautiful.

624
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,066
- Yeah. Mom?
- Yeah?

625
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,403
I'm gonna go get something to eat,
and then I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

626
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,113
Be back right here in 20 minutes.

627
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,324
- Okay.
- Okay.

628
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,242
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Be careful.

629
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,410
Twenty minutes.

630
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,162
- Twenty!
- Okay.

631
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,582
So what's the origin of this festival again?

632
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,792
I know everything you do here
has a meaning.

633
01:05:41,354 --> 01:06:09,214
Hi.

634
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,340
Hey.

635
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,718
Well, I got this and this for you.

636
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,053
I downloaded this.

637
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,138
And there's this girl,
she has some really cool violin stuff,

638
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:21,142
and I thought maybe
you could play along and...

639
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,689
It's not like Bach and them,
but I thought maybe you'd like it and...

640
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,176
So do you have any kids?

641
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:56,928
No.

642
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:01,433
Well, how's Dre doing?

643
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,519
Xiao Dre making progress.

644
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,603
Xiao Dre?

645
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,523
Yeah. Chinese for "little. "

646
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,404
So how many students do you have?

647
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,282
- Including Xiao Dre?
- Yeah.

648
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:19,617
One.

649
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,753
So, what's this show about?

650
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:36,092
It's a story of the goddess
and the boy she loves.

651
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,970
I love this story.

652
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,477
Her mother does not approve of him.

653
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:49,105
So she cuts a wide river in the sky

654
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,983
to separate them forever.

655
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,110
But once a year,

656
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,614
all the birds in the sky

657
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:02,535
feel sad for them and they form a bridge

658
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:11,044
so the two of them
may be together for a single night.

659
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:22,972
I'll be there at your audition
if you come to my tournament.

660
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,641
Okay. I'll be there.

661
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,059
Pinky swear?

662
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,522
See, you wrap your hands like this.

663
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:35,860
I swear that I'll be there at your audition,
no matter what happens.

664
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:40,365
And I promise to cheer bigger
than anyone else when you win.

665
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,767
What up, Mr. Han?

666
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,396
Did I say "come in"?

667
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,441
I think you did. I mean...

668
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,114
Mr. Han, can I please come in?

669
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,657
Yes.

670
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,370
So, what are we doing today?

671
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,622
Same.

672
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,257
You know, Mr. Han, I told you.

673
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,217
I get it, okay?

674
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,344
Be respectful. I got it.

675
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,556
I put my jacket on a thousand times,
I took it off a thousand times!

676
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,433
Okay? This is stupid.

677
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,851
I'm done.

678
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,312
They can beat me up if they want to.

679
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:19,857
And you know why
you only have one student?

680
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,734
'Cause you don't know kung fu.

681
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,695
Xiao Dre!

682
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,238
What?

683
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:32,704
Come here.

684
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,213
Jacket on.

685
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,549
- Mr. Han, I already...
- Jacket on.

686
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,393
Jacket on.

687
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,730
- I don't have a jacket now.
- Jacket on.

688
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,405
Be strong.

689
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:09,907
Jacket on.

690
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:12,869
Firm.

691
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,413
Jacket off.

692
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:21,461
Remember, always strong.

693
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:24,797
Jacket off.

694
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,303
Strong.

695
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,472
Left foot back.

696
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:36,642
Right foot back. Left foot back!
Pick up yourjacket!

697
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,229
- Whoo, Mr... Okay.
- Focus!

698
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,898
Always concentrate.

699
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:44,901
Left back.
Right foot back! Pick up yourjacket!

700
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,236
Stay.

701
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,116
Pick up yourjacket.

702
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,290
Be strong. Hang it up.

703
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:01,751
Hang it up.

704
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,337
Hang up. And attitude.

705
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,173
Strike.

706
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,468
Hang up, and attitude.

707
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,678
Harder! Harder!

708
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,600
Good.

709
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,977
But no face.

710
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,188
Jacket off!

711
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,172
Kung fu lives in everything we do, Xiao Dre.

712
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:53,094
It lives in how we put on a jacket,
how we take off the jacket.

713
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,348
And lives in how we treat people.

714
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,354
Everything is kung fu.

715
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,817
So why didn't we take the Scirocco?

716
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,653
I don't drive the Scirocco.

717
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,741
Do you have a license?

718
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,410
Yes.

719
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:04,290
So you have a license and a car
and we're on a train?

720
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,252
Please be quiet.

721
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,795
I'm just saying.

722
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,173
Seems like
we could've saved a lot of money.

723
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,925
Don't you think?

724
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,095
Do you always ask this many questions?

725
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,348
I'm sorry.

726
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,434
So, what are we learning today?

727
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:27,939
Chi.

728
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:32,109
Internal energy.

729
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,946
The essence of life.

730
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:39,825
It moves inside of us,
it flows through our bodies.

731
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,328
Give us power from within.

732
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,085
I get it.

733
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:51,629
Like The Force in Star Wars.

734
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,131
You're Yoda and I'm like...

735
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,550
I'm like a Jedi.

736
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,002
Is this where you learned kung fu?

737
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,169
Yes.

738
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:37,425
Everything good about me was born here.

739
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,928
Xiao Dre, you can leave your backpack
and skateboard here.

740
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,222
So where we going?

741
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,349
We journey to the top of the mountain.

742
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:47,685
Drink from the Dragon Well.

743
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,356
Dragon Well.

744
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,360
It's probably closer than it is
than looking at it.

745
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:58,696
Right?

746
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,226
Are we there yet?

747
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,978
Soon.

748
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,900
How do you say "water" in Chinese?

749
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,111
I need some shui.

750
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,449
I'm really thirsty.

751
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,456
I'm thirsty, Mr. Han.

752
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,583
Water on top of the mountain.

753
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,639
Xiao Dre.

754
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,443
The journey is complete.

755
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:29,448
Is this the Dragon Well?

756
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:31,951
Yes.

757
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,166
I stood here

758
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:42,211
with my father when I was your age.

759
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:45,798
He told me it's magic kung fu water.

760
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,228
You drink, and nothing can defeat you.

761
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:14,201
It's the best water I've ever tasted.

762
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:19,498
Did you see the lady with the snake?

763
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,624
Yes.

764
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:21,792
She was doing the cobra thing.

765
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:26,422
She was, like, copying the snake,
and it was, like, right here.

766
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:28,173
And she was like...

767
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,927
You did not watch closely enough, Xiao Dre.

768
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:35,139
The snake was copying the woman.

769
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:37,892
What?

770
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,435
I don't get it.

771
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:50,154
Look.

772
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:52,239
What do you see?

773
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:53,449
Me.

774
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:54,992
Well, my reflection.

775
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,827
Yes.

776
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,915
Now what do you see?

777
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,833
- It's blurry.
- Yes.

778
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,711
The woman was like still water.

779
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,422
Quiet, calm.

780
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,758
In here and in here.

781
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:17,306
So, the snake reflects her action,
like still water.

782
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,642
- Like a mirror.
- Yes.

783
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:25,356
So she controlled a snake by doing nothing?

784
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:32,696
Being still and doing nothing
are two very different things.

785
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,995
- She used her chi on that snake, didn't she?
- Very good.

786
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:44,208
You've got to teach me that,
like, how to control people.

787
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:48,420
There's only one person
you need to learn how to control.

788
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,425
Who?

789
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,637
Empty your mind.

790
01:22:56,721 --> 01:23:00,557
Flow with my movement.
Connect to the energy around you.

791
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:03,936
I kind ofjust want to learn the cobra thing.

792
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,230
Cobra takes a lifetime.

793
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,982
Requires great focus.

794
01:23:08,274 --> 01:23:09,566
But I have great focus.

795
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,114
Oh, my God. Mr. Han?

796
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,908
Your focus needs more focus.

797
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:20,160
Mr. Han?

798
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:01,076
Thank you, Mr. Han.

799
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:26,602
There is no such thing
as fortune cookies in China?

800
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,771
Dre, please be careful crossing the street.

801
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:34,902
You scared the life out of me the other day.
Pedestrians do not have the right-of-way.

802
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,658
And the symbols. I can't get
the symbols right on the bathrooms.

803
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:44,161
I stay walking into the men's restroom.

804
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,331
The other day I walked in,
there was this 90-year-old Chinese man.

805
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:50,918
He thought he was gonna get a little treat.
Dre, please stop that! You look crazy!

806
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,920
Here, eat your noodles.

807
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:09,812
Up.

808
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,363
Mr. Han, what's going on?

809
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,117
Anticipation.

810
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:25,327
I can't...

811
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,871
Don't see it, feel it.

812
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,833
Damn it, Mr. Han!

813
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:32,751
I felt that one!

814
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:37,881
- Mr. Han!
- What?

815
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,098
Concentrate. Okay?

816
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,474
Okay. Do I get the stick now?

817
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,601
Turn. Kick.

818
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:09,872
Ouch.

819
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:11,915
- Dre, you okay?
- I'm okay!

820
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,047
So, Mr. Han,
what time we training tomorrow?

821
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,009
Xiao Dre, we are not training tomorrow.

822
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:24,678
Why not?

823
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:34,521
Means, "Too much something is not good. "
You train a lot. You need rest.

824
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,065
A day off?

825
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,943
Yes, Mr. Han. Yes.

826
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,362
Xiao Dre needs to rest.

827
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,407
Yes, Mr. Han. You rest, too.

828
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,993
Love you, Mr. Han.

829
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:49,494
Peace!

830
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:04,760
Hey.

831
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:07,638
Are you okay?

832
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,766
My audition is tomorrow at 6:00.

833
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,101
But isn't that what
you've been practicing for?

834
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,686
Yes, of course.

835
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:17,272
Don't worry. You got it.

836
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,234
What if they don't pick me?

837
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,655
Mei Ying, wait!

838
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:29,034
Okay, first of all,
I'm gonna be there with you.

839
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:31,536
And B, all you have to do is
what your teacher says.

840
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:34,414
Play the pauses. It's easy, watch.

841
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:38,085
See?

842
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:42,547
I have to practice.

843
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:44,758
Wait.

844
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:47,636
What?

845
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:49,554
I'm starting to think
you don't speak Chinese.

846
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:54,851
Too much-a good stuff is bad stuff?

847
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,689
Yeah.

848
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,652
Come on.

849
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:04,820
Where are we going?

850
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:06,488
- Dang, have you been to the gym?
- Wait, no!

851
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:08,532
- Come on, we're gonna go have some fun.
- I have to go! No!

852
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,450
Come on, I know you want
to go have some fun.

853
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,190
Okay, that's gonna give you
some serious gas.

854
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:54,578
Don't do it.

855
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:58,874
What do you see?

856
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,042
Me.

857
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,502
Now what do you see?

858
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:04,671
Me.

859
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:35,702
You go. Come on.

860
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:39,331
<i>You're a dance machine.
That was pretty good.</i>

861
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,666
Go ahead.

862
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:44,127
<i>Here comes Round 2.</i>

863
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,557
<i>You're hot!</i>

864
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:46,857
That's like American dancing.
Like, you should have a group...

865
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,024
No.

866
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:53,447
...with, like, other people in it, and they're
dancing behind you, doing the same stuff.

867
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:09,504
The audition, it was changed to today.

868
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:11,339
- But they said it was tomorrow.
- Something happened.

869
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,383
It's in 20 minutes.

870
01:31:13,676 --> 01:31:16,011
My father is coming to get me.

871
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,725
Excuse me. Sorry.

872
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,937
Excuse me, coming through!

873
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,451
Come on, come on.

874
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,180
Excuse me!

875
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:22,822
Hey, she's, like, totally gonna get in, right?
Because that was just great.

876
01:34:57,274 --> 01:34:59,901
Hey, that was fantastic.

877
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:04,280
You played so beautifully and...

878
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:07,075
We can no longer be friends.

879
01:35:08,911 --> 01:35:10,745
You are bad for my life.

880
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:26,261
See you at the tournament.

881
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:30,265
Don't be late for that.

882
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:19,189
Mr. Han!

883
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,862
We no train today.

884
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,171
What are you doing?

885
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:45,882
It's June 8th.

886
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:00,123
Why'd you break the car?

887
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:21,603
His name was Gong Gong.

888
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,107
Xiao Dre, how old are you?

889
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:28,985
Twelve.

890
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:31,613
He was 10.

891
01:38:33,782 --> 01:38:35,533
He was so beautiful.

892
01:38:39,496 --> 01:38:41,289
Her name was Zhang.

893
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,168
She was a singer.

894
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:51,007
Not professional.

895
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:55,678
She sang only for me.

896
01:39:34,009 --> 01:39:35,385
What happened?

897
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:46,729
It was a steep hill.

898
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,607
Lots of rain.

899
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:53,569
The carjust...

900
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,241
I was driving.

901
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:02,078
We argue about something.

902
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,957
I was so angry.

903
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:08,543
I lost control.

904
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,754
I try to remember.

905
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:16,426
I cannot remember what we argue about.

906
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,930
I hope it was something important.

907
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,060
Every year,

908
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:28,813
I fix the car.

909
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:31,941
Still fix nothing.

910
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:20,503
Punch.

911
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,505
Good.

912
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:24,317
Mr. Han.

913
01:45:54,473 --> 01:45:55,931
Look at me.

914
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,183
Down!

915
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:16,786
Faster!

916
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:18,954
One more.

917
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:24,835
Come here.

918
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:19,348
Win or lose, doesn't matter.

919
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:22,017
Fight hard.

920
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:26,188
Earn respect. Boys leave you alone.

921
01:47:32,195 --> 01:47:34,029
Have present for you.

922
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,120
Mr. Han!

923
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:42,246
Man!

924
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:44,415
This is the one Bruce Lee had.

925
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:46,876
Great.

926
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:49,712
Thank you.

927
01:47:53,091 --> 01:47:56,218
You have taught me
a very important lesson, Xiao Dre.

928
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:00,598
Life will knock us down.

929
01:48:01,433 --> 01:48:05,394
But we can choose
whether or not to get back up.

930
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:12,151
You're the best friend I ever had, Mr. Han.

931
01:48:30,253 --> 01:48:31,420
Okay.

932
01:48:35,425 --> 01:48:37,927
Wait, can you help me with something?

933
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:44,308
Dre?

934
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:46,602
Is your dad home?

935
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:54,527
Sir...

936
01:48:55,153 --> 01:48:56,820
...my name is Dre Parker.

937
01:48:57,948 --> 01:48:59,949
My actions have brought...

938
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:04,286
...dishonor to your family.

939
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:09,625
Your daughter
has been a great friend to me.

940
01:49:10,835 --> 01:49:13,295
And from her, I have learned...

941
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:15,631
...that a true friend...

942
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:19,134
...is a person who makes your life better.

943
01:49:19,469 --> 01:49:23,889
But, if you give me a second chance...

944
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:28,978
...I promise that I will be...

945
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:35,234
...the best friend your daughter has ever had.

946
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,156
That's it.

947
01:49:56,715 --> 01:50:01,677
My daughter told me that she made
a promise to be at your tournament.

948
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:05,848
In our family, we do not break our promises.

949
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,520
Good luck.

950
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:24,450
Rock and roll.

951
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:47,640
Hi!

952
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:49,058
Hey!

953
01:50:51,227 --> 01:50:53,604
Let the tournament begin!

954
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:28,097
We're up.

955
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:32,768
- What's that?
- Rulebook.

956
01:51:33,436 --> 01:51:35,938
- You don't know the rules?
- Of course I know the rules.

957
01:51:36,356 --> 01:51:38,857
Simple. You hit him, don't let him hit you.

958
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,985
What? Mr...

959
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:44,279
They're gonna kill me.

960
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:46,782
Two points to win.

961
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:51,120
Go. Hit him two times.
Focus, focus. Come on.

962
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:06,552
Dre!

963
01:52:11,307 --> 01:52:12,850
Come on, Dre!

964
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,944
That's a warning.
You cannot run out of the mat.

965
01:52:24,028 --> 01:52:25,654
Next time, you lose a point.

966
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:27,823
Go. Hey, be strong.

967
01:52:28,491 --> 01:52:29,825
Come on, Dre.

968
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,028
Good job. Next time, no face.

969
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:08,030
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.
- Okay, okay, okay.

970
01:53:08,114 --> 01:53:09,448
Next point, winner.

971
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,200
Come on, baby!

972
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:32,805
Yeah!

973
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:34,408
That's right, baby!

974
01:54:57,432 --> 01:54:58,557
Go.

975
01:56:15,134 --> 01:56:19,137
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!

976
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:23,308
From now on, semi-final matches.
Three points to win.

977
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:26,019
Be kind of hot
if I won this thing, right, Mr. Han?

978
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:27,813
Be kind of hot if you focus.

979
01:56:28,856 --> 01:56:30,315
Yeah, well, after that.

980
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:43,745
And now the first semi-final of the evening...

981
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:03,009
Next semi-final
introducing Fighting Dragon, Liang...

982
01:59:05,888 --> 01:59:08,140
...and the surprise finalist, Dre Parker.

983
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:22,988
But, I can beat him.

984
01:59:23,072 --> 01:59:24,781
I do not want him beaten.

985
01:59:24,866 --> 01:59:25,949
I want him broken.

986
01:59:32,957 --> 01:59:34,791
Empty your mind.

987
01:59:34,876 --> 01:59:36,084
Focus.

988
02:00:43,736 --> 02:00:45,237
You're disqualified!

989
02:00:50,785 --> 02:00:52,911
Be still. Xiao Dre.

990
02:00:53,496 --> 02:00:54,829
You okay?

991
02:01:08,552 --> 02:01:10,095
Don't move. Don't move.

992
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:20,480
He's done.

993
02:01:21,857 --> 02:01:23,441
I'm sorry, you should not continue.

994
02:01:24,068 --> 02:01:26,820
You've brought honor to your family.

995
02:01:29,782 --> 02:01:31,950
Doctor says you did great.

996
02:01:43,504 --> 02:01:44,838
You okay, baby?

997
02:01:44,922 --> 02:01:46,423
Yeah, I'm okay.

998
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:52,387
Dre Parker has 2 minutes
to return to the match.

999
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:54,723
If he is unable to return...

1000
02:01:54,807 --> 02:01:59,352
...the Fighting Dragons win by default.

1001
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:03,565
Can you guys give us a second?

1002
02:02:05,401 --> 02:02:08,653
Yeah, okay. Sure, baby, whatever you need.

1003
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:20,040
Do you think I could have won?

1004
02:02:21,709 --> 02:02:24,169
Win or lose doesn't matter, Xiao Dre.

1005
02:02:25,629 --> 02:02:28,089
You know that's not what I mean.

1006
02:02:32,636 --> 02:02:36,014
Yes. I think you had a good chance.

1007
02:02:39,393 --> 02:02:41,811
So let's do the fiery cup thing.

1008
02:02:44,815 --> 02:02:47,150
You don't need to fight anymore.

1009
02:02:47,234 --> 02:02:49,152
You have proven everything
you need to prove.

1010
02:02:49,612 --> 02:02:53,448
What, that I can get beat up easy
and then quit?

1011
02:02:53,532 --> 02:02:56,409
That's not balance. That's not real kung fu.

1012
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:58,953
You said that when life knocks you down,

1013
02:02:59,288 --> 02:03:02,290
you could choose
whether or not to get back up.

1014
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:05,085
Well, I'm trying to get back up,
and why won't you help me?

1015
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:13,176
Because I cannot watch you
get hurt anymore.

1016
02:03:18,015 --> 02:03:19,641
Please, Mr. Han.

1017
02:03:20,726 --> 02:03:22,060
Please.

1018
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:25,772
Just tell me, Xiao Dre, why?

1019
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:28,483
Why you need to
go back out there so badly?

1020
02:03:33,322 --> 02:03:35,365
Because I'm still scared.

1021
02:03:37,743 --> 02:03:39,911
No matter what happens,

1022
02:03:39,995 --> 02:03:41,955
tonight, when I leave,

1023
02:03:42,623 --> 02:03:44,791
I don't want to be scared anymore.

1024
02:03:57,263 --> 02:04:01,975
Since Dre Parker has not
returned to the ring...

1025
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:25,123
Dre Parker will fight!

1026
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:19,696
Xiao Dre.

1027
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:38,548
Come on, Dre. You can do this, Dre.

1028
02:08:23,862 --> 02:08:24,904
You okay?

1029
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:26,406
Yeah. I'm okay.

1030
02:08:30,202 --> 02:08:31,577
I want you...

1031
02:08:32,663 --> 02:08:35,206
...to break his leg.

1032
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,751
No mercy.

1033
02:09:53,494 --> 02:09:56,996
The score is tied, the next point wins!

1034
02:10:04,213 --> 02:10:06,798
Can you continue?

1035
02:10:37,746 --> 02:10:39,080
Come on, Dre.

1036
02:12:02,664 --> 02:12:03,915
Finish him!

1037
02:12:34,696 --> 02:12:36,280
You won!

1038
02:13:24,746 --> 02:13:25,871
Dre! Dre!

1039
02:13:29,418 --> 02:13:31,335
I'm so proud of you!

1040
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:36,382
Good.
