1
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,515
This is a lot at stake here,
you know?

2
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,114
We're talkin' nation
versus nation, and...

3
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,352
... the race is still on.

4
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,523
There's lots to discover
out there, man.

5
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,568
I guess the call came in
on a Friday.

6
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,031
Nate and I were
at Ben's for a barbecue.

7
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,994
Um... just a few beers, you know?
Maybe more than a few.

8
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,452
With Ben's cooking,
you definitely need a few.

9
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,625
Nate took the call.
It was Milton...

10
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,838
... and Milton said
18 was back on.

11
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,427
But it was classified.
DOD, top secret.

12
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,683
Asked, you know,
"Are you okay with that?"

13
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,640
And he was like,
"Are you kidding me?"

14
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,515
I come from a family
of military pilots.

15
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,685
Duty can sometimes
outbalance a private life.

16
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,151
Make choices,
keep moving forward.

17
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,317
NASA already has something
like 800 pounds of rocks.

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,179
So why we need more,
I don't know.

19
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,079
But, hey, if it means
a trip to the moon...

20
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,743
Placing cameras. We got these
Westinghouses all over the place.

21
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,878
Well, I think the way it's being
explained is they're using...

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,463
... a Saturn V to launch
a classified DOD payload, uh...

23
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,846
... which is meant to be very large,
very heavy, and uh...

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,399
... apparently unmanned.

25
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,351
Apparently.

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,138
Placing these
high-frequency transmitters...

27
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,309
... part of some early warning
antimissile defense system...

28
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,567
... against the Soviet Union.

29
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,230
These PSD5s are kind of like
high-tech radar scanners.

30
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,741
They should pick up and track
anything we can't.

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,574
Gotta keep a little eye
on the Russians there.

32
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,613
Would have been nice
to tell my wife.

33
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,034
Laura had been by my side
the whole time, and uh...

34
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,405
...she thinks I'm off
doing a training exercise...

35
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,705
... with the Japanese
space agency.

36
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,522
Ryan, my boy, would have
been nice to tell him...

37
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:46,922
... his old man's
going to the moon.

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,553
I would have loved to have
brought him a souvenir.

39
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,760
Maybe a moon rock.
I don't know. Maybe one day.

40
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,847
Ben was always first in class...

41
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,477
... and I was always
right at his heels.

42
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,390
Yeah, I'll admit, I'm a little jealous
that he'll be moonwalking with Nate...

43
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,309
... while I'll be all by my
lonesome, piloting the orbiter.

44
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,356
My job is essentially to make
sure I bring us home safely.

45
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,610
Look, let's face it, these
missions are result-oriented...

46
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,451
... and uh... we can't afford
to fail here, now can we?

47
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,287
Things can go wrong,
things do go wrong, it happens.

48
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,952
But you just gotta push
that out of your mind.

49
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,460
It's just not an option.

50
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,255
I'm proud to do it
for these guys.

51
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,841
And I'm proud to do it
for my country.

52
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:38,220
T-minus ten, nine,
eight, seven...

53
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,437
... six, five, four, three...

54
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,477
... two, one.

55
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,662
Apollo 18, you're looking good.

56
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,177
Christmas lights.

57
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,929
- Bring any Christmas lights, Ben?
- Nope, not me.

58
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,682
You ever see anything
like that before?

59
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,013
No, sir.

60
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,432
It's amazing.

61
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,524
Earth in all her glory.

62
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,196
That's a good lookin' boy.
You sure he's yours?

63
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,153
Watch it.
He's a good kid.

64
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,034
He's got big shoes to fill now.

65
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,740
Big old moon boots.

66
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,245
So, Nate, you wait all this time
to put your foot on the moon...

67
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,378
... and you get to be number 13.
How you feel about that?

68
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,664
You gonna be okay
with staying behind, John?

69
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,842
Oh, you know, it'd be nice
to have some alone time.

70
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,174
It's gettin' crowded in here.

71
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:59,092
I'll keep a light on for you, boys.
Don't stay out too late now.

72
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,635
See you in a couple
of days, partner.

73
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,601
Roger that.
See you in a couple of days.

74
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,577
Houston, this is Freedom
preparing to undock Liberty. Over.

75
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,202
Okay, 18, you're go for
undock in four minutes.

76
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,956
John, is the tunnel vented?

77
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,917
Roger that.
Tunnel is vented.

78
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,416
Okay, Liberty,
we're ready to send you...

79
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,129
... an updated state vector
and REFSMMAT.

80
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,638
Roger, Houston. We're pooling
data, computer is all yours.

81
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,930
Wish you were comin'
with us, John.

82
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,930
Now, you boys
be careful down there.

83
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,145
You too, buddy.

84
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,433
Got a good visual on you.

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,694
Okay, 18, you are go for landing.

86
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,822
We're go for the moon!

87
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,196
Fourteen hundred feet.

88
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,078
Forty-four down, lookin' good.

89
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,114
Down to a thousand feet.

90
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,033
We're right on profile.

91
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,537
Fifty-four LPD.
Dropping off

92
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,550
Seven hundred feet.
Down 20. Looking good.

93
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,389
Mission elapsed time:
Four days, six hours, 33 minutes.

94
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,720
Roger.

95
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,557
Leveling off.
Take her down.

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,814
- Gonna have to land long.
- Where?

97
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,066
Over that next crater.
Twelve o'clock.

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,068
Next to the rim.
It's a pretty rocky area. Mark it.

99
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,696
Four hundred and 30 feet.
Down 15, 25 forward.

100
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:44,905
Houston, we have a program
alarm. Twelve-oh-one.

101
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,664
You are go on the
twelve-oh-one, Liberty.

102
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,825
Roger.
Go twelve-oh-one.

103
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,835
Liberty, position
vector mark one-eight.

104
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,837
Watch those
suppression boosters.

105
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,124
You wanna think about
revisiting that approach?

106
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,667
Negative, we'll miss our window.

107
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,460
Those boulders
are some big mothers.

108
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,426
Sub boosters
on my three, two, one, mark.

109
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,216
- Liberty status?
- We're coming in too fast.

110
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,759
Liberty, you stabilize.

111
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,513
Liberty to Houston,
range is long. Going manual.

112
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,569
- Contact light.
- Standby for T1 stay no stay.

113
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,699
- Engine arm off.
- Stay for T1, Liberty.

114
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,204
Houston,
you give that man a cigar.

115
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,412
From up here,
that looked very pretty.

116
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,077
Excellent touchdown.

117
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,630
Oh, are you talking
to me or Nate?

118
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,671
Well, I'm talking
to you both, Ben.

119
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461
December 25th, 1974.

120
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,097
MET: Four days, nine hours,
23 minutes.

121
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,883
Commander Nathan Walker.
DOD Mission Report One-A.

122
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,896
We're day one
of our two-day mission.

123
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:50,896
Prepping for EVA-One
and payload setup.

124
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,977
This is Thomas Young
at Apollo Mission Control.

125
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,483
In addition to the Mauer
16-millimeter cameras...

126
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,191
- ... this mission will mark...
- Looks like five reels.

127
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,572
- 10,000 feet Kodachrome.
- The RCA module...

128
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,903
... data acquisition cameras
inside the lunar module...

129
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,238
... record all facets of the mission.

130
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,903
Houston, we are
prepped for EVA-One.

131
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,073
Copy, Liberty.
You are go for cabin depress.

132
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,459
Button up good, boys. We don't
want anyone catching cold.

133
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,248
Roger that.

134
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,964
Can you check me over?

135
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,551
It'd help if you
were a little smaller.

136
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,768
- Check my PLSS.
- Yup.

137
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,481
Houston...

138
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,116
... we're taking our first steps
on the south pole.

139
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:51,498
I prepared a speech, but no one
but us would hear it anyway.

140
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,123
No words can describe
how it feels to be here.

141
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,628
Rock formations everywhere.

142
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,293
The sun is low, on the horizon.

143
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,178
It's amazing.

144
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,641
Freedom, do you read?

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,972
Do you read?

146
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,014
Freedom reads you loud
and clear, Liberty. Over.

147
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:28,652
Yeah, yeah. Perfect.
You call that a salute?

148
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,163
Okay, let me get a shot of you
with the LM in the background.

149
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,126
That looks like
a Navy salute to me.

150
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,213
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I gotta get this.

151
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,509
Promised Laura and Ryan
I'd spend Christmas with them.

152
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,669
This is all going back
to the Department of Defense.

153
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,179
No one's ever gonna...

154
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,266
Completing Westinghouse setup.

155
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,189
Sounds good, Nate.
Standing by.

156
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,688
Motion sensor is tracking
you perfectly, Nate.

157
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,357
Captain Video says first round
is on him when you get back.

158
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,323
I'm checking the payload
in the MESA unit.

159
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,518
Shit!

160
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,095
What was that?

161
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,392
Houston, can you track
that power flux?

162
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,435
I'd like to get a fix
on the interference.

163
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,354
Roger, Nate. Looks like you're
ready to proceed to location one...

164
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,570
- ... and initiate setup procedures.
- Copy. We're on our way.

165
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,986
Will you take a look at that?

166
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,283
It makes you think, doesn't it?

167
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,707
Damn, it's dusty.

168
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,965
I'm leaving the camera up here
so you can get a better view, Tommy.

169
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,841
And for your information...

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,095
... we're about three hours
and 20 minutes...

171
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,721
It's hard to believe the sun never
shines in some of these places. Ever.

172
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,270
Careful, now, fellas.
You drop into any of those craters...

173
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,779
... you'll get cold in a hurry.

174
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,618
PSD5 in place.

175
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,121
Roger.
Proceed with startup.

176
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,284
Did you record the signal frequency
on the PSD5 during training?

177
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,499
- It was ALSEP, wasn't it?
- Thought it was.

178
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,961
I think they changed it.

179
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,219
Set astral coordinates,
four-eight-point-three on the Z...

180
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,721
... and eight-niner-point-eight
on... record.

181
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,399
Initiation sequence complete.

182
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,102
Houston, we're getting some
noise on the high-gain again.

183
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:15,115
Collecting geological samples near
what appears to be a... impact crater.

184
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,536
The sample feels...

185
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,085
... strange.

186
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,931
It's great to get out of that gear.

187
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,974
MET: Four days,
fourteen hours, 48 minutes.

188
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,860
Commander Nathan Walker.
DOD Mission Report Three-Charlie.

189
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,816
Day one, EVA-One complete.

190
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:57,118
I am starving.
What's on the menu tonight?

191
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,530
Carrots or peas?

192
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,164
I'll take carrots.

193
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,246
- No. You get the peas.
- Perfect.

194
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,214
I'm mighty proud of you, boys.

195
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,376
- You have a good time out there?
- You know it.

196
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,712
I'm gettin' a lot of noise
on this frequency.

197
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,883
I'm gonna see if I can isolate it,
maybe clean it up a bit.

198
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,969
Roger that.

199
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,949
Astronaut Ryan Anderson with
his dad, flying through space.

200
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,662
- Ryan, what are you doing?
- Just playing, Mom.

201
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,788
Don't play with your dad's stuff.

202
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,907
Baby, is that recording?

203
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,122
Sorry, Dad.
Love you.

204
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:54,168
Beverly's in a panic because
a hair appointment ran over.

205
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,428
Stan and Jean are already over
and nothing's ready...

206
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,965
... so I offer to help cut
all these jalapenos.

207
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,850
Couple of minutes later,
I'm in the bathroom takin' a leak...

208
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,762
... with all this jalapeno
nonsense on my hands.

209
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,353
Next thing I know,
my crotch is on fire.

210
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,769
So I'm in the bathroom,
hollering in pain.

211
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,404
- And they can hear you?
- Oh, oh, they heard me.

212
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,612
And Stan's wife's a nurse, so she
sends me back into the bathroom...

213
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,028
- ... with a cup of milk.
- Nate, I gotta stop you.

214
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,617
You're not about to tell me that you
dipped your balls in a glass of milk?

215
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,126
- Hey, don't knock it. It works.
- Jalapeno dick.

216
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,286
I can't believe you
haven't heard that story.

217
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,299
- Is Beverly back in Miami?
- Yeah. So I hear.

218
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,131
You realize she divorced
you 'cause you snore, right?

219
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,887
- I don't snore.
- Yeah.

220
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,715
Every time.

221
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,552
- You all right, Benny?
- Yeah, I'm good.

222
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,971
- You bang your head?
- Again.

223
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,639
It's a big head.

224
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,309
Thanks for the housekeeping,
guys. Great first day.

225
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,069
We'll miss you over at Marybelle's.
Get some sleep.

226
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,400
Good night, JD.

227
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,781
Never should have
told you that. You little prick.

228
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,501
- Nate?
- Yeah, I hear it.

229
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,880
What can that be here?

230
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,544
Give me a second.

231
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,878
It should be on comm?

232
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,435
What's that?

233
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,937
Right.

234
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,316
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

235
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,569
All right.
Uh...

236
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,746
Sounds like it's coming
from up here.

237
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,366
That doesn't sound right.

238
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,918
Can't find it down here.

239
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,307
Hey, Tommy, do you think this
interference could be coming...

240
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,807
... from the PSD5 setup?

241
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:52,687
We don't see anything obvious.
We'll double-check with DOD.

242
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,196
We'll look into it.
Go get some sleep.

243
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,334
I'm up!
You can turn off the noise.

244
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,624
Good morning, Liberty.

245
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,009
We took care of the interference
a couple of hours ago.

246
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:10,139
You guys should be okay.
Let's get ready for EVA-Two, okay?

247
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:19,478
MET: Five days,
eight hours, 34 minutes.

248
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,517
IMP Ben Anderson.

249
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,604
I gotta document this.

250
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,448
Now, Nate...

251
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,985
... Nate says he never
snores in his sleep.

252
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,698
Now I got proof.

253
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,337
Ha!

254
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,678
Well, boys, I just wanna let you
know that Freedom will be going...

255
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,714
... around the corner
to the backside.

256
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,600
- No comm for a while.
- Roger that.

257
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,937
Hey, I made you breakfast.

258
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,726
What do I got today?

259
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:08,069
- Scrambled eggs.
- Oh, again. What do you got?

260
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,154
I'm going with
the delicious ham spread.

261
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,328
- Hm.
- It's all yours.

262
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,799
Just like Mom makes.

263
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,997
Hey, did you remove
one of my samples?

264
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,130
Huh?

265
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,383
Look, one of my samples
is on the floor.

266
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,432
What's that doing there, Ben?

267
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,052
I don't know.

268
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,688
I bagged and tagged everything.

269
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,232
- Look, uh...
- It's gotta go back in.

270
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,567
Yeah, grab me the scoop.

271
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,953
I'm gonna have to mark
this one contaminated.

272
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,785
I don't understand.
How did it get there?

273
00:19:58,948 --> 00:19:59,976
I don't know.

274
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:01,576
No, really, Ben,
how'd that get there?

275
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,790
I don't know.

276
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,723
DOD is checking
on the interference...

277
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,474
... with the first payload setup.

278
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,837
Run a diagnostic...

279
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,099
Houston?
Do you copy?

280
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,268
I think we lost them.

281
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,062
Probably got
some comm blockage.

282
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
These are some big craters.

283
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,571
Five days, ten hours,
40 minutes since liftoff.

284
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,908
Commander Nathan Walker.
We're on EVA-Two.

285
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,823
Initiating day two receiver setup.

286
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,587
Activating PSD5
transmission signal.

287
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,673
Houston, do you copy?
This is Liberty, over.

288
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,808
Still down.

289
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,892
There is something
with that frequency.

290
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:08,434
Comm shouldn't be cuttin' out
like that, not for this length of time.

291
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,319
Where are you going?

292
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,861
What the hell?

293
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,697
- Nate.
- What is it?

294
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,742
Tracks.

295
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,332
What?

296
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,838
No, that's impossible.

297
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,999
These aren't ours.

298
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:38,173
MET: Five days,
eleven hours, seven minutes.

299
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,182
IMP Anderson.

300
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,146
Tracks appear in single...

301
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,480
Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?

302
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,568
Houston, this is 18.
Do you read?

303
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,031
John's on the backside.
No comm from him, either.

304
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,868
Well, let's see where they lead.

305
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,496
Impact crater.

306
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,836
You feel that?

307
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,467
Yeah.
Temperature dropped.

308
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,090
Look at the footprints.

309
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,769
It doesn't make sense.

310
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,430
I think he was
just walking in circles.

311
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,315
Disoriented.

312
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,282
- Oxygen dep?
- I don't know.

313
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,067
They go off in this direction.

314
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,623
Get up here.

315
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,554
Holy shit.

316
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,731
It's Russian.

317
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,483
What the hell?

318
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,513
How could there be Russians
on the moon...

319
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:29,413
... and nobody knows about it?

320
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,126
We're on the moon and
nobody knows about us.

321
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,258
Something's not right.

322
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,718
I'm gonna look inside.

323
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,358
Lights are off.

324
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,678
Somebody lost it in here.

325
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,770
This place is trashed.

326
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,448
Their systems aren't
that different from ours.

327
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:52,079
Powers up.
Oxygen reserves are good.

328
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,835
Can't tell if she's fully
operational, though.

329
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,045
- Where the hell did they go?
- I don't know.

330
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,883
I'm gonna take a look around.

331
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,763
But stay close.

332
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,016
Those Russians
could be anywhere.

333
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,645
What the hell?

334
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,230
There's blood.
A lot of it.

335
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,030
Somebody got hurt pretty bad.

336
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,956
I don't like this.

337
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,302
I think I see something
inside the crater.

338
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,472
I'm going down.

339
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,984
Wait, Ben. The suits aren't
ready for that kind of cold.

340
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,985
It's okay,
the crater isn't so deep.

341
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:09,823
It's so cold.

342
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,489
I just see rocks.

343
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,752
The ground,
it's uh... it's different.

344
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,003
It feels... softer.

345
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,009
Get out of there.

346
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,602
Oh, God...

347
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,520
So cold.

348
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,939
Get out of there!
Ben!

349
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,075
Okay, yeah, all right.
I'm heading back up.

350
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,482
Holy shit!

351
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,373
I found him!
I got the cosmonaut!

352
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:01,003
It's okay. I'm all right.
I'm on my way up!

353
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,713
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm warmin' up.

354
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,177
Oh, Christ.
What the hell happened here?

355
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,510
Maybe the other cosmonaut?

356
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,642
You think he killed him?

357
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,648
There's a rip.

358
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,071
What are you doing?
Get your hand outta there.

359
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,570
Wait a minute,
there's something...

360
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,613
Get away from him!

361
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,578
What the hell was that?

362
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,760
It was a rock.

363
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,340
Must have happened
when I was dragging him out.

364
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,850
- I don't know.
- Let's get out of here.

365
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,601
All right, we're almost
at the point of no return, Ben.

366
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,731
If we don't go now,
we'll end up just as dead.

367
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,362
I don't like this.
Someone died up here.

368
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,242
Enough.

369
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,501
This is a secure line.

370
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,961
I'm just talking to you, right,
Tommy?

371
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,717
That's affirmative, Nate.

372
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,721
The Russians have been
to the moon.

373
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,598
Say again?

374
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,510
The Russians have landed
on the south pole.

375
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,475
We found their
LK Proton Lander.

376
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,357
But it didn't end well
for the cosmonaut.

377
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,190
- You find a crash site?
- They didn't crash.

378
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,114
We found his body in a crater.

379
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,318
You found a dead cosmonaut?

380
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,328
You telling me
you didn't know this?

381
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,375
We land less than two clicks
from a Soviet LK...

382
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,207
... and you expect me to believe
you didn't know they were here?

383
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,463
You know they scrubbed their
manned flight program in '69.

384
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,502
That's the official word.

385
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,510
Did you know they were here?

386
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,346
- Tommy?
- This is a DOD mission, Nate.

387
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,517
I'm just briefed in on what I need
to know. That's all I can tell you.

388
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:32,359
You get that little prick
from DOD to give me a call.

389
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,697
Get some rest. I'll get the DOD
over here and we'll talk to you soon.

390
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,864
- Tommy's a straight shooter.
- No.

391
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,533
I knew something was wrong
from the beginning.

392
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,452
All right, what are you thinking?

393
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,168
DOD taking over,
lying to our families.

394
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,877
Then they're rushing us
up here for what?

395
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,293
What, to set up
some listening devices?

396
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,929
Yeah.
Makes no sense.

397
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,841
Come on, think about
Watergate, Nate.

398
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,541
I mean, that was our president,
for Christ sakes...

399
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:05,479
... and you don't think
that DOD would just lie to us?

400
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,810
So, what are we
doing up here then?

401
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,393
What are we really doing?

402
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,526
Well, it's kind of spooky, really.

403
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,955
Strange beauty on the backside.

404
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,164
I don't know if it's my mind
playing tricks on me...

405
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,331
... but every so often you look
out these little windows and...

406
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,841
... get this sense that something
might be looking back.

407
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,593
Back at you.

408
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,580
Nate, look at this.

409
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,419
- What?
- Look at this!

410
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,884
The flag's gone.

411
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,594
No, this isn't right.

412
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,100
Houston, this is 18.
Over.

413
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,016
Houston, Liberty.

414
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,399
Did you see anything unusual
on the Westinghouse last night?

415
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,979
Uh... we got some
interference and dropouts.

416
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,402
Our flag is gone.

417
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,692
Say again?

418
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,575
Say again.

419
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,079
Maybe the other
cosmonaut took it.

420
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,716
If there was another cosmonaut,
he'd be away from his LK for, what..

421
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,719
... a minimum of ten, 12 hours?

422
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,215
- What are you thinking, John?
- There's no way.

423
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,429
He couldn't carry
that kind of oxygen.

424
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,435
So how could he survive?

425
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,105
Maybe there is no he.

426
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,436
You saying the Soviets
flew a one-man mission?

427
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,567
Wouldn't be the first time.

428
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,321
If there's one cosmonaut,
who took the flag?

429
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,108
Who killed the other
cosmonaut that we found?

430
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,494
We need to get DOD
on the line. Now.

431
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:53,829
We suspected the Soviets might be
there, but we had no confirmation.

432
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,163
Intelligence warned that they
might be disguising missions...

433
00:33:56,326 --> 00:34:00,627
- ... as routine satellite launches.
- Why the hell didn't you tell us?

434
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,760
National security. We play our cards
pretty close to the vest, Commander.

435
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,295
I'm sure you can understand.

436
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,636
Maybe a little too close.

437
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,558
We were concerned they might get
their eye in the sky up there first.

438
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,938
It would be a national
security disaster.

439
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,316
So where the hell's
this other cosmonaut?

440
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,403
What, they're just gonna
leave him here?

441
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,691
Our intelligence suggests
there was only one cosmonaut.

442
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,858
- Goddamn!
- Setup's complete.

443
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,369
It's time to get
you boys home again.

444
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,994
So that's it?

445
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,629
Let's focus on getting home.
We'll ask questions later.

446
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,052
Zero-four-seven, plus three.

447
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,215
- Seven-seven-six-two.
- Your RCS feed is looking good.

448
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,974
... minus seven-six.

449
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,388
What the hell was that?

450
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,431
Let's get outta here.

451
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,442
Roger.
DAP looks good.

452
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,444
Ten seconds.

453
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,573
- Ten seconds. Ready on my mark.
- Ten, nine...

454
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,076
- Time to go home.
- ... eight, seven, six...

455
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,998
Master alarm!

456
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,133
Shit! We are no go!
We are no go!

457
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,794
- Safe this damn thing.
- I'm trying!

458
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,089
- I've got a major power glitch.
- We're losing the descent oxygen.

459
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,132
- We got a leak somewhere!
- I'm gonna try and isolate the tanks...

460
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,643
... and see if I can stop it.
Houston, do you copy?

461
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,020
- Repeat, Houston, do you copy?
- Engine arm off!

462
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,854
We've lost comm.
Prop valves, closed.

463
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,439
- No, no, no, no, no, no...
- What the hell is going on?

464
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,776
No. Houston, this is Liberty.
Over.

465
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,215
We just lost communications.

466
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,093
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.

467
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,933
Impact on the LM,
maybe a meteorite?

468
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,973
There's no way to tell
without going EVA.

469
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,023
- Give me a hand with the PLSS.
- You sure about this?

470
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,110
We need comm to get home.
Can't just stay in here and wait.

471
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,242
- Look, I can play with the omni...
- Suit up!

472
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,822
Leaving egress platform.

473
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,533
Stepping down the ladder.

474
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,495
MET: Six days...

475
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,124
... thirteen hours, 46 minutes.

476
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,054
Commander Walker is performing
an unscheduled EVA...

477
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,761
... to repair the S-Band antenna
on the Rover.

478
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,264
We've experienced...

479
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,351
... we've experienced some
unexplained, uh... malfunctions.

480
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,735
Looks like the hull's
insulation is damaged.

481
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,741
Could be debris from the impact,
but I don't see any meteor residue.

482
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,834
- This is ripped to pieces.
- Something hit us?

483
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,294
I can't tell.

484
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,336
We get that same feedback
each time we use active comm.

485
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,378
Sounds like crossover chatter
from another frequency.

486
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,845
I can't squelch it.
I've never heard anything like it.

487
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,850
Wait, wait.

488
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,569
Nate, talk to me.
What do you see?

489
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,525
Looks like tracks.

490
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,533
Footprints? Maybe there
is another cosmonaut.

491
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,943
No.

492
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,823
MET: Six days,
thirteen hours, 47 minutes.

493
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,913
Commander Nathan Walker.

494
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,794
We're witnessing
what could be evidence...

495
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,957
... of extraterrestrial contact.

496
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,966
We're witnessing
what could be evidence...

497
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,503
... of extraterrestrial contact.

498
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,473
Do you know
what you're saying?

499
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,306
These tracks are not human.

500
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,103
I found the flag.

501
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,314
It's shredded.

502
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,151
And the motion-sensor
camera is gone.

503
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,326
S-Band looks okay,
just got knocked.

504
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,781
I'm turning the Rover back up.

505
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,765
Connection looks good.
Try to reach Houston or Freedom.

506
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,725
Freedom, copy.

507
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,977
Houston, do you copy?

508
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,401
Damn it.
No, look, it's not working.

509
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,362
All right, let me try something.

510
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:37,383
Wait. Something's... something's
moving. Something's moving.

511
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,045
What?
I don't see anything.

512
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,966
Something in... inside my suit!

513
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,928
It's in my helmet!

514
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,189
Nate, listen to me.
Get back to the LM!

515
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,247
I can't get it out!

516
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:54,647
Nate, come back
to the LM, okay? Nate?

517
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,482
- I can't get it out!
- There's nothing inside your suit.

518
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,318
- Now, get back to the ship!
- It's in my helmet!

519
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,324
- I can't take it out!
- Nate!

520
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,748
Oh, Christ.

521
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,173
Nate!

522
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,509
Nate!

523
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,605
Nate!
You need oxygen!

524
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,029
Come on, Nate!
You got to keep moving!

525
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,320
Come on, we're almost there.

526
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,236
Come on, Nate.
Keep moving.

527
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,452
You're almost there.
Come on.

528
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,461
Come on.
We're almost there.

529
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,810
Come on.
Pull yourself in.

530
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,564
Cabin's locked!

531
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,986
Cabin repress auto,
point-five PSI.

532
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,407
Look, you're not getting
enough oxygen.

533
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,438
Hang on.
Breathe!

534
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:42,084
Breathe!
PSI one.

535
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,214
Look at me. You're gonna be all right.
Breathe. One-point-five.

536
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,309
Two.

537
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,388
Two-point-five.

538
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,479
Three! Cabin pressure is stable.
It's okay. You're gonna be okay!

539
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,953
So... you okay?

540
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,532
I'm fine.

541
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,876
What happened out there?

542
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,925
You started screaming, I come
out there, you're on your back.

543
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,975
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me? Over.

544
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,227
Liberty this is Freedom.
Do you read? Over

545
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,489
Uh... Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you read me? Over.

546
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:54,201
- We read you, John. Over.
- I can't raise Liberty, Tommy.

547
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,412
Copy that, Freedom.

548
00:42:55,423 --> 00:42:57,412
We're having the same
issues down here.

549
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,794
Have you tried
switching frequencies?

550
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,171
Well, we've got some
sort of interference.

551
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,630
Could have something
to do with those PSD5s.

552
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,262
Yeah, we've been assured the PSD5s
aren't the source of the problem.

553
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,969
All right, well, why don't we
try to shut down the receivers...

554
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,852
- ... and see what happens?
- Uh... negative.

555
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,981
Well, why not? We got two men
down there, Tommy. Come on.

556
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,395
Tommy?

557
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,315
Tommy, you there?

558
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,948
We're working on the problem,
John. We'll keep you advised.

559
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,611
Oh, you're working on it.
That's great. Great.

560
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,033
Goddamn it.

561
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,702
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

562
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,009
MET: Six days, sixteen hours,
12 minutes.

563
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,545
Post-EVA interview one-alpha
with Commander Walker.

564
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,303
I already told you
everything I remember.

565
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,092
Come on.

566
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,387
I was repairing the S-Band.

567
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,602
I thought I saw something...

568
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,232
I thought I saw something
out of the corner of my eye.

569
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,611
I was wrong.

570
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,532
And then there was
a shrieking noise.

571
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,864
It caught me off guard.
Slipped.

572
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,903
Must have hit a rock.

573
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,914
That's it.

574
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,833
You said something was inside
your helmet. You yelled it.

575
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,556
I don't remember that.

576
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,434
Christ, Nate, you're bleeding.

577
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,144
Look at your shirt.
You're bleeding.

578
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,937
- Jesus Christ!
- Hand me the first aid kit.

579
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,951
You said something
was inside your suit, Nate.

580
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,296
The inside, you said.

581
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,674
You said inside your helmet.

582
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,558
I don't get it.
How did you get that wound?

583
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,520
Now, if there was something in your
suit, then where the hell did it go?

584
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,224
Wait a second.

585
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,395
Nate... look, I can feel it
right... right here.

586
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,780
Oh, man,
there's something inside.

587
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,487
- What are you talkin' about?
- Right here, look.

588
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,369
- It's hard, under the skin.
- Jesus.

589
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,286
I need to get that out, okay?

590
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,835
Yeah, okay, just make it quick.

591
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,459
Just...

592
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,648
It'll be all right.
Hang in there.

593
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:12,914
Okay.

594
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,324
Jesus, it's really in there.
It's like it's moving.

595
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,204
- Get it out. Get it out!
- I got it. I got it. it's coming!

596
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,956
Damn it, Ben!
Get it out!

597
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,919
Hey, are you all right?
You all right?

598
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,751
Hang on.
Hang on.

599
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,461
Hang on.

600
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,301
Put something on it.

601
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,471
Looks like one of my samples.

602
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,852
You said you felt something
moving in your helmet.

603
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,321
I don't understand.
How the hell did this get in...

604
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,115
Goddamn it, you contaminated
the entire ship!

605
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,123
Liberty, do you copy?

606
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,584
Houston, we read you.

607
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,594
Liberty, can you hear us?

608
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,132
Yes, damn it!
Houston, we read you!

609
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,436
Ben, do you copy?

610
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,560
They can't hear us.

611
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,566
Liberty, do you read me?

612
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,372
Those PSD5s...

613
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,967
What if they're not there
for spying on the Russians?

614
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,672
What do you mean?

615
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,509
Look, they told us
that the transmitters...

616
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,144
... would pick up an ALSEP
frequency, but they don't.

617
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,728
They're blocking our comm.
They're emitting a signal.

618
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,109
All right.

619
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,612
But why would they
be doing that?

620
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,659
No, keep filming. Keep filming.
You need to document this.

621
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:37,002
To attract the things that made
the tracks that you saw.

622
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,799
Whatever killed the cosmonaut.

623
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,263
All these cameras, Ben...

624
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,190
... they're watching it.

625
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,815
We're on our own.

626
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,522
We're guinea pigs.

627
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,242
That's why they sent us up here.

628
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,496
We gotta dismantle
those transmitters.

629
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,954
PSD5's destroyed.

630
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,214
There's debris everywhere.

631
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,009
Look at these tracks.

632
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,645
Nate, they were here.

633
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,728
Let's check on the other sites.

634
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,406
Liberty, do you copy?

635
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,076
Liberty, do you copy?

636
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,250
Liberty, this is Houston.
Do you copy?

637
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,802
Something's out here.

638
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,471
It's gone.

639
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,650
Nate, we're too late.

640
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,112
This was a bad idea.

641
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,575
You need to get
your rest, Nate, okay?

642
00:50:25,576 --> 00:50:27,775
We're gonna get
you back to the LM.

643
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,680
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.

644
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,630
It's entered your bloodstream.

645
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:52,308
Previous wound seems to...
have become infected.

646
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,599
Eyes appear extremely bloodshot.

647
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,696
I don't know how to treat this.

648
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,823
Houston, this is Freedom. I haven't
been able to reach Nate or Ben.

649
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,787
Comm is still down
with Liberty.

650
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,404
We have no communication
with the crew...

651
00:51:18,405 --> 00:51:21,204
... but we are receiving
data from the LM.

652
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,715
We're trying to restore comm now.
Stand by, Freedom.

653
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,626
Liberty, this is Houston.

654
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,171
Looks like you can hear us,
but we can't hear you.

655
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,800
We've lost the Westinghouse
and your vitals...

656
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:35,000
... but we're still getting LM data.

657
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,479
We estimate 12 hours left
on your LM life support...

658
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,810
... and the troops are sorting
out the engine problems.

659
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,772
We're doing everything we can.
We're gonna get you home.

660
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:48,240
We're gonna get you home.

661
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,317
They're lying.

662
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,288
No.

663
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,583
No, they'll get us back.

664
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:04,630
They have to get us back.
They want that footage.

665
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,712
- What about the Russian ship?
- That poor Russian bastard.

666
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,140
He was infected, just like me.

667
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,684
I'm getting worse.

668
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,440
Ben.

669
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,982
- You gotta leave me here.
- No.

670
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,162
- No one's leaving anyone.
- You'll have to.

671
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,700
We are not dying up here.

672
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,463
Fate has ordained...

673
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:50,752
... the men who went to
the moon to explore in peace...

674
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,297
... remain on the moon
to rest in peace.

675
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,716
What the hell
are you talking about?

676
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,008
I feel my thoughts...

677
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,228
... fragmenting.

678
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,155
Like I'm being drawn to them.

679
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,862
I'm so tired, Ben.

680
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:26,542
MET: Six days, twenty-two hours,
23 minutes.

681
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,002
IMP Anderson.
Delta reel.

682
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,468
No further communication
from Houston.

683
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,554
Oxygen levels are running low.

684
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,719
Nate's been asleep
for about an hour.

685
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,858
The sickness seems to have
brought on fatigue.

686
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,113
We're not gonna make it here.

687
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,785
If Houston doesn't come up with
a plan in the next couple of hours...

688
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,017
... we'll, uh...

689
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:05,497
We'll abandon Liberty,
head towards the Russian LK.

690
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,668
Their comm and oxygen
are our only hope.

691
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,128
I just pray to God.

692
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,351
Jesus Christ!

693
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,372
Oh, Jesus.

694
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:50,417
Partial laceration, upper left rib.

695
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,292
The infection's spreading.

696
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,294
Oh, goddamn it.

697
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,723
Must have been the same thing
that happened to the Russian.

698
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,271
- The rock... Christ, Nate!
- I'm not gonna let you kill me.

699
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,898
Nate, it's me. Listen to me.
Look at me. It's me, okay?

700
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,606
I'm just trying to help you.
You're getting worse.

701
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,149
Don't ever touch me.

702
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,172
Nate!
Jeez!

703
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,302
What the hell are you doing?

704
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:05,840
- They're everywhere!
- Please, Nate, you'll kill us both!

705
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,384
- Stop watching us!
- No, Nate!

706
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:13,230
They're not gonna
watch me die!

707
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,486
No!

708
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,477
What are you doing?
Stop!

709
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,613
Stop!
Come on, you're...

710
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,067
Nate!

711
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,725
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?

712
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,311
Liberty, this is Freedom.

713
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,369
I don't know
if you can hear me...

714
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,069
... but I'm gonna be
out of comm range soon.

715
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:12,036
Guys, we need to get you out
of there ASAP. Do you copy?

716
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,334
Come on, guys.
Don't make me leave you here.

717
00:58:22,273 --> 00:58:24,251
Freedom, do you read me?

718
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,845
John?

719
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,182
John, can you hear me?

720
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,436
Please, anyone,
can you hear me?

721
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,352
Abandoning Liberty.

722
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,870
- Come on!
- I had to do it.

723
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,376
Take the camera.

724
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,288
We're at 25 percent in the tank.

725
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,709
20 minutes on reserve.
It'll get us there.

726
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,969
I gotta grab the film.

727
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:13,050
The black box for DOD.

728
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,976
We gotta go now.
It's clear.

729
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:35,663
Come on, Nate, let's go.

730
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,547
They're everywhere.

731
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,585
You can't help me.
You're not supposed to be here.

732
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,682
Ben, it's okay.

733
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,311
It's gonna be okay.

734
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,441
We'll make it, okay?
We're gonna make it.

735
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,276
They're waiting for me.

736
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,032
We're not safe here.

737
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,834
- Get rid of me!
- Hang in there!

738
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,620
It's just me they want!
It's just me!

739
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,084
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let me off!

740
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:26,715
Just hang on!

741
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,236
Nate!

742
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,575
Nate!

743
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,417
MET: Unknown.

744
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,255
Rover's been destroyed.

745
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,211
There's no sign
of Commander Walker.

746
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:31,234
American astronaut
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.

747
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,913
Oxygen's getting low.

748
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,457
I'm...

749
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,131
I'm gonna search
for the Russian lander...

750
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,297
... and Commander Walker.

751
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,143
Nate!

752
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,183
Nate!

753
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,990
Get away from me, Ben.
This is where they're coming from.

754
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,575
There's nothing here, okay?
You gotta come with me.

755
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,957
Goddamn it!
We need to get moving!

756
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,706
Ben, listen to me.

757
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,047
We're running
out of time here, please.

758
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,659
You gotta find the LK.

759
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,259
Their systems aren't
that different from ours.

760
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,627
Save yourself.

761
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,839
No, Nate, I'm not going.
You're coming with me.

762
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,508
You have to leave me here.
Just get to John.

763
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:42,847
I'm not leaving here!

764
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,309
You can't help me,
but you can save your...

765
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,597
Nate!

766
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,603
Nate!

767
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,144
Jesus, Nate!
Can you hear me?

768
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,322
Nate, answer me!

769
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,906
Do you hear me?
Say something!

770
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,167
Nate, where are you?

771
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,904
Oh, no, no!
Oh, my God!

772
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,328
No!
Christ!

773
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,713
No!

774
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,800
Oh, no! John, Nate's gone!
Repeat, Nate is gone!

775
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,143
Please!
Can anybody hear me?

776
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:46,224
Oh, come on, come on!
Come on, electricity!

777
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:48,974
Got it!

778
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,898
Come on!

779
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,531
Repress is almost complete.

780
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:28,725
This is American astronaut
Ben Anderson.

781
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,887
Apollo 18.
Do you copy?

782
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,517
This is Apollo 18.
Do you copy?

783
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,909
Anyone, do you copy?

784
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,371
Anyone?
Please, do you copy?

785
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,663
Please, anybody, do you copy?

786
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,051
Shit!

787
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,850
Yes, this is Captain Ben Anderson
of Apollo 18. Do you read me?

788
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:24,940
This is Ben Anderson.
Copy? Anybody?

789
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,279
Anybody?
Please, do you read me?

790
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:35,075
Captain Anderson, this is
the Deputy Secretary of Defense.

791
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,536
What?

792
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:38,836
DOD?
Yes!

793
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,748
Yes, this is Captain
Ben Anderson.

794
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,512
Communicating with
the Russians...

795
01:06:43,513 --> 01:06:46,512
... and they are patching me
through to you.

796
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:51,925
We're aware of your condition,
and we've made a decision.

797
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,352
- We can't bring you home.
- No.

798
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,810
No, no, no.
No, listen to me, please.

799
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,351
Listen, Nate got a cut
on his body, he got infected.

800
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,112
There's nothing on me.
Please, you have to come get me.

801
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:10,322
We can't take the risk.
We can't bring you back to Earth.

802
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:14,331
Please. Please, listen to me,
listen to me. Um...

803
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:18,744
I have a family.
I need my family, please.

804
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:24,299
We'll let your family know
you died a hero.

805
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,634
I'm sorry, Ben.

806
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,939
You gotta get... you get out here!

807
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:35,139
And you'll fucking
pick me up right now!

808
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,726
I did my job! You do your job!
You get me home!

809
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,315
Houston, please.

810
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:54,078
We will stay on this channel
with you, but this decision's final.

811
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:58,492
You've done a great service for
your country, son, and for mankind.

812
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,593
MET...

813
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,429
... remote comm...

814
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:26,940
Astronaut Ryan Anderson, with
his dad, flying through space.

815
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:32,029
- Ryan, what are you doing?
- Just playing, Mom.

816
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,694
Don't play with your dad's stuff.

817
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,910
- Baby, is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad. Love you.

818
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:42,604
Baby, is that recording?

819
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,043
Sorry, Dad.
Love you.

820
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,341
Love you.
Love you.

821
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,298
... Dad.
Love you.

822
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:53,313
Love you.

823
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,188
This is Freedom,
do you read me?

824
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,021
Liberty, this is Freedom.

825
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:15,410
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?

826
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,118
- Liberty, this is Freedom.
- Yes, John, it's Ben. I hear you!

827
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,123
Ben, is that you?
Do you copy?

828
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,456
Yes, John, this is Ben.
I hear you, copy.

829
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:30,004
I got you on the VHF, partner.
Where the hell are you?

830
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,261
- I'm in the LK.
- Yes! Goddamn.

831
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,589
They left me, John.
Left me here!

832
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,929
Where's Nate?
How is he?

833
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,058
He got sick
and he didn't make it.

834
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,600
There's something
down here, John.

835
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,094
And they knew about it.

836
01:09:50,518 --> 01:09:53,194
You hear me?
Those bastards knew about it!

837
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,700
Forget about the DOD, Ben.

838
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,059
Ben, I'm gonna get you
outta there, okay?

839
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,159
You think you can
pilot that thing?

840
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:04,167
- ... pilot that thing?
- I don't have much a choice, do I?

841
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,842
Pilot ails look good, and there's...
there's plenty of fuel.

842
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,627
Okay, buddy, you're not gonna
be able to dock with the CSM...

843
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,717
... so you're gonna need
to get into a synchronized orbit...

844
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:21,134
... and you're gonna need to do
a little spacewalk... step on board.

845
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,302
How does that sound
to you, pal?

846
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,221
Sounds beautiful, Johnny.

847
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,687
Sounds really beautiful.

848
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,109
I don't mean to rush you, partner,
but we are running out of time.

849
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,651
Tick-tock. You get that thing
into orbit, we can rendezvous.

850
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:42,910
I got it!

851
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,164
I got it, John!

852
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,951
Seven... six...

853
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,396
... five...

854
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,541
- Holy shit!
- Open this door.

855
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,631
Nate, you know I can't do that.
Please, you'll kill us both!

856
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,421
- I can't let you in.
- Then I'm coming in.

857
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:02,434
No, no, no, no!
Nate, you'll kill us both! Please!

858
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,469
- What do you mean, Nate?
- Please! Nate!

859
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,434
What do you mean, Nate?
Nate's dead!

860
01:11:06,435 --> 01:11:07,434
Stop!

861
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,480
- Please! Stop!
- What's going on?

862
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,190
- Stop!
- What's going on?

863
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,482
No, Nate, don't do it, please!
Please!

864
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,448
Jesus Christ!
No!

865
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,864
Nate?

866
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:30,203
Nate.
Oh, Christ. Nate!

867
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:37,176
No, no!
No, no, no!

868
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,713
All right, Ben, if you can launch,
you need to do it now!

869
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,007
Our window is almost gone!
You need to launch!

870
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,343
Goddamn it, Ben,
we are cutting it way too close.

871
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,763
Benny, we are going home!

872
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,360
Benny, listen to me now.

873
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,521
We're gonna go home.

874
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,940
You hear me?
We're gonna go home.

875
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,370
I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.

876
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:12,996
I have liftoff.

877
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,961
Freedom, do you read?

878
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,501
This is the Deputy
Secretary of Defense.

879
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,763
Ben has been contaminated.
Do not try to rescue him.

880
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,390
Repeat, you will not recover him.

881
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,182
Contaminated by what?
DOD?

882
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,188
What are you saying?
Where is Tommy?

883
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,476
You will not recover Anderson.
That is a direct order.

884
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,487
I'm on my way.

885
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,874
John, you are ordered to
abort rescue immediately.

886
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,535
Captain Anderson is a high
contamination threat.

887
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,124
You will not recover him.

888
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:57,086
You knew something was down
there and you sent them anyway.

889
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,046
I'm coming home.

890
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:03,804
I'm coming home, Ryan.
I'm coming home.

891
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:08,264
DOD to Freedom, if you do not
abort in T-minus 60 seconds...

892
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,224
... transmission will terminate.

893
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,306
You will not receive
an updated state vector.

894
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,648
You will run out of life support
package. You will not return home.

895
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,115
You have 45 seconds
to abort this rescue.

896
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:27,654
John, we have no choice.
We are begging you, do not do this.

897
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,164
Goddamn it, Benny!

898
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,334
We are going home!

899
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,343
Engine cutoff.
I'm in orbit!

900
01:13:57,315 --> 01:13:58,938
Ben!
Ben!

901
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,523
Forget about me, John.
Get outta here.

902
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,902
Ben, you're coming in too fast.

903
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,833
We're gonna impact!
Slow it down!

904
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:15,969
Ben!

905
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,704
Ben!

906
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:21,628
Ben!

907
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:33,245
We choose to go to the moon in
this decade and do the other things...

908
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:36,908
... not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

909
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:58,638
The voyage of Apollo
dramatized its risk.

910
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:03,560
The men of Apollo
epitomize the character...

911
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:07,196
... that accepts danger
and surmounts it.

912
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:12,819
Theirs is the spirit
that built America.
