1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,230
You are too harsh on me.

2
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,130
Can't you just hug me once?

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,020
Be born again.

4
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,660
I will wait.

5
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:35,280
(Hae Ra)

6
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,550
(Hae Ra)

7
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:08,140
Your call has been forwarded to...

8
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,440
Wine was like a pie in the sky.

9
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:11,480
This time, the chief director...

10
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,810
Why isn't he picking up?

11
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,680
- I'm tired. - Gosh.

12
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,820
But I'm not drunk.

13
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:26,360
Hae Ra.

14
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,400
(Episode 17)

15
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:35,640
Full moon.

16
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:39,170
When the moon is full.

17
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,310
When the moon is full.

18
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,720
What is she trying to say?

19
00:02:58,028 --> 00:02:59,960
I know.

20
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,060
If the ring receives 
a ray of full moon beam,

21
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:05,670
it gains strength to grant your wish.

22
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,010
Boon Yi, what would you like to wish?

23
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,710
Secret.

24
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,850
It is cold. Let us go inside.

25
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,520
Tell me when we go inside.

26
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,690
What is your wish? Let me hear it.

27
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:36,930
My wish is that...

28
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:41,640
you would not receive poison as punishment.

29
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,880
That is a difficult wish to come true.

30
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,550
I asked that...

31
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,580
you would not die...

32
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,990
even if you drank the poison.

33
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,500
Even if you drink the poison...

34
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,970
Whatever comes your way...

35
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,110
I asked that...

36
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,980
you never let go of your life...

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,110
easily.

38
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,190
You wished upon that ring.

39
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,330
Okay. Boon Yi.

40
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,800
I will wear that ring...

41
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:43,100
when I receive poison.

42
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,840
Which finger would fit?

43
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,680
I do not like jokes.

44
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:56,310
I am not joking.

45
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,750
You made an earnest wish upon that ring.

46
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,280
So it should be in contact with my skin.

47
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,350
I will put it in my inside pocket at least,

48
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,590
so I would never die.

49
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,530
Please do not die.

50
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,530
I will not die.

51
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:15,900
Never.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,300
Not ever.

53
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:37,850
I will not die.

54
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,220
Never.

55
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,560
Not ever.

56
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,810
Die in there!

57
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,910
Melt this ring, and make a new blade for this.

58
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:04,180
On the tiger's month, day, and hour,

59
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:08,550
make a knife that is extremely hard and sharp.

60
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,060
What is this?

61
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:57,800
What is this dress?

62
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,100
Answer me!

63
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,970
Baek Hee.

64
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,480
We have to leave.

65
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,350
I...

66
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,350
killed him.

67
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:59,160
Soo Ho. Wake up.

68
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,660
Open your eyes, Soo Ho.

69
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,980
Soo Ho.

70
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:22,680
No. You can't die.

71
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:54,050
Soo Ho.

72
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,420
Please come back.

73
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,590
Please make him come back.

74
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,660
Please save him.

75
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:11,500
Sharon. I brought stuff from Dongdaemun.

76
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:12,800
They're...

77
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:20,810
What happened...

78
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,710
to Mr. Moon?

79
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,450
Call an ambulance.

80
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:30,080
That's Sharon's.

81
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,790
I said call an ambulance!

82
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,660
Sharon.

83
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,660
Sharon. Where are you?

84
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:41,930
- Sharon. Where are you? - Wake up.

85
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,900
Please come back.

86
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:48,170
Please let him live.

87
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:12,960
Charge 200.

88
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:14,700
Clear!

89
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:47,800
Mr. Jung.

90
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:54,500
Soo Ho.

91
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,480
It's been so long.

92
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:06,550
Soo Ho.

93
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,020
You've become a decent, young man.

94
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:14,560
I had so much to talk to you when I met you.

95
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,060
I'm sorry,

96
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:19,890
and thank you.

97
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,630
Hae Ra and I are getting married.

98
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,270
Soo Ho.

99
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,940
Yes?

100
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,140
You...

101
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,010
shouldn't be here. Go back.

102
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,180
Did you forget your promise with Hae Ra?

103
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:44,690
Soo Ho.

104
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:46,590
Soo Ho.

105
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,900
Soo Ho...

106
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,550
His pulse is stable,

107
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,380
so he'll regain his consciousness soon.

108
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:17,820
Let's wait and see.

109
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,660
His heart stopped due to excessive bleeding?

110
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,390
Yes.

111
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Strangely, he didn't have any external injury...

112
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,930
that could've caused excessive bleeding.

113
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:31,300
We did a checkup on him to see if it was a stroke,

114
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,670
but it wasn't.

115
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:35,270
We've never had such a case before.

116
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:38,310
So we need to wait and see his condition first.

117
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,680
What happened?

118
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,180
Are you the one who called the ambulance?

119
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,090
Where was he?

120
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,920
Let's talk outside.

121
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,460
At Sharon Tailor?

122
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,130
I think he came to try on his wedding suit.

123
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,560
What do you mean?

124
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,200
We're supposed to make...

125
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,040
a dress and a suit for your wedding.

126
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,410
What?

127
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,780
You didn't get any call from Sharon, did you?

128
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:17,380
Don't meet her even if she does.

129
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:25,480
When did he ask you...

130
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:26,620
to make them?

131
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:29,860
Mr. Moon didn't ask it himself.

132
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:31,530
Then who...

133
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,930
It was Baek Hee.

134
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:38,170
That was why Mr. Moon said he'd wear it.

135
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,540
Why did she ask such a favor?

136
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,940
I don't know.

137
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:48,540
And...

138
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:52,380
I really don't want to say this...

139
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:59,390
I saw Sharon's silver knife...

140
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:03,290
dropped next to Mr. Moon.

141
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,890
I didn't see it in the ambulance.

142
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,900
When he was down unconscious,

143
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,500
Baek Hee was with him.

144
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,110
Where's she now?

145
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,250
Get changed.

146
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:33,590
I don't want to see you in that.

147
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,030
Are the police looking for me...

148
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:40,930
to arrest me as a murder suspect?

149
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,700
He fortunately saved his life.

150
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,580
He's alive?

151
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:02,950
I am...

152
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,920
giving up on you.

153
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,530
I don't want to see you anymore.

154
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:17,530
Baek Hee.

155
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,440
Leave this country.

156
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,140
Don't think about showing yourself before the two.

157
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,780
Don't you think you're too harsh on me?

158
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,910
Shall I report you to the police...

159
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,880
that a 200-year-old monster...

160
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,790
tried to hurt a person?

161
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,790
You made me this way.

162
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,090
Yes.

163
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,160
Just kill me instead, Sharon.

164
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,930
And have your revenge.

165
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:13,920
What happened?

166
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:15,720
Tell me in detail.

167
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,290
He's a bit hurt.

168
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,760
Don't worry too much. I think he'll recover soon.

169
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,430
Where did he get hurt that he's in the hospital?

170
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,800
He got into a car accident?

171
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,670
He sort of overworked.

172
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,700
He'll recover soon.

173
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,040
Did you call his employees?

174
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,110
Not yet.

175
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,080
I'll go nurse him from tomorrow morning.

176
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:37,580
I'll call you later.

177
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:43,280
Goodness, what's going on?

178
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:47,090
He went to work with a smile on his face earlier.

179
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:49,460
(Sharon Tailor)

180
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:52,890
Hello?

181
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:56,060
Yes, you heard the news.

182
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,070
Right.

183
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,370
He's in Haneul Hospital.

184
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,340
It's okay.

185
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,440
Don't mind me,

186
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,180
and take your time, Hae Ra.

187
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,550
I'm not hungry.

188
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,970
I think he's reacting to sounds.

189
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:41,780
I told you he'll regain his consciousness soon.

190
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,380
I'll check his condition,

191
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,450
so you may stay outside for a bit.

192
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,780
His guardian will arrive soon.

193
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,090
Well, then.

194
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:04,230
Mr. Moon Soo Ho.

195
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,230
Do you hear me?

196
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,000
Move your fingers again.

197
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,040
Good.

198
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:17,510
Open your eyes.

199
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,190
(Dr. Park Ji Yeon)

200
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,260
I told you to be born again.

201
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,210
Soo Ho.

202
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,150
Are you awake?

203
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:36,750
Where am I?

204
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,290
You're in the hospital.

205
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,550
(Haneul Hospital)

206
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,820
Don't worry about me, and get to work.

207
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:13,980
Do you feel pain, or does it ache anywhere?

208
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,220
Not at all.

209
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:16,860
I feel much better than usual.

210
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:21,230
Do you not remember why you came here?

211
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:24,700
I suddenly felt dizzy...

212
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,870
and feverish, so I came to the emergency room.

213
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,000
Yesterday,

214
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,270
it was odd that there was no wound...

215
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,210
even though you bled a lot.

216
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:36,240
I didn't bleed.

217
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:37,810
I walked in here myself.

218
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,980
Do you know where you left your clothes?

219
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:44,490
That's what I don't know.

220
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,650
That's odd.

221
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,620
You'll be late. Get to work.

222
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,060
I'll be fine.

223
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,060
The temperature dropped to minus 16.3°C.

224
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:56,960
I'll call you.

225
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,730
But the wind is less harsh than yesterday.

226
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,970
You can't tell what will happen with the weather.

227
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:05,110
Bye.

228
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,170
But it will stay pretty cold.

229
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:11,380
Other areas may drop to minus 8°C.

230
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,550
Soo Ho.

231
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,450
Forgive me.

232
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,390
For you,

233
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,490
Hae Ra, and Sharon,

234
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:32,070
you must forget about today.

235
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:39,210
What happened last night?

236
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,240
Next news.

237
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,780
The town that was selected for the city revival...

238
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,750
demands the decision to be cancelled.

239
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:50,920
For whom...

240
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,920
are we reviving this town for,

241
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:56,760
and for whom are we preserving this?

242
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,760
The taxpayers' money will be used for this,

243
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:05,130
and people point out that this profits no one.

244
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,200
Do we have to continue this project?

245
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:36,760
She's slacking off right after her promotion.

246
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:37,970
Hae Ra, I mean.

247
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,900
You have to give her a break.

248
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:42,140
Mr. Moon suddenly got hospitalized.

249
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,710
She did send the proposal late in the night.

250
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,970
She sent an email while she was nursing him.

251
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,210
Really? I'll check.

252
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:51,650
Oh, right. Sir.

253
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,080
We're going to go...

254
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,120
and visit Mr. Moon during our lunch time.

255
00:23:56,985 --> 00:23:58,220
- I'll let you go. - Okay.

256
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,690
Only if I like your proposal.

257
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,560
- Come on, you... - Understood?

258
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,730
You clearly told me that yesterday.

259
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:12,300
You saw Sharon's knife, but not in the ambulance.

260
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:13,430
You said...

261
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,470
Baek Hee was there when Soo Ho collapsed.

262
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:16,470
I did?

263
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:18,770
Yes, you did. In front of the emergency room.

264
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:21,170
When did I say that?

265
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,290
Why do you suddenly need your passport?

266
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,230
Something came up.

267
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,400
Please take care of...

268
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:46,100
Sharon Tailor while I'm gone.

269
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,170
You're the owner...

270
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:50,540
and the chief designer for a while.

271
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,810
How long will you be gone for?

272
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:57,980
I don't know.

273
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:01,920
And what happened yesterday?

274
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:07,120
Why was your knife...

275
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:10,060
on the floor next to Mr. Moon?

276
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,390
What happened?

277
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:20,570
Seung Goo.

278
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,140
Come here.

279
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,610
Let me give you a bottle of perfume as a gift.

280
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:42,690
Yesterday,

281
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:46,290
nothing happened, Seung Goo.

282
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,900
Nothing.

283
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,000
Then why were you at the hospital?

284
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,240
Yesterday? I was there because my stomach...

285
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,210
suddenly got upset, and I saw you there.

286
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,970
I got sick after eating a bowl of noodles...

287
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,050
as I shopped for materials in Dongdaemun area.

288
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:16,290
(Blood Test Result, all normal)

289
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,430
I've never seen anyone who recovered so quickly.

290
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:22,600
This is unique.

291
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,470
Any headaches or dizziness?

292
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,000
Not at all.

293
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,800
But let's stay another day and see how you feel.

294
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:31,670
I'm feeling great.

295
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,410
I think I can go home right away.

296
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,380
Then...

297
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:38,750
come back immediately if you feel weird.

298
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,650
I will.

299
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,190
Where did you go last night without telling me?

300
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,530
At my shop.

301
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,170
I saw that you cleaned up everything.

302
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:02,140
Did you get a call...

303
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,800
from the hospital?

304
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,510
Why do you want to know?

305
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,540
You're going to leave soon.

306
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,780
He's...

307
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,280
alive, right?

308
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:23,090
He's not someone you can recklessly hurt.

309
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,190
If you do that again,

310
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,100
I will tell the police.

311
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:31,600
Remember that.

312
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:51,120
Soo Ho...

313
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,790
I have to forget about last night...

314
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:56,060
because of what you just said, correct?

315
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,280
Ms. Choi.

316
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,820
It looks like you were about to run away.

317
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,920
Are you insane?

318
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,560
You lived over 200 years, and you can do magic.

319
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,800
You can go anywhere without that.

320
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:40,700
Do you remember that?

321
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,640
I do remember, but it means nothing.

322
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,910
What's important is that you're a killer.

323
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,290
I came to ask a question.

324
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,930
Did you...

325
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,900
stab Soo Ho yesterday?

326
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,710
Ms. Jang, you know something, don't you?

327
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,080
You're hiding something. Are you not?

328
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:27,610
Seung Goo said...

329
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:30,820
he saw Sharon's knife next to Soo Ho.

330
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,590
Although he said something different today.

331
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,130
Let's go to the police station. We'll talk there.

332
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:00,950
I made them wedding garments.

333
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,520
That means I can probably die now.

334
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:10,960
I...

335
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,600
still don't know what I did wrong.

336
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:15,260
What?

337
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,830
Someone jumped off!

338
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,120
What?

339
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,630
Someone jumped off the bridge!

340
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:25,500
Goodness. Call an ambulance!

341
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,800
Hi. I need an ambulance.

342
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,930
Someone just jumped off a bridge.

343
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,540
Yes, a person jumped into the river.

344
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:45,250
Goodness, Mr. Moon.

345
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:46,480
Are you all right?

346
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,690
Are you okay to be out of the hospital so soon?

347
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,060
I'm fine.

348
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,160
What was wrong?

349
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,830
The hospital misdiagnosed.

350
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:58,100
What's wrong with Hae Ra?

351
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,730
Aunt Sook Hee. Please make her a hot cup of tea.

352
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,040
Okay.

353
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:04,900
Let's go.

354
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,500
That woman...

355
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,110
I hope the police find her.

356
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,780
Right. Get some sleep.

357
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:49,920
I didn't dream it, did I?

358
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,590
You saw what I saw, right?

359
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,890
Don't think about it, Hae Ra.

360
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:58,660
The police will find her.

361
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,050
Have you found the body yet?

362
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:24,150
We haven't found her yet.

363
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,820
We'll keep looking.

364
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,990
Please continue the search.

365
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:35,630
I want you to show the document...

366
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:39,000
and the letter of prayer to Hae Ra.

367
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:41,070
Wouldn't that confuse her?

368
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:43,840
It's up to her to believe it or not.

369
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,870
All right.

370
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,810
Is there something...

371
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,620
you want to tell me?

372
00:33:57,652 --> 00:33:58,820
Sharon...

373
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,490
stabbed you with a knife

374
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,430
I felt your pulse,

375
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,160
so I hid the knife.

376
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:14,970
Why?

377
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,340
To protect the three of you.

378
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,910
Nothing good will come of it,

379
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,710
if the story gets out.

380
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:28,520
So you tried to erase...

381
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:31,820
what happened from my memory.

382
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,960
It doesn't really work with you.

383
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:42,900
Did Choi Seo Rin...

384
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,700
really die?

385
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,570
No.

386
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:49,570
But...

387
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:53,610
you can consider her as dead.

388
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:58,980
Because she won't come between you two anymore.

389
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,020
She had...

390
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:08,390
jumped into the river twice before.

391
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,270
After 30 years.

392
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,280
And after 50 years...

393
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,990
She came back.

394
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:07,710
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

395
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,520
Mr. Moon. You've been busy lately, haven't you?

396
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,450
No, because my business isn't going well.

397
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:16,190
Still...

398
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,730
I feel a good vibe.

399
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,630
Everything will work out.

400
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:22,430
Since it's been a while,

401
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,160
let's do just 10 first.

402
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,140
One.

403
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,210
Two.

404
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:36,310
96.

405
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,380
97.

406
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,420
98.

407
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,620
99.

408
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,860
100. Mr. Moon, you can stop now.

409
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:58,000
Mr. Moon, have you been eating healthy food?

410
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,510
Our stocks are crazy.

411
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:13,110
Amazing.

412
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,920
Mr. Moon.

413
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:21,180
Good morning.

414
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:22,520
Yes, good morning.

415
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:26,130
Mr. Moon, it's really strange.

416
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:27,460
What is?

417
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:30,430
The Jinju stock you recommend...

418
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:32,630
has been going up for four days straight.

419
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,900
Thank you, Mr. Moon.

420
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:40,310
Did you know A2 Group was going to be taken over?

421
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:42,810
No. I recommended it...

422
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,640
because the company seemed reliable.

423
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,380
Be careful since it can be a strategy.

424
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:49,720
Also,

425
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:52,690
the Red Techno stocks you told me to sell,

426
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,560
the value went down as soon as I sold it.

427
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,290
Do you have a sixth sense or something?

428
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,700
After you arrive,

429
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,330
it'd be good to take a rest...

430
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,200
before going to dinner, right?

431
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,370
Sure.

432
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,170
- Of course. - Of course.

433
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,100
Relax in your hotel room for a little bit.

434
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:16,040
Get changed into nice clothes.

435
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,210
Fix your makeup too.

436
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,410
I bought new clothes.

437
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:21,880
We'll have to put on a nice lipstick.

438
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,580
There are 55 of us,

439
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,520
but you planned the itinerary so well.

440
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:30,120
I think you're the best in Korea.

441
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:31,690
No, you're the best in Asia.

442
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:33,020
Isn't she the best in the world?

443
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:35,060
- You're right. - Thank you.

444
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:38,360
Thank you. Thank you for your compliment.

445
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:49,680
Hae Ra.

446
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,880
Do I look any different?

447
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,950
No. Why do you ask?

448
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,180
I think I'm feeling better,

449
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:58,410
and I've gained more muscles too.

450
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,690
That's good.

451
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,260
Also...

452
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:05,630
Never mind.

453
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:07,960
What is it?

454
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:10,530
I recommended a stock to my employees,

455
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:12,130
and that hit the jackpot.

456
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:15,570
Don't do such things. It's dangerous.

457
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:17,500
I told them not to.

458
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:18,940
I just thought it was interesting.

459
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,780
I'm meeting Ms. Jang this evening.

460
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:25,340
She asked to have dinner with me.

461
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:27,350
Okay. Have a good time.

462
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:32,920
I can trust her, right?

463
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,320
I trust her.

464
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,540
Why did you want to see me?

465
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,280
I had a dream.

466
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:01,910
I was on top of a shiny building,

467
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:06,020
and I looked down...

468
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,420
at the streets of Seoul.

469
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:10,690
It's a dream about falling.

470
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:12,190
Be careful.

471
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:18,870
Let me...

472
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:23,840
meet with Seo Rin.

473
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,280
You two are so similar.

474
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:34,080
You have crazy obsessions.

475
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,620
Where is Seo Rin?

476
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,120
She's dead.

477
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:48,230
Seo Rin doesn't get old, and she never dies.

478
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:51,900
Find her if you can.

479
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,670
I'm curious too.

480
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:02,070
Seo Rin.

481
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,480
I loved her so much.

482
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:09,980
Even if he manages...

483
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:12,420
to escape from the lab fire case,

484
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:14,950
There are many ways to corner him...

485
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:17,390
like preferential loan and embezzlement.

486
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,360
We have to put him in jail for the fire case.

487
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:22,530
Don't worry. Things will work out well.

488
00:41:23,798 --> 00:41:24,900
Okay.

489
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:30,940
Mr. Yoon cannot be reached.

490
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,580
You suspect us...

491
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,120
whenever something happens.

492
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:47,690
No, I really don't know anything.

493
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:57,130
Give Yoon Dal Hong his land back already.

494
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:58,790
Dad.

495
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:01,270
Don't ever see him again.

496
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:03,400
Don't be curious...

497
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,840
about his whereabouts either if he disappears.

498
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:27,730
Young Mi.

499
00:42:30,932 --> 00:42:32,260
We need to talk.

500
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:37,170
Hye Young, can you clean up the second floor first?

501
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:39,410
Okay.

502
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,840
Speak.

503
00:42:55,423 --> 00:42:56,920
Tell me honestly...

504
00:42:58,459 --> 00:42:59,860
about what you know.

505
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:02,330
I know nothing.

506
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:06,570
You said my father set a fire to the lab...

507
00:43:07,702 --> 00:43:10,100
and killed Hae Ra's father.

508
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:11,600
You wanted to break up with me,

509
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:13,110
so I made up a story out of anger.

510
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:15,910
I told you it was a lie.

511
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:17,280
My father is a pathetic man...

512
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:23,150
who became evil because he was ignorant.

513
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:26,650
Help him stop from becoming more evil.

514
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:30,190
Did anything else happen that I don't know of?

515
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,130
Tell me.

516
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,730
Tell me what you know.

517
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,600
- Drink it. - You know I hung out...

518
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:49,770
with delinquents for a while, right?

519
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,780
- Will we become men too? - Goodness.

520
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,550
I want to pee.

521
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,810
Here. Do it here.

522
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:59,250
- Here. - Hey, I'm sophisticated.

523
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:01,180
Sophisticated, my foot.

524
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:04,060
You think you're a noble woman or what?

525
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,790
- Gosh, it's cold. - Drink up.

526
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:06,860
I won't.

527
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,720
You set a fire on the lab, didn't you?

528
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,460
How could you do that?

529
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,000
Don't accuse an innocent man.

530
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,030
Let's go to the police. Let's talk there.

531
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,200
Are you all innocent?

532
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:19,370
You snuck out Doctor Moon's research paper...

533
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:20,910
to earn money.

534
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:25,010
You'll be the first to be suspected.

535
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:26,980
And I'll take the responsibility for it.

536
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,550
I'm prepared.

537
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:33,620
So you earned enough money, is that right?

538
00:44:33,621 --> 00:44:35,180
I can't let it slide.

539
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:38,160
You may kill me too in the future.

540
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:40,290
Right.

541
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:44,860
You two always treated me like I'm the bad one.

542
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:48,670
You're twisted out of inferior complex.

543
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,670
Inferior complex?

544
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,880
You punk. You're insane.

545
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:57,380
You jerk.

546
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,400
Hey...

547
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,430
Hey, get up.

548
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,250
And...

549
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:38,280
he carried Hae Ra's father on his back...

550
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,290
and got on his car.

551
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,590
I thought he was going to a hospital.

552
00:45:48,863 --> 00:45:51,400
But I heard a different story later.

553
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,570
Why didn't you tell others then?

554
00:45:58,072 --> 00:46:00,270
Because of Park Gon,

555
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:01,710
the class president of Hanguk Middle School.

556
00:46:03,878 --> 00:46:05,440
I kept silent because of you.

557
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:10,250
Your family moved to an expensive apartment.

558
00:46:11,252 --> 00:46:12,650
You got a new car.

559
00:46:13,254 --> 00:46:15,520
I liked seeing you live a better life.

560
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:18,920
Young Mi.

561
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,130
I lied to Hae Ra...

562
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:25,870
that my parents...

563
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,570
checked how he died in the hospital.

564
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:36,980
Until now,

565
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,610
we've made it without any problem.

566
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,420
No one knows about it.

567
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:48,590
Let's keep it a secret between me and you.

568
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,980
It's surprising...

569
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:18,020
that your story was found in the grave.

570
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,490
But I don't believe in a past life.

571
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:26,160
It doesn't matter even if you don't believe it.

572
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:29,800
But it's true that such things happened...

573
00:47:30,231 --> 00:47:31,560
in the past.

574
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,070
If your story is all true,

575
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,310
and Choi Seo Rin is an immortal being,

576
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:46,450
then she'll appear again.

577
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:49,920
Maybe when you two...

578
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:53,690
become a happy old couple.

579
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:57,420
If she appears before my eyes again,

580
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:02,360
I think I'll be able to believe in all this story.

581
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,300
When you're upset or confused,

582
00:48:07,768 --> 00:48:09,570
tell me anytime.

583
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:14,170
Is Sharon Tailor...

584
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:16,780
still closed?

585
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:20,050
Seung Goo is working hard to run it.

586
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:21,980
Pay a visit some time,

587
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,620
and keep him company.

588
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:25,820
He must be lonely.

589
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,560
Okay, I'll visit there one day.

590
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:30,020
Stop it.

591
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,050
Did you talk with her all right?

592
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:35,550
Yes.

593
00:50:35,983 --> 00:50:37,150
But...

594
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,590
I don't believe in the old story.

595
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,650
Then don't.

596
00:50:42,322 --> 00:50:43,460
But...

597
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,330
I think it's true that we're meant to be.

598
00:50:49,663 --> 00:50:50,730
Hae Ra.

599
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:52,970
Do you know what my dream is?

600
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:54,570
What is it?

601
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,010
To grow old with you like them.

602
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,640
Is that all?

603
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:08,410
That's all.

604
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:13,390
That's very simple.

605
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:17,290
Let's make our wedding pictures...

606
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:19,830
look really great and wonderful.

607
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,330
Okay.

608
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:25,460
Let's live a happy and healthy life.

609
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:29,070
Let us do that.

610
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:43,650
Hey, stop the car.

611
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:49,490
- Did you see that? - What?

612
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:53,330
This is Lee Hyun Sik of patrol car three.

613
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,220
Was there any other suicide report?

614
00:51:55,229 --> 00:51:57,860
None. There has been no other suicide today.

615
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:00,670
That's odd.

616
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:01,970
What is it?

617
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:05,700
I just saw a woman's head right above the water.

618
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,100
What are you talking about?

619
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,170
Han River is completely frozen today.

620
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:11,880
Let's go.

621
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:13,080
Okay.

622
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:42,670
Hey, Sharon!

623
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:57,920
I got confused for a second.

624
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:02,490
You must miss her a lot.

625
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,800
No, I don't.

626
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,070
I was going to brag about my new design.

627
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:11,770
Seung Goo.

628
00:53:12,673 --> 00:53:14,270
For the next 30 years,

629
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:17,780
no, maybe 50 years,

630
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:23,520
can you keep this place as good as today?

631
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:25,680
Is Sharon...

632
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,020
gone for good?

633
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:30,060
I don't know either.

634
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,390
No.

635
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,360
I don't think I can.

636
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:43,040
If she doesn't come back,

637
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,170
I'm going to ruin this place and sell it off.

638
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:02,950
Sharon.

639
00:54:05,726 --> 00:54:06,860
I guess...

640
00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:11,900
there is someone that misses you.

641
00:54:14,901 --> 00:54:16,070
Father.

642
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:17,540
Mother.

643
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:21,040
I am here. It is me, Seo Rin.

644
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:23,580
Please come out.

645
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,050
I am here.

646
00:54:27,314 --> 00:54:28,410
Yes.

647
00:54:28,649 --> 00:54:29,950
Father.

648
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:32,780
There used to be people that loved you.

649
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:40,590
Once you graduate from dressmaking school,

650
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,730
let's return to Joseon.

651
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:45,930
I'm sure everyone who remembers us...

652
00:54:45,932 --> 00:54:48,230
are all long gone.

653
00:54:48,302 --> 00:54:50,270
How long do you think we'll live like this?

654
00:54:50,771 --> 00:54:52,840
One day, when you meet Boon Yi,

655
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,910
make her some clothes.

656
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:57,110
Can people really be born again?

657
00:54:58,578 --> 00:55:00,250
People who lived a great life...

658
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:02,650
or a very wicked life...

659
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,580
probably don't.

660
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:06,720
But...

661
00:55:07,254 --> 00:55:08,850
those who left...

662
00:55:08,855 --> 00:55:10,920
with great sorrow and regret...

663
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:12,260
may get...

664
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:14,930
one more chance by fate.

665
00:55:15,862 --> 00:55:17,300
How do you know?

666
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,300
If not, then never mind.

667
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:21,930
I don't want to make any clothes.

668
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:24,300
The only two things you are good at are...

669
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:25,730
making yourself look pretty...

670
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,810
and getting jealous.

671
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:29,540
Make use of that.

672
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,280
Let's go play mah-jong.

673
00:55:32,879 --> 00:55:34,080
Go study.

674
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,620
It's just for today.

675
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:39,380
Let's go.

676
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:48,290
I don't know where you are,

677
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:53,200
but atone for everything you did there,

678
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,300
and never return.

679
00:56:02,142 --> 00:56:03,580
Baek Hee.

680
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,130
Can you get some forks?

681
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:31,200
Did you two hold a photo exhibit yesterday?

682
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,140
I put them up. I'll take them down.

683
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,640
They look great. Leave them up.

684
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,070
Don't take them down.

685
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,010
Are you going to the construction site later?

686
00:56:38,011 --> 00:56:39,470
Yes, after I stop by my office.

687
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,810
Then can you drop me off at the subway station?

688
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:43,520
It's the weekend. Do you want to come?

689
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:44,750
Should I?

690
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:46,320
I'll call you later.

691
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:48,190
Do you want some milk?

692
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,130
What was that?

693
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:33,300
Are the lights changing just for you?

694
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,470
What?

695
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:36,670
I guess so.

696
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,730
Sharon will be surprised to see this.

697
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,740
I have a feeling...

698
00:58:11,037 --> 00:58:13,240
that she will come back in May.

699
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,310
She likes roses.

700
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,420
Who is it?

701
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:31,520
Hae Ra.

702
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:36,560
Goodness, you're so awful.

703
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:38,160
I haven't seen you in ages.

704
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:40,100
I'll visit from time to time.

705
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,930
Everything looks the same.

706
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:44,740
I'm going to leave it as it is...

707
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:46,340
until Sharon returns.

708
00:58:46,373 --> 00:58:48,210
When will she come back?

709
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:49,770
Baek Hee said...

710
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:52,840
she'll be back in 30 or 50 years.

711
00:58:53,313 --> 00:58:54,410
But who knows?

712
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,480
I came to return this.

713
00:59:03,523 --> 00:59:04,620
What?

714
00:59:14,067 --> 00:59:15,500
After I put this on,

715
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:18,200
I went through a series of odd events.

716
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:23,210
It was a turning point in my life.

717
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,540
Anyway, I became happy.

718
00:59:25,612 --> 00:59:27,050
This is a very special coat,

719
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:28,950
so I want to return it.

720
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,150
Really?

721
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,280
Did your life change...

722
00:59:32,352 --> 00:59:34,320
after you put this on?

723
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:35,590
Yes.

724
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,090
I'm thankful for the coat,

725
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:44,300
but I'm also scared of it.

726
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:30,440
Yes, dark brown.

727
01:00:31,111 --> 01:00:33,380
Seung Goo, I'm leaving.

728
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,310
One second.

729
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:37,150
Have a cup of tea before you leave.

730
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:39,950
Then I'll tell Soo Ho to come here.

731
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:41,590
We have to be somewhere later.

732
01:00:41,755 --> 01:00:43,190
That'd be wonderful.

733
01:00:44,157 --> 01:00:46,690
Yes. Hello? Yes.

734
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,420
Who are you?

735
01:02:02,068 --> 01:02:04,440
(Black Knight - The Man Who Guards Me)

736
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:06,370
I think she's pretending not to know me.

737
01:02:06,372 --> 01:02:07,770
I came back very soon this time, right?

738
01:02:07,774 --> 01:02:08,900
You don't remember?

739
01:02:08,908 --> 01:02:10,370
The chic Sharon style.

740
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:11,710
She's back.

741
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,240
I'm marrying Soo Ho.

742
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,080
My employees prepared this.

743
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:16,340
How about champagne?

744
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:19,420
Let's stop. Please!

745
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:21,520
I'm a son of a criminal.

746
01:02:21,521 --> 01:02:23,520
Hae Ra said she'd work...

747
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:25,620
in the office in Rome for two years.

748
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,360
I don't want you to go.

749
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,090
All I need is you.

750
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:30,860
This isn't a dream, is it?
