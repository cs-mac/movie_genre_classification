00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:43,246
Mitchell: The media is
the message and the messenger

3
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:46,310
and, increasingly,
a powerful one.

4
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:50,056
Katz:
People learn more from media

5
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,616
than any other single source
of information,

6
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:53,854
so if we want to understand

7
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:56,227
what's going on in our society
in the 21st century,

8
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:57,993
we have to understand media.

9
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,626
Steyer: If you think about
media and technology,

10
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:03,796
they're delivering content
that is shaping our society.

11
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,328
They're shaping our politics.

12
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:06,601
They're shaping
our national discourse.

13
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,768
And most of all, they're shaping

14
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:11,074
our children's brains
and lives and emotions.

15
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,171
Mayer: We estimate
that there's somewhere north

16
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:15,944
of a billion people who use
the internet every single day.

17
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:18,178
That's just a reach
that hasn't existed before

18
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:19,982
in terms of media.

19
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,354
Steyer: Our kids today
live on Facebook and cellphones.

20
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,359
The diversity
of the platforms means

21
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,793
that those images
are impacting your kid 2417

22
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:30,525
and whatever restrictions
existed when we were growing up

23
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:31,759
simply don't exist today.

24
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:35,132
Kilbourne: Girls get the message
from very early on

25
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:38,001
that what's most important
is how they look,

26
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:40,337
that their value, their worth,
depends on that.

27
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:42,467
And boys get the message

28
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:44,375
that this is what's important
about girls.

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,539
We get it from advertising.
We get it from films.

30
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,517
We get it from television shows,
video games, everywhere we look.

31
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,349
So, no matter what else
a woman does,

32
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,355
now matter what else
her achievements,

33
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:59,154
their value still depends on
how they look.

34
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,822
There is no appreciation
for women intellectuals.

35
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,492
It's all about the body,
not about the brain.

36
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,593
You all saw the famous photo
from the weekend

37
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,626
of Hillary looking so haggard

38
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,639
and, what,
looking like 92 years old.

39
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,971
Breast implants...
did you have them or not'?

40
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:17,534
Because that's all over
the internet about you

41
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:18,704
in mainstream media.

42
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:21,180
I think if you waterboarded
Nancy Pelosi,

43
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:22,910
she wouldn't admit
to plastic surgery.

44
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:27,887
Pozner: The fact that media are
so limiting and so derogatory

45
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,153
to the most powerful women
in the country,

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,592
then what does it say
about media's ability

47
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:36,495
to take any woman in america
seriously'?

48
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,192
The media treats women
like shit,

49
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,893
and it's horrible,
and it's, like...

50
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:41,265
I don't know how we survive it

51
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,894
I don't know
how we rise above it.

00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,200
Siebel Newsom:
There are moments in life

79
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,733
when you begin to see things
more clearly.

80
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:34,111
When I found out
I was pregnant with a girl,

81
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:36,742
everything came into focus.

82
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,211
But I looked around me,

83
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:42,620
and I was really frightened
for her.

84
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:45,785
I couldn't imagine
that my daughter could grow up

85
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:49,023
to be emotionally healthy
and fulfilled

86
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,053
given our modern culture.

87
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:55,000
So I'm compelled to make sense
of all of this for her.

88
00:05:55,024 --> 00:06:00,030
And I know I have to start
by looking at my own life...

89
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:04,306
the mistakes I've made
and the traps I've fallen into.

90
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,746
Because even though
I've had many privileges,

91
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,579
I haven't been immune

92
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:14,145
to the damage our culture does
to women and girls.

93
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,452
When I was a young girl,

94
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,515
I felt secure
in my place in the world.

95
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:24,896
But as with most girls,
things changed as I got older.

96
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,391
A few days before
my 7th birthday,

97
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:33,635
my older sister Stacy died
in an accident.

98
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:36,609
I blamed myself for her death,

99
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:39,613
and out of guilt and sadness,

100
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:44,744
I tried to be two daughters
instead of one.

101
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,753
I channeled my pain

102
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:50,222
into excelling in sports
and school.

103
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:55,854
But no matter how hard I tried
I somehow felt inadequate.

104
00:06:55,884 --> 00:07:00,196
I became increasingly
susceptible to peer pressure

105
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:02,498
and the bombardment
of media messages

106
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,664
telling me that being strong,
smart, and accomplished

107
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:07,731
was not enough.

108
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:10,369
To be a woman
meant constantly striving

109
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,073
for an unattainable ideal
of beauty

110
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:16,640
and approval in the eyes of men.

111
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:20,142
So when a trusted peer
and, later, a coach

112
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:23,850
preyed upon my vulnerability
and violated me,

113
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,988
I was so frightened and ashamed
I completely shut down.

114
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:32,055
My self-worth
was at an all-time low

115
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,124
and I developed
an eating disorder

116
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:38,502
that consumed
two years of my life.

117
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,768
It took a lot of love
and support

118
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:43,640
for me to find
my strength again.

119
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:46,544
And although my experiences
are unique,

120
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:50,015
my struggle is all too common.

121
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:52,985
It's always hard
being a teenage girl,

122
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:55,010
but now the media disseminates

123
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:57,489
such limiting portrayals
of women

124
00:07:57,513 --> 00:08:00,494
and pervades
every aspect of our culture.

125
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:04,623
Is it any wonder teen girls feel
more powerless than ever'?

126
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,386
I want a different world

127
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,421
for my daughter
and her generation.

128
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,593
But a lot has to change first.

129
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,368
We see so much in the media

130
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:48,432
that there's so much negativity
towards women

131
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,340
and their weight
and how they look,

132
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:53,073
and it's just a representation
of the pressure we feel

133
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,172
to conform to man's ideals.

134
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:58,617
There's this concept
of the perfect woman

135
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,813
who looks this certain way,

136
00:09:00,843 --> 00:09:02,686
and because women
may not look that way,

137
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,088
they're scrutinized.

138
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:07,116
I remember fifth grade,
I was worrying about my weight.

139
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,150
And now I'm in ninth grade.

140
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,560
I'm still worrying about
my weight.

141
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:11,394
Me being a small person,

142
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,458
like, at my old school,
I was told to, like, go throw up

143
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:16,628
[voice breaking]
or, like, go eat a hamburger

144
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:18,865
because people thought I was
like, anorexic or something.

145
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:22,967
So I would, like, eat a lot
so that people would think

146
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,239
that I didn't have
an eating disorder.

147
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:28,214
I straighten my hair
just so I can fit in

148
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:30,410
when I have
naturally curly hair.

149
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:34,785
I have close friends that,
like, in between break periods,

150
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,312
they will go to the bathroom

151
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,382
and put on like 10 pounds
of make-up

152
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:39,915
and, you know, comb their hair

153
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,928
and do all this pampering
you know,

154
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,395
and you're at school to learn.

155
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,091
When is it gonna be enough'?

156
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
'Cause, you know, I have
a younger sister, and, like.

157
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:50,604

00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,864
Kilbourne:
The ideal image of beauty

160
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:23,529
is more extreme and impossible
than ever before.

161
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:26,038
In the old days,
the perfection was achieved

162
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:28,041
through cosmetics
and airbrushing,

163
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:29,599
but now it's possible

164
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:32,544
for that image to be
absolutely perfect

165
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:33,841
because of computers.

166
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:35,473
[camera shutter clicking]

167
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:38,348
You never see the photograph
of a woman considered beautiful

168
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,148
that hasn't been
digitally altered

169
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:43,213
to make her absolutely,
inhumanly perfect.

170
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,816
Girls are being encouraged
to achieve that ideal

171
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:48,157
at younger and younger ages
all the time.

172
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:52,188
They end up measuring themselves
against an impossible standard

173
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,758
and feeling themselves wanting
as a result of it.

174
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,600
Also, not surprisingly,

175
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:00,505
young men who are shown lots
of photographs of supermodels

176
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,601
then judge real women
much more harshly.

177
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,203
The most important thing
to understand

178
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:09,374
about all of these images
and how they affect us

179
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:11,884
is that the effect
is primarily subconscious

180
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,477
and that it is very harmful

181
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:16,921
but that for the most part,
we're not really aware of that,

182
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:19,084
which is why we need to
pay conscious attention

183
00:11:19,114 --> 00:11:20,616
to these images.

184
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,960
The average child develops
over 18 to 24 years,

185
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,159
and full brain development
doesn't really occur

186
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:27,826
until you're
into your early 20s.

187
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:32,066
So the idea that kids
at 8 or 10 or 15

188
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:33,539
have the same level

189
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:37,339
of intellectual and emotional
maturity as an adult is nuts.

190
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,243
They have different
interpretive abilities,

191
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,042
they have different
emotional abilities,

192
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,549
and they're a much more
vulnerable class in society.

193
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:48,749
I worry about, you know, how
much pressure my daughters feel

194
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:51,690
in a society that features

195
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:56,492
anorexic actresses and models
and television stars.

196
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,054
We get conditioned to think

197
00:11:58,086 --> 00:11:59,997
this is what
women should look like,

198
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:04,698
so even people
of average weight and size

199
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:07,536
have body dysmorphic disorder.

200
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:10,839
When I did my first television
show, "All-American Girl,"

201
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:13,437
which was the first
Asian-American family show

202
00:12:13,468 --> 00:12:14,503
on television,

203
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,641
I had a lot of problems
with the network

204
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:19,584
because they were constantly
telling me that I was too fat.

205
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,986
You know, I became very anorexic

206
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,755
trying to somehow keep this job
that I really wanted to keep,

207
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:29,763
and they ended up canceling
the television show,

208
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:32,197
and they replaced it
with Drew Carey

209
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,131
'cause he's so thin.

210
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,435
An aspect
of media-literacy education

211
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:43,340
that I think
many people aren't aware of

212
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:45,402
is the whole political economy
of the media.

213
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:51,710
Most media get their revenues
from advertising, you know'?

214
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,050
So the non-advertising content
of these media

215
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,578
has to support the advertising.

216
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,217
Everybody needs to learn
what the media's really about.

217
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:00,624
It's really, like, about

218
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,425
how they want you to be
something that you're not.

219
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:06,865
A lot of advertising is based on
making people feel anxious

220
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:08,231
and feeling insecure.

221
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:11,499
For men, there's a lot of
anxiety around status and power

222
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:13,665
and wanting to look as if
you have power...

223
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:16,574
at least drive a powerful car.

224
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:19,579
For women, that you're never
beautiful enough,

225
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,046
Durham:
Which is why you keep seeing

226
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:22,776
these same body types
over and over and over again.

227
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:24,806
Because those are the body types

228
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,150
that generate the purchase
of all these beauty products

229
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,155
in this futile pursuit
of this idealized body.

230
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:32,021
It's a hugely profitable pursuit
for these media industries

231
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,526
and for all of the advertisers.

232
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,838
American women end up spending
much more money on beauty

233
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:49,365
and the pursuit of these ideals
and these myths

234
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:50,774
than on their own education

235
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,710
which, in fact, would benefit
them more in the long run.

236
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:55,078
And so, under this rhetoric
of empowerment,

237
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,606
it's completely
disempovvering women.

238
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:26,971
Kilbourne: Not only are girls
seen as objects by other people,

239
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:29,141
they learn to see themselves
as objects.

240
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,152
Heidman: The American
Psychological Association

241
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:33,744
has found in recent years

242
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,949
that self-objectification
has become a national epidemic,

243
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:39,822
a national problem.

244
00:14:39,848 --> 00:14:43,660
The more women and girls
self-objectify,

245
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,824
the more likely they are
to be depressed,

246
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,527
to have eating disorders.

247
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:50,594
They have lower confidence.
They have lower ambition.

248
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,662
They have lower
cognitive functioning.

249
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:55,140
They have lower GPAs.

250
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:57,666
How does this connect
to women in leadership?

251
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,305
Women who are
high self-objectifiers

252
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,337
have lower political efficacy.

253
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,077
Political efficacy is the idea

254
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,278
that your voice matters
in politics

255
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:09,152
and that you can bring about
change in politics.

256
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:11,919
So if we have a whole generation
of young people

257
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:14,393
being raised where
woman's objectification

258
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,863
is just par for the course,
it's normal, it's okay,

259
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,456
we have a whole generation
of women

260
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,125
who are less likely
to run for office

261
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:23,432
and less likely to vote.

262
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:30,231
Siebel Newsom:
This is dangerous business.

263
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:32,768
If the media
is sending girls the message

264
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,179
that their value lies
in their bodies,

265
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:38,582
this can only leave them
feeling disempovvered

266
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,451
and distract them
from making a difference

267
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,080
and becoming leaders.

268
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:13,308
Mitchell: Here we are...

269
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:16,288
this massively powerful
democratic society,

270
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:19,622
and we are not modeling
for the rest of the world

271
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,650
a better balance.

272
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:39,646
Newsom:
If people knew that Cuba,

273
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,773
China, Iraq, and Afghanistan

274
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:43,476
have more women in government

275
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,610
than the United States
of America,

276
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,642
that would get
some people upset.

277
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:50,122
No wonder we are in such trouble
in this country.

278
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:52,352
We've been choosing
our national leadership

279
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,486
from 6% of the country.

280
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,997
Lawless:
Without more women in politics,

281
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:03,400
we just don't really have
democratic legitimacy.

282
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,268
Something looks
fundamentally wrong

283
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:06,829
with our political institutions.

284
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,465
We're shortchanging voices

285
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:11,102
that are urgently needed
in public forums

286
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:12,873
from ever getting to the table.

287
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,881
Washington is still pretty male,

288
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:17,509
and it was not unusual
to go into a room

289
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,849
and be the only woman
in the room.

290
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,353
Sometimes, it mattered.

291
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,846
When there was an attempt
to change Title IX

292
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:28,190
and some pressure
from Capitol Hill about that,

293
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:31,095
I can remember Karen Hughes
and I going to the President

294
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,760
and saying, "You can't do that
because you don't know"

295
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:39,295
"what it was like to be a woman
in college prior to Title IX,"

296
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,897
when you had to ha a bake sale

297
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,467
"to get your sports team
to take a trip."

298
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,241
If you have any kind
of a decision-making board

299
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,771
and there are not any women
on that board,

300
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,875
they're going to make
the wrong decisions,

301
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,386
because they don't have
the woman's perspective,

302
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:57,322
the woman's insight,
the woman's experience.

303
00:17:57,345 --> 00:18:01,122
It's an absolute scandal
that America's women

304
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:06,895
continue to earn just <i>77</i> cents
for every dollar men earn.

305
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:10,300
In nine states
and the District of Columbia,

306
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:13,431
women who are victims
of domestic abuse,

307
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:15,566
who've been victims
of domestic abuse,

308
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,474
can be denied
healthcare coverage

309
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:18,807
because domestic abuse

310
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,404
can be considered
a pre-existing condition.

311
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:23,211
We go to the ladies room...

312
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:26,378
the Republican women
and the Democratic women...

313
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:29,218
and we just roll our eyes
at what's being said out there.

314
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:30,621
And the Republican women said,

315
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,818
when we were fighting over
the healthcare bill,

316
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,349
"if we sent the men home,

317
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:36,055
we could get this done
this week."

318
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:39,395
[ laughter,
cheers and applause]

319
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:43,062
The United States is the only
major industrialized nation

320
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,798
without paid family leave.

321
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,136
If women didn't speak up
on these issues

322
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:49,164
and didn't become
front-and-center

323
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:51,677
on making sure they were
on the front burner

324
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,236
of the legislative agenda,
they simply wouldn't happen.

325
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,715
I feel if it wasn't us,
who would do it'?

326
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,684
Women have been
actually creating

327
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,617
the best public policy
in America

328
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:03,145
in every state and community
of this country.

329
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:06,387
The living-wage campaigns,
micro-enterprise, safety...

330
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:08,394
everything that needed
different thinking,

331
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,622
women have been doing it.

332
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,756
So we got to get them
in the tables of power.

333
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,493
Well, two things have to happen

334
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,297
when you talk about women
moving to the next rung

335
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,429
or minorities moving
to the next rung.

336
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,565
First, you have to have
the candidates.

337
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:22,905
You have to have people
who are in the pools

338
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:24,933
from which these positions
are drawn.

339
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,377
But you also have to have

340
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:28,574
a kind of
psychological breakthrough.

341
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:33,382
Can an American see a woman
or an African-American

342
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:34,910
in that position'?

343
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:40,256
Now, I think with women
we still have a bit to go.

344
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:44,093
Siebel Newsom: I knew these obstacles
still existed for my generation,

345
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,826
but I wanted to find out
if things were any better

346
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:49,597
for young women
seeking leadership positions,

347
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,366
so I spent time with
an exceptional young woman

348
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:53,872
named Devanshi Patel,

349
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:57,138
who aspires to have a career
in public service.

350
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:59,145
Well, welcome to bill hearing.

351
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,272
Tonight is
the bill hearing night

352
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:04,681
for the Central Silicon Valley YMCA
Youth & Government Delegation.

353
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:07,778
So, the first time I ran
for public office

354
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,311
was in fourth grade.

355
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:11,346
My parents worked with me.

356
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,859
We made all these fliers with
all these cure little slogans,

357
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,691
and we campaigned
all over the school.

358
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:19,995
And I was actually the runner-up
by a handful of votes.

359
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:23,195
I think everyone is born with
something that they have to do,

360
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,532
and for me, this was it.

361
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,833
Every time
that I could run for something,

362
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,533
I didn't run for anything less.

363
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,633
I didn't run for Vice President or Treasurer.
I ran for President.

364
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:32,304
Ranna: I asked her one day...
I think it was in fifth grade.

365
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,870
I said, "Devanshi,
you always want to be a leader,"

366
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:37,247
but do you know
what a leader is?"

367
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,149
She says,
"it's very simple, Mama.

368
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:41,050
"They are just serving
the people.

369
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:44,056
Leaders are just servants
to people."

370
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,080
Devanshi: I loved
the Youth & Government program.

371
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:50,859
The best way I can give back is
by running for Youth Governor.

372
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:53,525
How would you solve
the California budget crisis?

373
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:54,898
Starting with Miss Patel.

374
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,664
I would out
unnecessary spending.

375
00:20:56,691 --> 00:20:59,137
When I was running for office,
there were a lot of...

376
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,231
if not outward shows of sexism,

377
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:02,673
little remarks here and there,

378
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:05,678
like, "Oh, she speaks well
for a woman."

379
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,577
"She's smart for a woman."

380
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:08,842
There were also
a couple instances

381
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,281
with some of my friends

382
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:12,876
when they were going to speak
in front of a large audience

383
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:15,410
and the only thing people
could focus on was their body,

384
00:21:15,443 --> 00:21:17,889
what they looked like,
what they were wearing.

385
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,983
I thought, you knovv,
"We're better than this."

386
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:33,232
She said, "Mama, it looks like
I'm another Hillary Clinton."

387
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:35,764
Guys will vote for guys,
and girls will vote for guys

388
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,174
but some of the time,

389
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:39,610
girls have a harder time getting
the girls to vote for girls

390
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,171
'cause I feel like girls are
kind of harder on other girls.

391
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:52,021
Siebel Newsom:
Devanshi's story

392
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:54,993
made me think about how early
girls face a deep gender bias

393
00:21:55,016 --> 00:22:01,228
and how things have not changed
as much as we'd like to think.

394
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:02,666
One of the first things I did

395
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,670
when I became mayor
of San Francisco is

396
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,467
I appointed
a female Police Chief

397
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:08,474
and then a female Fire Chief.

398
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:11,238
When they both show up
at the podium in a disaster,

399
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,267
a lot of national media
will look there and say,

400
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,247
"Where's the Police Chief?"
"She's right here."

401
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,476
"Where's the Fire Chief, then?"
"Well, she's right here."

402
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:20,247
People thought I was trying to
make some grand statement

403
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:23,016
when, in fact,
I was actually just hiring

404
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:25,490
the most qualified
two candidates.

405
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:29,928
The incredible opposition
was coming mostly from women

406
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,955
and those that feel it's
too much, too soon, too fast.

407
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:36,434
They never would have questioned
that had they been men.

408
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:39,063
Little boys and little girls,
when they're <i>7</i> years old,

409
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,767
an equal number want to be
President of the United States

410
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,673
when they grow up...
about 30%.

411
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:46,645
But then you ask the same
question when they're 15,

412
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,944
and you see
this massive gap emerging.

413
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,007
So we have
this gendered socialization,

414
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,212
where politics
is considered to be for men.

415
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,721
Leadership is considered to be
a masculine pursuit,

416
00:22:55,743 --> 00:23:00,385
and women are discouraged from
pursuing ambitious positions.

417
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:11,492
I think what happens is that
if you do not have women there,

418
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:15,668
then girls do not see
that they can be that,

419
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:20,442
so it's really what you see
that inspires your idea

420
00:23:20,468 --> 00:23:22,311
of what's possible for you
in the world.

421
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,146
I do disagree with Sarah Palin
on a lot of issues,

422
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:27,084
but seeing her up onstage there

423
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:29,679
with her young family
and her young baby

424
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,713
was just beautiful,
and I thought, "You know what'?"

425
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:33,851
Maybe I could give this a shot
as well."

426
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:41,891
Having this opportunity
to see women,

427
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:43,266
to see women leadership,

428
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,272
to see woman's leadership
in reality and on the screen

429
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:49,707
and in the television
is huge for women... huge.

430
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:53,076
Because you don't have that many
women really in leadership,

431
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:55,775
so the way that it gets done,
to a certain extent,

432
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:59,148
and the way problems get solved
often have to do with Hollywood

433
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,709
and the films that get made,

434
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,881
the documentaries,
the television shows.

435
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,321
Start where people are,

436
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:06,552
and people
are watching television.

437
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:08,891
Siebel Newsom:
There are some examples

438
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,523
of films and TV shows
that portray powerful women,

439
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:17,627
but in general, the situation
in Hollywood is pretty bleak.

440
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:24,907
I decided to pursue acting
professionally at the age of 28

441
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:28,470
and was hopeful I could find
complex roles to play.

442
00:24:28,503 --> 00:24:29,641
My first reality check came

443
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,583
when my agent told me
to lie about my age

444
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:35,349
and remove my Stanford MBA
from my résumé

445
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:37,378
because it might be threatening.

446
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,152
Well, I didn't do either,

447
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,786
but my confidence
was really shaken.

448
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:44,228
My second reality check came

449
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:46,892
when I learned that there were
very few multidimensional roles

450
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,901
to even audition for.

451
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,994
I shouldn't have been surprised

452
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,936
because when you really look
at Hollywood

453
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,564
and the films
that are being made,

454
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:57,269
you see the same stereotypes
being portrayed

455
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:59,778
over and over again.

00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:50,221
♪ Is it ever gonna be enough'? ♪

470
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:53,289
Women are never the protagonists
or the ones who...

471
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,232
like, if they are
the protagonist,

472
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:58,465
it's some, like, drama about
getting a guy or something.

473
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:01,132
It's never really about finding
your destiny or whatever,

474
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:02,505
how they say it for the guys.

475
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,407
Like in the "Star Trek,"
he's like,

476
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:05,672
"This is your destiny,"

477
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,805
you know, being powerful
being the captain.

478
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,712
But for a girl,
they wouldn't say that.

479
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,478
And then
what's weird about it is

480
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:14,748
that it seems normal for us.
Like, we don't question it.

481
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,277
We don't say,

482
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,153
"Oh, why isn't a girl being
the protagonist for this'?

483
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,487
Why can't a girl be powerful?"

484
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:25,896
Davis:
I hear this all the time.

485
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,399
Well, things are getting better.

486
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,492
I mean, things are
getting better, you know'?

487
00:26:29,523 --> 00:26:31,525
But they're not.

488
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,836
Mainstream movies are generally
stories of man's lives

489
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,398
which revolve around men,

490
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,673
and then we have this subgenre
called "chick flicks,"

491
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,441
which are stories
of woman's lives

492
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:44,040
which, when you look at them
a little more closely,

493
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,415
you realize that they generally
revolve around man's lives, too.

494
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,613
They revolve around
trying to get a man,

495
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:52,250
trying to get love,
get married, get pregnant.

496
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,420
It's my fault that I'm alone
on Valentine's Day.

497
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:59,226
My closest relationship
is with my Blackberry.

498
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,994
- Right.
- Thank God it vibrates.

499
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:05,027
Between 1937 and 2005,

500
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:10,805
there were only 13 female
protagonists in animated movies.

501
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,435
All of them except one

502
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,707
had the aspiration
of finding romance.

503
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:17,579
As a culture,
women are brought up

504
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:20,085
to just be kind of
fundamentally insecure

505
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,814
and always looking for the time

506
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:25,255
when that knight on a horse
will come and rescue us

507
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,123
or provide for us.

508
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:31,687
Heidman: When it comes to female
leaders in entertainment media,

509
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,221
we see the bitchy boss

510
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:36,064
who has sacrificed
family and love

511
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,660
to make it to where she is.

512
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:40,400
Miranda: I said to myself,
"Take a chance.

513
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:43,409
Hire the smart, fat girl."

514
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:47,345
The whole movie is about
bringing her down a peg,

515
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:49,405
and this is generally done
by someone who is under her,

516
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:51,917
a subordinate, typically a male,

517
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,044
so that image doesn't bode well

518
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:57,352
when it comes to ideas
of women in leadership.

519
00:27:57,378 --> 00:28:01,019
Haggis: We had many more
interesting characters on screen

520
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:03,654
in the '20s, '30s, '40s
than we do now.

521
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:06,995
And we allowed women
to really embody

522
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,297
all the contradictions that
make up a human being back then.

523
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:12,634
They could be the femme fatale

524
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,140
and then turn around
and be the mother

525
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:17,836
and then turn around and
be the seductress,

526
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,708
and then turn around
and be the saint,

527
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,941
and we accepted that.

528
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,846
They were complex human beings.

529
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:26,852
Now we really like to
put people in boxes.

530
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,683
The only two choices
for women...

531
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:29,881
witch and sexy kitten.

532
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,981
Oh, you just said
a mouthful there, sister.

533
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:35,722
As men, we do it
because we don't understand

534
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,922
characters that aren't ourselves,

535
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:38,294
and we aren't willing to
put ourselves

536
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,560
in the skin of those characters.

537
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,795
And women, I think, terrify us.

538
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:45,167
We tend not to write women
as human beings.

539
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:47,297
It's cartoons we're making now.

540
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:49,330
And that's a shame.

541
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:53,038
Heidman: Throughout any type
of mass media there is,

542
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:56,640
we see the widespread acceptance
of women as sex objects.

543
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,173
In rock videos,
rap and hip-hop videos,

544
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,049
in all the summer blockbusters,

545
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:03,385
women are basically
just body props

546
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:05,687
there for young male viewers.

547
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:08,592
I think
when they do put in the part,

548
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,527
she's used as a sexual object

549
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:13,225
or an object of desire
toward the men,

550
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:15,256
which I think
should change a lot

551
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:18,361
because there's a lot more
to a woman than just a body.

552
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:21,236
Katz: We're socializing
boys to believe

553
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:24,505
that being a man means
being powerful and in control.

554
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,209
Ooh la la.

555
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:30,545
Being smarter than women
or better than women

556
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:33,279
or our needs get met first
in relationships with women,

557
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,378
that's not genetically predestined.

558
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:36,786
That's learned behaviour.

559
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,586
You don't think
I can be a surgeon'?

560
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:39,682
I can be a surgeon.

561
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,920
- Surgery's hardcore.
- I'm hardcore.

562
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,860
You won't last
the first year, babe.

563
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:47,255
Heidman: We also see
a new incarnation of this,

564
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:49,859
where women
appear to be empowered.

565
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,268
They are carrying the story.
They're the action hero.

566
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:55,604
But, again, when you peel back
a layer or two,

567
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,633
you discover that it's not
really about their agency,

568
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,146
and I call this archetype
"the fighting fuck toy."

569
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:04,672
♪ Don't move, don't speak,
even whisper ♪

570
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:07,650
That's a badass chick.

571
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:10,679
Heidman: Because even though
she is doing things

572
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:13,214
supposedly on her own terms

573
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:17,161
she very much is objectified
and exists for the male viewer.

574
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:21,496
Davis: In G-rated movies,
the female characters

575
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:24,696
are just as likely to be wearing
sexually revealing clothing

576
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,762
as in R-rated movies,

577
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,068
which is horrifying.

578
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:41,445
Fonda: The hypersexualization
that occurs in Hollywood...

579
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,319
it's toxic.
There's no question.

580
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,120
It affects all of us,

581
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:50,118
including young girls
who are seeking an identity.

582
00:30:56,323 --> 00:31:00,794
Mitchell: If the message is that
women are objectified objects,

583
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:03,638
that that's their primary being,

584
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:06,543
that's a very tough
and challenging message

585
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,878
for young women who think
that's their path to power.

586
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:16,319
Durham: You know

587
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:18,323
they'll say Madonna
is tremendously empowered

588
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:19,517
or Angelina Jolie,

589
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:21,925
but they all embody that exact
same definition of sexuality.

590
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,860
I mean, when you really think
about it, though,

591
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:25,557
Hillary Clinton's
tremendously empowered.

592
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:26,792
She's Secretary of State, right'?

593
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,027
Or, you know,
you think of women CEOs

594
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,660
or, you know, there are
women who are empowered

595
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:31,931
in lots of different
kinds of ways,

596
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,495
but you don't
see them represented.

597
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:34,801
You don't get that message

598
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:36,307
that you don't have to use
your sexuality

599
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,604
to attain empowerment
in the world.

600
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,942
A male-dominant system,
a patriarchal system,

601
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:44,108
values women
as child-bearers, period.

602
00:31:44,138 --> 00:31:46,084
So it limits their value

603
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:49,212
to the time that they are
sexually active,

604
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,052
reproductively active,

605
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:54,287
and become
much less valuable after that.

606
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:57,421
Lauzen: What we see
in broadcast television is

607
00:31:57,451 --> 00:32:00,057
that the majority
of female characters

608
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,725
are in their 20s and 30s.

609
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:06,829
That is just a huge
misrepresentation of reality,

610
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,670
and that really skews
our perceptions.

611
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:32,062
It's like when a female
reaches 39 or 40,

612
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:35,090
she simply needs to go away.

613
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,867
One day, I got the call that
I'd heard about others getting,

614
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:46,844
and that was this...
I had just gotten a series,

615
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:49,245
and it was presented to me
by my manager as,

616
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,251
"Daphne, your part is secure,
but would you consider doing

617
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:55,152
a little Botox or collagen
or something?"

618
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:57,519
Well, just like them, I didn't
know what the hell it was.

619
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,683
What do you mean,
"Botox or collagen or something"?

620
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:02,694
And I remember lying
in this chair,

621
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:06,562
with this fat, bald man

622
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:11,559
injecting, like, needles
in my forehead, bleeding.

623
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:12,593
And I'm crying,

624
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:14,367
and I'm feeling guilty for crying.

625
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:17,899
I remember lying in that chair,
just thinking,

626
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:20,411
"There's something wrong here."

627
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:24,143
It really made me feel...

628
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:27,812
a less spiritually whole person,

629
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,685
less of a woman with integrity.

630
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:33,157
I felt like
I was cheating and lying

631
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,887
with this stuff in my face.

632
00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:37,919
So, maybe I'll stop working.
I don't know.

633
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:39,123
But just right now,

634
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,258
I have chosen
not to do it again.

635
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,825
And my mother was furious.

636

the hippie in Vermont, said'?

"You tell those fuckers
to get penis implants."

[laughs]

639
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,037
This is not new.

640
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,573
You know, I started out
in the business in the '50s.

641
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:00,812
My very first movie,
I played a cheerleader,

642
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:04,288
and Jack Warner was the head
of Warner Bros.

643
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:07,155
And he sent word down that
he wanted me to wear falsies

644
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:08,626
and my director, Josh Logan,

645
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,562
asked me to have
my back teeth pulled out.

646
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:13,861
You know, I wasn't good enough
the way I was.

647
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,007
I really, truly believe

648
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:29,981
that reality TV is the
contemporary cultural backlash

649
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:32,040
against woman's rights.

650

Miss Blondie...

651
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,721
I think one of the worst
stereotypes in reality TV

652
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:42,227
is this notion that women exist
to be decorative.

653
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,160
Women exist to be stupid.

654
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:46,186
Women are considered
gold diggers.

655
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,667
Women are considered bitchy,
catty, manipulative, vindictive,

656
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,864
not to be trusted,
especially by other women.

657

Pozner: This notion
that women are natural enemies

663
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:10,181
vying for the prize of being
more beautiful than the rest

664
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,190
or the love of whoever

665
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:16,251
is so counter to women
in real life.

666
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,559
Woman: Please pick me,

power relationship

669
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:23,830
going on there,

670
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:25,359
where it's the girls
whose bodies are on display,

671
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:26,928
and the boys get the power
to arbitrate and judge

672
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,099
whether their bodies are
acceptable or not acceptable,

673

desirable or not desirable.

674
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:33,143
So I think there's a whole lot
going on there

675
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:36,171
that actually puts girls in
a really disempovvered position.

676

Pozner: These shows,
over the course of the last decade,

677
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:41,380
have tried to portray
a world in which

678

the only options
available to women

679
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,817
mimic the 1950s model
of femininity,

680
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:49,293
in which woman's only power
was her beauty,

681
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,159
in which women
not only had no choices

682
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:52,926
but shouldn't
have even wanted any,

683
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:55,559
in which men were burdened
with the responsibility

684
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,001
of being the Prince Charming
who comes in

685
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,096
and Whisks women away
to happily ever after,

686

then has to provide
for their financial security.

687

Nobody wins in this model,

688

but women particularly lose
in this model

689
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:11,741
where they're expected to
look like miss U.S.A.,

on "Sex And The City,"

691
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,545

Cronkite: This is the "CBS
Evening News with Katie Couric."

698
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,570
Hi, everyone.

699
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:42,410
I'm very happy
to be with you tonight.

700
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:44,109
Jenkins: Katie couric was

701
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:47,846
the very first national
experience we had all together,

702
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,481
viewing a woman
who was not entertaining us

703
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:53,048
but whose presence
and presentation was vital

704
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,424
for getting us
the information we needed.

705
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,690
The three major
evening newscasts

706
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,994
had been dominated
by white males.

707
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,694
They had very similar faces

708
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:05,329
and very similar backgrounds
for the most part.

709
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,270
I thought,
"This is an opportunity

710
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,705
to mix it up a little bit."

711
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,175
I also thought it was
an important message

712
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,701
that a women could be
as competent as a man

713
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,271
in an important, powerful role.

714
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,782
And I remember in the early days

715
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:19,909
when I would get calls
from reporters about,

716
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,715
"Ah, we have
our first woman anchor.

717
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:23,119
What do you think about that?"

718
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:26,022
inevitably, the questions
that they would ask first were.

719
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,184
"What about those legs'?

720
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:29,216
Do you think
she was showing too much leg?"

721
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,354
Or, "What about that winter white'?"

722
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:32,955
Wasn't that a big mistake?"

723
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:36,524
They were all observations that
had to do with her physicality

724
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:38,867
and not really about
the content at all.

725
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:41,463
But, again, it's because,
as I've always said,

726
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,202
we are a nation of teenage boys.

727
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,268
We don't know
what to make of this woman

728
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,041
sitting in front of us,

729
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:51,049
and so, you know, we look at
her legs, her boobs, her hair,

730
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,448
her whatever, you know

731
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:54,543
and then maybe way down the line

732
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:57,181
we'll get to listening
to what she's saying.

733
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,212
Ever since
I've been in media at all,

734
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:02,159
even since, you know, the first
morning show that I was on

735
00:38:02,182 --> 00:38:06,562
in Holyoke, Massachusetts,
as the sidekick news girl,

736
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:10,330
there's been a really consistent
proportion of...

737
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,394
I don't even know
if you could call it criticism.

738
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:13,564
Essentially, it's hate mail.

739
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:16,131
As I've become
sort of better-known

740
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,836
and I get more feedback,

741
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:21,471
the amount of
"I hate you," homophobic,

742
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:23,742
"I hate what you look like,"

743
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,513
"I'm gonna kill you,"
threatening mail stuff,

744
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,385
it's like the proportion
has stayed exactly the same.

745
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,856
[chuckling] It's like
it's always 14% of the feedback.

746
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:38,921
And almost all of the hate mail
is about gender and sexuality.

747
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:40,090
I mean, who has the time'?

748
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,531
If that's really what you think

749
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:43,364
and you really are
that bad a speller,

750
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,768
like, you really are
still gonna take this time

to let me know what you "thunk"
[laughs] about what I look like'?

752
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:56,441
It's the scrutinization
that women get

753
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,885
that far surpasses
the scrutinization that men get.

754
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:04,912

reporting on Brian Williams'
personal life,

756
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:13,159
yet Katie Couric
and what she is wearing

757
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:16,633

in similar professions,

760
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:25,340
it's automatically positioned
as a cat fight.

on the cable news channels.

769

shirts and lots of make-up,

770
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,399
and, you know, their hair
is kind of tousled,

771
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:55,100
and they look like they're
working as cocktail waitresses

instead of newscasters.

00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:11,181
Pozner: The local news
anchorships look like,

780
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:15,125
you knovv, somebody's grandfather
and his second wife.

781
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:18,721
Couric: Television's a very
visual medium, obviously,

782
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:22,359
and it's kind of
how do you walk the fine line

783
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:24,733
of looking pleasing and attractive

784
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,669
but also looking professional'?

785
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:29,299
I look back
on my "Today" show interviews,

786
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:32,401
and I think,
"Geez, my skirt is way too short."

787
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,706
I sometimes worry

788
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:36,476
that I started this thing
with my legs and everything,

789
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:40,417
that I have sort of started this trend

790
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,818
of trying to look, you know...

791
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,288
I don't know.

792
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:48,885
There is so much pressure
to look a certain way.

793
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:51,088
When I'm on television,

794
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:54,497
I never try
and explicitly dress sexy.

795
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:57,434
I don't want to distract from
the stories that I'm telling.

796
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,164
I want you to focus on
what I'm saying.

797
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,694
There's a lot of words
in my show,

798
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:03,105
and I work really hard on
getting them in the right order.

799
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,269
For some people
I will always be

800
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,107
too hideous a creature
to be on television.

801
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,238
That's fine.

802
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:09,872
But if you can get over that
on day one,

803
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:10,973
it's gonna stay the same

804
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:12,506
for the whole time
that I'm on the air.

805
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:15,713
I think it's really hard
for women today.

806
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:21,154
Siebel Newsom: The emphasis
on woman's appearance

807
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,718
affects more
than just women on screen.

808
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,889
It's affecting woman's ability

809
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:29,423
to participate
in the political process.

810
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:32,767
Ironically,
the more power women gain,

811
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:35,706
the stronger the backlash
against them.

812
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:37,936
And this phenomenon
is most evident

813
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:42,538
in the way the media disrespects
our female leaders.

814
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:45,482
She's irresistibly cute,
let's put it that way,

815
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:46,882
in the way
she presents herself.

816
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,614
Obviously,
she's attractive and all that.

817
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,849
Beck: Sarah Palin
looks really hot in that hat.

818
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:55,951
She just said that
she doesn't know how oars work.

819
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:58,724
Oh, that's crazy.
You seen the hat on her'?

820
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:01,858
Both you and Sarah Palin
are good-looking women.

821
00:42:01,888 --> 00:42:04,266
I mean, you're attractive,
young...

822
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,464
relatively young...
women.

823
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:08,495
Savage: Kagan... he's gonna put
on the U.S. Supreme court'?

824
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,838
Is there such a thing about
the aesthetics of the appointee'?

825
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:12,275
Let's put it to you this way...

826
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:14,802
she's not the type of face
you'd want to see on a $5 bill

827
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:17,441
I think I'm gonna send
Sotomayor and her club

828
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,949
a bunch of vacuum cleaners

829
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:21,475
to help them clean up
after their meetings.

830
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:24,546
Cynthia McKinney, the former
Congresswoman from Georgia,

831
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:26,216
was another angry black women.

832
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:28,021
Rodgers:
Look at these ugly skanks

833
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:30,722
who make up
the female leadership

834
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,161
of the Democratic party.

835
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:34,256
You know that ugly hag,
Madeleine Albright?

836
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:35,527
Remember her'?
A psycho.

837
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:37,592
She was the Secretary of State
under Clinton.

838
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:39,433
Remember her'?
Like a fat moron'?

839
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:41,564
And now we have
the Wicked Witch of the West,

840
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:43,199
you know, Nancy Pelosi

841
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,436
I think if Speaker Pelosi

842
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:46,705
were still capable
of human facial expression,

843
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,144
we'd see she'd be embarrassed

844
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:51,581
Baker: Nancy Pelosi, that...
hey, get another facelift, lady.

845
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:54,085
Another reason
why it's very rare

846
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:56,519
to find a woman worthy
of serving in political office.

847
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:58,989
♪ Ding dong! The wicked witch
is dead ♪

848
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,992
Limbaugh:
And it's bye-bye, Pelosi!

849
00:43:01,014 --> 00:43:03,620
Levin: Hillary Rodham Clinton,
her "Thighness,"

850
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,357
is no better than Dumbo
with the big ears.

851
00:43:05,385 --> 00:43:08,366
When she raises her voice,
and when a lot of women do,

852
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:09,799
you know, as I say,

853
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:11,894
it reaches a point where
every husband in America...

854
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,302
You know what'?

855
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:14,896
Has heard it
one time or another.

856
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,805
You get a woman
in the Oval Office,

857
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,639
most powerful person
in the world.

858
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,736
What's the downside'?

859
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,373
You mean besides the PMS
and the mood swings'?

860
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:28,214
There's probably
no more powerful influence

861
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:32,246
in the way we view power
than the way media treats power.

862
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:36,125
And media treats power
as defined by men

863
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:37,958
because it has been,

864
00:43:37,984 --> 00:43:40,487
throughout our generation
and the ones before,

865
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,863
generally defined that way.

866
00:43:41,888 --> 00:43:45,028
Falk: When press representations
of women who are,

867
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:48,130
you know, running for
the highest office in the land

868
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:50,835
are focusing, for example
on how women look

869
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:54,073
instead of what they've done
or their issue positions,

870
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,909
that's got to impact
the audience

871
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:58,610
in terms of how they evaluate
and judge those women.

872
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:01,278
One of the things it does is
it trivializes them.

873
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:03,686
It makes women seem
less powerful.

874
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,714
Pozner: During the Democratic
National Convention in '84,

875
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:08,657
when Geraldine Ferraro
was running,

876
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:10,923
she was introduced
on national television

877
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:13,864
as the first female
Vice Presidential candidate,

878
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:15,662
size 6.

879
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:18,568
So this is not new.

880
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:20,434
Walsh:
My colleague did a study

881
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,236
looking at Elizabeth Dole
and her race for president.

882
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:27,905
She was coming in second in Iowa
at the time after George Bush,

883
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:31,177
and there was much more coverage
of her appearance

884
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:35,152
than there was of the substance
of what she was talking about.

885
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,553
Lawless:
When I ran for Congress,

886
00:44:37,577 --> 00:44:39,648
I was campaigning
at grocery stores,

887
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,626
and a women came up to me,
and she put her arms around me,

888
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:44,060
and she whispered, "Don't worry."

889
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:47,361
You don't look nearly as fat
in real life as you do on TV."

890
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:51,130
The week before the election,
a man came up to me,

891
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:52,727
and he said,
You know, you seem great,

892
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:54,932
"but I don't feel like I could
vote for you for Congress.

893
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:56,804
I feel like I should hire you
as a babysitter."

894
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,174
When I first ran
for public office,

895
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,110
which is now over 20 years ago,

896
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:03,478
although my youngest was
a senior in high school,

897
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:05,676
the question I was
most frequently asked was.

898
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:07,981
"Who's gonna be taking care
of your children?"

899
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:10,181
And, of course,
it's one of those questions

900
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,417
that I don't think
a man has ever been asked

901
00:45:12,445 --> 00:45:13,753
when he has run for office.

902
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,250
If you look at the women who ran
who had honorary titles,

903
00:45:17,283 --> 00:45:18,785
like Senator Clinton,

904
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:20,764
if the press drops that title

905
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:23,529
and instead refers to them
as "Mrs. Clinton,"

906
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:25,194
this is a way to kind of diminish

907
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:26,533
some of her accomplishments.

908
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:41,214
Feinstein: There is such a thing
as a media bias.

909
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:44,688
For example, media will write
in the same way

910
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:46,554
about a man and a woman.

911
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:50,550
Senator X, who is a woman,
"Complained that..."

912
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:55,430
And in the same thing,
Senator Y "Stated that..."

913
00:45:55,455 --> 00:45:57,833
So the man will get a stated

914
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:02,863
and the woman will get
the negative verb "complained."

915
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,398
Women were twice as likely

916
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,809
to be described emotionally
as were men,

917
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:10,645
and by painting women
as more emotional than men,

918
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:13,378
we perpetuate the stereotype
that women are emotional,

919
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:14,851
therefore they're irrational,

920
00:46:14,874 --> 00:46:16,581
therefore they can't handle
a crisis,

921
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:18,885
therefore they should not be
in leadership positions.

922
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:23,156
I remember so many times during
the campaign, people asking,

923
00:46:23,183 --> 00:46:25,686
"Well, is she tough enough
to be Commander In Chief?"

924
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:27,561
[chuckling ] Well,
I've known plenty of men

925
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:29,396
who aren't tough enough
to be Commander In Chief,

926
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:30,833
and nobody asked that question.

927
00:46:30,857 --> 00:46:35,237
[voice breaking] Making sure
that these kids have a shot

928
00:46:35,261 --> 00:46:39,266
at the American Dream
[sobs] like I did...

929
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,108
is important.

930
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:44,172
Gosh, what do you think they
would have done to Nancy Pelosi

931
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,842
if she had gotten all worked up'?

932
00:46:45,872 --> 00:46:48,978
They would've said that
she's unstable, couldn't do the job.

933
00:46:49,008 --> 00:46:51,784
Ooh. Yes.
Welcome to America.

934
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:58,725
A woman in power is often seen
as a negative thing.

935
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:02,790
We associate all the worst
aspects of power,

936
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:04,768
and we translate those

937
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:07,101
to a woman
seeking to achieve power.

938
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:09,471
Heidman: One of the key ways

939
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:13,535
in which media played a role
in the primary

940
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:16,069
was to talk about
Hillary Clinton's ambition

941
00:47:16,102 --> 00:47:17,740
as though it were a bad thing.

942
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,977
When Barack Obama speaks,

943
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:22,816
men hear,
"Take off for the future."

944
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:26,289
And when Hillary Clinton speaks,
men hear,

945
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:27,814
[high-pitched]
"Take out the garbage."

946
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:30,088
When she reacts
the way she reacts to Obama

947
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:32,289
with just the look...
the look toward him,

948
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:34,229
looking like
everyone's first wife

949
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:36,165
standing outside
of probate court.

950
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:37,759
I don't know what
they're getting at here, Tucker.

951
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,292
What do you think
they're saying about Hillary'?

952
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:40,929
I don't know,
but that is so perfect

953
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,931
[chuckling] I have often said
when she comes on television,

954
00:47:44,964 --> 00:47:47,035
I involuntarily cross my legs.

955
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:48,340
I know you do.

956
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:51,281
Heidman: Hillary Clinton
had hecklers following her,

957
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:53,250
saying, "Iron my shirt."

958
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:54,650
Man: Iron my shirt!

959
00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:56,278
- Some people think...
- Iron my shirt!

960
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:59,483
- ...We bring about change by.
- Iron my shirt!

961
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:02,925
Heidman: She was frequently called
a bitch in mainstream media.

962
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:05,225
Beck:
She's a stereotypical bitch.

963
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,423
You know what I mean'?

964
00:48:06,452 --> 00:48:08,056
Obama did great in February,

965
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:10,567
and that's because
that was Black History Month.

966
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,864
And now Hillary's doing
much better

967
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,768
'cause it's White Bitch Month, right'?

968
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:16,103
If she knew
how it made her look...

969
00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:19,008
alternately soppy and bitchy...
she'd stop it,

970
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:20,636
but she can't help herself,
can she'?

971
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,011
Her credentials
were constantly questioned.

972
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:25,073
Let's not forget...
and I'll be brutal...

973
00:48:25,104 --> 00:48:26,640
the reason she's a U.S. Senator,

974
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:28,516
the reason she's a candidate
for President,

975
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,145
the reason she may be
a front-runner

976
00:48:30,176 --> 00:48:32,213
- is her husband messed around.
- Woman: Yeah, but...

977
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:34,452
That's how she got to be Senator
We keep forgetting it.

978
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,187
She didn't win there
on her merit.

979
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:41,822
Heidman: Sarah Palin presented
a very different image.

980
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:45,301
She is the first national,
high-profile, female candidate

981
00:48:45,325 --> 00:48:48,204
who presented herself
in very feminine terms...

982
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:51,141
as a "real woman."

983
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:52,609
She's the American Dream.

984
00:48:52,632 --> 00:48:54,839
Women want to be her.
Men want to mate with her

985
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:56,471
I want her
laying next to me in bed.

986
00:48:56,502 --> 00:49:00,780
There were pictures shot
between her legs

987
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,981
of folks at the
Republican National Convention.

988
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:08,550
In a nutshell,
she was pornified and ditzified.

989
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,583
I don't want to say
she's a ditz,

990
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:11,994
but [chuckles] last night,

991
00:49:12,018 --> 00:49:14,692
my stripper's fake name
was Sarah Palin.

992
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:16,701
Yo, let me tell you something
about Sarah Palin, man.

993
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:18,134
[laughter]

994
00:49:18,157 --> 00:49:20,159
She's good masturbation material.

995
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:21,297
- Oh!
- Oh!

996
00:49:21,327 --> 00:49:23,034
Heidman:
So, Hillary Clinton

997
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:25,702
tried to be properly masculine
and properly feminine,

998
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:26,972
and she lost.

999
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,276
Sarah Palin puts out
this different image

1000
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:31,475
of, shall we say, hyper-femininity,

1001
00:49:31,504 --> 00:49:34,610
and she gets beaten up in
really degrading, gendered ways.

1002
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,086
[laughter]

1003
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:38,953
But tonight,
we are crossing party lines

1004
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:41,390
to address
the now very ugly role

1005
00:49:41,414 --> 00:49:44,122
that sexism is playing
in the campaign.

1006
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,994
An issue
which I am frankly surprised

1007
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,762
to hear people
suddenly care about.

1008
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:52,360
[laughter]

1009
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:54,303
Reporters and commentators,

1010
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:56,637
stop using words
that diminish us,

1011
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:59,507
like "pretty,"
"attractive," "beautiful."

1012
00:49:59,532 --> 00:50:01,409
"Harpy," "shrew"...

1013
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:02,936
[laughter]

1014
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:04,573
 "boner-shrinker."

1015
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:06,584
[ laughter, applause]

1016
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,779
My worry is now that
there were millions of people

1017
00:50:12,812 --> 00:50:14,917
watching Sarah Palin,
Hillary Clinton.

1018
00:50:14,947 --> 00:50:16,824
I could talk about
a lot of women

1019
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,522
that are in New Jersey politics.

1020
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:20,792
There were millions
of young women watching this,

1021
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,800
and the messages
that they're getting

1022
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:25,029
are just not conducive
to encouraging them

1023
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:26,969
to put up with
this kind of abuse.

1024
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:28,870
When you're not treated
the same,

1025
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,738
you are dehumanized.

1026
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:32,674
When you're not given
the same opportunity,

1027
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:33,803
you're dehumanized.

1028
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,540
When people
look at you differently

1029
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:36,979
because you happen to be a woman

1030
00:50:37,003 --> 00:50:40,644
and you happen to be
in a position of some influence

1031
00:50:40,673 --> 00:50:44,086
that someone who is a man
would naturally be in

1032
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,748
based on tradition or history

1033
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:48,190
and people question
your qualifications,

1034
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:49,659
that's dehumanizing.

1035
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:54,324
Empowered women in general
threaten men

1036
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:57,426
because they feel
that an empowered woman

1037
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:59,437
is just putting down a man

1038
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:03,236
as opposed to trying to
sort of raise herself.

1039
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:06,937
As women have been challenging
man's power in business,

1040
00:51:06,966 --> 00:51:10,140
in the professions,
in education, in politics,

1041
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:13,048
and other areas of social life,

1042
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:16,747
the images of women that have
been flooding the culture

1043
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:19,222
have been showing women
as taking up less space.

1044
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:21,987
They're less threatening,
they're highly sexualized,

1045
00:51:22,014 --> 00:51:23,357
and, therefore,

1046
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:25,727
a certain kind of power
has been taken away from them,

1047
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:28,096
which is the power
of being a whole person.

1048
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:31,500
And I don't think
those things are coincidental.

1049
00:51:31,524 --> 00:51:35,597
I think that the way that the
symbolic realm has been acting

1050
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:37,130
is to take power away from women

1051
00:51:37,163 --> 00:51:39,370
while women have been
challenging man's power

1052
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:41,106
in the concrete realm.

1053
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,007
Siebel Newsom:
It seems we've become numb

1054
00:51:46,038 --> 00:51:48,609
to the insidious ways
the media holds women back

1055
00:51:48,641 --> 00:51:50,621
when it misrepresents them.

1056
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,656
I can't help but wonder...

1057
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,990
who are the people
behind the scenes,

1058
00:51:57,016 --> 00:51:59,963
making these crucial decisions
about what we see'?

1059
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,091
And what are the consequences

1060
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:05,068
for my daughter
and her generation'?

1061
00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:32,058
The media has always been

1062
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:34,189
overwhelmingly in the hands of men.

1063
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:41,929
Pozner:
As you go up the ranks in media,

1064
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:45,204
fewer and fewer women
and people of colour exist

1065
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:47,211
at every rung of the ladder.

1066
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:53,239
Jenkins: That means that 97%
of everything you know

1067
00:52:53,272 --> 00:52:55,479
about yourself and about
your country and your world

1068
00:52:55,508 --> 00:52:57,044
comes from the male perspective.

1069
00:52:57,076 --> 00:52:58,578
It doesn't mean that it's wrong.

1070
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:00,591
It just means
that in a democracy

1071
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:03,560
where you talk about equality
and full participation,

1072
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,221
you've got half
of the population...

1073
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:06,821
more than half of the population...

1074
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,093
not participating.

1075
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,066
Many years ago, I said,

1076
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:12,695
"Why don't we just create
our ovvn network

1077
00:53:12,725 --> 00:53:16,036
"rather than continuing to
try and get our stories told

1078
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:17,973
by other people's networks?"

1079
00:53:17,997 --> 00:53:20,136
So we put together an idea.

1080
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,669
We went to various distributors,

1081
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:24,545
including the broadcast networks,

1082
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:27,141
the cable companies, et cetera,
pitched the idea.

1083
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:28,948
And one person said to me,

1084
00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:31,512
"Why do we need
another woman's network'?

1085
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:34,320
We already have one.
We have Lifetime."

1086
00:53:40,486 --> 00:53:44,127
There's a fairly pervasive
sense of denial

1087
00:53:44,156 --> 00:53:47,194
about the status of women

1088
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:49,297
working in both television
and film.

1089
00:53:49,328 --> 00:53:52,036
Peter Bart wrote a column
in Variety,

1090
00:53:52,064 --> 00:53:56,308
talking about the glass ceiling
and how it no longer exists.

1091
00:53:56,335 --> 00:54:00,249
Putting that kind of information
out there is really troublesome.

1092
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,555
For so long,
it has been an industry

1093
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:17,761
dominated by men
who just don't leave.

1094
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,134
People who employ other people

1095
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,333
tend to hire people who are
a reflection of themselves.

1096
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:24,534
This impacts hiring.

1097
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:27,170
It impacts the news directors,
the journalists,

1098
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,509
the people
who are gonna cover the news

1099
00:54:29,535 --> 00:54:32,141
and, of course,
who reports the news

1100
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:36,051
very much is the factor in
what kind of news is reported.

1101
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:46,654
When any group
is not featured in the media,

1102
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:48,165
they have to wonder,

1103
00:54:48,187 --> 00:54:51,293
"Well, what part do I play
in this culture?"

1104
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:54,032
There's actually
an academic term for that.

1105
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,097
It's called
"symbolic annihilation."

1106
00:55:12,378 --> 00:55:17,589
All of Hollywood is run
on one assumption...

1107
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:20,826
that women will watch stories
about men,

1108
00:55:20,853 --> 00:55:23,265
but men won't watch stories
about women.

1109
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:27,499
And all the decisions are made

1110
00:55:27,526 --> 00:55:32,407
based on this concrete fact,

1111
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:35,844
and nobody's ever really proved
that that's true.

1112
00:55:35,868 --> 00:55:38,610
I think it's a horrible
indictment of our society

1113
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:41,118
if we assume that
one half of the population

1114
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,349
is just not interested
in the other half.

1115
00:55:44,377 --> 00:55:47,415
The first couple of scripts
that I wrote,

1116
00:55:47,446 --> 00:55:51,519
of course, had a female,
you know, as the lead character.

1117
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,893
And people were like,

1118
00:55:52,918 --> 00:55:55,762
"Well, there's hardly
any bankable actresses,

1119
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:57,563
"so they can't carry a film,

1120
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,831
"so it has to be
super low-budget

1121
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:01,839
"or we wouldn't bankroll it.

1122
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:05,035
And no one's gonna show up
in the theaters."

1123
00:56:05,064 --> 00:56:06,509
And I finally wrote

1124
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:09,172
the lowest-budget movie
I could ever write.

1125
00:56:09,201 --> 00:56:12,444
I co-wrote "Thirteen"
with a 13-year-old girl,

1126
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:15,042
and it was about
people of lower income.

1127
00:56:15,074 --> 00:56:18,055
They could wear my clothes.
We could shoot in my house.

1128
00:56:18,077 --> 00:56:19,613
We could use my car.

1129
00:56:19,645 --> 00:56:21,386
We made the movie,
and it went on to Sundance,

1130
00:56:21,414 --> 00:56:22,825
and it went on to win awards

1131
00:56:22,848 --> 00:56:25,328
and get international distribution.

1132
00:56:25,351 --> 00:56:28,457
And I think it was
the same with "Twilight."

1133
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:30,990
Two major studios
turned it down.

1134
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:34,402
Finally, a new upstart company
showed me the project,

1135
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:37,567
and it turned into,
obviously, a phenomenon,

1136
00:56:37,596 --> 00:56:40,600
making over half a billion
dollars so far.

1137
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:42,635
So it disproved the theory

1138
00:56:42,668 --> 00:56:45,581
that girls and women
wouldn't go to see a movie.

1139
00:56:45,604 --> 00:56:47,811
That they did go see the movie
in droves

1140
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,251
and over and over and over

1141
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:52,552
and bought the DVD
and even bought pillow cases.

1142
00:56:52,578 --> 00:56:54,990
But there's a flip side to that,

1143
00:56:55,014 --> 00:56:57,494
which is kind of
astonishing to me.

1144
00:56:57,516 --> 00:57:00,793
On the next two "Twilights,"
they've hired guys.

1145
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,857
They did not seek out
a female director.

1146
00:57:02,888 --> 00:57:05,095
And on the same side,

1147
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:06,762
I've gone after some jobs

1148
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:10,205
that I've been told flat-out
to myself and my agent,

1149
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:12,436
"Oh, no. We think a guy
should direct this."

1150
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:14,172
And to me, I think, "Okay."

1151
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,476
Why can a man direct
"Sex And The City,"

1152
00:57:16,502 --> 00:57:19,381
"Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants,"
a Miley Cyrus movie.

1153
00:57:19,405 --> 00:57:21,282
Nobody ever questions that.

1154
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:23,787
But I, a very successful
female director,

1155
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:26,881
cannot direct a movie that
"should be done by a man."

1156
00:57:26,912 --> 00:57:29,552
Nobody says, I'm not gonna hire
a female director."

1157
00:57:29,582 --> 00:57:30,959
They just... on their list,

1158
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:33,156
there's just 25 names,
and none of them are women.

1159
00:57:33,185 --> 00:57:36,496
What happens is
these studio chiefs

1160
00:57:36,522 --> 00:57:38,832
or people like myself,
you know...

1161
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:40,838
writer/predueers or directors...

1162
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,137
we see the world
in a certain way,

1163
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:46,905
and we don't really challenge
that often.

1164
00:57:46,932 --> 00:57:50,379
And so we just replicate
the world that we grew up in

1165
00:57:50,402 --> 00:57:55,579
without really asking
why we're doing it.

1166
00:57:55,608 --> 00:57:57,417
What is the first thing
that they tell people

1167
00:57:57,443 --> 00:57:59,423
when they're, you know
in screenwriting class'?

1168
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:00,719
"Create what you know."

1169
00:58:00,746 --> 00:58:03,818
When you have greater diversity
behind the scenes,

1170
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:07,126
not only do you get more
female characters on screen,

1171
00:58:07,153 --> 00:58:09,895
but you get a different kind
of female character.

1172
00:58:09,922 --> 00:58:11,265
You get a more powerful

1173
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,531
and multidimensional
female character.

1174
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,733
You should have seen the way
those men looked at me.

1175
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:19,868
But then they discovered
I was fearless!

1176
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:21,845
Dawson: That's why
it's extremely important

1177
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:24,279
for women to be writing
their own stories,

1178
00:58:24,303 --> 00:58:25,543
truly crafting those stories,

1179
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:27,608
writing them down
directing them,

1180
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,085
and giving them to people

1181
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:31,520
to really emotionally
become impacted by.

1182
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:33,751
Because when my mom
tells me a story

1183
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:35,850
or my grandmother tells me
a story, I'm riveted.

1184
00:58:35,881 --> 00:58:38,088
[laughs]

1185
00:58:38,117 --> 00:58:40,393
Davis:
None of us had any idea

1186
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:43,366
what the response was gonna be
to "Thelma & Louise."

1187
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:45,562
One time, I was at a red light,
and heard this honking,

1188
00:58:45,591 --> 00:58:47,798
and I looked next to me,
and there's a car full of women

1189
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:51,468
who are popping out of
all the windows and the sunroof

1190
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:53,477
and going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"

1191
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:54,842
[laughs]

1192
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:57,575
And I'm like,
"Well, this has certainly never been

1193
00:58:57,603 --> 00:58:59,879
the reaction
to any of my other movies."

1194
00:59:01,073 --> 00:59:04,577
Then the very next movie I made
was "A League Of Their Own,"

1195
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:08,888
where I had 13- or 15-year-old
girls coming up to me

1196
00:59:08,914 --> 00:59:10,325
with the same kind of reaction.

1197
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,727
"Oh, my God. You have no idea.
That movie changed my life.

1198
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:14,458
I play sports
because of that movie."

1199
00:59:14,486 --> 00:59:16,966
And it really struck me

1200
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:20,436
how few opportunities
we give women

1201
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:23,303
to have that kind of experience
watching a movie.

1202
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:27,402
The media can be
an instrument of change.

1203
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,606
It can maintain the status quo

1204
00:59:29,635 --> 00:59:32,479
and reflect the views
of the society,

1205
00:59:32,504 --> 00:59:38,614
or it can hopefully
awaken people and change minds.

1206
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:42,592
I think it depends on
who's piloting the plane.

1207
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:48,298
Siebel Newsom:
I don't want to undervalue

1208
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,563
the tremendous progress
women have made in America.

1209
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:55,003
But if we look closely

1210
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:57,633
at the way our history
has been recorded,

1211
00:59:57,663 --> 00:59:59,108
we start to understand

1212
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:01,236
the crucial role
media has played

1213
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:03,508
in defining who we are.

1214
01:00:03,535 --> 01:00:07,483
Berg: Patriarchy really is
America's default setting,

1215
01:00:07,506 --> 01:00:12,387
where men hold the positions
of privilege and power

1216
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:13,913
and where women, very often,

1217
01:00:13,946 --> 01:00:16,051
are treated
as second-class citizens.

1218
01:00:16,081 --> 01:00:19,426
It's always been problematic
in American society

1219
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:21,294
when women have gained power.

1220
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,391
[big-band music plays]

1221
01:00:25,891 --> 01:00:27,802
During World War ll,

1222
01:00:27,826 --> 01:00:31,000
6 million women were pulled in
to take care of the factories

1223
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,805
in the absence of the men.

1224
01:00:32,831 --> 01:00:34,708
But the time the war
was coming to a close

1225
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:37,543
80% wanted to stay
at their jobs.

1226
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:40,175
When the returning Gls
came home,

1227
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:42,651
within two days of victory
in the Pacific,

1228
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:46,646
800,000 women were fired
from the aircraft industry,

1229
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:49,353
and other companies
began to follow suit.

1230
01:00:49,381 --> 01:00:51,725
We needed a huge media campaign

1231
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,821
to get these women back
into the home.

1232
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:02,267
One of the most effective ways
to do this

1233
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:03,739
was through television,

1234
01:01:03,762 --> 01:01:06,834
so the television was part
of the re-domestication.

1235
01:01:11,236 --> 01:01:14,217
We had television shows

1236
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,879
sponsored by
numerous commodities,

1237
01:01:16,909 --> 01:01:18,411
the gleaming appliances

1238
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:20,185
that June Cleaver would use
in the kitchen.

1239
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:24,058
These commodities were being
linked to the good life.

1240
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:26,063
Women rushed to their
new shopping centers

1241
01:01:26,085 --> 01:01:28,497
in their brand-new cars
and loaded up.

1242
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,091
They didn't realize that
they were actually doing this

1243
01:01:31,123 --> 01:01:34,229
in the service of a strong
governmental imperative.

1244
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:37,934
The notion of the commodity boom
was linked to capitalism,

1245
01:01:37,963 --> 01:01:40,034
which our government
was supporting,

1246
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:42,045
vis-é-vis the threat
of communism.

1247
01:01:45,337 --> 01:01:48,944
So you really see the linkage
of advertising on TV,

1248
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:50,817
the pushing of capitalism,

1249
01:01:50,843 --> 01:01:53,449
and then our government
pushing capitalism, too.

Berg: Women went
from being barred access

1261
01:02:22,641 --> 01:02:24,917
to the institutions
of higher learning,

1262
01:02:24,943 --> 01:02:26,581
not allowed to participate

the well-known professions.

Berg: Then we get to the great
reality check of the 1980s.

1275
01:02:56,208 --> 01:03:00,350
There was a huge,
well-funded message machine

1276
01:03:00,379 --> 01:03:02,086
of conservative anchors

1277
01:03:02,114 --> 01:03:05,288
and the demonization
of the word "liberal."

1278
01:03:05,317 --> 01:03:07,194
If you took
an oppositional view

1279
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:09,130
you were almost un-American.

1280
01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:13,694
And who were the great targets
of this media machine'?

1281
01:03:13,725 --> 01:03:15,864
The woman's movement
and feminists

1282
01:03:15,894 --> 01:03:18,704
because we were seen
as posing the greatest threat

1283
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:22,507
to the social order of America
at that time.

1284
01:04:03,609 --> 01:04:06,783
Any time you move forward
in a culture,

1285
01:04:06,812 --> 01:04:08,189
there's gonna be a backlash

1286
01:04:08,213 --> 01:04:10,124
that's gonna try to
move backwards

1287
01:04:10,149 --> 01:04:11,253
or stop the progress.

1288
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:12,887
And so there's
a constant tension

1289
01:04:12,918 --> 01:04:14,261
between trying to move forward

1290
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:16,266
and advance the project
of human happiness

1291
01:04:16,288 --> 01:04:18,734
and equality and justice
and everything else

1292
01:04:18,757 --> 01:04:20,100
and, at the same time,

1293
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:23,106
the attempt to maintain
the existing power structures,

1294
01:04:23,128 --> 01:04:25,369
and that tension
is a constant tension.

1295
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:30,405
Steyer: Starting in the 1980s,
really under President Reagan,

1296
01:04:30,435 --> 01:04:32,472
we started deregulating
the media industry

1297
01:04:32,504 --> 01:04:33,881
in the United States.

1298
01:04:37,276 --> 01:04:38,653
And the same people

1299
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:42,090
who hung their hat
on the mantel of family values

1300
01:04:42,114 --> 01:04:45,493
were the same people who
deregulated the media industry.

1301
01:04:45,517 --> 01:04:49,465
The Chairman of the FCC,
Mark Fowler in those days,

1302
01:04:49,488 --> 01:04:51,832
referred to the television set

1303
01:04:51,857 --> 01:04:53,894
as just another piece
of hardware,

1304
01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:56,930
and therefore, it should be
regulated or not regulated

1305
01:04:56,962 --> 01:04:59,966
in the same way that toasters
are or washing machines.

1306
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:02,638
But you're talking about
images and messages

1307
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:05,274
that shape our entire society,
our culture.

1308
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:08,342
And to out back
on the regulatory structure

1309
01:05:08,373 --> 01:05:10,284
that oversees that

1310
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:12,220
led to a lot of
unforeseen consequences

1311
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:14,747
when it came to messages
and images for young people,

1312
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,418
particularly for girls
and young women.

1313
01:05:16,448 --> 01:05:19,292
What you saw
was more and more content

1314
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:21,320
fewer and fewer limits
on that content,

1315
01:05:21,353 --> 01:05:23,299
and a lessening of standards.

1316
01:05:23,322 --> 01:05:26,633
By the time you got
to the Telecom Act of 1996,

1317
01:05:26,658 --> 01:05:30,162
you had a chance to potentially
re-regulate, if you will,

1318
01:05:30,195 --> 01:05:31,469
the media industry.

1319
01:05:31,496 --> 01:05:32,975
But, in fact,
that did not happen.

1320
01:05:32,998 --> 01:05:36,741
Berg: We have huge
corporate conglomerations

1321
01:05:36,768 --> 01:05:39,647
controlling television, radio, cable,

1322
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:42,652
newspapers, movie theaters,
theme parks,

1323
01:05:42,674 --> 01:05:44,915
huge amount of power
in this country.

1324
01:05:44,943 --> 01:05:47,981
And most of these conglomerates
really operate

1325
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:50,653
with an eye focused on
the bottom line,

1326
01:05:50,682 --> 01:05:53,492
not on fair and balanced reporting.

1327
01:05:53,518 --> 01:05:56,124
Pozner: You have Fox News
and Bill O'Reilly

1328
01:05:56,154 --> 01:05:58,293
developing an entire strategy

1329
01:05:58,323 --> 01:06:00,997
to corner the market
in sensationalistic news

1330
01:06:01,026 --> 01:06:03,734
just to sell ads,
get eyeballs, et cetera,

1331
01:06:03,762 --> 01:06:06,868
and then all the other major
news outlets on cable

1332
01:06:06,898 --> 01:06:08,536
trying to compete,

1333
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:10,376
so that who gets to shout
the loudest

1334
01:06:10,402 --> 01:06:14,009
becomes a standard
for news practice.

1335
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:16,110
I could be delivering
the same script

1336
01:06:16,141 --> 01:06:18,417
with the same graphics
in the same studio,

1337
01:06:18,443 --> 01:06:19,888
wearing the same thing,

1338
01:06:19,911 --> 01:06:21,151
but on two different days,

1339
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:22,988
I could be delivering it
like this,

1340
01:06:23,015 --> 01:06:24,551
[loudly] or I could be
delivering it like this!

1341
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:25,561
And if I'm delivering it
like this,

1342
01:06:25,584 --> 01:06:26,824
I'm gonna get double the rating.

1343
01:06:26,852 --> 01:06:28,991
[normal voice]
So that's why people yell.

1344
01:06:29,021 --> 01:06:30,694
I know that's a sexist comment!

1345
01:06:30,722 --> 01:06:32,702
- It totally is.
- But there's truth to it!

1346
01:06:32,724 --> 01:06:35,568
Greene:
The rise of punditry in America

1347
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:40,668
is greatly adding to sexism
and bias in the media

1348
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:46,650
and also confusing what is fact
and what is opinion.

1349
01:06:46,672 --> 01:06:49,482
Pozner:
You have less and less minutes

1350
01:06:49,508 --> 01:06:51,954
devoted to the pursuit of strong,

1351
01:06:51,977 --> 01:06:55,117
independent, long-term
investigative journalism,

1352
01:06:55,147 --> 01:06:59,596
more minutes devoted every year
to celebrity news, to gossip.

1353
01:06:59,618 --> 01:07:01,154
Why'? 'Cause it's cheap.

1354
01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:05,134
Fifteen years ago,
it would have been unthinkable

1355
01:07:05,157 --> 01:07:08,934
for Britney Spears' panties to
be a breaking headline on CNN.

1356
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,133
I want to lead
with the Paris Hilton story.

1357
01:07:11,163 --> 01:07:12,665
No. And you know what'?
So does my producer.

1358
01:07:12,698 --> 01:07:14,006
Andy Jones
is not listening to me.

1359
01:07:14,032 --> 01:07:15,238
He's put it as the lead.

1360
01:07:15,267 --> 01:07:17,679
Listen... I just don't believe
in covering that story,

1361
01:07:17,703 --> 01:07:19,808
especially not as the lead story
in a newscast

1362
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:21,374
when you have a day like today.

1363
01:07:21,406 --> 01:07:23,352
Can we show some footage
of Paris'?

1364
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,446
- Do we have Paris...
- No. No, we can't.

1365
01:07:25,477 --> 01:07:28,219
Joe. No.
I'm gonna do the news now.

1366
01:07:28,246 --> 01:07:29,725
I haven't thrown it...
There she is.

1367
01:07:29,748 --> 01:07:31,056
Oh. Look at that strut.

1368
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:32,562
Oh, look at that.
She's so humble.

1369
01:07:32,584 --> 01:07:34,495
- That's a reformed woman.
- Yeah, she is reformed.

1370
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:35,827
She's shy.

1371
01:07:35,854 --> 01:07:37,856
- All right. To the news now.
- Think she found Jesus.

1372
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:40,460
Just months after
Telecom '96 passed,

1373
01:07:40,492 --> 01:07:43,962
"Access Hollywood" debuted
and "E! News" debuted.

1374
01:07:43,995 --> 01:07:46,737
These are two of
the most sort of fat-shaming,

1375
01:07:46,765 --> 01:07:49,302
infotainment outlets
we have today,

1376
01:07:49,334 --> 01:07:52,975
where they follow around
women who have eaten a muffin

1377
01:07:53,004 --> 01:07:55,382
and then circle their stomachs
with graphics

1378
01:07:55,407 --> 01:07:58,388
and point to them and say,
"Baby bump'? Are they pregnant?"

1379
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,583
Oh, no, sorry.
She just ate a bagel.

1380
01:08:00,612 --> 01:08:02,091
Woman:
After photos of the singer

1381
01:08:02,114 --> 01:08:04,560
performing in her trademark
Daisy Duke jean shorts

1382
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:06,585
showed off an unflattering
belly bulge,

1383
01:08:06,618 --> 01:08:09,326
Jess' reps were forced
to publicly state,

1384
01:08:09,354 --> 01:08:10,799
"She is not pregnant."

1385
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:12,665
This notion
that these media companies

1386
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:14,898
are just giving us
what the public wants...

1387
01:08:14,926 --> 01:08:17,099
No. They're giving us
what the media companies want.

1388
01:08:17,129 --> 01:08:19,040
They're giving us
what the advertisers want.

1389
01:08:19,064 --> 01:08:21,101
And they're packaging it
in such a way

1390
01:08:21,133 --> 01:08:23,841
as to make it sound like
it's our fault, and it's not.

1391
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:28,215
This is the first time
in human history

that marketers have dictated
our cultural norms and values.

1393

And this is made possible

1394
01:08:34,146 --> 01:08:36,649
by the relaxation of rules
on advertising

1395
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:38,092
in the 1970s and '80s...

1396
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:48,460
and then an amplified
relaxation starting in the '90s.

1397
01:08:52,831 --> 01:08:54,833
This is all about capitalism.

The television industry
targets men 18 to 34

1399
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:02,184
because it's harder to get men
to watch television.

1400
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:05,154
Women watch television.

1401
01:09:05,177 --> 01:09:07,521
So the advertisers encourage
the networks

1402
01:09:07,546 --> 01:09:10,959
to come up with programming
for men 18 to 34

There has been some discussion

1413
01:09:36,274 --> 01:09:40,654
that advertisers are themselves
men who are 18 to 34.

1414
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,818
They are saying,

"This is the kind
of programing we want."

but are largely in the pocket
of the media industry

1457
01:12:08,393 --> 01:12:10,373
because their fortunes
as politicians

1458
01:12:10,395 --> 01:12:12,397
are dependent upon
the media coverage

1459

Without a media system

what you have is not only
widespread content bias,

but what you have is

For years,

1470
01:12:40,325 --> 01:12:42,965
the media industry hid behind
the label of censorship.

1471
01:12:42,994 --> 01:12:46,305
It's not censorship
to say to a media company

1472
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:49,278
that's producing an image
or a website,

01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,906
"That's really offensive
and really inappropriate."

That's the essence
of free speech.

But in a world of a million
channels like we have today,

people try to do more shocking

1477
01:12:58,877 --> 01:13:00,254
to break through the clutter.

1478
01:13:00,278 --> 01:13:02,952
And oftentimes,
they resort to violent images

1479
01:13:02,981 --> 01:13:05,928
or sexually offensive images
or demeaning images

Kilbourne: These images are part
of a cultural climate

in which women are seen
as things, as objects,

1485

and turning a human being
into athing

1486
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:29,516
is almost always the first step

1487
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:32,488

against that person.

not become
emotionally illiterate

1500

and feel that
they can't show emotion,

1501
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:23,456
that they're sissies
if they cry,

1502
01:15:23,488 --> 01:15:27,129
that they can't be

1505
01:15:29,494 --> 01:15:31,132
he's supposed to
make more money than women,

1506
01:15:31,162 --> 01:15:32,835
he's supposed to have
more respect than women

1507
01:15:32,864 --> 01:15:34,844
yet it's not true

then they're criticized for it,

and they're kind of...

1516

I don't know.

1517
01:15:56,154 --> 01:15:58,191
They're looked upon
as, like, less of a man.

Now, how do we expect our sons

1519

to be men of integrity
and of conscience

1520
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,540
and to be
social-justice advocates

1521
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:06,235
and to treat women with respect

1522
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:07,538
and to speak up

1523
01:16:07,565 --> 01:16:08,839

being treated with disrespect

1524

their fathers doing it,

1525
01:16:10,368 --> 01:16:12,211
if they don't see men
in the public culture doing it'?

1526
01:16:12,237 --> 01:16:14,114
It's not fair to put the burdens

1527
01:16:14,138 --> 01:16:16,744
on the shoulders of boys
or even young men.

1528
01:16:16,774 --> 01:16:18,549
Even though
they're part of the solution...

1529
01:16:18,576 --> 01:16:20,556
there's no question...
this is about adult men.

1530
01:16:20,578 --> 01:16:23,354
I definitely am not
one to conform

1531
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:26,328
to the "we need to be
hyper-masculine,"

1532
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:29,059
and we need to be misogynistic"
stereotypes.

1533
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:33,297
And it really puts
a lot of pressure on me

1534
01:16:33,324 --> 01:16:34,769
when I have relatives

1535
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:37,500
who have grown up
with this phenomenon,

1536
01:16:37,528 --> 01:16:40,941
who attempt to put me
on that path,

1537
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:42,444
but I'm not ready for it.

1538
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:43,810
I remember sitting down

1539
01:16:43,835 --> 01:16:46,907
having this conversation
with a woman far wiser than me

1540
01:16:46,938 --> 01:16:48,849
and starting to talk about,

1541
01:16:48,873 --> 01:16:52,013
oh, how bad it is
for women in America.

1542
01:16:52,043 --> 01:16:54,250
And she just looked at me
and listened to me for a while,

1543
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:55,883
and she said,
"Well, I have to tell you, Cory,

1544
01:16:55,914 --> 01:16:57,757
I actually think it's really bad
for men in America."

1545
01:16:57,782 --> 01:16:58,783
And I go, "What do you mean?"

1546
01:16:58,816 --> 01:17:00,124
She started talking to me

1547
01:17:00,151 --> 01:17:02,791
and really putting the spotlight
on me and talking about

1548
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:06,893
how emotionally constipated men
are taught to be very early on,

1549
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:08,336
how we don't have...

1550
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:10,965
haven't learned how to express
ourselves in healthy ways.

1551
01:17:10,995 --> 01:17:15,444
It often does manifest itself
in such awful and violent ways

1552
01:17:15,466 --> 01:17:18,538
but she talked about
a spiritual healing

1553
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:20,276
that was needed for guys.

1554
01:17:30,982 --> 01:17:34,088
Siebel Newsom: I've been trying
to imagine a better world

1555
01:17:34,118 --> 01:17:36,826
for my daughter's generation,

1556
01:17:36,854 --> 01:17:39,562
and I'm beginning to get
some ideas.

1557
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,332
The numbers of women
in leadership positions

1558
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,601
in our country
are still very low.

1559
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:48,771
Siebel Newsom: We have to find
a way to change this culture.

1560
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,077
We need to shift our focus
from the bottom line

1561
01:17:52,103 --> 01:17:54,310
to one of social responsibility.

1562
01:17:54,339 --> 01:17:56,785
We need to challenge
the media conglomerates

1563
01:17:56,808 --> 01:17:59,846
to value women
for more than their youth,

1564
01:17:59,877 --> 01:18:01,515
beauty, and sexuality,

1565
01:18:01,546 --> 01:18:04,584
and we must hold
these companies accountable.

1566
01:18:04,615 --> 01:18:08,461
We need to encourage women
to discover their true power

1567
01:18:08,486 --> 01:18:09,931
so they can become leaders,

1568
01:18:09,954 --> 01:18:12,264
and we must support them
on theirjourney.

1569
01:18:19,664 --> 01:18:23,407
And ultimately, we need to
live our own vision

1570
01:18:23,434 --> 01:18:25,744
of what a woman can be.

1571
01:18:32,777 --> 01:18:35,087
We make a mistake when we say

1572
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:37,957
you have to find role models
who look like you.

1573
01:18:37,982 --> 01:18:42,590
If Sally Ride, my dear friend,
the first female astronaut,

1574
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:46,625
had been waiting for
a female astronaut role model,

1575
01:18:46,657 --> 01:18:48,136
she would never have done it.

1576
01:18:48,192 --> 01:18:49,933
And so I'm a big believer

1577
01:18:49,961 --> 01:18:53,431
in finding your role models
wherever you can find them,

1578
01:18:53,464 --> 01:18:56,070
in people who inspire
and stimulate you

1579
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,511
for whatever reason.

1580
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,744
Growing up, there was nobody who
looked like me on television,

1581
01:19:00,772 --> 01:19:03,378
so I never dreamed
that I could be on television.

1582
01:19:03,408 --> 01:19:05,649
I would love to say,

1583
01:19:05,676 --> 01:19:08,156
"Yeah, there was great women
role models back then."

1584
01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:10,489
Actually, there were none.

1585
01:19:10,515 --> 01:19:14,122
Years later, Connie Chung
went on television

1586
01:19:14,152 --> 01:19:16,063
to report on Watergate,

1587
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:18,328
and I'd say to her,
"Connie, you're my role model."

1588
01:19:18,356 --> 01:19:20,563
And she would say to me,
"Jan, but I'm not that old."

1589
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:22,969
And I'd say, "Yeah, you're a
year older than I am, Connie,"

1590
01:19:22,994 --> 01:19:24,268
and that's good enough for me."

1591
01:19:24,295 --> 01:19:27,538
In terms of my role models
in television news,

1592
01:19:27,565 --> 01:19:30,205
of course Barbara Walters,
Lesley Stahl,

1593
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:32,510
and, believe it or not,
Mary Tyler Moore.

1594
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:34,574
I grew up watching that show

1595
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:37,711
and the notion of a woman
making it on her own

1596
01:19:37,742 --> 01:19:39,517
and working at that TV station,

1597
01:19:39,544 --> 01:19:42,855
I think,
was very, very influential.

1598
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,554
One of the things
that really surprised me

1599
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:49,190
was the number of women in
positions of power in television

1600
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,460
who reached out to me and said,

1601
01:19:50,488 --> 01:19:51,899
"Can I take you
out to breakfast'?

1602
01:19:51,923 --> 01:19:53,095
"Can I take you out to lunch'?

1603
01:19:53,124 --> 01:19:55,001
"Can I make sure
that you have my phone number

1604
01:19:55,026 --> 01:19:57,165
or my e-mail address so that
if anything comes up..."

1605
01:19:57,195 --> 01:19:59,334
And it definitely wasn't like

1606
01:19:59,363 --> 01:20:02,469
the gender Mafia going on
in the media.

1607
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,606
But there was an overt effort
to both welcome me

1608
01:20:05,636 --> 01:20:08,913
and make me know that women
who had gone before me,

1609
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,647
who had fought to get
where they were

1610
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:12,018
were both happy that I was there

1611
01:20:12,043 --> 01:20:13,613
and wanted to be
resources to me,

1612
01:20:13,644 --> 01:20:14,816
and there's an expectation

1613
01:20:14,846 --> 01:20:16,723
that I will be
a resource to other women.

1614
01:20:16,747 --> 01:20:19,728
Siebel Newsom:
When women mentor each other,

1615
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,287
it can be incredibly powerful.

1616
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,301
I got to know
a talented young journalist

1617
01:20:25,323 --> 01:20:27,769
named Jessica Shambora.

1618
01:20:27,792 --> 01:20:30,568
Jessica was covering a story
for Fortune magazine

1619
01:20:30,595 --> 01:20:33,371
about mentorship
that really proves the point.

1620
01:20:33,397 --> 01:20:35,707
I just wanted to introduce
myself to you guys.

1621
01:20:35,733 --> 01:20:36,803
I'm Jessica Shambora.

1622
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:38,404
I'm with Fortune,

1623
01:20:38,436 --> 01:20:40,143
and so I'm gonna be covering
the event tonight.

1624
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:44,313
Minute mentoring is a program
that a couple of the women from.

1625
01:20:44,342 --> 01:20:47,016
Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit
came up with.

1626
01:20:47,044 --> 01:20:50,082
In order to reach
a larger group of young women

1627
01:20:50,114 --> 01:20:52,856
who really had this desire
to be mentored

1628
01:20:52,884 --> 01:20:55,728
and get advice from successful,
professional women,

1629
01:20:55,753 --> 01:20:58,427
they would have sort of
like a speed-dating night,

1630
01:20:58,456 --> 01:21:00,959
except for substitute mentoring
for the dating.

1631
01:21:00,992 --> 01:21:02,994
Meyers: The most important thing
that should drive decisions,

1632
01:21:03,027 --> 01:21:04,370
especially when you're young,

1633
01:21:04,395 --> 01:21:06,636
is what really gets your heart
pitter-pattering.

1634
01:21:06,664 --> 01:21:08,769
In the end, here's the deal.

1635
01:21:08,799 --> 01:21:11,780
You want to be
so good at what you do

1636
01:21:11,802 --> 01:21:13,975
that they can't ignore you.

1637
01:21:14,005 --> 01:21:16,451
Perino: Turn off the television
and read.

1638
01:21:16,474 --> 01:21:18,977
One hour of reality TV
can be fun.

1639
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,513
Four hours is, like, destructive.

1640
01:21:21,546 --> 01:21:22,547
[laughter]

1641
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,685
To thine own self be true.

1642
01:21:24,715 --> 01:21:28,629
Know who you are.
Know what is best about you.

1643
01:21:28,653 --> 01:21:29,996
Have confidence in yourself,

1644
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:31,967
and don't try and be
anybody else.

1645
01:21:31,989 --> 01:21:33,024
On Tony Snow's last day,

1646
01:21:33,057 --> 01:21:34,536
when he was leaving
the White House

1647
01:21:34,559 --> 01:21:37,403
and I was taking over officially
as the White House Press Secretary,

1648
01:21:37,428 --> 01:21:39,465
he came into my office,
and he said,

1649
01:21:39,497 --> 01:21:43,070
"You are better at this
than you think you are."

1650
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,273
Molinari:
I hope you will remember

1651
01:21:45,303 --> 01:21:47,977
that you will help that
next generation of women along.

1652
01:21:48,005 --> 01:21:51,748
It is far overdue that we women
stop criticizing each other,

1653
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:54,620
the decisions and
the life decisions that we make,

1654
01:21:54,645 --> 01:21:56,215
and instead say,
"Alleluia, sister.

1655
01:21:56,247 --> 01:21:58,454
Whatever gets you through.
I'm there to support you."

1656
01:21:58,482 --> 01:22:00,291
[applause]

1657
01:22:02,887 --> 01:22:06,266
You know, if women
don't stand up for each other,

1658
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,564
then no one else will.

1659
01:22:07,592 --> 01:22:10,163
No one's gonna look out
for the interests of women

1660
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:12,196
except other women.

1661
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:17,407
If women spent more time
helping a sick neighbour

1662
01:22:17,435 --> 01:22:19,506
or volunteering
at a homeless shelter,

1663
01:22:19,537 --> 01:22:21,710
focusing on how to use
all their energy

1664
01:22:21,739 --> 01:22:23,946
to solve some
of the worlds problems...

1665
01:22:23,975 --> 01:22:27,286
if they spent a tenth of the
time thinking about those things

1666
01:22:27,311 --> 01:22:29,655
that they do
thinking about their weight,

1667
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,923
I mean, I think we'd solve
all the world's problems

1668
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,429
in a matter of months.

1669
01:22:34,452 --> 01:22:37,228
We're here for an instant
in an eternity,

1670
01:22:37,255 --> 01:22:41,169
and all that really matters
is what we do with that time.

1671
01:22:41,192 --> 01:22:42,899
We have enormous power.

1672
01:22:42,927 --> 01:22:46,374
86% of the purchasing power
in this country

1673
01:22:46,397 --> 01:22:48,502
is in the pockets of women.

1674
01:22:48,532 --> 01:22:49,909
Well, let's use it.

1675
01:22:49,934 --> 01:22:53,006
I mean, let's use it not to buy
those tabloid magazines

1676
01:22:53,037 --> 01:22:55,950
and not to support
the tabloid television shows.

1677
01:22:55,973 --> 01:22:57,316
A consumer's voice

1678
01:22:57,341 --> 01:23:00,845
is maybe the most important,
powerful voice we have

1679
01:23:00,878 --> 01:23:04,587
other than as a citizen
and using our vote.

1680
01:23:04,615 --> 01:23:09,121
Pelosi: Women in America
will be more encouraged

1681
01:23:09,153 --> 01:23:12,760
if they can see young women
who share their experience,

1682
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:16,431
raising a young family,
speaking for them,

1683
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:19,441
identifying with their aspirations.

1684
01:23:19,463 --> 01:23:20,999
We're creating new leaders,

1685
01:23:21,032 --> 01:23:24,275
and they're going to not look
like how they always did...

1686
01:23:24,302 --> 01:23:25,610
an older, white male.

1687
01:23:25,636 --> 01:23:27,616
They're gonna look like a woman,

1688
01:23:27,638 --> 01:23:29,618
and they're gonna look like
people of colour,

1689
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,712
and that is the true reflection
of this country

1690
01:23:32,743 --> 01:23:33,881
and of this world.

1691
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:37,051
Wilson: I got
this little letter one day.

1692
01:23:37,081 --> 01:23:39,083
"Ms. Wilson, Do you realize

1693
01:23:39,116 --> 01:23:40,823
there has never been
a woman president?"

1694
01:23:40,851 --> 01:23:43,832
And then she said,
I will make a great president.

1695
01:23:43,854 --> 01:23:46,596
"I'm practicing my piano,
I'm doing my maths,

1696
01:23:46,624 --> 01:23:50,162
and my name is Alexandra,
which means 'leader of men."'.

1697
01:23:51,962 --> 01:23:53,805
Look at those eyes.

1698
01:23:53,831 --> 01:23:55,242
Oh, honey.

1699
01:23:55,266 --> 01:23:56,973
- Oh!
- Hello.

1700
01:23:57,001 --> 01:24:00,244
Hello.

1701
01:24:00,271 --> 01:24:04,083
- Oh, she's smiling.
- She's smiling.

1702
01:24:04,108 --> 01:24:07,055
Siebel Newsom:
On september18, 2009,

1703
01:24:07,078 --> 01:24:10,082
a began myjourney
into motherhood.

1704
01:24:10,114 --> 01:24:13,994
My husband and I have
the same wishes for Montana

1705
01:24:14,018 --> 01:24:16,965
that any parents have
for their child.

1706
01:24:16,987 --> 01:24:20,833
We want her to pursue her
purpose and passions in life

1707
01:24:20,858 --> 01:24:23,839
and to understand
that what's really important

1708
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:25,499
is who she is on the inside.

1709
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:28,373
And it's critical to us

1710
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:30,538
that all girls grow up
in a world

1711
01:24:30,568 --> 01:24:32,070
where their voice counts,

1712
01:24:32,103 --> 01:24:35,710
where our culture embraces them
in all of their diversity,

1713
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,981
and where they're afforded
equal opportunities

1714
01:24:38,008 --> 01:24:40,852
to succeed in life.

1715
01:24:40,878 --> 01:24:43,654
I keep coming back
to my early years.

1716
01:24:43,681 --> 01:24:46,821
Too often, we girls and women

1717
01:24:46,851 --> 01:24:49,661
don't recognize
our own internal strength

1718
01:24:49,687 --> 01:24:55,467
I now know that we can't let
anyone or anything

1719
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:57,268
take our power away from us.

1720
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:04,642
What do you think, Montana'?

1721
01:25:04,668 --> 01:25:06,409
Are you ready'?

1722
01:25:13,711 --> 01:25:16,351
If you really want things
to change around you,

1723
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,223
here's what you can do.

1724
01:25:21,685 --> 01:25:23,756
Measure yourself
by your accomplishments

1725
01:25:23,788 --> 01:25:25,028
and not by how you look.

1726
01:25:25,055 --> 01:25:28,059
If you and I,
every time we pass a mirror,

1727
01:25:28,092 --> 01:25:30,936
downgrade on how we look
or complain about our looks

1728
01:25:30,961 --> 01:25:33,271
if we remember
that a girl is watching us

1729
01:25:33,297 --> 01:25:35,607
and that's what she's learning.

1730
01:25:35,633 --> 01:25:38,614
Reflect on the ways
you might contribute to sexism.

1731
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:41,776
I include myself in this.
We scrutinize the woman.

1732
01:25:41,806 --> 01:25:44,787
God, look how old she s gott
Look how Grey she's gotten.

1733
01:25:44,809 --> 01:25:46,015
"What is she wearing?"

1734
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:47,386
I think that as women,

1735
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:49,891
we need to stop
that destructive behaviour

1736
01:25:49,914 --> 01:25:53,953
that we inflict upon each other
and, ultimately, onto ourselves.

1737
01:25:53,984 --> 01:25:57,488
Support media that champions
accomplished women.

1738
01:25:57,521 --> 01:25:59,296
We need strong women role models

1739
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:02,099
who are in the media
because they did something,

1740
01:26:02,126 --> 01:26:03,935
because they're doing
great work,

1741
01:26:03,961 --> 01:26:06,202
not because they have
the most bangin' body

1742
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:09,006
and they're
the Sexiest Woman of 2010.

1743
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:10,512
They're the best philanthropist.

1744
01:26:10,534 --> 01:26:12,411
They're the best
in the medical field.

1745
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:14,848
And it's not about
the way they look.

1746
01:26:14,872 --> 01:26:16,749
It's about who they are inside.

1747
01:26:16,774 --> 01:26:19,414
Boycott magazines,
TV shows, and movies

1748
01:26:19,443 --> 01:26:21,582
that objectify
and degrade women.

1749
01:26:21,612 --> 01:26:23,888
Speaking your mind
and criticizing media companies

1750
01:26:23,914 --> 01:26:25,621
when you think
they're doing things

1751
01:26:25,649 --> 01:26:27,492
that are inappropriate
to your children

1752
01:26:27,518 --> 01:26:31,125
is not just your God-given right
as an American, as a parent,

1753
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:33,294
but it's also
entirely consistent

1754
01:26:33,324 --> 01:26:34,860
with the First Amendment.

1755
01:26:34,892 --> 01:26:37,771
Go see movies
written and directed by women.

1756
01:26:37,795 --> 01:26:40,901
And it's important
to go on opening weekend,

1757
01:26:40,931 --> 01:26:43,241
and Friday is best

1758
01:26:43,267 --> 01:26:45,747
because these are the numbers
that Hollywood tracks.

1759
01:26:45,769 --> 01:26:48,943
Write your own stories
and create your own media

1760
01:26:48,973 --> 01:26:52,011
about powerful women
in non-traditional roles.

1761
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:53,282
My daughter, when she was 9,

1762
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,687
she wrote
this little screenplay,

1763
01:26:54,712 --> 01:26:57,158
and she shot a movie, you know
with our little video camera,

1764
01:26:57,181 --> 01:26:58,387
casting her friends.

1765
01:26:58,415 --> 01:27:00,088
It was just so much fun for her.

1766
01:27:00,117 --> 01:27:03,291
And it teaches them that
the media are a construction.

1767
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,628
And they start to understand

1768
01:27:04,655 --> 01:27:06,225
that these are stories
that people are telling them,

1769
01:27:06,257 --> 01:27:08,259
and they can come up with
their own stories to tell back

1770
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:09,828
and very often,
they can be, you know

1771
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,464
subversive stories, resistance stories.

1772
01:27:11,495 --> 01:27:14,704
Teach those around you
to look at the media critically.

1773
01:27:14,732 --> 01:27:17,212
Well, one thing
that I do with my kids is

1774
01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:19,771
I watch these shows with them.

1775
01:27:19,803 --> 01:27:21,441
I say, "Hey, did you notice"

1776
01:27:21,472 --> 01:27:23,918
there's only one female
in that group?"

1777
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:28,151
And, "What if that character
had been a girl instead?"

1778
01:27:28,178 --> 01:27:30,089
And, "Why is she wearing that"

1779
01:27:30,114 --> 01:27:33,152
when she's trying to
rescue somebody?"

1780
01:27:33,183 --> 01:27:36,062
Ask your school to start
a media-literacy course

1781
01:27:36,086 --> 01:27:38,293
focused on gender issues.

1782
01:27:38,322 --> 01:27:39,767
We need media literacy

1783
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:42,737
as much, I think,
as we need to learn to read.

1784
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,068
Our responses should be,

1785
01:27:44,094 --> 01:27:46,540
"Whose perspectives
are framing this story?"

1786
01:27:46,564 --> 01:27:49,841
There are always more
than two sides to every story.

1787
01:27:49,867 --> 01:27:51,642
Are we being sold here'?

1788
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:53,842
Don't be afraid
to challenge your friends

1789
01:27:53,871 --> 01:27:56,613
if you hear them saying
derogatory things about women.

1790
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,244
King said it very eloquently.

1791
01:27:58,275 --> 01:28:00,881
"The problem today
is not the vitriolic words

1792
01:28:00,911 --> 01:28:03,255
"and the evil actions
of the bad people.

1793
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,454
It's the appalling silence
and inaction of the good people."

1794
01:28:06,483 --> 01:28:10,158
Find healthy role models
and be a mentor to others.

1795
01:28:10,187 --> 01:28:12,224
Encourage women
to become leaders.

1796
01:28:12,256 --> 01:28:14,532
And support them
in the process.

1797
01:28:14,558 --> 01:28:17,539
If we see women
who we think would be excellent

1798
01:28:17,561 --> 01:28:18,938
at any political job,

1799
01:28:18,963 --> 01:28:21,637
whether it's dogcatcher,
school-board member,

1800
01:28:21,665 --> 01:28:25,738
or member of Congress,
we need to make that known.

1801
01:28:25,769 --> 01:28:27,180
"Whatever women do,

1802
01:28:27,204 --> 01:28:29,878
"they must do
twice as well as a man

1803
01:28:29,907 --> 01:28:32,410
"to be thought of
as half as good.

1804
01:28:32,443 --> 01:28:35,424
Luckily, that's not too difficult."
