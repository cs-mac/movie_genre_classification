1
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,958
Starling!

2
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,838
Crawford wants to see you
in his office.

3
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,903
Thank you, sir.

4
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,492
- Clarice.
- Hey.

5
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,708
Looking for Crawford?

6
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,111
He should be back soon.
Why don't you wait in his office?

7
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,774
Starling.

8
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,944
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr. Crawford.

9
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,446
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

10
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,585
Your instructors say you're
in the top quarter of your class.

11
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,116
I hope so. They haven't posted
any grades yet.

12
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,890
A job's come up,
and I thought about you.

13
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,721
Not a job, really,
more of an interesting errand.

14
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,122
Sit down.

15
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,686
Yes, sir.

16
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,737
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

17
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:15,372
You grilled me on the bureau's civil
rights record in the Hoover years.

18
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,564
I gave you an A.

19
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,169
A minus, sir.

20
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,108
Double major, psych and criminology,
graduated magna.

21
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,081
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

22
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:32,053
It says when you graduate you want
to work for me in Behavioral Science.

23
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,316
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

24
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,329
We're interviewing
all serial killers in custody...

25
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,362
...for a psycho-behavioral profile.

26
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
It could be a real help
in unsolved cases.

27
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,129
Most of them have been happy
to talk to us.

28
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,264
Do you spook easily, Starling?

29
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,404
Not yet, sir.

30
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,505
The one we want most refuses to help.

31
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,147
I want you to go after him
in the asylum.

32
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,980
Who's the subject?

33
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,654
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.
- "Hannibal the Cannibal."

34
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,449
I don't expect him to talk to you...

35
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,660
...but I have to be able
to say we tried.

36
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,827
If he won't cooperate,
I want straight reporting.

37
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,863
How's he look? How's his cell?

38
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,628
Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?

39
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,137
Here's a dossier on Lecter...

40
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,315
...copy of our questionnaire
and an I.D. for you.

41
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,508
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800, Wednesday.

42
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:34,879
Okay.

43
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,482
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

44
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,422
Lecter's been in prison for years.

45
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,722
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill?

46
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,766
I wish there were. Now, I want
your full attention, Starling.

47
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,395
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

48
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:59,037
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over
all the physical procedures used.

49
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,140
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

50
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,408
You're to tell him nothing personal.

51
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,021
You don't want Hannibal Lecter
inside your head.

52
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,384
Just do your job
but never forget what he is.

53
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,951
And what is that?

54
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,324
<i>Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath.</i>

55
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,923
It's so rare to capture one alive.

56
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,160
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

57
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,066
We get a lot of detectives here...

58
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,542
...but I must say I can't remember
one as attractive.

59
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,582
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

60
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,551
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

61
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,324
I'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton...

62
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:52,395
...but I must talk to Dr. Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

63
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,166
I see. Well, let's make
this quick, then.

64
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,929
We've tried to study him, but he's too
sophisticated for the standard tests.

65
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,370
Oh, my, does he hate us.

66
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,669
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

67
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,874
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

68
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,482
- What do you mean, sir?
- Pretty young woman to turn him on.

69
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:19,924
I don't believe Lecter's seen a woman
in eight years, and you are his taste.

70
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,624
So to speak.

71
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,762
I graduated from UVA.
It's not a charm school.

72
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,229
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

73
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,971
Do not touch or approach the glass.
Pass him nothing but soft paper.

74
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,905
No pencils or pens, no staples
or paper clips in his paper.

75
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,443
Use the sliding food carrier,
no exceptions.

76
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,842
If he passes you anything,
do not accept.

77
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,518
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

78
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,080
I'm going to show you why we insist
on such precautions.

79
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,758
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981...

80
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,861
...he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

81
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,531
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG.

82
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,724
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

83
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,907
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less. Save one of her eyes.

84
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:15,005
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.

85
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,148
- I keep him in here.
- Dr. Chilton.

86
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,314
If Lecter feels
that you're his enemy, then...

87
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,924
Maybe we'll have more luck
if I go by myself.

88
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,625
What do you think?

89
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:36,262
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

90
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,731
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

91
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,945
When she's finished, bring her out.

92
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:20,102
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

93
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,578
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

94
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,442
Nice to meet you. You can hang
your coat there if you like.

95
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,847
Okay. Thank you, I will.

96
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,483
He's past the others.
The last cell.

97
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,455
You keep to the right.

98
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,299
- I put out a chair for you.
- Yes, that's very good, thank you.

99
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,605
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

100
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,793
I can smell your cunt.

101
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,907
Good morning.

102
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,989
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice
Starling. May I speak with you?

103
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,021
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

104
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,585
I am, yes.

105
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,728
May I see your credentials?

106
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:47,386
Certainly.

107
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,230
Closer, please.

108
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,666
Closer.

109
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,153
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

110
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:23,099
I'm still in training at the academy.

111
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:29,238
- Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
- Yes, I'm a student.

112
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:31,464
I'm here to learn from you.

113
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:34,872
Maybe you can decide
if I'm qualified enough to do that.

114
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:41,409
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

115
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,616
Sit. Please.

116
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:57,990
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

117
00:13:58,202 --> 00:14:00,796
"Multiple Miggs" in the next cell.

118
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:04,133
He hissed at you. What did he say?

119
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,478
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

120
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,108
I see.

121
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,474
I myself cannot.

122
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:25,188
You use Evyan skin cream.

123
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,600
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

124
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:33,526
But not today.

125
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,603
Did you do all these drawings?

126
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:44,045
That is the <i>Duomo,</i> seen
from the Belvedere.

127
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,077
Do you know Florence?

128
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,020
All that detail just from memory, sir?

129
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:54,815
Memory, Agent Starling, is what
I have instead of a view.

130
00:14:55,526 --> 00:15:00,122
Perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

131
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:04,768
No, no, no. You were doing fine.

132
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:07,961
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

133
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:12,632
You had established trust with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

134
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:17,507
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

135
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,114
It won't do.

136
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:24,454
I'm only asking you to look at this.
Either you will or you won't.

137
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:28,317
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be
very busy indeed...

138
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:31,051
...if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

139
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,124
Busy hunting that new one,
Buffalo Bill.

140
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,629
What a naughty boy he is.

141
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:40,299
Do you know why he's called
"Buffalo Bill"?

142
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:43,837
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

143
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,307
It started as a joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

144
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:51,743
They said, "This one likes
to skin his humps."

145
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,380
Why do you think...

146
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:58,385
...he removes their skins,
Agent Starling?

147
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,853
Thrill me with your acumen.

148
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,217
It excites him.

149
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:06,487
Most serial killers keep
trophies from their victims.

150
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:09,391
- I didn't.
- No.

151
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,267
No, you ate yours.

152
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:16,038
You send that through now.

153
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:47,536
You think you can dissect
me with this blunt little tool?

154
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,137
No! I thought
that your knowledge...

155
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,640
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

156
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,638
You know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

157
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,281
You look like a rube.

158
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,080
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

159
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:07,118
Nutrition has given you
some length of bone...

160
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:10,487
...but you're not more than one
generation from white trash...

161
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,525
...are you, Agent Starling?

162
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,528
The accent you've tried
so desperately to shed...

163
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,792
...pure West Virginia.

164
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,061
Is your father a coal miner?

165
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,000
Does he stink of the lamp?

166
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,072
I know how quickly the boys found you,
all those tedious, sticky fumblings...

167
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:30,714
...in the back seats of cars,
while you dreamed of getting out.

168
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,279
Getting anywhere.

169
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:36,110
Getting all the way to the FBI.

170
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:42,221
You see a lot, doctor.

171
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,894
But are you strong enough
to point that...

172
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,620
...high-powered
perception at yourself?

173
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:49,758
What about it?

174
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:54,131
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

175
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:56,067
Or maybe you're afraid to.

176
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,716
A census taker once tried to test me.

177
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,252
I ate his liver
with some fava beans...

178
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:14,754
...and a nice Chianti.

179
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,933
You fly back to school now,
little Starling.

180
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,327
Fly, fly, fly.

181
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,220
I bit my wrist...

182
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,658
...so I could die.

183
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:50,154
Look at the blood!

184
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:52,493
Gotcha.

185
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:54,989
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

186
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:03,371
Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

187
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:06,667
I would not have had that happen.
Discourtesy is ugly to me.

188
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,311
- Then do this test!
- No, but I will make you happy.

189
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:12,038
- I'll give you a chance at your love.
- What?

190
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:17,016
Advancement. Listen. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

191
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,418
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

192
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:24,250
I don't think Miggs could
manage again so soon...

193
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,691
...even though he is crazy.
Go now!

194
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:09,399
Hi, Bill.

195
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,906
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

196
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,677
- Did you get any bad guys, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away.

197
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,377
Ah, shoot.

198
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:48,006
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

199
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:51,738
Turn around. Hands behind your back.
Thumbs up.

200
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,549
You're dead, Starling.

201
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:02,218
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

202
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,824
- In the corner.
- Did you check it?

203
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,619
- No, sir.
- That's why you're dead.

204
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:08,955
3-1-0-9?

205
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:13,603
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

206
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,833
Rule 404?

207
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:37,023
Clarice, phone. It's the guru.

208
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:38,854
Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

209
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:41,763
- Starling?
<i>- Sir.</i>

210
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,398
Miggs is dead.

211
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:45,557
Dead?

212
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:47,664
How?

213
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:51,465
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon.

214
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:54,269
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his tongue.

215
00:21:57,314 --> 00:21:58,406
Starling?

216
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:01,975
Yeah. I'm still here, sir. I just...

217
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:03,914
I don't know how to feel about this.

218
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:07,923
You don't have to feel any way.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

219
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,193
Look, I know it got ugly today...

220
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:16,062
...but you mentioned a name,
"Mofet." Any follow-up on her?

221
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,864
He destroyed most of his patients'
histories prior to capture...

222
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:24,563
...so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet.

223
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:28,870
But I thought the "yourself" reference
was too hokey for Lecter...

224
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,243
...so I figured he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book.

225
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,715
And there's a
"Your Self" storage facility...

226
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,411
<i>... right outside</i>
<i>of downtown Baltimore, sir.</i>

227
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,855
Unit 31 was leased...

228
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,325
...for 10 years, prepaid in full.

229
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,464
The contract was in the name...

230
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:53,432
...of a Miss Hester Mofet.

231
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:56,265
So nobody's been
in here since 1980?

232
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:58,270
Not to my knowledge.

233
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:02,608
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

234
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:05,439
Yes, I won't disturb anything,
I promise.

235
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:07,674
I'll be out of here
before you know it.

236
00:23:08,218 --> 00:23:10,516
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

237
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:11,876
Here.

238
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:20,421
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

239
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:22,721
What about him?

240
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:29,071
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.

241
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:30,797
Right.

242
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:34,136
You stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

243
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:09,370
It's stuck. Will you hand me
that flashlight?

244
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,558
If this door should fall down...

245
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:29,531
...or anything else...

246
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,997
...this is the number
for our Baltimore office.

247
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:34,162
They know that you're with me.

248
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:38,066
- Call them if anything should happen.
- Yes, Miss Starling.

249
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,884
Clarice. Here, they're waiting
for you.

250
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:13,619
Watch your step.

251
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:18,858
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, doctor?

252
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,061
Hester Mofet: "The rest of me"?

253
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:26,408
"Miss The Rest Of Me," meaning
that you rented that garage?

254
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:03,270
Thank you.

255
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:05,812
Your bleeding has stopped.

256
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:09,478
How did?

257
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:12,512
It's nothing.

258
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,723
It's just a scratch.

259
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:18,590
Dr. Lecter, whose head
is in that bottle?

260
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,923
Why don't you ask me
about Buffalo Bill?

261
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,826
Do you know something about him?

262
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:27,764
I might if I saw the case file.
You could get that for me.

263
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:31,307
Let's talk about Miss Mofet.
You wanted me to find him.

264
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:37,436
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
A former patient of mine...

265
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:42,577
...whose romantic attachments
ran to, shall we say, the exotic.

266
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:47,385
I did not kill him, merely tucked
him away, very much as I found him...

267
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,957
...after he'd missed
three appointments.

268
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:53,253
If you didn't kill him, who did?

269
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:56,565
Who can say?
Best thing for him, really.

270
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,167
His therapy was going nowhere.

271
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,764
His dress, makeup...

272
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:04,798
Raspail was a transvestite?

273
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:09,672
In life? Oh, no.
Garden variety manic-depressive.

274
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,348
Tedious, very tedious.

275
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,949
I now think of him as an experiment.

276
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:18,677
A fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

277
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:21,687
How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice?

278
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,993
Scared at first, then...

279
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:26,359
...exhilarated.

280
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:29,192
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

281
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,129
Apparently, he likes you
and you like him too.

282
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:34,598
I never thought about it.

283
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:37,800
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

284
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:43,139
He is much older, but do you think
he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

285
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:44,507
Fucking you?

286
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:52,681
That doesn't interest me. It's the
sort of thing that Miggs would say.

287
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:56,249
Not anymore.

288
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,494
Thank you, Barney.

289
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:11,397
What happened to your drawings?

290
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:17,412
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel program.

291
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:20,512
When you leave, they'll turn
the volume way up.

292
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:24,014
Dr. Chilton does enjoy
his petty torments.

293
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:27,051
What did you mean
by "transformation," doctor?

294
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:39,566
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

295
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:43,304
I know they will never
ever let me out while I'm alive.

296
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:46,268
What I want is a view.

297
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:50,276
I want a window where I can see a tree
or even water.

298
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,109
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

299
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:56,683
What did you mean
by "fledgling killer"?

300
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,718
Are you saying he's killed again?

301
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:02,219
I'm offering you a psychological
profile on Buffalo Bill...

302
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:04,519
...based on the case evidence.

303
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,269
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

304
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,101
You know who he is, don't you?

305
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:24,708
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, doctor.

306
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:27,712
All good things to those who wait.

307
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:32,280
I've waited, Clarice. But how long
can you and old Jackie-boy wait?

308
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:38,021
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

309
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:43,284
Hey, little cheeper.

310
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:53,293
I'll be right there.

311
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:13,919
Jeez!

312
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:21,690
Can I help you with that?

313
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:23,799
Would you?

314
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,092
Sure.

315
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:26,699
Thank you.

316
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:29,201
That's all right. You look
kind of handicapped.

317
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:33,399
Yeah. I got it this far, I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

318
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,475
Here, grab this. Up!

319
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:36,870
Okay.

320
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,480
Just set it down. That's good.

321
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:43,482
Get in the truck. I want to
push it all the way up.

322
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:45,779
I really appreciate this.
Thank you.

323
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:50,357
Just go all the way back.

324
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,625
Okay. Is this good?

325
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:54,660
Yeah, that's good.

326
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,862
- That's great.
- Okay.

327
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:01,192
Say, are you
about a size 14?

328
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:02,564
Sorry?

329
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:25,124
Good.

330
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:47,409
Oh, good. Good.

331
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:04,365
<i>Holds!</i>

332
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,462
Ones!

333
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:18,240
Starling!

334
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,051
Outside. Let's go.

335
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:26,820
Cindy, in the ring for Starling.
Let's go!

336
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:37,930
Pack your field gear.

337
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:39,829
- You're going with Crawford.
- Where?

338
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:41,697
Found a girl's body
in West Virginia.

339
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:44,601
Been in the water a week.
Looks like Buffalo Bill.

340
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:59,712
Keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

341
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:03,017
No evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death.

342
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,717
All the mutilation you see
there is postmortem.

343
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:08,453
Okay, three days...

344
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:11,896
...then he shoots them, skins them
and dumps them.

345
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:13,796
Each body in a different river.

346
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:17,131
The water leaves us no trace
evidence of any kind.

347
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,774
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

348
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:22,843
Her body was the only one he
weighted down.

349
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:25,879
So actually, she was
the third girl found.

350
00:36:26,082 --> 00:36:28,312
After her, he got lazy.

351
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,883
Okay, let's see.

352
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:37,287
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

353
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:42,556
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

354
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:04,949
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

355
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:07,622
Well, he's a white male.

356
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:10,793
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

357
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:15,928
He's not a drifter. He's got his
own house, not an apartment.

358
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:19,799
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

359
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:24,440
He's in his 30s or 40s.
He's got real physical strength.

360
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:29,977
Combined with an older man's
self-control. He's cautious, precise.

361
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,274
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

362
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:35,785
Why not?

363
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:40,281
He's got a real taste for it now,
and he's getting better at his work.

364
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,789
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

365
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:46,794
Yes, sir.

366
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:50,762
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information in my report...

367
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:52,365
...or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

368
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:54,365
I'm considering it.

369
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,505
That's why you sent me
in there, isn't it?

370
00:37:57,706 --> 00:37:59,765
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

371
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:05,540
Well, if that was the case, then...

372
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:08,512
...I just wish I was in on it,
that's all.

373
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:12,813
If I'd sent you in there with a real
agenda, Lecter would have known it.

374
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:16,651
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

375
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:51,989
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

376
00:38:52,194 --> 00:38:53,456
These are the FBI people.

377
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:58,725
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

378
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:01,596
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

379
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:05,035
Somebody from the state attorney's
office called you.

380
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:07,300
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now...

381
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:08,771
Sheriff...

382
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:14,244
...this type of sex crime has aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

383
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,042
Know what I mean?

384
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:09,329
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin
from the chapel.

385
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:10,555
We're back here.

386
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:13,929
Tell Lamar to come on when
he's finished playing his music.

387
00:41:14,203 --> 00:41:16,603
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

388
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:19,707
It's working.

389
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:23,207
I need a six-way link up.
Chicago, Detroit...

390
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:24,811
What? What?

391
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:31,447
Excuse me.

392
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:34,918
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen.
Listen here, now.

393
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:37,319
There's things we need to do
for her.

394
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:41,053
Y'all brought her this far, and her
folks would thank you if they could...

395
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:43,857
...for your kindness
and your sensitivity.

396
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,796
Please, go on now,
and let us take care of her.

397
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,062
Go on, now.

398
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,342
Thank you.

399
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:58,776
Thank you.

400
00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:01,813
Okay, good.

401
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,823
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.
Stand by for transmission.

402
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:19,934
Ray.

403
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:35,178
Doctor, Lamar.
Let's take a look at her.

404
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:53,392
Jesus...

405
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:01,867
Okay, Starling.

406
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:29,368
Star-shaped contact entrance
wound over the sternum.

407
00:43:31,306 --> 00:43:33,171
A muzzle stamp at the top.

408
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:36,469
- Wrongful death.
- Wrongful death.

409
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:40,011
She'll have to go to the state
pathologist's at Claxton.

410
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:42,308
Well, I better get back
to that service.

411
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:43,849
Lamar will help you.

412
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,713
Lord Almighty.

413
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:52,685
What else do you see, Starling?

414
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:57,298
Well, she's not local.

415
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:00,332
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's...

416
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:04,772
...glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me.

417
00:44:10,745 --> 00:44:14,010
Two of her fingernails
are broken off...

418
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:16,513
...and there's dirt or grit
under them.

419
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:19,777
It looks like she's tried to claw her
way through something.

420
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:23,017
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

421
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:24,452
Right.

422
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:35,432
Let's do another.

423
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:46,204
She's got something in her throat.

424
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:49,674
When a body comes out
of the water...

425
00:44:49,884 --> 00:44:52,546
...lots of times there's
leaves and things in the mouth.

426
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:25,145
What is that?

427
00:45:25,352 --> 00:45:26,944
Some kind of seedpod?

428
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:30,021
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

429
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:33,218
There's no way that could get
way down in there.

430
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:36,157
Not unless somebody
shoved it in there.

431
00:45:38,566 --> 00:45:40,761
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her.

432
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:42,299
Lamar, give me a hand?

433
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:43,993
Yes, sir, I will.

434
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:52,142
Oh, Jack.
What do you make of these?

435
00:45:52,346 --> 00:45:55,509
Different configuration than
the other victims. Get close-ups.

436
00:45:55,716 --> 00:45:57,308
Victim's skin removed...

437
00:45:57,518 --> 00:46:00,612
...in two diamond-shaped sections
above the buttocks.

438
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:04,018
Exit wound level with the second
or third thoracic vertebrae...

439
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:07,092
<i>... approximately six inches from</i>
<i>the right shoulder blade.</i>

440
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:08,693
Starling...

441
00:46:09,797 --> 00:46:13,289
...when I told that sheriff we
shouldn't talk in front of a woman...

442
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:15,093
...that burned you, didn't it?

443
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:18,760
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

444
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:20,770
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

445
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:23,102
Cops look at you to see how to act.

446
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,777
It matters.

447
00:46:25,012 --> 00:46:26,309
Point taken.

448
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:34,516
Ligature marks found around wrists...

449
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:36,383
<i>... not around the ankles.</i>

450
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,423
<i>This would indicate that</i>
<i>the skinning was postmortem.</i>

451
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:04,342
Time, Pilch. My move.

452
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:09,455
- No fair! You lured him with produce.
- Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

453
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,858
Nice and slow, baby.

454
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:15,558
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

455
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:19,359
Of course it counts. How do you play?

456
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:23,162
Agent Starling?

457
00:47:23,604 --> 00:47:25,299
<i>Where the heck did this come from?</i>

458
00:47:25,673 --> 00:47:27,265
It's practically mush.

459
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:31,706
It was found in a murder victim.
The body was in the Elk River.

460
00:47:31,912 --> 00:47:33,379
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

461
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:34,912
I can't tell you any more.

462
00:47:35,115 --> 00:47:36,309
We heard it on the radio.

463
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:39,816
You mean this is a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!

464
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,648
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

465
00:47:43,057 --> 00:47:45,787
<i>Sphingid Ceratomia,</i> maybe...

466
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:48,621
Boy, he's a big sucker.

467
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,727
Okay...

468
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:52,899
...let's check morphology.

469
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:04,471
What do you do when you're not
detecting, Agent Starling?

470
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:08,304
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

471
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:11,409
You ever go out for
cheeseburgers and beer?

472
00:48:12,653 --> 00:48:14,484
The amusing house wine?

473
00:48:14,688 --> 00:48:16,519
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

474
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:19,223
- Yes.
- Gotcha!

475
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:20,290
What do you got?

476
00:48:20,494 --> 00:48:25,363
Agent Starling,
meet Mr. <i>Acherontia Styx.</i>

477
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:26,658
Weird.

478
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:30,064
Better known to his friends
as the Death's-head moth.

479
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,430
Where does it come from?

480
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:34,574
That's what's strange.
They only live in Asia.

481
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:37,403
They're specially raised from
imported eggs.

482
00:48:37,611 --> 00:48:40,978
Somebody grew this guy.
Fed him honey and nightshade.

483
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:42,978
Kept him warm.

484
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:45,548
Somebody loved him.

485
00:49:19,653 --> 00:49:21,484
Where are you?!

486
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:24,989
Let me out of here!

487
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:32,259
Hey!

488
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,900
Please help me!

489
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,766
Help me, please!

490
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:43,499
Why won't you answer me?! Please!

491
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,711
<i>- Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.</i>
<i>- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.</i>

492
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:52,909
<i>And I'm Tim Langhorn.</i>
<i>Our top story this morning:</i>

493
00:49:53,253 --> 00:49:57,519
<i>Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old</i>
<i>daughter of Senator Ruth Martin...</i>

494
00:49:57,725 --> 00:49:59,056
<i>... listed as a missing person...</i>

495
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:03,753
<i>... is believed to have been kidnapped</i>
<i>by the killer known as "Buffalo Bill."</i>

496
00:50:03,964 --> 00:50:07,400
<i>Memphis police say the missing girl's</i>
<i>blouse has been identified...</i>

497
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:12,163
<i>... sliced up the back, in what has</i>
<i>become a kind of grim calling card.</i>

498
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:16,308
<i>Young Catherine is the only daughter</i>
<i>of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin...</i>

499
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,535
<i>... the Republican senator</i>
<i>from Tennessee.</i>

500
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:22,375
<i>And while her kidnapping is not</i>
<i>considered politically motivated...</i>

501
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,518
<i>... it has stirred the government</i>
<i>to its highest levels.</i>

502
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:28,517
<i>Reached for comment on the ski</i>
<i>slopes of Vermont...</i>

503
00:50:28,722 --> 00:50:32,283
<i>... the president himself said to be,</i>
<i>and I quote, "intensely concerned."</i>

504
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:37,089
<i>Just moments ago, Senator Martin</i>
<i>taped this dramatic personal plea:</i>

505
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:41,097
<i>I'm speaking, now, to the person</i>
<i>holding my daughter.</i>

506
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:45,638
<i>Catherine is very gentle and kind.</i>

507
00:50:46,073 --> 00:50:48,371
<i>Talk to her and you'll see.</i>

508
00:50:49,743 --> 00:50:53,611
<i>You have the power.</i>
<i>You are in charge.</i>

509
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,651
<i>I know you can feel love</i>
<i>and compassion.</i>

510
00:51:00,954 --> 00:51:04,720
<i>You have a wonderful chance</i>
<i>to show the whole world...</i>

511
00:51:04,925 --> 00:51:08,383
<i>... that you can be merciful,</i>
<i>as well as strong.</i>

512
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:11,359
<i>That you're big enough</i>
<i>to treat Catherine better...</i>

513
00:51:11,565 --> 00:51:13,726
<i>... than the world has treated you.</i>

514
00:51:13,934 --> 00:51:15,770
<i>You have that power.</i>

515
00:51:15,903 --> 00:51:20,397
<i>Please. My daughter is Catherine.</i>

516
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:22,667
Boy, that's smart.

517
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:24,344
Jesus, that's really smart.

518
00:51:24,578 --> 00:51:26,546
She keeps repeating the name.

519
00:51:26,747 --> 00:51:31,309
If he sees Catherine as a person, not
an object, it's harder to tear her up.

520
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,250
<i>Please, release my little girl.</i>

521
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:39,084
What you're doing, Ms. Starling,
is coming into my hospital...

522
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:42,854
...and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

523
00:51:43,164 --> 00:51:47,658
Sir, I told you this is just
a routine follow-up on the Raspail...

524
00:51:47,868 --> 00:51:49,961
He is my patient. I have rights.

525
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:51,001
I understand that.

526
00:51:51,205 --> 00:51:55,699
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

527
00:51:56,777 --> 00:51:59,041
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney.

528
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:03,546
Please, either discuss it with him
or let me do my job, you understand?

529
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:12,219
<i>If your profile helps us catch</i>
<i>Buffalo Bill...</i>

530
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:15,054
...in time to save Catherine Martin...

531
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:18,754
...the senator promises you
a transfer to the VA Hospital...

532
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:22,402
...at Oneida Park, New York,
with a view of the woods nearby.

533
00:52:22,603 --> 00:52:25,333
Maximum security still applies,
of course.

534
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:28,299
You'd have reasonable access to books.

535
00:52:29,176 --> 00:52:30,268
Best of all, though...

536
00:52:31,478 --> 00:52:35,505
...one week of the year, you get
to leave the hospital...

537
00:52:35,716 --> 00:52:38,048
...and go here:

538
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:42,555
Plum Island.

539
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,687
Every day of that week,
you may walk on the beach.

540
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:50,091
You may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour...

541
00:52:50,297 --> 00:52:52,925
...under SWAT team surveillance,
of course.

542
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,261
And there you have it.

543
00:52:58,038 --> 00:53:02,270
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

544
00:53:03,244 --> 00:53:05,678
A copy of the senator's offer.

545
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,145
This offer is non-negotiable
and final.

546
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,375
Catherine Martin dies,
you get nothing.

547
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:27,326
Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Center.

548
00:53:29,036 --> 00:53:30,560
Sounds charming.

549
00:53:31,372 --> 00:53:35,001
That's only part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

550
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:37,439
Terns nest there.
There's beautiful...

551
00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:39,772
Terns?

552
00:53:40,748 --> 00:53:43,808
If I help you, Clarice, it will be
"turns" with us too.

553
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:47,112
Quid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

554
00:53:47,321 --> 00:53:49,983
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

555
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,159
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

556
00:53:55,696 --> 00:53:59,188
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little
Catherine is waiting.

557
00:54:00,401 --> 00:54:01,800
Go, doctor.

558
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:05,597
What is your worst memory
of childhood?

559
00:54:07,574 --> 00:54:09,235
The death of my father.

560
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,170
Tell me about it.
And don't lie, or I'll know.

561
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:16,375
He was a town marshal...

562
00:54:17,685 --> 00:54:22,952
...and one night he surprised two
burglars coming out of a drugstore.

563
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:26,158
They shot him.

564
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:28,989
Was he killed outright?

565
00:54:29,196 --> 00:54:33,792
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

566
00:54:34,468 --> 00:54:36,936
My mother died when I was
very young, so...

567
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:42,100
...my father had become
the whole world to me...

568
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:45,676
...and when he left me, I had
nothing. I was 10 years old.

569
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:49,075
You're very frank, Clarice.

570
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:54,149
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

571
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,921
Quid pro quo, doctor.

572
00:54:58,993 --> 00:55:03,521
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

573
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,130
Yes.

574
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:09,734
Big through the hips, roomy?

575
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:11,234
They all were.

576
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:13,132
What else?

577
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,140
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

578
00:55:17,344 --> 00:55:21,872
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

579
00:55:22,082 --> 00:55:23,709
Was it a butterfly?

580
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,747
Yes. A moth.

581
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:33,088
Just like the one we found in
Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

582
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:35,892
Why does he place them there,
doctor?

583
00:55:36,997 --> 00:55:40,524
The significance of the moth
is change.

584
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:44,636
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa...

585
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:47,500
...and from thence into beauty.

586
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:50,643
Our Billy wants to change too.

587
00:55:51,412 --> 00:55:54,540
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

588
00:55:54,748 --> 00:55:57,546
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

589
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:01,483
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

590
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:03,656
No. Tell me why.

591
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:08,224
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

592
00:56:12,132 --> 00:56:16,296
I don't imagine the answer is on
those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

593
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:20,405
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

594
00:56:20,607 --> 00:56:21,904
They had a ranch.

595
00:56:22,543 --> 00:56:23,908
Was it a cattle ranch?

596
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:26,006
Sheep and horses.

597
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:27,810
How long did you live there?

598
00:56:29,016 --> 00:56:29,948
Two months.

599
00:56:30,484 --> 00:56:31,576
Why so briefly?

600
00:56:32,186 --> 00:56:33,244
I ran away.

601
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:37,622
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

602
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:39,793
Did he sodomize you?

603
00:56:40,427 --> 00:56:44,022
No. He was a very decent man.

604
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:47,961
Quid pro quo, doctor.

605
00:56:49,236 --> 00:56:51,602
Billy is not a real transsexual.

606
00:56:51,805 --> 00:56:53,705
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be.

607
00:56:53,907 --> 00:56:56,774
He's tried to be a lot of
things, I expect.

608
00:56:56,977 --> 00:57:00,970
You said I was very close to the way
we'd catch him. What did you mean?

609
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,877
There are three major centers for
transsexual surgery:

610
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:08,180
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

611
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:11,687
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy
applied for sex reassignment...

612
00:57:11,892 --> 00:57:15,658
...at one or all of them,
and been rejected.

613
00:57:15,863 --> 00:57:17,626
On what basis would they reject him?

614
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:23,159
Look for severe childhood
disturbances associated with violence.

615
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:26,271
<i>Our Billy wasn't born</i>
<i>a criminal, Clarice...</i>

616
00:57:26,473 --> 00:57:30,466
<i>... he was made one through</i>
<i>years of systematic abuse.</i>

617
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:34,113
<i>Billy hates his own identity,</i>
<i>you see...</i>

618
00:57:34,314 --> 00:57:37,078
<i>... and he thinks that makes him</i>
<i>a transsexual...</i>

619
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:41,414
<i>... but his pathology is</i>
<i>a thousand times more savage...</i>

620
00:57:41,622 --> 00:57:43,419
<i>... and more terrifying.</i>

621
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:50,925
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

622
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:53,194
Mister, my family will pay cash.

623
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,528
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

624
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:02,207
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

625
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,278
Yes, she will, Precious.
She'll get the hose.

626
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:10,111
Okay, okay, okay.

627
00:58:11,151 --> 00:58:12,982
Okay, I'll do it.

628
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:14,653
Okay.

629
00:58:15,822 --> 00:58:21,158
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges. I promise.

630
00:58:22,162 --> 00:58:24,653
See, my mom is a real important woman.

631
00:58:24,864 --> 00:58:26,855
I guess you already know that.

632
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:30,059
Now it places the lotion
in the basket.

633
00:58:30,503 --> 00:58:31,527
Please!

634
00:58:32,439 --> 00:58:34,498
Please, I want to go home.

635
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:38,402
I want to go home!
Please! Please let me.

636
00:58:38,611 --> 00:58:41,045
It places the lotion in the basket.

637
00:58:41,915 --> 00:58:46,045
I want to see my mommy.
Please let me.

638
00:58:46,786 --> 00:58:50,552
I want to see my mom again.
I want...

639
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:53,248
I want to see my mom.

640
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,494
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

641
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:36,357
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

642
00:59:36,569 --> 00:59:38,332
I don't think so.

643
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:41,600
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

644
00:59:41,808 --> 00:59:44,572
She never heard of any deal with you.

645
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:47,972
They scammed you, Hannibal.

646
00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:50,973
Stand outside.

647
00:59:52,352 --> 00:59:53,944
And shut the door.

648
00:59:54,254 --> 00:59:55,551
Barney.

649
01:00:01,661 --> 01:00:05,927
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

650
01:00:06,132 --> 01:00:07,360
I designed it.

651
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:11,333
Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

652
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:14,598
Identify Buffalo Bill by name...

653
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:16,866
...and if the girl is found in time...

654
01:00:17,076 --> 01:00:21,342
...you'll be transferred to Brushy
Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.

655
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:24,280
Answer me, Hannibal.

656
01:00:26,252 --> 01:00:27,844
You answer me now...

657
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:30,921
...or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

658
01:00:32,892 --> 01:00:35,122
Who is Buffalo Bill?

659
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:38,156
His first name is Louis.

660
01:00:38,598 --> 01:00:42,159
I'll tell the rest to the Senator
herself, but only in Tennessee.

661
01:00:42,368 --> 01:00:44,836
And I have a few conditions of my own.

662
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,533
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

663
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:53,774
<i>Jack, Hannibal Lecter</i>
<i>is being transferred to Memphis.</i>

664
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:55,241
Transferred?

665
01:00:55,448 --> 01:00:59,942
Did you have a trainee make a phony
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

666
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:01,984
I rolled the dice. I had to.

667
01:01:02,188 --> 01:01:04,213
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

668
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:06,358
Paul Krendler's here from Justice.

669
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,392
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

670
01:01:33,987 --> 01:01:35,852
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

671
01:01:36,055 --> 01:01:38,683
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

672
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:40,984
We'll treat you as good
as you treat us.

673
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:44,288
You be a gentleman,
you'll get three hots and a cot.

674
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:49,199
Sir, if you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

675
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,235
Here, sir, use mine.

676
01:02:43,423 --> 01:02:44,412
Senator Martin...

677
01:02:45,758 --> 01:02:47,885
...Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

678
01:02:52,632 --> 01:02:54,224
Dr. Lecter...

679
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:58,159
...I've brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

680
01:02:58,438 --> 01:03:00,929
You'll want to read it before I sign.

681
01:03:04,577 --> 01:03:08,809
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.

682
01:03:09,015 --> 01:03:12,917
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford
have wasted too much time already.

683
01:03:13,419 --> 01:03:16,445
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

684
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:20,788
Let me help you now.
I will trust you when it is all over.

685
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,285
You have my word. Paul.

686
01:03:26,032 --> 01:03:28,500
Buffalo Bill's real name
is Louis Friend.

687
01:03:29,836 --> 01:03:33,795
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May, 1980...

688
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:36,668
...by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

689
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:38,810
They were lovers, you see.

690
01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:43,137
But Raspail had become
very frightened.

691
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:46,785
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient...

692
01:03:46,986 --> 01:03:48,769
...and done things with the skin.

693
01:03:48,804 --> 01:03:50,553
...and done things with the skin.

694
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,949
We need his address
and a physical description.

695
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:57,092
Tell me, senator.

696
01:03:57,564 --> 01:03:59,998
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

697
01:04:00,433 --> 01:04:03,061
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

698
01:04:03,269 --> 01:04:05,635
- Now, wait a minute!
- Yes. I did.

699
01:04:05,939 --> 01:04:08,032
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

700
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:09,230
You son of a bitch!

701
01:04:09,743 --> 01:04:13,543
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

702
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,079
Tell me, Mom, when your
little girl is on the slab...

703
01:04:17,283 --> 01:04:18,750
...where will it tickle you?

704
01:04:19,686 --> 01:04:23,019
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

705
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:26,992
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

706
01:04:27,193 --> 01:04:29,753
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

707
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:31,191
He'd be about 35 now.

708
01:04:31,397 --> 01:04:34,298
He said he lived in Philadelphia
but may have lied.

709
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:36,230
That's all I can remember, Mom.

710
01:04:36,436 --> 01:04:39,098
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

711
01:04:41,574 --> 01:04:44,008
Oh, and senator, just one more thing:

712
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:48,176
Love your suit.

713
01:04:50,316 --> 01:04:53,285
<i>In a meeting earlier today</i>
<i>with Senator Ruth Martin...</i>

714
01:04:53,486 --> 01:04:57,718
...Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the
investigation to find Buffalo Bill.

715
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:02,094
- How do you fit in?
- My unique insight...

716
01:05:02,295 --> 01:05:04,229
...into Lecter made the breakthrough.

717
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,488
Buffalo Bill's name?

718
01:05:05,698 --> 01:05:09,464
His name is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

719
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:12,137
- Can you give us..?
- I'm Dr. Frederick Chilton.

720
01:05:12,338 --> 01:05:13,896
- Spell it?
- That's C-H...

721
01:05:15,575 --> 01:05:17,566
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

722
01:05:17,777 --> 01:05:20,268
Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

723
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,745
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've received death threats.

724
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:25,542
I understand, sir.

725
01:05:31,658 --> 01:05:33,285
Log in and check your weapon.

726
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:36,957
I can't take all the credit myself.

727
01:05:37,163 --> 01:05:39,461
Senator Martin,
Justice Department, FBI...

728
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:43,102
...folks at the Baltimore State
Hospital. Now for the hard part:

729
01:05:43,303 --> 01:05:45,100
Apprehending the suspect.

730
01:05:45,605 --> 01:05:47,664
Excuse me, I have to catch a flight.

731
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:54,106
Command desk, Officer Jacobs.

732
01:06:03,056 --> 01:06:06,116
- Is it true what they're saying?
- Huh?

733
01:06:07,126 --> 01:06:09,151
He's some kind of vampire?

734
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:13,626
They don't have a name for what he is.

735
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:16,429
You do know the rules, ma'am?

736
01:06:17,136 --> 01:06:19,468
Yes, I've questioned him before.

737
01:06:22,976 --> 01:06:23,965
Go ahead.

738
01:07:01,481 --> 01:07:03,449
Good evening, Clarice.

739
01:07:05,018 --> 01:07:07,714
I thought you might like
your drawings back.

740
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,381
Just until you get your view.

741
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:15,356
How very thoughtful.

742
01:07:16,296 --> 01:07:19,094
Or did Jack Crawford
send you for one last wheedle...

743
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:21,529
...before you're both
booted off the case?

744
01:07:22,035 --> 01:07:24,230
No. I came because I wanted to.

745
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:31,342
People will say we're in love.

746
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:37,972
Anthrax Island.

747
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:41,153
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

748
01:07:41,354 --> 01:07:42,343
Yours?

749
01:07:43,056 --> 01:07:44,080
Yes.

750
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,848
Yeah.

751
01:07:46,492 --> 01:07:48,289
That was good.

752
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:50,428
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

753
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,655
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

754
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:55,663
Your anagrams are showing, doctor.

755
01:07:56,502 --> 01:07:58,026
Louis Friend?

756
01:07:58,738 --> 01:08:01,935
Iron sulfide,
also known as fool's gold.

757
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:06,277
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you
need to get more fun out of life.

758
01:08:06,746 --> 01:08:09,715
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

759
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:11,383
Please continue now.

760
01:08:11,985 --> 01:08:14,476
Well, I've read the case files.
Have you?

761
01:08:14,854 --> 01:08:17,914
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

762
01:08:18,124 --> 01:08:21,025
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice.

763
01:08:21,227 --> 01:08:24,321
Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

764
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:27,988
Of each particular thing, ask:
What is it in itself?

765
01:08:28,201 --> 01:08:29,998
What is its nature?

766
01:08:30,436 --> 01:08:34,338
What does he do, this man you seek?

767
01:08:35,842 --> 01:08:37,070
He kills women.

768
01:08:37,276 --> 01:08:40,245
No. That is incidental.

769
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:46,344
What is the principle thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

770
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:48,114
Anger...

771
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:53,783
...social acceptance
and sexual frustration...

772
01:08:53,993 --> 01:08:54,982
No!

773
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:57,586
He covets.

774
01:08:58,464 --> 01:09:00,022
That is his nature.

775
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:02,865
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

776
01:09:03,636 --> 01:09:06,264
Do we seek out things to covet?

777
01:09:06,873 --> 01:09:08,773
Make an effort to answer now.

778
01:09:08,975 --> 01:09:11,443
No, we just...

779
01:09:11,644 --> 01:09:14,977
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

780
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:18,480
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

781
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:22,619
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

782
01:09:23,322 --> 01:09:25,654
All right, yes.
Now, please tell me how.

783
01:09:25,858 --> 01:09:27,325
No.

784
01:09:28,061 --> 01:09:30,029
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

785
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:32,697
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

786
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:35,857
Why did you leave that ranch?

787
01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:40,196
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

788
01:09:40,406 --> 01:09:42,931
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

789
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:45,007
This is all the time you'll have.

790
01:09:45,211 --> 01:09:47,509
Later. Please listen.
We've only got five...

791
01:09:47,713 --> 01:09:51,084
No! I will listen now.

792
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:56,155
Your father's murder orphaned you
when you were 10.

793
01:09:56,355 --> 01:10:01,190
You went to live with cousins on a
sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And?

794
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:05,658
And one morning I just ran away.

795
01:10:06,432 --> 01:10:09,924
Not "just," Clarice.
What set you off?

796
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:11,728
You started at what time?

797
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:13,769
Early, still dark.

798
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:16,567
Then something woke you.
Was it a dream?

799
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:17,868
What was it?

800
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:21,175
I heard a strange noise.

801
01:10:22,415 --> 01:10:23,780
What was it?

802
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,612
It was...

803
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:28,309
...screaming.

804
01:10:29,889 --> 01:10:32,585
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

805
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:34,626
What did you do?

806
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:36,492
I went...

807
01:10:36,696 --> 01:10:39,392
...downstairs. Outside.

808
01:10:41,534 --> 01:10:44,128
I crept up into the barn.

809
01:10:44,337 --> 01:10:47,534
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

810
01:10:48,674 --> 01:10:51,973
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

811
01:10:53,412 --> 01:10:54,709
Lambs.

812
01:10:55,915 --> 01:10:57,576
They were screaming.

813
01:10:58,151 --> 01:11:00,915
They were slaughtering
the spring lambs?

814
01:11:01,454 --> 01:11:03,183
And they were screaming.

815
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:06,219
And you ran away?

816
01:11:06,425 --> 01:11:10,259
No. First I tried to free them.

817
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:13,364
I opened the gate to their pen.

818
01:11:13,566 --> 01:11:17,002
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

819
01:11:17,203 --> 01:11:19,694
But you could and you did, didn't you?

820
01:11:20,506 --> 01:11:23,907
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

821
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,907
Where were you going, Clarice?

822
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:29,104
I don't know. I didn't have
any food, any water...

823
01:11:29,315 --> 01:11:31,943
...and it was very cold.
It was very cold.

824
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:35,279
I thought...

825
01:11:36,189 --> 01:11:38,749
I thought if I could save just one...

826
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,352
...but he was so heavy.

827
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:44,952
He was so heavy.

828
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:54,205
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

829
01:11:57,376 --> 01:12:01,574
The rancher was so angry he sent me
to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

830
01:12:02,415 --> 01:12:04,406
I never saw the ranch again.

831
01:12:05,117 --> 01:12:07,847
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

832
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:11,086
They killed him.

833
01:12:11,457 --> 01:12:13,652
You still wake up sometimes,
don't you?

834
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,655
Wake up in the dark...

835
01:12:16,329 --> 01:12:19,162
...and hear the screaming
of the lambs?

836
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:20,857
Yes.

837
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:25,166
And you think if you save
poor Catherine...

838
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:28,932
...you can make them stop, don't you?
You think if Catherine lives...

839
01:12:29,141 --> 01:12:32,338
...you won't wake up
in the dark ever again...

840
01:12:32,545 --> 01:12:35,412
...to that awful screaming
of the lambs.

841
01:12:36,582 --> 01:12:37,947
I don't know.

842
01:12:38,684 --> 01:12:40,015
I don't know.

843
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:44,121
Thank you, Clarice.

844
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:45,881
Thank you.

845
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:48,183
Tell me his name, doctor.

846
01:12:55,134 --> 01:12:57,398
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

847
01:12:58,004 --> 01:12:59,562
I think you know each other.

848
01:13:01,807 --> 01:13:03,331
Okay.

849
01:13:03,976 --> 01:13:06,103
- We found her.
- Let's go.

850
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:08,075
It's your turn, doctor.

851
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:10,142
- Out!
- Tell me his name.

852
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:13,182
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders
to put you on a plane.

853
01:13:13,386 --> 01:13:14,546
Come on, now.

854
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,788
Brave Clarice.

855
01:13:17,123 --> 01:13:20,684
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

856
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:22,724
Tell me his name, doctor!

857
01:13:22,928 --> 01:13:24,225
Clarice!

858
01:13:25,598 --> 01:13:27,361
Your case file.

859
01:13:29,035 --> 01:13:30,127
Hey!

860
01:13:32,305 --> 01:13:33,795
Goodbye, Clarice.

861
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:41,702
Ready when you are, doc.

862
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:44,201
Just another minute, please.

863
01:14:53,052 --> 01:14:55,486
Son of a bitch demanded
a second dinner.

864
01:14:55,688 --> 01:14:57,519
Lamb chops, extra rare.

865
01:14:57,723 --> 01:15:02,319
Wonder what he wants for breakfast?
Some damn thing from the zoo?

866
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:25,350
Good evening, gentlemen.

867
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:27,513
Okay, doc. Grab some floor.

868
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,779
Same drill as before, please.

869
01:15:36,629 --> 01:15:38,927
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

870
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:56,640
Okay.

871
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:04,956
Hand me that, would you?

872
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:11,856
Thanks.

873
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:17,758
Mind the drawings, please.

874
01:16:21,006 --> 01:16:22,030
Thank you.

875
01:16:46,598 --> 01:16:49,192
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me!

876
01:16:55,841 --> 01:16:57,274
Jesus Christ!

877
01:18:16,054 --> 01:18:18,488
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

878
01:18:27,933 --> 01:18:29,867
What is this shit?

879
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:34,032
Did somebody go up on five?

880
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:38,039
- No, nobody went up.
- Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

881
01:18:40,946 --> 01:18:45,007
CP, shots fired on five.
Repeat, shots fired on five.

882
01:18:45,217 --> 01:18:46,548
Sergeant Tate!

883
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:48,779
<i>Proceed. Shots fired on five.</i>

884
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:51,015
Holy shit!

885
01:18:51,223 --> 01:18:53,020
- What the hell?
- Bitch!

886
01:18:53,392 --> 01:18:54,381
Shut up!

887
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,820
Bobby, get the vest.

888
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:57,495
Right, sarge.

889
01:18:57,829 --> 01:18:59,990
- Brady, Howard, cover...
- Look!

890
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,358
It stopped.

891
01:19:05,637 --> 01:19:07,298
Seal off a 10-block radius.

892
01:19:07,506 --> 01:19:10,475
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance, double quick.

893
01:19:10,676 --> 01:19:11,836
We're going up.

894
01:19:40,839 --> 01:19:42,363
Pembry?!

895
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:45,299
Boyle?!

896
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,655
Oh, God!

897
01:20:06,798 --> 01:20:07,856
Go.

898
01:20:15,674 --> 01:20:17,073
- Clear.
- Clear.

899
01:20:17,275 --> 01:20:18,674
Command post.

900
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:20,635
Two officers down.

901
01:20:20,846 --> 01:20:22,336
- Clear!
- Clear!

902
01:20:22,781 --> 01:20:23,975
Lecter's gone, sarge.

903
01:20:24,182 --> 01:20:25,979
Prisoner is missing.

904
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:27,651
Boyle's gun is gone.

905
01:20:27,986 --> 01:20:30,454
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

906
01:20:30,655 --> 01:20:32,452
He stripped the bed.

907
01:20:32,891 --> 01:20:35,655
Might be making a rope.
Check all the windows.

908
01:20:35,861 --> 01:20:38,159
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

909
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,120
He's alive.

910
01:20:40,732 --> 01:20:42,996
Sergeant Tate! He's alive!

911
01:20:43,368 --> 01:20:46,565
Get ahold of him and feel his hands.
Talk to him!

912
01:20:47,072 --> 01:20:48,096
What do I say?

913
01:20:48,306 --> 01:20:51,241
It's Jim Pembry.
Now talk to him, damn it!

914
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,408
Lecter is missing and armed.

915
01:20:54,613 --> 01:20:58,447
- Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?
- He took Boyle's gun.

916
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:01,676
Pembry got off one round.
There's a chance Lecter's hit.

917
01:21:01,887 --> 01:21:03,821
Keep breathing in and out.

918
01:21:04,022 --> 01:21:07,583
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.

919
01:21:08,226 --> 01:21:11,127
Yeah, you look... Look real good.

920
01:21:28,113 --> 01:21:29,273
- You ready?
- Let's go!

921
01:21:29,481 --> 01:21:31,472
- Let's do it.
- Okay, let's go!

922
01:21:42,394 --> 01:21:44,521
Looking good. You're gonna make it.

923
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:46,720
Everything's just fine.

924
01:21:46,932 --> 01:21:49,162
- I need that IV now!
- Lactated Ringer's.

925
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:51,733
Can we get the strap?
Where's the oxygen?

926
01:21:51,937 --> 01:21:55,668
Doing good, buddy. That's right.
Stay with me here.

927
01:21:57,008 --> 01:21:59,772
We're losing him!
Downstairs, quickly!

928
01:22:00,111 --> 01:22:01,578
And up!

929
01:22:02,814 --> 01:22:03,872
- Elevator!
- This way!

930
01:22:04,082 --> 01:22:06,744
- Out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

931
01:22:10,522 --> 01:22:12,080
<i>CP to Tate.</i>

932
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:15,157
Roger, lieutenant. Tate here.

933
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,988
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

934
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:20,431
He seems to be hanging on.

935
01:22:21,132 --> 01:22:23,225
Top three floors secured.

936
01:22:23,768 --> 01:22:25,827
Main stairwell secured.

937
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:28,705
We think he's on two.

938
01:22:41,953 --> 01:22:44,148
<i>Tate, you still with me?</i>

939
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:48,224
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

940
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:51,363
That's all for now. Over.

941
01:23:09,848 --> 01:23:12,408
He's on the roof of the elevator.

942
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,451
Okay, guys.

943
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:34,060
I see him.

944
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:36,905
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

945
01:23:37,742 --> 01:23:40,540
- One warning. We need him alive.
<i>- Got it.</i>

946
01:23:41,646 --> 01:23:42,874
Lecter?

947
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:45,115
Put your hands on your head.

948
01:23:47,485 --> 01:23:48,952
One in the leg.

949
01:24:00,031 --> 01:24:01,555
No movement.

950
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:05,463
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

951
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:07,564
We're opening the hatch.

952
01:24:08,406 --> 01:24:09,395
Watch his hands.

953
01:24:09,607 --> 01:24:12,542
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.

954
01:24:12,744 --> 01:24:13,802
<i>Got it.</i>

955
01:24:39,938 --> 01:24:41,872
Memphis General, this is Unit 26.

956
01:24:42,073 --> 01:24:44,633
We're inbound with
a 50-year-old male officer...

957
01:24:44,843 --> 01:24:46,970
...with severe facial lacerations.

958
01:24:47,178 --> 01:24:50,306
He had grand mal seizure activity.
He's postdictal now.

959
01:24:50,515 --> 01:24:52,676
<i>- I copy.</i>
<i>- Vital signs are good.</i>

960
01:24:52,884 --> 01:24:54,545
- Pressure is 130/90.
- Ninety?

961
01:24:54,752 --> 01:24:56,913
Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse, 84.

962
01:24:57,188 --> 01:24:59,486
We got him
on lactated Ringer's running...

963
01:24:59,691 --> 01:25:01,989
...and the patient
is on 10 liters of oxygen.

964
01:25:03,127 --> 01:25:04,287
Watch it!

965
01:25:08,633 --> 01:25:12,034
The ambulance was found in
a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

966
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,704
The crew was dead.

967
01:25:14,772 --> 01:25:16,399
He killed a tourist too.

968
01:25:16,608 --> 01:25:18,473
Got his clothes, cash.

969
01:25:18,877 --> 01:25:20,674
By now he could be anywhere.

970
01:25:20,879 --> 01:25:22,870
- He won't come after me.
- Oh, really?

971
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,207
He won't.

972
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:26,445
I can't explain it.

973
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:28,881
He would consider that rude.

974
01:25:29,354 --> 01:25:31,185
It's over. She's dead.

975
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:33,016
It's not your fault.

976
01:25:33,224 --> 01:25:37,854
Lecter said everything we need to
catch him with is here, only I can't...

977
01:25:38,062 --> 01:25:39,859
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

978
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:41,826
He's here, Ardelia.

979
01:26:11,462 --> 01:26:13,430
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

980
01:26:15,466 --> 01:26:19,835
"Doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random?

981
01:26:20,038 --> 01:26:23,838
Like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Ta. Hannibal Lecter."

982
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:27,034
"Desperately random."
What does he mean?

983
01:26:27,245 --> 01:26:30,146
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's a pattern here.

984
01:26:31,249 --> 01:26:34,480
But there's no pattern
or the computers would've nailed it.

985
01:26:34,686 --> 01:26:37,120
They're even found in random order.

986
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:41,156
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

987
01:26:41,593 --> 01:26:43,493
- Fredrica Bimmel.
- Right.

988
01:26:43,695 --> 01:26:47,028
From Belvedere, Ohio.

989
01:26:47,231 --> 01:26:50,792
The first girl taken,
third body found. Why?

990
01:26:51,002 --> 01:26:53,129
She didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

991
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:56,671
What did Lecter say
about the "first principles"?

992
01:26:56,874 --> 01:26:58,432
Simplicity.

993
01:26:58,643 --> 01:27:01,908
What does this guy do? He covets.

994
01:27:02,113 --> 01:27:04,604
How do we first start to covet?

995
01:27:04,816 --> 01:27:06,511
We covet what we see.

996
01:27:06,718 --> 01:27:08,345
Every day.

997
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:11,583
Hot damn, Clarice.

998
01:27:12,056 --> 01:27:13,318
He knew her.

999
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,099
Mr. Bimmel?

1000
01:28:30,301 --> 01:28:31,529
That's me.

1001
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:34,531
Hello, I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1002
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:41,708
I appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1003
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,307
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1004
01:28:44,515 --> 01:28:47,450
Police been back here
so many times already.

1005
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:51,923
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

1006
01:28:52,323 --> 01:28:54,018
She left the interview okay.

1007
01:28:54,358 --> 01:28:55,950
She never come home.

1008
01:28:58,796 --> 01:29:00,957
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1009
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:02,388
Upstairs.

1010
01:29:03,067 --> 01:29:04,557
<i>Door to the left.</i>

1011
01:31:49,567 --> 01:31:53,196
<i>He's making himself a woman suit.</i>
<i>Out of real women!</i>

1012
01:31:53,404 --> 01:31:54,462
And he can sew!

1013
01:31:54,672 --> 01:31:57,664
He's very skilled.
He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...

1014
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,638
<i>- Starling!</i>
- That's why they're big.

1015
01:31:59,844 --> 01:32:02,074
He keeps them alive
so he can starve them...

1016
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:03,712
...loosen their skin and...

1017
01:32:03,914 --> 01:32:06,439
<i>Starling!</i>
<i>We know who and where he is!</i>

1018
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:08,140
<i>We're on our way right now.</i>

1019
01:32:08,352 --> 01:32:11,253
<i>- Where?</i>
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1020
01:32:11,455 --> 01:32:14,015
Be on the ground
in 45 minutes with HRT.

1021
01:32:14,225 --> 01:32:16,420
That's great news, sir. But how..?

1022
01:32:16,627 --> 01:32:20,188
<i>We fed the names Johns Hopkins</i>
<i>came up with into Known Offenders.</i>

1023
01:32:20,397 --> 01:32:24,333
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
a.k.a. John Grant.

1024
01:32:24,535 --> 01:32:28,232
<i>Lecter's description was accurate.</i>
<i>He just lied about the name.</i>

1025
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:30,532
Customs had some paper on him.

1026
01:32:30,741 --> 01:32:33,801
They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX.

1027
01:32:34,011 --> 01:32:36,070
Live caterpillars from Suriname.

1028
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,272
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1029
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:42,751
Chicago is only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

1030
01:32:42,953 --> 01:32:44,648
No, there's not enough time.

1031
01:32:44,855 --> 01:32:47,050
We want him for murder,
not kidnapping.

1032
01:32:47,258 --> 01:32:49,522
Link him to Bimmel
before he's indicted.

1033
01:32:49,727 --> 01:32:53,754
- See what you can find in Belvedere.
- Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1034
01:32:53,964 --> 01:32:55,295
<i>Starling.</i>

1035
01:32:55,699 --> 01:32:59,294
We wouldn't have found him
without you. Nobody will forget that.

1036
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:01,562
<i>Least of all me.</i>

1037
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:03,800
Thank you, sir.

1038
01:33:04,008 --> 01:33:06,340
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1039
01:33:07,611 --> 01:33:09,044
Mr. Crawford?

1040
01:33:21,559 --> 01:33:23,857
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1041
01:33:24,161 --> 01:33:26,095
I got a better idea.

1042
01:33:47,451 --> 01:33:50,079
Okay, Precious.
Time for a little treat.

1043
01:34:03,033 --> 01:34:04,523
Precious!

1044
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:08,633
Come on, girl!

1045
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,165
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious.

1046
01:34:21,418 --> 01:34:23,147
Come on, Precious.

1047
01:34:23,354 --> 01:34:26,221
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1048
01:34:26,423 --> 01:34:27,685
Come and get it!

1049
01:34:34,698 --> 01:34:36,131
Precious!

1050
01:34:36,934 --> 01:34:39,664
Are you up there, you little shit?

1051
01:34:40,204 --> 01:34:43,073
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1052
01:34:49,512 --> 01:34:50,877
Precious!

1053
01:34:51,081 --> 01:34:53,242
Please come. Come on.

1054
01:35:01,057 --> 01:35:03,025
Come on, Precious.

1055
01:35:14,904 --> 01:35:16,394
Would you fuck me?

1056
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,809
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1057
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:23,274
Come on. Come on! Come on!

1058
01:35:23,746 --> 01:35:24,940
I'd fuck me.

1059
01:35:25,748 --> 01:35:26,737
Come on.

1060
01:35:31,054 --> 01:35:35,650
I'd fuck me hard.
I'd fuck me so hard.

1061
01:35:39,829 --> 01:35:41,091
No!

1062
01:36:42,091 --> 01:36:45,993
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

1063
01:36:46,196 --> 01:36:48,357
I mean, better places than this?

1064
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:51,724
Sometimes you do.

1065
01:36:52,602 --> 01:36:56,936
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1066
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:01,076
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1067
01:37:01,277 --> 01:37:03,837
She thought it was such hot shit.

1068
01:37:04,247 --> 01:37:06,545
What did she know? Big dummy.

1069
01:37:06,749 --> 01:37:10,913
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention
a man named Jamie Gumb?

1070
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,781
Or a Jame Gumb?

1071
01:37:13,556 --> 01:37:15,820
- How about John Grant?
- No.

1072
01:37:16,025 --> 01:37:18,357
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know?

1073
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:21,121
No way. If she had a guy,
I'd have known.

1074
01:37:21,331 --> 01:37:22,889
Sewing was her life.

1075
01:37:23,633 --> 01:37:25,191
Did you ever work together?

1076
01:37:25,401 --> 01:37:30,134
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1077
01:37:30,673 --> 01:37:34,234
Can I get Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

1078
01:38:02,338 --> 01:38:04,101
So powerful.

1079
01:38:04,307 --> 01:38:05,934
So beautiful.

1080
01:38:11,047 --> 01:38:12,480
Precious?

1081
01:38:18,288 --> 01:38:19,277
Precious?

1082
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:21,514
Down here, you sack of shit!

1083
01:38:30,199 --> 01:38:31,723
- Put her in that bucket.
- No!

1084
01:38:31,934 --> 01:38:34,801
You get me a telephone
and lower it down here, now!

1085
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:41,899
Oh, poodlie-poo. Precious?
Darling, are you all right?

1086
01:38:42,111 --> 01:38:45,103
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1087
01:38:49,452 --> 01:38:52,080
She broke her leg on the way down.
She's licking...

1088
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,279
Hey! Don't you hurt my dog!

1089
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:56,390
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1090
01:38:56,592 --> 01:38:58,753
You don't know what pain is!

1091
01:39:04,167 --> 01:39:07,762
Get me that telephone
or I'll kill him!

1092
01:39:12,308 --> 01:39:16,540
- Oh, fuck!
- You better get me that telephone!

1093
01:39:16,746 --> 01:39:18,839
I'm gonna do it, mister!!

1094
01:39:19,048 --> 01:39:23,109
I'm gonna snap her neck off,
I swear to God!

1095
01:39:23,586 --> 01:39:25,577
All right, mister. I'm doing it!

1096
01:39:49,145 --> 01:39:51,375
Okay, I'm coming.

1097
01:39:52,782 --> 01:39:54,147
We're going in.

1098
01:39:59,021 --> 01:40:01,216
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.

1099
01:40:01,424 --> 01:40:03,722
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1100
01:40:04,394 --> 01:40:06,487
FBI! Everybody down!

1101
01:40:07,463 --> 01:40:09,397
Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1102
01:40:09,599 --> 01:40:12,067
Excuse me, sir.
I need to speak with you.

1103
01:40:13,269 --> 01:40:15,032
- Clear!
- Clear!

1104
01:40:15,838 --> 01:40:17,863
What's the problem, officer?

1105
01:40:18,074 --> 01:40:20,804
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

1106
01:40:24,147 --> 01:40:25,748
There's no one here, Jack.

1107
01:40:28,417 --> 01:40:29,752
Clarice.

1108
01:40:29,885 --> 01:40:30,977
Your name is?

1109
01:40:31,186 --> 01:40:32,312
Oh, Jack Gordon.

1110
01:40:32,521 --> 01:40:34,386
Mr. Gordon. Good.

1111
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:37,821
Fredrica worked for Mrs. Lippman.
Did you know her?

1112
01:40:38,794 --> 01:40:40,455
No, uh-uh.

1113
01:40:41,029 --> 01:40:42,496
Oh, wait.

1114
01:40:42,798 --> 01:40:44,993
Was she a great big fat person?

1115
01:40:45,901 --> 01:40:47,528
Yes, she was a big girl, sir.

1116
01:40:47,736 --> 01:40:49,226
Yeah, I may have...

1117
01:40:49,438 --> 01:40:51,929
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1118
01:40:53,776 --> 01:40:56,142
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help.

1119
01:40:56,345 --> 01:40:58,074
I got his card in here.

1120
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,508
You want to come in?

1121
01:40:59,715 --> 01:41:00,807
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

1122
01:41:01,016 --> 01:41:02,176
Thank you.

1123
01:41:21,036 --> 01:41:23,095
Are you close to catching somebody?

1124
01:41:24,873 --> 01:41:25,862
Yes.

1125
01:41:26,074 --> 01:41:27,268
We may be.

1126
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:30,305
Did you...

1127
01:41:31,246 --> 01:41:34,841
...take over this place after
Mrs. Lippman died, is that right?

1128
01:41:36,151 --> 01:41:40,485
Yeah, I bought this house
two years ago.

1129
01:41:41,757 --> 01:41:45,090
Did she leave any records,
any business records...

1130
01:41:45,294 --> 01:41:49,128
...tax forms, lists of employees?

1131
01:41:49,765 --> 01:41:51,699
No, nothing like that at all.

1132
01:41:54,069 --> 01:41:56,799
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1133
01:41:57,005 --> 01:42:00,406
The police around here don't seem
to have the first clue.

1134
01:42:09,985 --> 01:42:14,684
Have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1135
01:42:16,124 --> 01:42:17,148
No.

1136
01:42:19,795 --> 01:42:21,126
No, we don't.

1137
01:42:32,507 --> 01:42:33,974
Here's that number.

1138
01:42:35,477 --> 01:42:37,138
Very good, Mr. Gordon.

1139
01:42:37,346 --> 01:42:39,177
May I use your phone, please?

1140
01:42:47,322 --> 01:42:49,347
Sure you can use my phone.

1141
01:42:50,859 --> 01:42:52,019
Freeze!

1142
01:42:52,861 --> 01:42:56,922
Put your hands over your head
and turn around. Spread your legs.

1143
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,362
Spread your legs!

1144
01:42:59,568 --> 01:43:01,297
Put your hands in the back...

1145
01:43:01,503 --> 01:43:02,970
Freeze!

1146
01:44:15,544 --> 01:44:17,535
Hey!

1147
01:44:37,499 --> 01:44:39,831
Are you there?

1148
01:44:41,236 --> 01:44:44,364
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1149
01:45:03,558 --> 01:45:05,185
Catherine Martin?

1150
01:45:05,394 --> 01:45:06,759
Yes!

1151
01:45:08,463 --> 01:45:09,725
FBI.

1152
01:45:09,931 --> 01:45:11,228
You're safe.

1153
01:45:11,433 --> 01:45:14,402
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1154
01:45:29,518 --> 01:45:31,383
You're all right. Where is he?

1155
01:45:31,586 --> 01:45:34,555
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!

1156
01:45:34,756 --> 01:45:37,919
Catherine, you've gotta be quiet!
Now, shut that dog up!

1157
01:45:38,126 --> 01:45:40,185
Just get me out of here!

1158
01:45:41,296 --> 01:45:42,456
Oh, my God.

1159
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:48,927
Catherine, I'm gonna get you out.
But right now, you listen to me.

1160
01:45:49,137 --> 01:45:50,616
I've gotta leave. I'll be right back.

1161
01:45:50,651 --> 01:45:52,095
I've gotta leave. I'll be right back.

1162
01:45:52,206 --> 01:45:55,369
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch! No!

1163
01:45:55,576 --> 01:45:57,100
Don't you leave me here!

1164
01:45:57,311 --> 01:46:00,041
This guy is fucking crazy!

1165
01:46:02,416 --> 01:46:07,251
Wait! I gotta get out of here!

1166
01:46:08,756 --> 01:46:09,745
Please!

1167
01:46:09,957 --> 01:46:14,656
Catherine! The other officers
will be here any minute now.

1168
01:46:14,862 --> 01:46:18,593
Wait! Don't go! Please!

1169
01:46:18,799 --> 01:46:20,096
Quiet!

1170
01:46:22,403 --> 01:46:24,963
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1171
01:50:20,774 --> 01:50:23,242
- You okay?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing, I'm okay.

1172
01:50:23,444 --> 01:50:26,470
Agent Starling, how did you
track Buffalo Bill here?

1173
01:50:32,786 --> 01:50:35,653
Clarice M. Starling.

1174
01:50:37,825 --> 01:50:39,122
Congratulations.

1175
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,403
Ernest W. Stevens.

1176
01:51:13,326 --> 01:51:15,226
Special Agent Starling!

1177
01:51:15,629 --> 01:51:17,529
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

1178
01:51:17,731 --> 01:51:19,062
Thank you. Excuse me.

1179
01:51:19,266 --> 01:51:20,528
Starling.

1180
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:26,237
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1181
01:51:26,473 --> 01:51:27,531
Sure.

1182
01:51:29,476 --> 01:51:31,603
I just wanted to say congratulations.

1183
01:51:31,978 --> 01:51:35,539
I'm no good at this kind of thing,
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1184
01:51:36,016 --> 01:51:37,643
Okay. Sure.

1185
01:51:39,152 --> 01:51:40,813
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1186
01:51:48,628 --> 01:51:50,858
Your father would've been proud today.

1187
01:51:54,167 --> 01:51:55,896
Don't forget your phone call.

1188
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:01,905
Starling.

1189
01:52:02,142 --> 01:52:03,734
<i>Well, Clarice...</i>

1190
01:52:04,277 --> 01:52:06,768
...have the lambs stopped screaming?

1191
01:52:07,214 --> 01:52:08,340
Dr. Lecter?

1192
01:52:08,548 --> 01:52:11,574
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1193
01:52:15,088 --> 01:52:17,215
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

1194
01:52:17,424 --> 01:52:19,289
I have no plans to call on you.

1195
01:52:19,493 --> 01:52:21,961
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1196
01:52:22,496 --> 01:52:25,488
<i>So you take care now</i>
<i>to extend me the same courtesy.</i>

1197
01:52:25,699 --> 01:52:28,224
You know I can't make that promise.

1198
01:52:28,702 --> 01:52:31,068
I do wish we could chat longer...

1199
01:52:32,372 --> 01:52:35,068
...but I'm having
an old friend for dinner.

1200
01:52:36,543 --> 01:52:37,805
Bye.

1201
01:52:38,278 --> 01:52:39,609
<i>Dr. Lecter!</i>

1202
01:52:42,115 --> 01:52:43,548
Dr. Lecter.

1203
01:52:45,752 --> 01:52:47,219
Dr. Lecter.

1204
01:52:49,156 --> 01:52:50,714
Dr. Lecter?

1205
01:52:51,758 --> 01:52:53,157
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1206
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,021
The security system's set up?

1207
01:52:55,228 --> 01:52:57,890
- We have the big shot security.
- I appreciate it.

1208
01:53:41,228 --> 01:53:51,228
Thank you for using the subs
     regards, shock...
