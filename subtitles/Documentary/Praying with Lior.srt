1
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:04,619
Am I dead?

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,619
Or is this one of those dreams?

3
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:11,089
Those horrible dreams

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,096
that seems like it last forever

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,024
If I am alive, why?

6
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:27,162
Why if there is a God or whatever,

7
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:30,115
something, somewhere

8
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:34,054
Why have I been abandoned by everyone

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,442
and everything I've ever known

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,867
I've ever loved. Stranded.

11
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:43,568
What is the lesson? What is the point>?

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,855
God give me a sign or I have to give up

13
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,474
I can't do this anymore

14
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:52,802
Please just let me die

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,074
Being alive hurts too much

5
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:16,601
Well, you almost had me fooled

6
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:25,087
Told me that I was nothing without you

7
00:01:25,576 --> 00:01:29,962
Oh, but after everything you've done

8
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:38,447
I can thank you for how strong I have become

9
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,778
'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell

10
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:45,129
I had to learn how to fight for myself

11
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,478
And we both know all the truth I could tell

12
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:51,605
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

13
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:58,286
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'

14
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:05,872
I hope your soul is changin', changin'

15
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,059
I hope you find your peace

16
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:16,602
Falling on your knees, prayin'

17
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:28,180
I'm proud of who I am

18
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:36,481
No more monsters, I can breathe again

19
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:42,056
And you said that I was done

20
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:50,544
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come

21
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:55,324
'Cause I can make it on my own

22
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:04,181
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known

23
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:09,836
I'll bring thunder, I'll bring rain, oh-oh

24
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:16,601
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name

25
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:19,773
You brought the flames and you put me through hell

26
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:23,054
I had to learn how to fight for myself

27
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:26,237
And we both know all the truth I could tell

28
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,611
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

29
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:36,275
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'

30
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:43,888
I hope your soul is changin', changin'

31
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,120
I hope you find your peace

32
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:54,384
Falling on your knees, prayin'

33
00:03:54,922 --> 00:04:00,577
Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night

34
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,247
Someday, maybe you'll see the light

35
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,449
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give

36
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:20,919
But some things only God can forgive

37
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:28,427
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'

38
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:35,500
I hope your soul is changin', changin'

39
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:39,388
I hope you find your peace

40
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:46,936
Falling on your knees, prayin'
