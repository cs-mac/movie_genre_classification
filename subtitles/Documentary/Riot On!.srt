Translated by: The Unknowns and Snow White

4
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:14,922
Thesis delivery.

5
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,328
"Since no weapons allowed here."

6
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,552
Open 23.

7
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,223
Green. Come forward in the east wing.

8
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,449
I was looking for an uncomfortable place to take a nap ...

9
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:25,854
but the house was closed.

10
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,607
Where are you going?

11
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,569
The infirmary, organize the kitchen, and then a few more things.

12
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,657
Well, go on.

13
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,803
New eater.

14
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
New medication list for the prisoners. - Thanks.

'Fobidden territory'

16
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,798
Package for Balam.

17
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,300
Masks.

18
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,442
Good. Sounds fine. Thanks.

19
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,852
He is here.

20
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,819
Walk on, walk on.

21
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:43,492
Stay in line. Scrolling ... walking.

22
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,958
Wie is dat?
- Jack Stone.

23
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,252
Wie is Jack Stone?

24
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,920
An ex-police officer.

25
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,049
Not so fast, Slankie.

26
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,510
Come on, run.

27
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,140
Jack Stone.

28
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,230
First a cop. Then a killer cops.

29
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,901
Well, Stone, how long do you think you can last here?

30
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,736
It seems that Green has a new sweetheart.

31
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,993
These prisoners are beasts. And you've been there enough, right?

32
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,668
And so it begins.

33
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,341
And you are the center of everything.

34
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,989
If you want to talk, I listen well.

35
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,215
We are on the roof.

36
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,974
Does he know what is his place?

37
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,310
With so much money do you really think that he give a damn?

38
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,756
Three, two, one ...

39
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,637
Everyone is looking for coverage.

40
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,732
If you stay alive white let him lie.

41
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,950
Ren, ren, ren!

42
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,829
Over here, come!

43
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,713
We're here for the money from the bank, not yours.

44
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,899
Everyone on the ground. - On the ground.

45
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,654
Lie and not say a word.

46
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,202
The bank manager, hands on your head? Where is he?!

47
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,585
You have three seconds to open the safe. One two...

48
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,761
Move along.

49
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,473
Keys.

50
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,924
You hear that, Jack?

51
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:15,264
That sound in the distance, voices. That is of hungry prisoners, Jackie.

52
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,891
They smell fresh meat.

53
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:25,232
I do not know who to put my money. On the prisoners or guards.

54
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,193
I would go for the guards.

55
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,989
Everyone take cover.

56
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,743
Here they come! Motherfuckers!

57
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,077
Clark, Ashdown, follow me!

58
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,012
Everyone aside! On the ground.

59
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,085
Dirty whore!

60
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,111
Lay down! Everyone on the ground.

61
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,994
Ashdown you check this floor. Clark, you're coming with me.

62
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,435
Clark, you go left.

63
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,853
That's far enough. Hands up. Now!

64
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,021
I said hands up.

65
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,735
I thought I had to go to my cell because you ...

66
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:46,368
Jack, right? Would you like to the top or bottom?

67
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,955
I'll go at the bottom.

68
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,083
Call me Silva.

69
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:18,001
Semyon. Let me welcome you to your new home.

70
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,963
Once times a week, you pay me for protection ...

71
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,800
then you the money directly into my account transfer.

72
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,886
I do not need your protection.

73
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,266
Always use protection.

74
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:39,481
My friend, if there is someone here needs protection, then you will.

75
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,698
Take him and put him in a cell.

76
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,008
My name is Sem ...

77
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,440
Everthing allright.

78
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,368
Come on up.

79
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:30,092
Detective Jack Stone, your name for years ...

80
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,846
a constant irritation for my business.

81
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:40,978
You cost me guys, shipments, money. More times than I want to remember.

82
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,190
Do you feel guilty if you share a cell with me?

83
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,443
That's a bold move.

84
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:55,576
Unfortunately I have not met personally.

85
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:58,996
We can still change this?

86
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,166
I guess that would work out not good for me, Jack.

87
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,839
Have you ever heard of a king who gives tours of his kingdom?

88
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:15,637
No of course not. The king remains in his castle.

89
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:25,907
Do you know why? If the king leaves his castle he offers his enemies ...

90
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,401
a chance to climb up there.

91
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,821
I'm not here for your throne, Balam.

92
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:37,451
You know what price on my head?

93
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:43,498
A million dollars. That's what they think I'm worth.

94
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,463
What about you, Jack? What are you worth?

95
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,717
25, 50, 100,000 dollar?

96
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:01,683
What did you get out of my safe and to whom have you given?

97
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:11,568
As you wish, you go there as if your wife.

98
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,948
I heard she bled to death.

99
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:22,704
Agony stand out while you watched, without even do anything.

100
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:29,086
It's a shame that you're not dead.

101
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:37,803
Jack, you and I are at war.

102
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,588
Who are you, Jack Stone?

103
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,302
I said hands up.

104
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,268
I trusted you. - Jack?

105
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:31,440
She's dead because of you. - I had no choice, Jack. I have a family.

106
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,880
Did you again late shift, Timmy?

107
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,551
As punishment for the past week.

108
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,513
Fences do not jump for a car, Tim.

109
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:09,937
You should really behave like a retarded character to be touching one.

110
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,730
Were you ?? and sms while driving?

111
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,691
I sat back of a truck.

112
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,621
Thank you and goodbye.

113
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,457
How can I help you? - I'm Trisha Sinclair.

114
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,543
I have an appointment with prosecutor Johnson.

115
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:21,800
Sorry. But unfortunately I have no agreement with that name.

116
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,303
Unfortunately, I canceled that appointment.

117
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,640
Hallo, Miss Sinclair.
Mark Crane.

118
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,476
Mr. Johnson could not come so I had to cancel.

119
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:32,936
I do not call to cancel?

120
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,106
I'm sorry, if you're with me ... - Sorry, when he has time?

121
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,817
You can discuss it with me as well.

122
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,612
Then I can give that information to him if he is available.

123
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,323
I did not ask to speak with you. - Can you cancel my calls.

124
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,616
Ja, Mr Crane.
- Kom hier.

125
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,123
Listen, the information you gave to Mr. Johnson is very important to me.

126
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,959
Jack Stone is a closed case.

127
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,753
This is not just about Jack Stone.

128
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,798
If you have additional information I give it gladly.

129
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,343
If you give it to me I'll make sure he gets it.

130
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,513
But make a new appointment.

131
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,526
The head of the school is conducting an investigation.

132
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,529
Excuse me, prosecutor Johnson?

133
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,031
Excuse me, but I really need to talk to you.

134
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,867
En u bent...?
- Trisha Sinclair.

135
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,537
The reporter of 'The Post'.

136
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:35,374
George, I can still talk later? Thanks.

137
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,001
And Miss Sinclair what's so terribly important ...

138
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,921
that my conversation with the mayor had to pause?

139
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,298
Is that the mayor? - You're not him Recognized?

140
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,217
I was working for the other.

141
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,971
I'm sorry, I made an appointment with you, but your guard canceled it.

142
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,599
That was Mark, he does not long for me.

143
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,977
And he sometimes behaves what overprotective.

144
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,688
Shall we run?

145
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,985
What is this about? - Jack Stone and Balam Moglovich.

146
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:07,197
Balam? That's been years in prison.

147
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,116
The same as where Jack Stone is sent there.

148
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,786
And? - I think this was not purely coincidental.

149
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,623
They murdered his former partner. Jack Stone was part of a group of three

150
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,000
that robbed the Bank of Orleans?

151
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,627
What many believe that it was by the Russian mafia.

152
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:24,715
That was never confirmed. It's not that it's not true, but ...

153
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,342
Accusations without proof ...

154
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:30,387
I mean, how much evidence. Lots of it.

155
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,140
What if Jack and Balam work together?

156
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,517
A detective is involved with the Russian mafia?

157
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,812
It's more complicated than that, Miss Sinclair.

158
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:42,608
It would be good if you think about it! Why did Jack go to jail?

159
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,110
He killed a policeman.

160
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,864
It's not just Jack. I have a whole list of names.

161
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,742
Do not worry. Your name is not listed.

162
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:57,956
Police corruption is a fundamental threat.

163
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:02,794
Like any lifestyle and everything to protect our neighbors.

164
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,172
And judgments given in the courtroom.

165
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:09,176
If you have information, you should come with them for the day.

166
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:10,677
I wanted that too.

167
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,639
I wanted to make sure you understand everything before I come up with evidence.

168
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:19,102
Good. Let me know if I can do something to help.

169
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,855
This is my number.

170
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:26,443
You do not have to worry about Mark Crane.

171
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,253
Stone, you have a visitor.

172
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,729
Hallo, Mr. Stone.

173
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:07,943
Miss Sinclair. I have looked forward to your visit.

174
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,571
How do you know who I am?

175
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,073
What will you do with the information I sent you?

176
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,785
Was that yours?

177
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,497
What do you want?

178
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,292
Use the information, Miss Sinclair.

179
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:40,934
William, come on, you block the road.

180
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:43,437
On the side!

181
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,793
Congratulations.

182
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:14,551
Because you are my anchor, and no matter how hard the sea can be ...

183
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,804
and I know you are always there for me.

184
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,015
I love you.

185
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:45,207
Sorry, I did not bother. Are you Jack Stone?

186
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,210
Thanks for your help here.

187
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,712
What do you mean?

188
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:53,966
Does not matter.

189
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:03,100
I am William. I'm very important here.

190
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,604
If you need to clean floors in this block, they call me.

191
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:11,400
Can you imagine that I'm sometimes crowding.

192
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,613
Ken je Balam?

193
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,867
And.

194
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:25,789
His nephew Semyon put his face in the jelly.

195
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,292
I know who Semyon.

196
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,379
Are not you afraid of Balam?

197
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,928
Do you know where Balam his cell?

198
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,457
Nobody knows where it is. Nobody goes there ...

199
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:47,895
Even the guards ... also not good.

200
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,488
I like your necklace cute. Were you in the military?

201
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:05,579
It was a gift from my wife. She is dead.

202
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,627
That is sad. Sorry.

203
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:57,881
Stay away from me!

204
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,309
Wait. I take her over here. You are needed in Block D.

205
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,438
Come on, sweetheart.

206
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,692
Isolation is not the other way?

207
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,318
Shut up.

208
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,910
Cousin, why am I here? Everything is good.

209
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:31,748
There are three reasons why I chose a life in prison.

210
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,335
Protection of my many enemies.

211
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:43,093
It's like a blind spot to keep my business outside the government.

212
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,930
And ultimately, control.

213
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:52,227
Control means power, it means ranking.

214
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:56,064
Control means respect. - I know this already!

215
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:01,236
Nothing is happening this prison without my approval.

216
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:09,620
And if someone's like to work alone without consultation, I find it disrespectful.

217
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:19,546
I do not tolerate disrespect, not even my cousin.

218
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,006
I would never ...

219
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:28,347
A percentage taken without my permission.

220
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,933
Amiss.

221
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:38,524
Selling drugs, inside and outside these walls, behind my back?

222
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,692
Very disrespectful.

223
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:46,323
Try to murder Jack Stone and grab the honor.

224
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,619
That's very disrespectful.

225
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:09,972
What a shame. Your face is a mix of beauty and tragedy.

226
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,975
Like a beautiful painting.

227
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:18,397
Why risking damage to something so precious?

228
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:25,445
You must know that Katerina is one of my employees.

229
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:32,327
That means she's under my protection.

230
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:40,419
So if you fight with Katerina, you fight with me.

231
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,798
You want me to be your enemy?

232
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:50,762
Because when you're a little care there

233
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,434
For something so beautiful ...

234
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:00,606
Maybe you do not deserve this.

235
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:05,694
I grab it and put it on my wall.

236
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:10,657
Where it is not abused by you.

237
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:23,670
You represented me in everything you do, cousin.

238
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:29,092
Your failure to murder Jack Stone is my failure.

239
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:36,016
And in the eyes of the other prisoner show your weakness.

240
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:42,689
Weakness leads to difference and that can quickly turn into revolt.

241
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,527
Please, cousin. Give me a second chance. I will not disappoint you.

242
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:52,199
No. Jack Stones question can not go unanswered.

243
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,826
I want you to spread it.

244
00:33:55,619 --> 00:34:02,209
One hundred thousand dollars to the one who brings the head of Jack Stone.

245
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:22,771
You're in trouble. Balam paid one hundred thousand dollars to the one who killed you.

246
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:28,986
This also applies to the guards. What are you going to do now?

247
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,411
I do not move so much more. It gives me more time. I'm not busy.

248
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,583
These guards are good. So stay at the bad guys away.

249
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:46,086
How do I know who the bad guys are?

250
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,131
Those are the ones you want to murder.

251
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,845
Everybody out!

252
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:58,932
Come on! Now!

253
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,866
Who are you?

254
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,495
A friend.

255
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,756
But how did she get all that information?

256
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:16,577
Come on, you have lists, names, contacts, buyers, sellers!

257
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:19,206
Remember who you're talking.

258
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:23,183
Come on, she's got proof! Paperwork, disks, USB sticks.

259
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,937
That is impossible. I was told that everything is burned.

260
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,189
Listen, I'm not perish!

261
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:32,192
Then it's simple. That woman must die.

262
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:39,908
Okay, I'll take care of it. What about with Stone?

263
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:43,412
He is dead at the end of the day.

264
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,406
Allison! - I'm at the airport.

265
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,492
I'll see you later tonight, okay?

266
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,309
Really? Think logically. With how many are you. Eight?

267
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:11,727
We are with z `nine.

268
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,312
Actually, eight and a half.

269
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:17,858
I know it's a lot of money but it's not as you think.

270
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,820
If you've got what you look for?

271
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,240
11,000 each?

272
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,202
Eleven thousand sounds good to me.

273
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,412
Not if you're risking the risks.

274
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:33,248
What is he talking about?

275
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:38,086
Are they worth 11 000 dollars you for a skull fracture, broken eardrum.

276
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:43,913
Maybe a broken femur, cracked ribs, collapsed lungs,

277
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,822
Half your nose beaten into your brain.

278
00:39:48,938 --> 00:39:50,543
You look smarter than you are!

279
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:50,112
How are you doing? - Yes No. Jesus!

280
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,997
That must have been a visit ..

281
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:59,084
It was not what I expected. Alone...

282
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,045
What is going on?

283
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,506
I'm doing this all wrong.

284
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,010
I do not think I've ever seen you so passionate to have a story.

285
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,513
The whole time I try the connection between Jack Stone and corruption

286
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,473
so I came nowhere.

287
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,476
This is all about Balam.

288
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,606
His drug network, vendors, buyers ...

289
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,567
All of these names.

290
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:29,031
City officials, police officers, the list is long.

291
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:30,782
What will you do with it?

292
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,744
Please check everything, make sure I understand everything and then call.

293
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:00,687
What?

294
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:05,150
Balam says that I must apologize.

295
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,115
I wait.

296
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:46,775
The cat!

297
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,986
Let's go, princess!

298
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,535
Is all well with her? - Mind your own business.

299
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:09,381
Blood pressure 126/78. 65 heartbeat.

300
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:16,430
The pupils are dilated and unresponsive.

301
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:49,285
Another? - No, let her sleep. Be sure of it

302
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:50,631
that gets her next record.

303
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:02,554
Stone. Your girlfriend is back.

304
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:37,047
Jack, I read it with your wife. Sorry.

305
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:39,967
So you've figured out that I was not working for the Russian mafia

306
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:41,677
as it was on paper.

307
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,971
But I did find out who did.

308
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:49,810
I called my partner told what I had found, and he went to the Mafia.

309
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:57,150
She wanted a hit on me, but Elizabeth was killed.

310
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,501
And I killed him.

311
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:24,595
What will you do with the information I sent you?

312
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:30,225
I know why you're here. You're killing yourself even by doing this.

313
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:37,774
What happens to me does not matter. This is about the one who is responsible.

314
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,822
I'm allergic to peanuts `s ...

315
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:54,833
Onions? Onions are good.

316
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:39,336
Are you happy? You look happier.

317
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,839
I have a full time job ...

318
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,675
Excuse me, Doctor?

319
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,725
That's pretty flattering, William, but I'm just a nurse.

320
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,980
Just a nurse? Well, I heard that they do all the work

321
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:43,567
while the doctors are somewhere playing golf.

322
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:48,322
Okay, ladies' man, but told. What do you want?

323
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:56,622
I was hoping you could answer a medical question.

324
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,290
An embarrassing question.

325
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:18,060
How long have you been undercover?

326
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:25,651
You are still alive. I bet that you make passes around me.

327
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:29,863
Where are you from? FBI, CIA?

328
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,618
FBI.

329
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:40,332
This place has long been corrupt

330
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,584
but we did not know how deep the SAT.

331
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:47,464
If you tell me where is the proof that we need, the mystery disappears.

332
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,343
You know why I'm here?

333
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,892
Are you going to stand me in the way?

334
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:09,194
I am now six months here. I'll grab one while Balam here is boss.

335
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:12,781
He has too much information for the government.

336
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:17,619
Once I heard that you came here, and you have the missing piece

337
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,163
that makes a difference.

338
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,209
Here they come.

339
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,771
There's more what we need here.

340
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,356
Go back!

341
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,786
Sometimes I finish this fluent Russian.

342
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:08,921
How do you say '' Jack, you're so sexy. I need you. I want you''?

343
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,006
You need help.

344
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:13,717
I need a friend.

345
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:18,138
Why do not you hire a translator for this in?

346
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:20,140
The information is too sensitive.

347
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:23,602
As much of this is true, there are many people in prison.

348
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:16,864
When you were six months ago came here they told me two things:

349
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:22,327
One, you're not a good defender ... Two, I gave you a trusted status.

350
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:26,915
I never had a reason to answer that until today.

351
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:31,503
William, I must tell you that I am very disappointed in you.

352
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:38,468
Three prisoner saw you Losif picked up and tossed him over the rail.

353
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,930
I want to know why you're doing something.

354
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:48,812
It was 13-4. If I would do this terrible, I would be afraid and be useless

355
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:56,111
and then God would execute the rebels.

356
00:53:57,154 --> 00:54:03,118
I'll be honest with you, William. The Bible came from the office.

357
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:10,459
If you want to stop your faith in God to save you is up to you.

358
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:15,797
But within these walls I'm the only savior that you need.

359
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,800
And believe me, boy, you need a rescue.

360
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,553
Losif Balam was one of his boys.

361
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,933
If I have to put back into block A or block any whatsoever

362
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,810
then you are to the end of the week death.

363
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:34,066
Can you help me?

364
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:39,488
It is not a question of whether I can, but more if I want it.

365
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:41,907
Will you do that?

366
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:47,371
Yes, paid.

367
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:55,003
I have no money.

368
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:03,887
Not you. But I'm sure you have friends there who can arrange something for you.

369
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:08,392
What you have hidden. If you do what you have blocked.

370
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,687
My brother has money.

371
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:19,361
See! Your brother is his love for you, say worth $ 1,000?

372
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:22,906
I do not know.

373
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:29,580
Why do not you go back to work and think about it, okay?

374
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,791
When you're ready to call your brother, let me know.

375
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:39,548
But you'd better think fast. You know how the communication works here.

376
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:43,343
Balam, there may already be behind what you did.

377
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:52,895
If my brother you paid $ 10,000 you will promise me that I will not be killed?

378
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:57,691
With my hand on the Bible.

379
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:04,156
I need Mr. Johnson speak, please.

380
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:05,866
Do you have an appointment?

381
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:08,035
No, but it's important. - It always is.

382
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:11,830
Is there a problem? - I need to talk to the prosecutor.

383
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:19,421
Another plot. Listen, Miss Sinclair, if you have a problem, call the FBI.

384
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:23,050
You go down with the rest.

385
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,734
What is happening?

386
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,572
You do not feel well, Princess?

387
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:37,249
On the side!

388
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,507
Stand still!

389
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:47,759
Get out of my way!

390
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,414
How are you doing? - Yes.

391
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:19,666
Let's lay it up.

392
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,924
Sure we can trust?

393
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:30,427
Balam is the force that I came here.

394
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:35,307
Jack wanted to bring this to an end.

395
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:43,357
Ready? Come on. We go.

396
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,593
Is it true?

397
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:19,476
Is this you?

398
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,151
Papa?

399
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,851
I lied to my whole life. I thought you were dead.

400
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:45,687
I went away to protect you.

401
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:50,234
I was told you were a national hero.

402
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:57,366
A life with your family sacrifice for the love of your country and I accepted it.

403
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,202
Mom knows that you wanted?

404
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:05,791
I do not know what you've been told and that it is not true.

405
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:12,381
Drugs, weapons, human trafficking?

406
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:17,845
I could not bear to read the rest. It was page after page.

407
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,235
Available.

408
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:56,466
I am inside.

409
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:09,605
Be a man for once and tell me the truth.

410
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:15,235
I want you to look me in the eye and tell

411
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:19,198
that everything I've read is not true.

412
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:23,994
These things are not true.

413
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:28,624
You're not man enough to admit it.

414
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:35,422
You made the choice long ago to be a part of my life.

415
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:40,177
So I now make the choice never to be a part of yours.

416
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,513
I want nothing to do with you make.

417
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:47,059
I do not know what you are, but I will never find out.

418
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:53,190
Olesya, you're not safe! They're coming for you!

419
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,569
I think this was the last time you see me.

420
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:12,334
I see Balam and his escort leaving the business area.

421
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:17,673
Semyon is in Blok A.

422
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:23,679
The rest of the group waiting for the return of Balam.

423
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:26,807
Jack is in isolation.

424
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:30,894
Okay, Jack, let's see if you now are so good again.

425
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:39,194
What are you to `t rumble? Answer!

426
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:47,369
Isolation, answer.

427
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,916
Will, take them on.

428
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,669
I assume this is not a social call.

429
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,839
I do the check and my partner sits on the surveillance cameras.

430
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:00,883
We help you to come to Balam.

431
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,121
Which way?

432
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:33,040
Turn right.

433
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:42,299
Go left.

434
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:58,565
Door 5B. - Good.

435
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:15,207
23-C.

436
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:35,769
There is a guard at my door.

437
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:39,064
Jack, we are running out of time.

438
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:51,493
They come closer, Jack.

439
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:57,499
I forgot my keys. Open it.

440
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:05,424
Open the door. I want to go home.

441
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:20,147
Open the door.

442
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:23,317
Eric, wake up!

443
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:32,868
Eric, wake up! I want to go home!

444
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,040
What is going on? - I'm sorry, sir.

445
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:42,044
I forgot my keys and my partner I guess is asleep.

446
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,689
What is going on? Come on, open it!

447
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:06,985
Open the door, come on!

448
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:09,196
Jack, we have to go.

449
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:16,995
To open!

450
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:22,167
We're screwed. They're here, Jack.

451
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,336
Make them all open.

452
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:26,338
What do you mean?

453
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:29,049
The hall, the cells, everything. Make them open!

454
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:04,751
I want you to do all the doors locked. Nobody is allowed in or out.

455
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:06,962
This is a large emergency!

456
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:58,013
Back in your cell!

457
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:53,819
10-34! 10-34! We need assistance!

458
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:11,628
I have the money already.

459
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:29,855
I want to just go on a search.

460
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:37,696
No, I want to Stone!

461
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:57,568
Hey? - It is time.

462
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:01,280
Amazing. I have been waiting a long time.

463
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:03,991
Remember to clean. You wait for your money.

464
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:06,368
I'm going down.

465
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,623
This job is finally done.

466
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:20,048
I want it all. I need the original files.

467
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:23,760
Allison?
- Disks, usb stick, alles.

468
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,346
Get up, now.

469
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:31,351
Stone!

470
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,774
Jack, do you start?

471
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:21,318
Nee.

472
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:23,737
Balam is nearby. Let him stop.

473
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:34,326
Get up now and give me everything I want, or I'll shoot you.

474
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:37,037
You're not gonna shoot me, Allison.

475
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:39,248
Trust me, I'll accept that.

476
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:41,708
What are you doing? You're my friend.

477
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:46,713
I was offered a lot of money.

478
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:51,426
You sit deeper in, Allison. Probably hired to observe.

479
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:53,637
But not to act.

480
01:15:54,054 --> 01:15:55,430
You are wrong.

481
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:33,635
FBI, Miss Sinclair.

482
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:43,312
Wait! Or I'll blow your head off empty.

483
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,356
Move over, so we ...

484
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:10,172
I'm sorry, man. It's just my job, okay?

485
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:20,641
William?

486
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:25,398
No, wait.

487
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:32,986
I have money, I do drugs, I have everything you need!

488
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:38,617
Freedom. I can give you freedom! I can get you out of here.

489
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:45,582
Please, no! The Bible! You're a man of faith.

490
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,543
I remember that.

491
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:50,629
Free!

492
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,188
Look in the hall.

493
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:09,815
Cover me!

494
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:42,347
Stone!

495
01:18:54,943 --> 01:19:00,115
What, Elizabeth? It was nothing personal, just business.

496
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:05,871
We met each other in person and you pulled my daughter herein.

497
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:16,215
I killed her because of you!

498
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:20,260
I was going to murder because of you!

499
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,722
On the ground! Lie down on the ground!

500
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:41,777
Free!

501
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:07,344
Jack? Do what you came to do?

502
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,264
I have done that.

503
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:18,730
Why did you do to me?

504
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:22,526
I lost my partner a few years ago, had him felted

505
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:26,780
cut him into pieces and sent it to his family.

506
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:30,200
You did what no one had the balls.

507
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:35,539
Meet my new partner, Agent Shiles.

508
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:39,793
How are you doing? - It sometimes got worse.

509
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:42,504
Let's go.

510
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:50,012
The director would like to thank you for what you did.

511
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:53,515
Disabling Balam and his men opened your doors.

512
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:57,811
One way to purify you, not here, but in the city.

513
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:00,731
I appreciate that but actually I should be thanking you.

514
01:23:01,523 --> 01:23:03,525
I hope you do not mind.

515
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,612
We need you anyway arrest yet.

516
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:14,786
A big arrest today, including the government and police officers.

517
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:17,873
Attorney Johnson was also arrested.

518
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:21,335
There were rumors for months about Mr. Johnson.

519
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,337
Until the story came to light.

520
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:26,965
Rumors of embezzlement, tampering with the jury and attempted murder.

521
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:29,218
Under the motto of other prizes.
