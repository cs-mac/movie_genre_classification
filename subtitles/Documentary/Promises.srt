1
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:07,616
He says, "Christmas."
So I say to him...

2
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:10,172
Should we go shopping?

3
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,827
The kid's 16.

4
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:17,724
He says,
"But, Uncle, it's Christmas."

5
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:21,504
How much you taking off?

6
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:23,514
Uncle Azim...

7
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:27,101
This is him.
The kid I am talking about.

8
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:29,082
He looks okay to me.

9
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:32,985
Ekrem, how you doing?

10
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:39,194
He looks okay, yeah,

11
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,781
but he won't do
one lousy thing for me.

12
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:46,112
Here. Look, Ekrem.

13
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:48,641
Take this.

14
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:49,949
Azim, please.

15
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:55,362
You see? We had a deal.
Now he's backing out.

16
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,435
Azim, leave the kid alone.

17
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:02,686
It's obviously
some psychological thing.

18
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,554
<i>Take the fucking ustura
and finish this Rus!</i>

19
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,763
Please, I need help.

20
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,511
Do you need methadone?

21
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,301
For methadone,
I need to see prescription.

22
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,250
Was she hemorrhaging
when you found her?

23
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,367
Yes.

24
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:16,159
Did you get a name?
No.

25
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:20,060
You're all right, sweetheart.
Stay with us, all right?

26
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:24,509
Baby's in distress.
Her stats are very poor.

27
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,373
Fetal heart rate's
at 60, 58, 57
and free falling.

28
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:38,742
Speak to me.

29
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:41,302
Placental abruption.
We need to get
the baby out now.

30
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:59,765
I'm afraid
we've lost the mother.
Okay, enough.

31
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,154
Call it.

32
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,354
Unidentified woman died
December the 20th, 23:13.

33
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,181
Baby girl born
20th of December, 23:14.

34
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:47,283
Did you sleep?

35
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:49,172
A bit.

36
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,821
Mum...

37
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,288
Mmm-hmm?

38
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,369
Are you okay?

39
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:00,407
Of course not.
It's Christmas.

40
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:11,607
Anna, where did you get this?

41
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:16,305
It's your own fault
for giving him
something to play with.

42
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,713
Well, I can't read Russian,
can I?

43
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,735
I told you, Uncle Stepan.

44
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:27,315
I found it in
the handbag of the girl
who died in my ward.

45
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:30,355
Do you always rob
the bodies of the dead?

46
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,598
Yes, actually.
We all do it.

47
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,734
It's one of the perks
of working at the hospital.

48
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:41,047
Did you know
that your daughter robs
the bodies of the dead?

49
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,577
I'm looking
for an address.

50
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,241
You have an uncle, Anna,
who doesn't steal
the things from the dead.

51
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:55,119
Not even their secrets.

52
00:05:55,194 --> 00:05:59,088
Oh, don't go
all momentous on us, Stepan.
Lift your elbows.

53
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,743
You should put this
into her coffin.

54
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,792
Bury her secrets
with her bodies.

55
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:10,705
Body.

56
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:13,523
Singular.

57
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:27,832
<i>My name is Tatiana.</i>

58
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:31,214
<i>My father died in the mines
in my village,</i>

59
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,176
<i>so he was already buried
when he died.</i>

60
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,468
<i>We were all buried there.</i>

61
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:40,082
<i>Buried under the soil
of Russia.</i>

62
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:43,948
<i>That is why I left,
to find a better life.</i>

63
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:57,613
So...

64
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,247
You go pick up Azim
and you bring him back here

65
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,726
with his bitch of a wife.

66
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,068
<i>Da, da. Okay.</i>

67
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:05,201
Then I'll think of an excuse
and we can get away.

68
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,795
Who the fuck's that?

69
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,835
Maybe somebody sent your dad
a hooker for Christmas.

70
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,041
Man, you're so fucking
unbelievably disrespectful.

71
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,229
Hey, you got work to do.

72
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:35,820
Move!

73
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:37,965
See you.

74
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:07,082
Oh, no. We are closed.
Yes, I know.

75
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,177
I'm a midwife.

76
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:15,025
Then unless one of
my daughters is keeping
something from me,

77
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,717
you have the wrong address.

78
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,277
I was hoping to speak
to the manager.

79
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:21,169
Khitrova?

80
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,665
My dad was Russian.

81
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:26,515
What was your father's
first name?
Ivan.

82
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,067
Ivan? So you are
Anna Ivanovna.

83
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:31,820
Now come.

84
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,934
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

85
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:41,779
I must stir, I must stir,
or the borscht dies
in my hands.

86
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:45,073
Today, it is family.
Here is my son, Kirill.

87
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,475
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry!

88
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,498
Come, come, come on.
Hurry! Hurry!

89
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:54,800
More glasses for red
over there.

90
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:04,305
My angels.

91
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,080
My angels,
you must practice more.

92
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:14,066
You know, you must...
You must make
the wood cry. Show me.

93
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,016
This is an old card,
from before the renovations.

94
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:57,643
But if she had worked here,
I would remember her name.

95
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:01,387
Perhaps she ate here once.

96
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,462
Try it. Try.

97
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:06,698
Try this.

98
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,976
My God, that's amazing.

99
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,688
My dad made borscht
just like that.

100
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:39,048
Anna, I'm so sorry
I couldn't help.
It is sad.

101
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,909
Very sad.
It's all right.

102
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:44,553
I'll probably
find out more once I get
her diary translated.

103
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:50,603
Her diary?

104
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,511
Yeah. I found it in her bag.

105
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:56,997
Okay, Anna,
this is how it will be.

106
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,616
You will bring the diary
and I will translate it
for you.

107
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:03,370
And if we get the names
of any relatives,

108
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,214
I will call them myself.

109
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,469
I can just get my uncle
to translate...
And when you come,

110
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,184
I will make you
some more borscht.

111
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:20,099
Like your papa used to make.
So tomorrow?
Shall we say 7:00?

112
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:27,016
Well, then it's settled.
But, for now,
you must forgive me.

113
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,041
Goodbye, Anna.

114
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,167
Anna.

115
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,913
You always work
at Trafalgar Hospital?

116
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:42,378
Yes. Always.

117
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:45,381
Yeah. That's good.

118
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,816
Nice bike.

119
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:14,217
Ural.

120
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,324
You don't see them anymore.

121
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:19,074
It was my dad's.

122
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,148
How much do you want for it?

123
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:25,857
It has sentimental value.

124
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:31,047
"Sentimental value."
I've heard of that.

125
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:37,768
Not staying for party?
No.

126
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:38,979
Nor me.

127
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,405
Chauffeurs don't get invited.

128
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,854
You want to go
for a drink instead?

129
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:03,745
Anna, how is it
that your boyfriend wasn't
here to carve?

130
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,599
I don't live
with Oliver anymore,
Uncle Stepan.

131
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,583
I'm living back here
for a bit.

132
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,151
For as long as you want.

133
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,811
I knew he would
run away from you.

134
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,053
He didn't run away.

135
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:25,187
Christ, you make me sound
like a burning building.

136
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,751
Black men always run away.

137
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,253
Oh, Stepan!

138
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,752
I'm not allowed to be honest?

139
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:32,928
He was a doctor, Stepan.

140
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,684
What has that got
to do with anything?

141
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:44,832
It is not natural
to mix race and race.

142
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:48,897
That's why your baby
died inside you.

143
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,870
Oh, shut up, Stepan!

144
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:53,537
Anna, please...

145
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:57,349
You're just how he was,
stupid, bloody,
drunken Russians.

146
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:53,086
Hello.

147
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,686
Yeah. It's a panda.

148
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,264
Coast is clear? Yeah? What?

149
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,187
No, not "beach."

150
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,392
I said "coast."

151
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:13,982
It's an English expression,
you fucking baboon.

152
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:17,828
It means...
It means, there are no police?

153
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:20,955
You're sure? Good.

154
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:28,579
No. My father
is not involved.

155
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:47,103
The driver stays down here.

156
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:48,414
Calm down.

157
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:50,553
Do you really think
I do this kind of thing?

158
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,259
He is not a driver.
He is the undertaker.

159
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:56,857
Yeah?
Yeah.

160
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,523
I don't like him.

161
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:07,105
I have converted
the upstairs rooms
into a private social club.

162
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:10,399
Some gambling, some drinking,

163
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:13,216
smoking, food, dancing.

164
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:16,480
It has been
the most surprising...

165
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,608
Hey.

166
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:20,631
Hey, Ekrem.

167
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,834
Be calm.

168
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,629
Slowly.

169
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,218
I got tickets, Azim.

170
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,850
It's with Chelsea.

171
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,328
They said there was
no tickets.

172
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:33,663
But I got tickets
for the Chelsea game.

173
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,073
Okay. Okay, okay.
You go watch DVD now.

174
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,775
Come on.

175
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:47,296
Azim?
Yeah?

176
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:50,044
He knows to say
he hasn't seen us, right?

177
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,687
He don't know anything.

178
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:56,031
He's been touched
by the angels.

179
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:04,764
Yeah. It's him.

180
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,549
He was like a brother
to me.

181
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:12,319
And now, he looks like
a fucking ice cream.

182
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:18,326
Hey! Show some respect
for a dead man.

183
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:23,642
Respect?

184
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,209
This is respect.

185
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:38,006
Okay, Kolya,
he's all yours.

186
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,632
Show some respect.

187
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,481
Pederast!

188
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,806
Have you got hair dryer?

189
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:40,434
Have you finished
cutting his hair?

190
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,952
I thought you might want
£6.50 from his pocket.

191
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:56,919
Better burn wallet.

192
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,209
Okay.

193
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:03,579
Now I'm going to do his teeth
and cut off his fingers.

194
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:07,866
You might want to leave room.

195
00:19:14,556 --> 00:19:15,985
You too.

196
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:00,175
Wait...

197
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,900
Aren't we going to
weight him down or something?

198
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,614
No.
If you want to dump body,
this is best place.

199
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:10,809
This is the best spot
to get rid of a corpse.

200
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,434
Let's go.

201
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:14,479
One...

202
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:16,696
Two...

203
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:18,387
Three...

204
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:25,206
The current will keep it down
until past the barrier.

205
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:26,223
<i>I am so excited this morning.</i>

206
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,847
<i>Yesterday a friend came back
to our village</i>

207
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,595
<i>and he told us
all about the places
on the map that I look at,</i>

208
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:37,579
<i>Paris, Amsterdam, London.
He's been there for real.</i>

209
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:43,245
<i>He says the future
of everything was already
happening at all those places.</i>

210
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:55,919
Anna.

211
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,467
I wasn't expecting you
so early.

212
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,850
Is that okay?

213
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:04,876
I copied the whole thing.

214
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,650
Where is the original?

215
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,244
Well, I was
going to keep it.

216
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:14,665
Thought I might give it
to Tatiana's daughter
some day.

217
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:21,007
I will need my spectacles
and a clear head.

218
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,979
Today, I broke my rules
and I drank vodka.

219
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:28,849
Tomorrow, I will translate it.

220
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:32,430
And then I will bring
what I've done to your home.

221
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:35,598
Where do you live, Anna?

222
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:36,845
Not far.

223
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:41,233
But I can just drop by
and pick it up.

224
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,438
Or maybe I can drive you home.

225
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:46,444
It's okay.
I've got my bike outside.

226
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,053
Come on, Kirill.

227
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:52,332
Get out.

228
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,367
Okay. Okay.

229
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,735
Get up, Kirill.

230
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:00,527
We're partners now, man.

231
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,696
You know?

233
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,055
Hello.

234
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:13,994
Hello.
Sorry.

235
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:25,297
Where's your fucking keys?

236
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,516
We went to Kurdish place.

237
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:56,041
They don't even
celebrate Christmas.

238
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:00,302
Papa! What did I do?

239
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:02,605
Is it Merry Christmas,
or what?

240
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:08,327
I think he's had enough.

241
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:11,277
Who the fuck are you
to tell me, "Enough"?

242
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,663
Papa. Hey, Papa!

243
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:23,272
Papa!

244
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:27,430
Papa!

245
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,185
Christ!

246
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:54,221
You've got water in it.

247
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:58,540
Water?
What makes you think that?

248
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,798
Joke.

249
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:15,268
Postmen used these
in my village
when I was a boy.

250
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,546
Russian copy. BMW flat-twin.

251
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:21,860
Same.

252
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:24,581
What?

253
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:34,502
Please.

254
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:35,915
Allow me.

255
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:52,007
Get bus.

256
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:01,415
You have far to go?

257
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:05,480
Just across the park.

258
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:09,259
I am driver.

259
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:11,080
I even do limousines.

260
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,574
Please.

261
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:16,458
If Semyon, my boss, finds out
I let guest walk home
in the rain,

262
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:18,083
he will fire me.

263
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:27,749
Have you ever met
a girl called Tatiana?

264
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,421
I met a lot of girls
called Tatiana.

265
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,084
She was pregnant.

266
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,596
In that case, no,
I never heard of her.

267
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,909
She died on my shift.

268
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:47,305
I thought you did birth.

269
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,819
Sometimes birth and death
go together.

270
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:56,254
She came in
with needle punctures
all over both arms.

271
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,948
Probably a prostitute
at the age of 14.

272
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,831
Do you think
Semyon's son knew her?

273
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:08,547
I am driver.

274
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:11,966
I go left, I go right,
I go straight ahead.
That's it.

275
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:18,913
You'll take the next right.

276
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:32,709
How much do I owe you?

277
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:40,161
Christmas present.

278
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,107
Morning, sir.
Morning.

279
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:07,558
How are you?

280
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:16,799
We think he might
be Russian Mafia.

281
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:27,711
<i>And he was a member
of vory v zakone.</i>

282
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:31,679
Stars on his knees means
he'd never kneeled
before anyone.

283
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:40,677
In Russian prisons
your life story is
written on your body

284
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,212
in tattoos.

285
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:47,840
You don't have tattoos,
you don't exist.

286
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,052
This one was a captain.

287
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:54,941
And he's been
professionally processed.

288
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:00,795
There was something else.

289
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:07,648
It was in his jacket.

290
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:17,596
Anna?

291
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,228
Yeah?

292
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,502
Stepan, come here.

293
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,332
Tell her
what you told me.

294
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:31,394
What? Stepan, what?
I'm late for work.

295
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:35,710
Who gave you that?

296
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,241
It was on the dresser.

297
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:40,963
Mum, you can't go through
my things.

298
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:43,232
You wanted him
to translate it.
Right and you didn't want to,

299
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,187
so I found someone else.

300
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:49,757
No, Anna.
You don't go to
someone else with this.

301
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:53,027
You don't go to anyone.

302
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,383
<i>Nasilovaniye means rape.</i>

303
00:29:57,411 --> 00:29:59,866
<i>Igla means needle.</i>

304
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,872
<i>Prostitutsiya...</i>

305
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:06,976
Perhaps you can guess.
I'm going to wash my hands.

306
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:16,697
Anna,

307
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,521
Stepan said that this girl

308
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:23,229
<i>ended up in the hands
of the vory v zakone.</i>

309
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:25,338
Do you know what that means?

310
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:28,054
Look,

311
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,072
if I don't find a relative
in the next few days

312
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:31,673
they're going to put Christine
out for fostering.

313
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,095
Once she's in the system,
she'll never get out again.

314
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,785
Who named her Christine?

315
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,010
I had to call her something.

316
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:45,022
Sounds like Christmas.

317
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,851
She's so beautiful.

318
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:58,175
If I can persuade Stepan
to translate it, will you
leave the rest to the police?

319
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,254
Tell him I've heard
bad words before.

320
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:58,396
So which one are
we going to fuck?

321
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:00,764
What do you care?

322
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,007
Serious.

323
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:08,348
Pick one.
Come on.
Let me enjoy myself.

324
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:12,308
Hear me.
You are going to fuck
one of these girls.

325
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,763
Okay. Okay.

326
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:24,253
You're going to fuck
one of these girls now!

327
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,900
That's an order.

328
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:42,611
What's the matter with you?

329
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,339
Who are you going to fuck?

330
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:46,747
Calm down, Kirill.

331
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:48,732
I am recommending you
to my father.

332
00:32:48,797 --> 00:32:51,895
I have to be sure
that you ain't
no fucking queer.

333
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:57,305
That's enough, Kirill.

334
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,275
Enough?

335
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,848
Siberian ox...

336
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:04,530
<i>You don't tell a vor
what is enough.</i>

337
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:11,251
I'm taking you to
my father's favorite stable.

338
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,640
He comes here himself
because they're all clean.

339
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:18,899
So now I'm going to
watch you fuck
one of these bitches.

340
00:33:19,612 --> 00:33:23,059
So you can prove me
that you are no queer.

341
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:27,189
Psycho.

342
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,115
So, which one is it
going to be?

343
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:38,709
That one.

344
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:47,475
<i>When I was little,
London was like
a place in the Bible.</i>

345
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:50,034
<i>I wasn't even sure
if it was real.</i>

346
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:54,865
<i>My friend has told me
there is a place in London
where they pay girls to sing.</i>

347
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:58,997
<i>He said if I sang in
this restaurant I would
make more money in a week</i>

348
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:01,270
<i>than my father would
in a year.</i>

349
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,087
Very nice.

350
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,181
You did it very nice.

351
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,775
Yeah? Really?

352
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:28,529
Thank you, brother.

353
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,413
So, if my examination is over,

354
00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:40,014
get the fuck out of here
while I get dressed.

355
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:26,836
What's your last name?

356
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:32,716
Tell me your last name.

357
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:35,918
Kirilenko.

358
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,349
Where are you from?

359
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,486
Ukraine.

360
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:46,611
Which village? Which town?

361
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:49,710
Irpen.

362
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:51,636
Outside Kiev.

363
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:04,206
Stay alive a little longer.

364
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,214
Understand?

365
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:25,070
<i>My friend said
he would get me to Amsterdam</i>

366
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,523
<i>and from there we could
find a way into London.</i>

367
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:33,385
<i>I have been practicing
my singing and have even
rejoined the church choir.</i>

368
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:36,113
<i>I'm also practicing
my English.</i>

369
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:41,587
<i>My friend says his uncle
owns a restaurant
where you can sing.</i>

370
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:44,205
<i>He's sure this man
will take care of me.</i>

371
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:47,570
Let's go to sleep now.
Hello, Anna.

372
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:49,872
I came on tiptoes.

373
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:51,465
How did you get in here?

374
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,632
There are always open doors,
Anna Ivanovna.

375
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,317
I'm afraid you're not
allowed in here.

376
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:01,519
Please, Anna.
Let me speak.

377
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,113
I translated the diary.

378
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:15,946
I was shocked to discover
that my son, Kirill,

379
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,800
is mentioned many times.

380
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,980
I have known for some years
that he has strayed
from the path

381
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,643
I set out for him.

382
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:36,590
His mother...
His mother died
when he was very young.

383
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,471
What did it say about him?

384
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,968
Many bad things.

385
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:53,927
But please, Anna,
let me deal with him.

386
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,738
If the diary should
find its way to the police...

387
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:02,791
I mean, some of the things
my son did

388
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,957
are illegal.

389
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:09,130
And he is a good boy.

390
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,102
I don't care about him.
I care about the baby.

391
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:15,244
Of course. Of course.

392
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:25,447
That is the baby.

393
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,077
So sweet.

394
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,897
I have made some enquiries.

395
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:37,611
I have found out
an address for Tatiana's
family in Russia.

396
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:42,120
That's where
the baby belongs, no?

397
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:47,813
Perhaps we can do a deal.

398
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,532
Do you understand me?

399
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:58,379
It's okay.
He was just leaving.

400
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,974
So you know where I am,

401
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:07,657
and I know where you are,
Anna Ivanovna.

402
00:39:10,574 --> 00:39:14,796
<i>I was thrown down the stairs,
and fell onto some sacks,</i>

403
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:16,106
<i>like potato sacks.</i>

404
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:19,276
<i>Kirill came down after me...
"Kirill came down after me...</i>

405
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:21,000
<i>...and he hit me
until I was bleeding.</i>

406
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,339
- "...and he hit me
until I was bleeding.

407
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:27,879
"Then he tried to rape me
but he couldn't do it.

408
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:32,650
"He just got madder and madder
and kept hitting me.

409
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:37,227
"In the end
his father came down.

410
00:39:38,157 --> 00:39:41,474
"It was the father
who raped me.

411
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:46,826
"He shouted at his son,

412
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:51,595
"'lf you don't break a horse
it will never
be tame, Kirill.'"

413
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,525
Hello, dear.
How was your night?

414
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:03,235
Stepan's arthritis
is playing up.
I'm taking dictation.

415
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,683
Do you want some tea
or something?

416
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,773
He came to see me.

417
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:20,801
The man from the restaurant,
he came to the hospital.

418
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,192
I told you this!
I told you that...
I know and it's my fault.

419
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:25,957
It's no one's fault.

420
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:29,922
I have a friend from Ukraine
who's got a gun...

421
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,842
Stepan!
...from the war
in Afghanistan.

422
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:34,565
Don't talk about guns.

423
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,132
<i>I dealt with the vory v zakone
when I worked for the KGB.</i>

424
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:43,235
You never worked
for the fucking KGB.

425
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:45,889
I was an auxiliary!

426
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:49,546
What did this man want?

427
00:40:52,554 --> 00:40:54,244
He wants the diary.

428
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,715
And in return he'll give us
Tatiana's family address.

429
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,655
Christine's family.

430
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:05,729
You cannot do deals
with those people.

431
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:08,933
This isn't a deal.
It's an exchange
of information.

432
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:11,653
Have you already forgotten
what I just read to you?

433
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:13,610
We have to be practical.

434
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,138
I think he was threatening
to harm the baby.

435
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,064
Then it's settled.
No!

436
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:22,754
Stepan!

437
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:25,438
This isn't our world.

438
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:27,335
We are ordinary people.

439
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:35,298
She was an ordinary person.

440
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:46,855
Come here.

441
00:41:49,192 --> 00:41:51,101
I've got present for you.

442
00:42:02,216 --> 00:42:03,874
From France.

443
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:05,285
Old as fuck!

444
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:12,100
Here.

445
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:13,511
Open one.

446
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:15,714
Old is good with wine.

447
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:22,204
Sixty quid a bottle anywhere.
Except I got this for
10 quid a case, man.

448
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:24,709
From where?

449
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:27,710
From where, you don't ask.

450
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,655
Now,

451
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,826
if Papa says okay,

452
00:42:35,015 --> 00:42:38,178
I can start telling you
about the serious stuff.

453
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:40,581
Import, export.

454
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:44,126
This booze is just like gifts
for Papa's friends.

455
00:42:44,198 --> 00:42:48,159
The real import stuff is
from Kabul.

456
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:50,106
You understand?

457
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:55,388
Papa! You scared me.
What's wrong?
We're just sampling.

458
00:42:55,462 --> 00:42:57,186
What's wrong?

459
00:42:57,254 --> 00:43:00,068
Your friend Soyka is dead.

460
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,131
Yeah?

461
00:43:04,198 --> 00:43:07,614
So what? It has nothing
to do with me.

462
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:10,172
No, no, no. Don't lie to me.

463
00:43:10,244 --> 00:43:11,652
Papa, believe me.

464
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:14,532
I said don't lie to me!
Papa. Papa!

465
00:43:14,598 --> 00:43:16,736
Don't lie to me!

466
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,350
Kirill. Your dad is right.
No point lying to him.

467
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:24,384
What are you saying?

468
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:26,043
Azim's nephew slit
Soyka's throat.

469
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:28,801
Kirill paid him to do it.

470
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:30,975
Shut your fucking mouth!

471
00:43:31,237 --> 00:43:33,506
Your dad always
knows the truth.

472
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:36,858
It's okay, boss.
You don't have to worry.

473
00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:38,972
What? I don't
have to worry?

474
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:43,649
I got rid of body myself.

475
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:45,178
Police won't find anything.

476
00:43:45,252 --> 00:43:48,066
My son commits a murder
on my own doorstep.

477
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:49,920
A fellow soldier.

478
00:43:49,987 --> 00:43:52,224
And no one thought
to tell me about it?

479
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:55,838
<i>Vory v zakone code says,
"Never speak to anybody
about your captain."</i>

480
00:43:55,908 --> 00:43:57,664
Kirill is my captain.

481
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,478
When I find out
what happened,

482
00:44:00,548 --> 00:44:03,897
we do what we have to,
to clean up situation.

483
00:44:03,972 --> 00:44:06,874
Soyka was spreading lies
about Kirill.

484
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:08,541
About your family.

485
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:12,641
It was the right thing.

486
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:16,829
I decide what's right
and what's wrong.

487
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:20,510
<i>You do not kill a vor
for no reason.</i>

488
00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:25,272
You know as well as I do,
Soyka was talking to police.

489
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,525
For a driver,
you are well-informed.

490
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:33,496
I have connections
with Chechens exporting cars.

491
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,240
They tell me Soyka speaks
to Russian desk,
Scotland Yard.

492
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,988
Kirill did the right thing.

493
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:44,761
He did a good thing
for our people.
They will appreciate that.

494
00:44:45,186 --> 00:44:48,447
Yeah, Papa! I swear.
Shut up!

495
00:44:53,729 --> 00:44:55,933
If you are so well-informed,

496
00:44:57,314 --> 00:45:02,015
you will know Soyka
has brothers.

497
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:05,533
That's okay.
Kirill has got me.

498
00:45:06,272 --> 00:45:07,582
It's okay?

499
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:11,192
Okay.

500
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:15,518
Get boxes out of sight.

501
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:27,606
<i>So you heard him, patsan!
Now you get these boxes
out of sight.</i>

502
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,519
Ok, ok.

503
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,362
Here.
Thank you.

504
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:49,753
How can you eat?
I'm hungry.

505
00:45:56,831 --> 00:45:58,522
That's their driver.

506
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,988
Here he comes.

507
00:46:19,295 --> 00:46:21,148
Meet in public place...

508
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,636
Lot of people around.
Very wise.

509
00:46:26,973 --> 00:46:30,170
And I see
you bring bodyguards.

510
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:32,505
Also very wise.

511
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,452
When I was
in the KGB, we knew how to
deal with scum like you.

512
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:38,553
And you did what there?

513
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:39,767
Stepan.

514
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:46,646
Anna?

515
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:13,748
Okay.

516
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:16,728
Thank you.

517
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:20,443
Now, you give me the address.
What address?

518
00:47:23,227 --> 00:47:24,821
Tatiana's family.

519
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:30,101
I don't know
what you're talking about.

520
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:34,229
See? You see?
I told you it would
happen like this.

521
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,893
I told you this.
Anna!

522
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:42,901
She was 14! Read the diary.

523
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:46,200
She was 14 when he raped her.
You bastards murdered her.

524
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:47,958
Calm down.

525
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:52,884
Anger is very dangerous.
Makes people do stupid things.

526
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:56,751
Please, forget any of this
ever happened.

527
00:47:58,011 --> 00:48:00,247
You're in very wrong place,
Anna Ivanovna.

528
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:02,736
You belong in there
with nice people.

529
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:06,517
Stay away from people like me.

530
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:11,190
Devil!

531
00:48:13,114 --> 00:48:14,576
Motherfucker!

532
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:15,828
Stepan!

533
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:34,670
<i>I'm not sure
I can carry on another day.</i>

534
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,541
<i>The windows won't open,
so I can't throw myself out.</i>

535
00:48:40,408 --> 00:48:44,085
<i>They inject me every day
with heroin.</i>

536
00:48:44,152 --> 00:48:47,764
<i>Sometimes I think
this is all a hallucination.</i>

537
00:49:01,209 --> 00:49:05,964
It's always good to have
someone who I can trust
to do simple tasks.

538
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:11,667
In this business,
sometimes the biggest danger

539
00:49:11,735 --> 00:49:15,314
comes from
the most stupid things.

540
00:49:15,384 --> 00:49:19,060
You can't afford to
be careless in any area.

541
00:49:34,743 --> 00:49:39,979
So, what was the lie
Soyka was spreading
about my son?

542
00:49:40,374 --> 00:49:41,781
It was nothing important.

543
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:45,587
Kirill had him killed
for nothing important?

544
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,638
I don't like to repeat this.

545
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,064
For me, you will repeat it.

546
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:57,931
You play with the prince
to do business with the king.

547
00:49:58,007 --> 00:50:01,835
If you want to
do business with me
you must be open with me.

548
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,331
Thieves in law.

549
00:50:06,613 --> 00:50:09,331
So what was Soyka saying
about the prince?

550
00:50:12,629 --> 00:50:14,255
That he's a drunk.

551
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:21,044
And also,

552
00:50:24,085 --> 00:50:25,295
a queer.

553
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:36,815
My only son.

554
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:44,429
You know,
it never snows in this city.

555
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:47,306
It's never hot.

556
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:51,630
London is a city
of whores and queers.

557
00:50:55,475 --> 00:50:58,988
I think London is to blame

558
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:01,961
for what he is.

559
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,358
Why don't you go home?

560
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:07,980
Cold gets into my bones.

561
00:51:08,051 --> 00:51:12,306
Also, KGB would
be waiting for me.

562
00:51:13,428 --> 00:51:14,475
FSB.

563
00:51:15,315 --> 00:51:18,130
They are called FSB now.

564
00:51:18,195 --> 00:51:21,971
Whatever they call them,
they are worse even
than the KGB were.

565
00:51:24,658 --> 00:51:28,302
The midwife said
she had an uncle.

566
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,063
A Russian.

567
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:33,360
I met him.

568
00:51:34,578 --> 00:51:36,782
So you know
what he looks like.

569
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:41,771
Yes, yes.

570
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,166
She said he has
read the diary.

571
00:51:47,218 --> 00:51:51,014
You cannot trust a Russian
with that kind of information.

572
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:56,805
Do you understand me?

573
00:51:58,129 --> 00:51:59,503
Yes.

574
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:04,400
Perhaps you can
deal with him.

575
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:32,841
I thought that
I should bring it back
before it got stolen.

576
00:52:32,913 --> 00:52:34,768
Lot of villains around.

577
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:42,730
I have address you wanted.

578
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:45,898
Small village
outside Novokuznetsk.

579
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,140
I know it.

580
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:52,366
Not good place
for kid to grow up.

581
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:55,886
Especially not little girl.

582
00:52:55,952 --> 00:53:00,108
If you want my opinion,
she would be better off
in London.

583
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:02,062
Maybe with you. Why not?

584
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,979
So you've read the diary?

585
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:29,993
How can you keep doing
what you're doing?

586
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,576
I'm just a driver.

587
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,775
Why'd you bring me this?
I don't know.

588
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:51,298
I was passing.

589
00:53:57,197 --> 00:53:58,506
Your uncle.

590
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:02,507
It's true he was in KGB?

591
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,329
I don't know.

592
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:06,219
Does he live with you?

593
00:54:19,948 --> 00:54:22,501
I fixed it.

594
00:54:22,572 --> 00:54:24,262
Should be okay now.

595
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:46,117
Hey! Hey!

596
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,547
Excuse me.
Just calm down.

597
00:54:54,603 --> 00:54:57,122
Listen to me.
Just calm down, all right?

598
00:54:57,195 --> 00:54:58,721
Take it easy.

599
00:55:02,954 --> 00:55:04,296
Arsenal!

600
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:07,234
Arsenal!

601
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:10,470
Wanker!
Arsenal! Arsenal!

602
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,181
Chelsea!

603
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:18,821
Arsenal!
Wanker!

604
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:21,792
Arsenal!
Chelsea! Chelsea!

605
00:55:30,057 --> 00:55:32,129
Arsenal. Arsenal!

606
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:38,151
For my brother...

607
00:57:24,485 --> 00:57:27,071
They were going to kill me.

608
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:30,337
Those Chechens are savages.

609
00:57:30,404 --> 00:57:32,608
What did they say
about my son?

610
00:57:41,637 --> 00:57:43,393
They said

611
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,980
they would spare me

612
00:57:46,052 --> 00:57:48,473
only if I delivered
Kirill to them.

613
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:54,301
You are being
very, very honest.

614
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:59,583
I... I fear you
more than I fear them.

615
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:05,113
Never again do business
with any member of my family

616
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:08,057
behind my back.

617
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:11,135
Never.

618
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:15,578
I will never listen
to Kirill again. I swear it.

619
00:58:17,315 --> 00:58:19,648
Do they know

620
00:58:19,714 --> 00:58:22,464
where to find Kirill?

621
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:25,695
They are like wolves.

622
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:29,344
Do they know
what he looks like?

623
00:58:30,147 --> 00:58:31,870
No.

624
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:34,689
They have just arrived
from the mountains.

625
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,890
Tell them you will
deliver Kirill to them.

626
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:44,826
And tell them

627
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,029
to give you two days.

628
00:58:52,098 --> 00:58:53,308
Two days.

629
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:58,968
<i>I know now, for sure,
that I am pregnant.</i>

630
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:01,245
<i>It hasn't begun to show yet.</i>

631
00:59:01,313 --> 00:59:04,575
<i>After I was raped
they made me take pills.</i>

632
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,780
<i>But I guess it was too late.</i>

633
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:10,144
<i>I am condemned to give birth
to a new life.</i>

634
00:59:10,209 --> 00:59:14,965
<i>But first,
I will try to find a way
to end my own life</i>

635
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,855
<i>and spare this child the pain.</i>

636
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:23,867
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I was passing.

637
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:27,447
Well, if you're passing,
just pass.

638
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:30,132
You keep on going, bitch.

639
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:31,859
Nikolai, come on.

640
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:36,247
You should go now.

641
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:40,796
Family's important
to you people, isn't it?

642
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:43,094
To "you people"?

643
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:45,427
What's she talking about?

644
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:46,711
I didn't catch it.

645
01:00:47,804 --> 01:00:49,114
Tell Semyon,

646
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:52,247
the baby I delivered
last Sunday is his daughter.

647
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:55,421
What did she say?

648
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:58,104
I don't know.

649
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:03,227
When he raped her,
she was a virgin.
Then they gave her pills.

650
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,180
He has to be the father.

651
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:08,252
Kirill! Kirill!

652
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:09,722
Shut up, bitch!

653
01:01:09,788 --> 01:01:10,737
Fuck her, Kirill!

654
01:01:11,741 --> 01:01:12,723
Forget her.

655
01:01:12,893 --> 01:01:15,511
She was 14.
She was just a child.

656
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,577
You don't pronounce
the name of my father.

657
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:27,862
You stop talking shit
about him.

658
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:29,873
You don't look
at her anymore.

659
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:31,736
That's an order.

660
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:37,523
Tell him what I said.
Tell him what?

661
01:01:38,812 --> 01:01:40,754
There is nothing to tell.

662
01:01:40,828 --> 01:01:42,900
Slaves give birth to slaves.

663
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,136
Tell him what I said.

664
01:01:46,652 --> 01:01:48,593
Yes, you know,

665
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:52,628
the girl you fucked
the other day in front of me.
The Ukrainian bitch.

666
01:01:52,698 --> 01:01:56,626
Anyway, so,
the police arrives,
some ordinary fucking police.

667
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:00,081
They just kick down the door
and ask for her by name.

668
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:01,331
Then they just
take her away.

669
01:02:01,403 --> 01:02:05,745
Like some fucking punter
just might have given them
her name or something?

670
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:08,884
What gives
the right to the police
to take our women?

671
01:02:08,953 --> 01:02:09,935
I don't know.

672
01:02:10,746 --> 01:02:13,845
Fuck police. Hey, Papa.

673
01:02:13,915 --> 01:02:16,303
I've never seen
so many old people
in one place.

674
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:17,971
Whose party is that?

675
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:19,701
The angel of death?

676
01:02:20,601 --> 01:02:22,162
She is one hundred years old.

677
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:24,435
I know.
Kirill,

678
01:02:25,689 --> 01:02:28,985
go down into the cellar
and bring up some brandy.

679
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:33,039
Twelve bottles.

680
01:02:34,554 --> 01:02:36,180
Kolya, you hear that?

681
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,632
Go down in the cellar.
Get 12 bottles of brandy
for Papa.

682
01:02:39,705 --> 01:02:42,127
No, no. He stays here.

683
01:02:42,201 --> 01:02:44,110
I want to talk business.

684
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:46,548
Business?

685
01:02:47,608 --> 01:02:49,069
What business?

686
01:02:50,713 --> 01:02:53,877
Papa! What business?

687
01:02:53,945 --> 01:02:55,984
His business is my business.

688
01:02:57,081 --> 01:03:00,047
Go to the cellar, Kirill.

689
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:01,812
And take your time.

690
01:03:19,512 --> 01:03:22,927
So, did you deal with
the old man?

691
01:03:33,368 --> 01:03:35,789
Good. Good.

692
01:03:37,175 --> 01:03:39,858
It's time you joined us.

693
01:03:43,414 --> 01:03:44,822
Thank you...

694
01:03:45,014 --> 01:03:45,942
Papa.

695
01:03:46,678 --> 01:03:50,573
<i>You, my dear friend...</i>

696
01:03:50,999 --> 01:03:54,927
<i>... don't think ill of me.</i>

697
01:03:58,103 --> 01:04:01,419
<i>In this wilderness...</i>

698
01:04:02,934 --> 01:04:06,283
<i>... simply bury me.</i>

699
01:04:20,182 --> 01:04:23,051
My dad swapped
a little girl from Georgia
for this shit.

700
01:04:25,046 --> 01:04:28,788
Don't feel bad for
what happened up there.
It's just how he is.

701
01:04:29,525 --> 01:04:32,721
He plays people
against each other.
That's all.

702
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:35,472
I understand more and more
how he's like.

703
01:04:37,396 --> 01:04:38,443
Here.

704
01:04:39,156 --> 01:04:42,287
Let's drink to
the little Georgian girl.

705
01:04:50,996 --> 01:04:52,589
I drink alone now?

706
01:05:14,004 --> 01:05:15,694
He offered me stars.

707
01:05:19,347 --> 01:05:20,907
I accept.

708
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:05,289
You think
I didn't know already?

709
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,907
He told me before.
It was my fucking idea.

710
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:15,536
He said now
there are a lot of things
I have to teach you.

711
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:18,929
It will take long time.

712
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,438
I've been protecting you
until now.

713
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:24,846
Yes, yes, Kirill.

714
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:28,678
Hey...

715
01:06:29,328 --> 01:06:32,459
You think
I don't know things
that you don't know?

716
01:06:32,528 --> 01:06:34,154
<i>I am a vor by birth.</i>

717
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,970
The star's
a fucking birthmark for me!

718
01:06:37,455 --> 01:06:38,536
I know.

719
01:06:41,104 --> 01:06:42,479
Don't you forget it.

720
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,014
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

721
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:56,778
We've got to celebrate.
Come here.

722
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,025
Help me with the bottles.

723
01:06:58,095 --> 01:07:00,778
Your dad don't need
bottles anymore.

724
01:07:31,598 --> 01:07:33,157
Beautiful building...

725
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:38,763
Good evening.

726
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:44,743
Is everything ok?

727
01:07:45,198 --> 01:07:47,140
Yes, everything's fine.

728
01:07:55,981 --> 01:08:00,716
We can see
that you were in prison
in Siberia...

729
01:08:01,037 --> 01:08:02,980
...and that you were a thief.

730
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:07,148
My father was
a government worker.

731
01:08:07,245 --> 01:08:09,449
He fixed the cars
of officials.

732
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:13,607
I began by selling
the spare parts
when I was fifteen.

733
01:08:15,566 --> 01:08:17,287
You have no forced tattoos?

734
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:18,756
None.

735
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,598
You were not cooperative?

736
01:08:23,596 --> 01:08:25,701
I spent two years
in the punishment block.

737
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:30,403
You went through the Crosses
in St. Petersburg?

738
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:32,262
I was in solitary confinement
a dozen times.

739
01:08:32,365 --> 01:08:34,666
<i>I was called 'T he Stump'
because they couldn't
shift me.</i>

740
01:08:37,517 --> 01:08:40,745
Your father was a bitch
and a weak fucker for
working for the Government.

741
01:08:41,612 --> 01:08:42,594
Right?

742
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:46,305
That's right.

743
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:49,352
He means nothing to me.

744
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:51,753
My mother...
You have no mother.

745
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:53,380
She was a whore anyway.

746
01:08:57,419 --> 01:08:58,434
Yes.

747
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:07,042
I have no mother
and no father.

748
01:09:07,787 --> 01:09:11,779
<i>There is only the code,
the vory v zakone code...</i>

749
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:14,403
...which I have
always followed.

750
01:09:15,562 --> 01:09:18,823
That is why there is
an empty space
above your heart...

751
01:09:21,162 --> 01:09:23,169
...where the stars will go.

752
01:09:23,722 --> 01:09:25,893
And an empty space
on your knees.

753
01:09:29,194 --> 01:09:31,103
I am dead already.

754
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:32,745
I died when I was fifteen.

755
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:36,065
Now I live in the zone
all the time.

756
01:10:50,503 --> 01:10:52,804
I tried to
get hold of Stepan.

757
01:10:52,871 --> 01:10:54,694
If he's not at home,
he's usually at his sister's

758
01:10:54,759 --> 01:10:57,278
but she hasn't heard
from him at all.

759
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,637
He did spit in
that awful man's face.

760
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:06,495
I don't think
the driver would do
anything to Stepan.

761
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,191
How do you know?

762
01:11:11,046 --> 01:11:13,762
You haven't spoken
to him since, have you?

763
01:11:29,412 --> 01:11:31,681
You're late.
I know.

764
01:11:33,221 --> 01:11:34,431
I'm cold.

765
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:39,042
Let's go in.

766
01:11:47,556 --> 01:11:51,746
Semyon recommends these places
for business meetings

767
01:11:53,732 --> 01:11:57,081
because you can see
what tattoos a man has.

768
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:03,132
Come on.
We have a lot to cover.

769
01:12:04,996 --> 01:12:06,402
Let's cook.

770
01:12:13,444 --> 01:12:17,022
What you were saying
about Kabul?
Yes.

771
01:12:19,172 --> 01:12:23,906
Our lines to Kabul are broken
every two or three weeks.

772
01:12:25,283 --> 01:12:27,553
Why?
Why?

773
01:12:29,155 --> 01:12:33,181
The Americans.
Fucking NATO.

774
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:45,787
Valery Nabokov

775
01:12:45,858 --> 01:12:50,429
imports flowers
and television sets
into this country.

776
01:12:52,129 --> 01:12:55,425
The television sets are
one in ten.

777
01:12:56,514 --> 01:12:58,336
That means

778
01:12:58,401 --> 01:13:03,136
one in ten have cargo
inside them.

779
01:13:03,554 --> 01:13:05,692
Where do they unload them?

780
01:13:12,577 --> 01:13:16,889
I will tell you
when I return
from the bathroom.

781
01:13:16,962 --> 01:13:19,514
Okay?
Okay.

782
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:20,632
Yeah.

783
01:13:22,817 --> 01:13:24,442
I will be back.

784
01:13:25,408 --> 01:13:26,489
Soon.

785
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,000
"Where do they unload them?"

786
01:13:53,632 --> 01:13:56,249
Kirill is in there...

787
01:13:56,959 --> 01:13:59,031
...there, there.

788
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:03,929
You will see the stars
there on his chest.

789
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:10,357
Well done.

790
01:15:07,196 --> 01:15:08,341
Are you okay?

791
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:10,229
Finish him off.

792
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,937
Enough.

793
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:28,879
My uncle,

794
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:34,989
the one who spat in your face,
he's disappeared.

795
01:18:36,148 --> 01:18:39,946
If we don't hear
from him soon,
we're going to the police.

796
01:18:40,021 --> 01:18:41,909
Do you know where he is?

797
01:18:45,045 --> 01:18:47,913
Yes. Scotland.

798
01:18:49,461 --> 01:18:50,737
Edinburgh.

799
01:18:51,636 --> 01:18:53,425
Five-star hotel.

800
01:18:56,085 --> 01:18:59,629
Edinburgh?
Your uncle knew too much.

801
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:05,067
I was told
to send him to heaven
with bullet in his head.

802
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:10,891
Instead I sent him
to Edinburgh

803
01:19:10,964 --> 01:19:12,972
with first-class ticket.

804
01:19:15,603 --> 01:19:16,880
He's okay.

805
01:19:18,516 --> 01:19:21,995
He's old school,
he understands situation.

806
01:19:23,187 --> 01:19:25,642
Exile or death.

807
01:19:31,474 --> 01:19:34,824
His hotel is called Caledonia.

808
01:19:41,138 --> 01:19:42,086
Hello.
Hi.

809
01:19:42,162 --> 01:19:44,497
Nikolai Luzhin, please.

810
01:19:44,562 --> 01:19:48,871
For that patient, I will need
your security clearance
information, please.

811
01:20:01,266 --> 01:20:02,924
You got my message.

812
01:20:04,722 --> 01:20:09,063
Using a dead body
to file a progress report
is original.

813
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:11,854
It must be against
FSB regulations.

814
01:20:11,921 --> 01:20:14,223
You didn't come here
to give me flowers...

815
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:15,431
No.

816
01:20:16,209 --> 01:20:19,024
In view of what's
happened to you

817
01:20:19,089 --> 01:20:23,629
and in the light of
other violent incidents
associated with you,

818
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:25,224
the Russian desk
at Scotland Yard

819
01:20:25,296 --> 01:20:27,752
have made an official request
to the Russian embassy

820
01:20:27,825 --> 01:20:31,140
that your undercover operation
in London be terminated.

821
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:35,661
You have gone beyond
what was agreed.

822
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:42,479
If they terminate
operation now
they will be wasting these.

823
01:20:44,721 --> 01:20:49,260
So you tell the Russian desk
you have seen stars
over my heart.

824
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:52,491
Tell them
I'm through the door.

825
01:21:01,296 --> 01:21:03,913
Tell them I'm going to
replace Semyon

826
01:21:04,367 --> 01:21:06,702
as boss of
London organization.

827
01:21:08,144 --> 01:21:10,860
What drugs are
they giving you?

828
01:21:10,927 --> 01:21:13,316
I need you
to take Semyon
out of the picture.

829
01:21:13,391 --> 01:21:15,879
I want you to arrest him.

830
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:17,641
Arrest him for what?

831
01:21:18,223 --> 01:21:19,270
Rape.

832
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:24,937
The girl was 14.

833
01:21:25,007 --> 01:21:28,487
And, of course,
she will testify?
She is dead.

834
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:30,501
But she had Semyon's baby.

835
01:21:31,502 --> 01:21:34,535
If you can prove baby was his
and girl was underage,

836
01:21:34,606 --> 01:21:37,256
that is statutory rape.

837
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:40,075
You have baby,
you need Semyon's DNA.

838
01:21:41,422 --> 01:21:43,014
For poetic reasons

839
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:46,407
I suggest you take his blood.

840
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,326
What are you looking at, baby?

841
01:22:00,653 --> 01:22:01,962
You.

842
01:22:05,165 --> 01:22:08,394
What were you and Grandpa
shouting about last night?

843
01:22:12,365 --> 01:22:14,634
Nothing, baby. Nothing.

844
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:16,643
Sounded like something.

845
01:22:20,492 --> 01:22:24,071
It's just that
someone I know got hurt

846
01:22:24,429 --> 01:22:25,954
so I blamed it on Grandpa.

847
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,762
Did you fight each other?
I heard banging.

848
01:22:33,771 --> 01:22:34,753
No.

849
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:39,459
It's not a fight
if one of you
doesn't fight back, right?

850
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:06,309
Maria, go upstairs.

851
01:23:07,947 --> 01:23:09,637
Go upstairs, I said.

852
01:23:17,707 --> 01:23:20,226
So, Papa, what did
they want from you?

853
01:23:23,114 --> 01:23:24,521
To poison me.

854
01:23:26,698 --> 01:23:29,219
They took blood from me
with a needle.

855
01:23:30,409 --> 01:23:33,409
Probably the same needle
they use for the junkies

856
01:23:33,481 --> 01:23:35,783
and whores and blacks
and queers.

857
01:23:38,282 --> 01:23:41,544
Now I probably have
the fucking queer disease.

858
01:23:46,025 --> 01:23:48,512
Why would they want
your blood, Papa?

859
01:23:59,433 --> 01:24:01,156
Goodbye.
Good night.

860
01:24:28,807 --> 01:24:31,393
Where have you
taken Christine?
Tell me, you bastard!

861
01:24:31,463 --> 01:24:33,536
You've taken her!
He took her, didn't he?

862
01:24:33,607 --> 01:24:35,909
What are you talking about?

863
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:43,871
I saw Kirill. I thought...

864
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:39,620
Forgive me.

865
01:25:41,893 --> 01:25:43,452
Forgive me, baby.

866
01:25:44,677 --> 01:25:46,139
Sorry.

867
01:26:03,812 --> 01:26:05,721
She's just a little girl!

868
01:26:07,427 --> 01:26:10,460
<i>She's just a little
fucking devochka, Papa!</i>

869
01:26:12,131 --> 01:26:13,342
Kirill.

870
01:26:18,627 --> 01:26:20,352
Let me take the baby.

871
01:26:22,403 --> 01:26:24,411
Please, she's cold.

872
01:26:33,442 --> 01:26:35,167
We don't kill babies.

873
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:39,935
This will be bad for us.

874
01:26:40,003 --> 01:26:42,273
Your father has gone too far.

875
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:50,010
You're either with him
or with me.

876
01:27:09,506 --> 01:27:14,142
With him or with me.

877
01:27:16,674 --> 01:27:20,089
I swear I didn't know
my Papa was setting you up.

878
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:23,419
I know.

879
01:27:24,033 --> 01:27:26,368
I know, Kirill.

880
01:27:30,753 --> 01:27:32,955
Give her to me.

881
01:27:47,776 --> 01:27:49,751
Your father's going away.

882
01:27:49,824 --> 01:27:53,120
The family business
will be yours.
It's our time.

883
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:55,258
You're the boss now.

884
01:27:57,151 --> 01:28:00,412
You're the boss.
Now we are partners.

885
01:28:02,623 --> 01:28:04,030
That's right.

886
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:08,028
Why don't we go home?
Come on.

887
01:28:09,152 --> 01:28:11,606
I'll take you home.
No.

888
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,542
We're missing
the fucking party of the year!
Happy New Year!

889
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,662
Let's go.

890
01:28:17,534 --> 01:28:18,550
Come on!

891
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:20,696
That's an order!

892
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,206
You are okay?

893
01:28:27,645 --> 01:28:29,654
I need to know who you are.

894
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,170
Why did you help us?

895
01:28:36,671 --> 01:28:40,893
How can I become king,
if king is still in place?

896
01:28:51,261 --> 01:28:53,400
Bless you.

897
01:29:21,404 --> 01:29:25,495
Goodbye, Anna Ivanovna.

898
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:40,282
It's okay.

899
01:29:41,403 --> 01:29:42,680
Nikolai!

900
01:30:22,394 --> 01:30:25,809
My little Russian doll...

901
01:30:30,266 --> 01:30:32,088
We're gonna go
and get something.

902
01:30:33,018 --> 01:30:37,394
Should we see Mama?
Should we see Mama?
Yeah. Come on.

903
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:39,213
Yeah, come on.

904
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:44,083
Here she is.
There's your Mama.

905
01:30:44,153 --> 01:30:46,291
Here she is,
my little angel.

906
01:30:47,418 --> 01:30:49,719
My muffin.

907
01:30:49,785 --> 01:30:51,279
Are you hungry?

908
01:30:53,434 --> 01:30:54,678
Are you?

909
01:31:02,074 --> 01:31:03,634
Who wants dinner?

910
01:31:04,538 --> 01:31:06,390
<i>My name is Tatiana.</i>

911
01:31:07,415 --> 01:31:10,712
<i>My father died in the mines
in my village,</i>

912
01:31:10,776 --> 01:31:14,191
<i>so he was already buried
when he died.</i>

913
01:31:14,264 --> 01:31:15,987
<i>We were all buried there.</i>

914
01:31:16,056 --> 01:31:18,325
<i>Buried under the soil
of Russia.</i>

915
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,437
<i>That is why I left,
to find a better life.</i>

916
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:50,100
THE END
