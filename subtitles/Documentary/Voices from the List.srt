1
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,980
Hey, Jerry.

2
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,350
Hey, Mr. Kowalski.

3
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,519
Call me Dennis.
It's okay.

4
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,588
Just wanted to say
we're very pleased.

5
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,023
You're doing a great job.

6
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,558
Thank you,
Mr. Kowalski.

7
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,026
That's what
I told that lady
from the courts.

8
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,462
"A great job," I said.
She's your lawyer?

9
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,130
She's a court-appointed
psychiatrist, Dennis.

10
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:48,133
- Thank you for...
thank you for saying that.
- No problem.

11
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:52,637
So, Jerry, the thing is,
is Milton Fixtures every year

12
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,639
has the company party,
a barbecue.

13
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,876
- Okay.
- And we get one representative
from each department

14
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,745
to help put it on,
usually the new guy.

15
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:03,081
And the new guy
in Shipping is you.

16
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,550
So, you...

17
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,985
want me to help
plan the party?

18
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,987
It's voluntary,
off the clock.

19
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,689
There will be
others, too.

20
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,024
Someone from Sales,
a guy from Design,

21
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,761
that cute English chick
in Accounting, Fiona.

22
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,963
- You wanna do it?
- Yes, I do!
Of course I do.

23
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,097
- Thank you.
- Cool.

24
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,665
First meeting
is tomorrow night at 5:00.

25
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,967
Yeah, I wanna get it on.
I wanna get it on.

26
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,668
The company buys
pizza and beer.

27
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,803
Okay, I'm in.
Thank you, Dennis.

28
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,138
- It'll be fun.
- Thank you, Dennis.

29
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,773
Okay, okay.

30
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,823
Bosco!

31
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,726
Who's my guy?
Who's my guy?

32
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,728
Who's my guy?
Who's my guy?

33
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,463
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

34
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,697
<i>You're a good boy!</i>

35
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,934
You're a good boy!

36
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,643
<i>What you doin', Jerry?</i>

37
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,144
Something for work.

38
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,847
<i>Those assholes give you
homework now?</i>

39
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,017
Trying on a shirt
for tomorrow.

40
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,787
<i>- They got something
that they want me to do.
- A shirt?</i>

41
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,156
<i>- Shouldn't that be
a straitjacket?
- Shut up.</i>

42
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,892
<i>You act like
they're doing you a favor
to let you work there,</i>

43
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,594
<i>like they should be able
to fuck you in the ass</i>

44
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,995
<i>without lube
whenever they want,</i>

45
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,697
<i>like some big privilege,</i>

46
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,600
<i>letting you work for free
on their picnic.</i>

47
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,070
How do you know
about the picnic?

48
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,240
<i>-  I know everything, Jerry.
- I'm not talking to you.</i>

49
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,809
<i>They'll mock you
the second you leave
the room, Jerry.</i>

50
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,811
<i>You're an unstable
crybaby.</i>

51
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,146
I'm not a crybaby.

52
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,981
<i>You're crying right now,
liar.</i>

53
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,616
<i>Come on.</i>

54
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,117
<i>The only reason
they don't fire your ass</i>

55
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,919
<i>is because you're
so hopelessly pathetic,</i>

56
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,654
<i>-  you amuse them.
- Shut up!</i>

57
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,732
Before we break up here,
I wanna go over

58
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,934
<i>the assignments.</i>

59
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,669
We're... we're just gonna
go around the table, okay?

60
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,238
Can your comment wait?

61
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,973
I just wanna say
that the picnic

62
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,808
<i>is gonna be a good place
to reach out</i>

63
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,210
and form relationships
with other people.

64
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,781
Duly noted, Jerry.

65
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,084
We all wanna
get out of here, so...

66
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,219
John, you'll be setting up
the barbecue grills

67
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,588
in the parking lot,
Dave's bringing drinks,

68
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,590
Sheryl's providing
decorations,

69
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,626
and Fiona's doing
the music.

70
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,027
- Any questions?
- Oh, yeah.

71
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,630
I've got an idea
while we were sitting here.

72
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,632
You know
the office corridor?

73
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,535
I thought it would be
the perfect place
for a conga line.

74
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,969
Mmm, like at a wedding?

75
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,672
Or a cruise ship.

76
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,541
It's really easy.
Anyone can conga.

77
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,809
I'll set my head on fire
before I conga.

78
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,679
Men are afraid to dance.
The male ego is too fragile.

79
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,881
I'm not afraid.
I'm a man.

80
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,182
I think it sounds
real fun.

81
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,585
Thanks, Jerry.

82
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,754
<i>Well, it's not
the coolest thing
in the world,</i>

83
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,822
but we're talking about
a party in a toilet factory,
after all.

84
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,125
Okay, it's settled.
We'll go with the conga line.

85
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,060
Moving on.
Jerry?

86
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,062
I'm setting up
the P.A. system tomorrow,

87
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,064
so if everything works out,
I'm good to go.

88
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,633
And, uh,
I thank you all.

89
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,336
And my extension
in Shipping is 5-1865.

90
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,573
<i>- No.
Dave,
go screw yourself.</i>

91
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,908
Sheryl, Dave, come on.
We're done here.

92
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,577
We'll see you all
at the picnic.

93
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,046
Anyone who wants
the leftover pizza,

94
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,248
please take it.

95
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,816
- Bye.
- Bye.

96
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,829
Hey, do you want
any of this pizza, John?

97
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,097
Cold pizza?
No, thank you.

98
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,799
Oh, free pizza.

99
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,167
What's better
than free pizza?

100
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,970
Lots of things.
Sushi, for example.

101
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,071
I don't know.
That's like raw fish, right?

102
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,806
No.

103
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:51,176
It's perfectly cooked rice
seasoned by a master chef

104
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,745
on top of which he places
specially selected slices

105
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,815
of the highest quality,
line-caught ocean fish.

106
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,651
Raw fish.
Gross.

107
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,853
You should
stick to fast food.

108
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:06,091
- Jerry?
- Hey, Fiona.

109
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,059
Hey.

110
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,862
Can your sound system
play music from an iPod?

111
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,797
I think so, yeah.

112
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,333
Cool, it's a plan.
See ya.

113
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,817
How are you doing,
Jerry?

114
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,819
Oh, uh, very well,
thank you.

115
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,154
Excellent, yeah.

116
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,689
Do tell.

117
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,025
Well, uh...

118
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,326
they like me at work.

119
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,295
<i>- You're a likeable man.
-  We're having a...</i>

120
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,797
a what do you call it...
a picnic,

121
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,299
and they asked me
to help out on it.

122
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,669
I was afraid
to say yes...

123
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,039
and then I said yes.

124
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,074
- And?
- Um...

125
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,009
and now I'm setting up
the sound system.

126
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,211
That's wonderful news.

127
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,080
You're becoming
part of something.

128
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,683
Any side effects
with the meds?

129
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,018
I don't know.

130
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,421
<i>-  Are you taking them?
- I don't know.</i>

131
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,756
You have to take them.

132
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,358
Okay.

133
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,028
<i>Any thoughts of suicide?</i>

134
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,329
No, none.

135
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,232
Do you ever hear voices?

136
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,768
Mm, voices? No.

137
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,937
I mean...

138
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,406
when someone's
talking to me.

139
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,875
<i>You hesitated
a little bit there.</i>

140
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,997
It just makes me think
of my mother.

141
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:36,748
Angels was what
she called her voices.

142
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,350
Yeah.

143
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,853
Angels were
her coping strategy.

144
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,121
The voices were real to her.

145
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,323
Angels were
a reasonable attempt

146
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,258
to craft a logical
explanation.

147
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,160
I know.
I know that.
Yeah, I know.

148
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,463
She was the best mother
that she knew how to be,
you know?

149
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,498
Right, exactly.

150
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,235
Do you have any questions
for me, Jerry?

151
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,238
Oh, yeah.
I got a big one for you.

152
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,974
- Okay.

153
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,243
There's a girl.

154
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,312
I like her.

155
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,747
Go on.

156
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,016
I don't know
how much to tell her,

157
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,319
you know,
about you and this
and my mom and stuff.

158
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,187
And?

159
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,429
I don't wanna
scare her away.

160
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,794
But I don't wanna
lie to her, either.

161
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,529
<i>I'm thinking
that if the subject
comes up, um...</i>

162
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,865
I'll just tell her.

163
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:31,069
But if it doesn't,
I'll just leave it be.

164
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,005
You answered
your own question, Jerry.

165
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,207
Why are you smiling?

166
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,876
We're gonna conga
tomorrow.

167
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:41,379
- Conga?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,914
You know,
like at a wedding.

169
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,082
It's gonna be amazing.

170
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,551
Conga?

171
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,543
Hey, buddy!

172
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,580
Oh, Bosco, what a day!
What a day!

173
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,615
I wish you
could've been there!

174
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,832
Did you fuck
the bitch?

175
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,088
I don't have
to answer that.

176
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,558
And you'll
never fuck her either,
because you disgust her.

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,027
- Shush!
- Yeah, shut up, cat.

178
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,329
<i>- She's from England,
- Jerry.</i>

179
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,131
In her eyes,
you're a ridiculous peasant.

180
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,400
Oh, oh, yeah.
Guess what.

181
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,270
I'm not a peasant,
Mr. Whiskers. Hmm?

182
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,206
I'm thinking that this
is a real good time
for a walk, Jerry.

183
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,175
I think that's
a fantastic idea.

184
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,143
You're out your league.

185
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,512
<i>She drinks tea in carriages
and fucks men</i>

186
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,984
- Not Jerry Hickfang.

187
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,253
- Go choke on a hairball.
- Cat hater.

188
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,387
Come on, Bosco.
Let's go, buddy.

189
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,422
<i>Come on.</i>

190
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,907
Okay,
I'll tone it down
a little bit.

191
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,643
You have
the greatest hair, Tom.

192
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,212
In the back.
It's awesome.

193
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,223
- Shift's over, Jer.

194
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,572
- Jerry.
- Hi.

195
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,976
Fiona.

196
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,612
You said I should come by
Accounting sometime.

197
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,514
- I did?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,617
When we were
getting ready
for the picnic.

199
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,553
No, I-I don't recall
saying that.

200
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,255
<i>Hi, Jerry.
I'm Lisa.</i>

201
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,090
Accounts Receivable.

202
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,026
Jerry.
Packing and Shipping.

203
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,329
Some of
the Accounting chicks

204
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,497
are going out
for a couple of drinks

205
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,733
if you wanna pack
and ship out with us.

206
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:52,103
Oh, yeah.
That sounds... yeah.

207
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,638
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

208
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Okay.

209
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,242
Ugh.

210
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,545
<i>So he looks me in the eye
and he says,</i>

211
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,481
"Let's move to America, Fi.
Let's get married."

212
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,051
So, after I've sold
everything and moved,

213
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,587
that's when
the knobhead decides that
he's not the marrying type.

214
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,989
Aw.

215
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,025
Yeah, six months later,
he marries Jill.

216
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:17,161
Now they've got three kids
and I'm stuck in this
stupid temp job.

217
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,764
I think it's time
to move back home.

218
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,332
I know karate.

219
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,773
Thanks for coming out,
Jerry.

220
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,775
It's cool.

221
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,513
Do you want my last
Krunchy Choo-Choo?

222
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,616
- I only had a bite.
- Yeah, sure.

223
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,187
Hey, can you give me
a ride to my car?

224
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,556
Or, just home,
you know.

225
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,195
- Sorry.
- Um...

226
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,498
You're giving a ride
to Fiona.

227
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,034
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay, Jerry.
I've got a lift.

228
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,368
- So...
- I don't mind, Fi.

229
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,610
I'd love to, uh,
give you a ride.

230
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,808
Okay.

231
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,109
So, you...

232
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,644
<i>you're... okay.</i>

233
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,480
I can just get a cab.

234
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,765
- What are you
doing this weekend?
- I was hoping on...

235
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,635
There's this cool
Chinese restaurant
that I wanted take you to.

236
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,137
<i>-  Shi Shan.
- Chinese?</i>

237
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,741
Yeah, but it's more
than just egg rolls
and fortune cookies.

238
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,277
- Do you wanna go?
- When?

239
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,279
On Friday night.
I'll pick you up after work.

240
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,747
No, it's... it's all right.
I don't need a lift.

241
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,582
Or just meet there, then?

242
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,084
The show starts at 7:00.

243
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,585
There's a show?

244
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,121
A show, yes.
More than just a show.

245
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,123
The best spectacle
in the world.

246
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,257
- You'll love it.
- Wow.

247
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,827
- Prepare to be amazed.
- Okay. Cool.

248
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,362
I'll get there early.
I'll save you a seat.

249
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,531
- All right.
- All right.

250
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,571
All right.
Thanks for the ride,
Jerry.

251
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,339
All right.
No problem, Fiona.

252
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,774
Have a good night.

253
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,529
Got a date

254
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,499
with Fiona
on Friday night
from England.

255
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,601
Well, fuck me.

256
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,469
I'm an asshole.

257
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,139
<i>I apologize, man.
You were right.</i>

258
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,274
<i>Cat food's in the kitchen, Jer,
and I can't open the can.</i>

259
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,843
<i>-  I don't have thumbs.</i>

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,628
Who's my good boy?

261
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,762
Who's my good boy?

262
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,403
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

263
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,638
- Hey...
- Alison.

264
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,906
- What's up?
- Where's Fiona?

265
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,575
She just left.
Do you have something for her?

266
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,677
Yeah, she needs
this address.

267
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,212
Shi Shan.

268
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,513
It's the restaurant
where we're gonna meet.

269
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,948
We'll make sure
she gets it.

270
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,885
- Is there anything else?
- No.

271
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,921
Make sure
she gets that, okay?
It's important.

272
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,656
- Yeah, we'll make sure.
- Okay.

273
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,764
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

274
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,299
What is this about?

275
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,768
Oh, it's this
Chinese restaurant.

276
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,303
I said I might
meet him over there.

277
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,637
Well, no.
You can't.

278
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,972
Tonight's karaoke.

279
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,473
Oh, yeah.
Karaoke.

280
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,277
Well, just call him and
tell him you can't make it.

281
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,413
No, I don't
want to upset him.

282
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,747
I'll wait until
the office closes

283
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,616
and then I'll leave
a message on voicemail.

284
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,858
You're a real sweetheart,
Fiona.

285
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,467
Whaa!

286
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,528
Hey, fish.

287
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,297
"Hi, Jerry.

288
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,466
How you doing,
man?"

289
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,968
Well, I'm a little
bit bummed.

290
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,970
"No duh.

291
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,973
She stood you up."

292
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,975
I'm sure there's a reason.

293
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,677
"I sure hope so.

294
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,480
I wish I could help you,
Jerry, but I'm just a fish."

295
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,882
Oh.

296
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,552
- Oh, Jesus.
- Have you seen Alison?

297
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,455
- No. I think she's gonna
keep going, actually.
- Oh, shit!

298
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,890
- Oh, no.
- Now my phone's fucked.

299
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,560
- Oh...
- No, that's all right.

300
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,895
I was gonna walk back
to the plant...

301
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,897
Oh, no.
I'll give you a ride.

302
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,899
- Yeah.
- Thank you!
You're the best!

303
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,601
- Okay, you ready?
- Okay.

304
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,536
- Go!

305
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,474
You okay?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,975
It's so horrible!

307
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,337
Ahh! It's like being
in England again.

308
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,493
You want me to wait?

309
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,161
- No.
- Have a good night.

310
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,500
Ugh.

311
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,982
Bloody hell!

312
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,186
Ugh.

313
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,921
Shit!

314
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:06,497
Ahh!

315
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,600
Jerry!

316
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,868
<i>Fiona?</i>

317
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,171
Jerry.

318
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:25,883
- Ohh.
- Fiona, you're soaked.

319
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,686
<i>-  Get in.
- Wow.</i>

320
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,055
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

321
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,923
What are you doing out here?

322
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,192
I was listening to music.

323
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,927
I-I went to Shi Shan.

324
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,597
<i>I didn't see you there.</i>

325
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,032
Didn't you get my message?

326
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,802
No. No.

327
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,271
- No.
- I'm so sorry, Jerry.

328
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,211
<i>Well, you, uh...</i>

329
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,248
need a hot chocolate
or something?

330
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,049
<i>I suppose I owe you,
don't I?</i>

331
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,919
Go on, then.
I'm freezing.

332
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,021
I... you're sitting
on a blanket.

333
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,757
- Oh.

334
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,000
<i>Don't stare, Jerry.</i>

335
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,902
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

336
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:21,071
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not the end
of the world, Jerry.

337
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,009
<i>Oh...</i>

338
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,979
God, I'm starving.

339
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,181
<i>Let's get something
to eat.</i>

340
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,750
I got crackers
in the glove box.

341
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,151
Oh, no.

342
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,754
We need something horrible
and greasy tonight.

343
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,556
- Do you know Doran's?
- Uh-uh.

344
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,790
You're gonna love it.

345
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,159
It's this terrible, cheap,

346
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,928
<i>all-night burger joint
out by the county line.</i>

347
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,163
- We go.
- And you wanna
go there tonight?

348
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,098
Yes and yes!

349
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,700
Full steam ahead,
Captain.

350
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,269
- And don't spare the chili.
- Yeah, all right.

351
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,149
You know, they say
a lot of things about you
up in Accounting.

352
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,851
Like what?

353
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,621
Well, that arty chick Lisa,
she thinks you're hot.

354
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:16,360
And everybody else,
we just wonder where
you're from.

355
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:20,598
Oh, my family
moved here from Berlin
when I was seven.

356
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,069
You know, a kid's gotta go
where his parents take him.

357
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,745
I don't even
have that excuse.

358
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,316
Why do you
live here, then?

359
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:42,019
Oh, God.
Well, if you
find out, call me.

360
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,088
- Hm.
- No, sorry.

361
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,623
No, that came out wrong.
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,124
You don't like Milton?

363
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,293
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
It's nice.

364
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,830
You know,
the people are friendly.
It's pretty.

365
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,367
No. High school football
and karaoke bars isn't enough.

366
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,638
I'm bored.

367
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,207
Insanely bored.

368
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,342
You like
heaven better, huh?

369
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,211
Heaven?

370
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,980
- What?
- Where you're from.

371
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,683
Heaven?

372
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:16,654
Hardly.
No, I'm from Reading.

373
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,322
Reading is a lot closer
to hell.

374
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:22,926
Oh.

375
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,995
You like trivia?

376
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,430
<i>-  Yes. Why?
- I got a good one.</i>

377
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,733
Okay,
there's tons of angels
in the Bible,

378
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,301
but only four of them
have names,

379
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,371
three of which are Michael,
Raphael, and Gabriel.

380
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,308
Who's the fourth?

381
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,144
You're not getting
all religious on me,
are you, Jerry?

382
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,312
No, I... this...
this is fun.

383
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,214
Come on, guess.
Who's the fourth?

384
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,984
I don't know.
Freddy the Angel.

385
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,986
No. Not Freddy.
You know this.

386
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,254
You know his name,
I promise you.

387
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,855
You're forgetting one thing.

388
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,794
You're forgetting
that he's an angel.

389
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,986
Jerry, kill me.
I wanna die.

390
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,823
Take your knife
and cut my throat.

391
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,825
<i>- Don't worry,
- I'll help you.</i>

392
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,026
What?

393
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,995
No, no, Jerry!

394
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,717
- No! Don't!
- I gotta do it.
I gotta do it.

395
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,501
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

396
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,343
The fourth angel is Lucifer.

397
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,480
What?

398
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:52,416
Lucifer is an angel
that, uh... a fallen angel.

399
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,988
Fio... Fiona.

400
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,323
<i>Fiona!</i>

401
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,858
<i>He asked me to do it.</i>

402
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,995
Fiona, don't run.

403
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,864
You'll get lost.

404
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,937
- Ah!
- Fiona!

405
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,777
- - Ah!

406
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,240
Oh, I don't know
how that happened.

407
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,090
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

408
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:36,894
Oh...

409
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,533
- You... you're in pain?

410
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,802
You're suffering?

411
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,842
- I love you.

412
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,138
I'm so sorry.

413
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,241
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,143
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,111
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,301
- Hi, Jer.
- Not now, buddy.

417
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,703
What the hell
you been doing?

418
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,335
It's okay, Bosco.

419
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,504
Pretty bad situation, buddy.

420
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:03,573
I know.

421
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,076
Maybe the best thing
to do is just, um,

422
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,577
go to the cops
and explain everything.

423
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,647
- Just tell them
what happened?
- Mmm, yeah.

424
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,352
I think you're right.

425
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,688
Be good to get it
off my chest.

426
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,223
If I wait, it'll be
a million times worse.

427
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,558
Thanks, Bosco.

428
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,628
You are both
so fucking naive.

429
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,030
<i>You go to the cops
and you say,</i>

430
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,433
<i>"Hey, man,
I accidentally stabbed
that English chick.</i>

431
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,101
Oh, oh, oh."

432
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,602
You think
they'll all nod
and understand

433
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,338
<i>the way your
stupid dog does?</i>

434
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,573
<i>- I don't know.
- Well, I do know.</i>

435
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:41,211
where tattooed meth addicts
will buttfuck you daily

436
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,746
<i>for 15 years to life.</i>

437
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,581
<i>You're a good man
who made a mistake.</i>

438
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,750
Nobody is gonna
rape you, Jerry.

439
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,752
<i>But he did mean to do it.</i>

440
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,154
- No.
- Not the deer.

441
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,457
That was an accident.
I'm talking about the girl.

442
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,325
<i>-  You wanted to kill her.
- Never.</i>

443
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,094
Why'd you take
the knife, then?

444
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:00,630
Oh, my God.

445
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,632
- I'm evil.
- No, you're not.

446
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,301
I've killed things
on purpose, Jerry.

447
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,303
There's no shame in it.
It's instinct.

448
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,639
<i>The only time
I felt truly alive
is when I'm killing.</i>

449
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,577
The only time
I've ever felt
truly alive.

450
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,746
<i>You see what I mean?</i>

451
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:18,615
But you have to do something
about the body, Jer.

452
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,584
What about the body?

453
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,220
Well, some hiker
stumbles across it,

454
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,255
and pretty soon
it's "CSI: Milton."

455
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,758
<i>And guess
whose hair and fiber</i>

456
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,793
<i>and spit and blood
are everywhere.</i>

457
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,294
Yours, Jerry.

458
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,764
Go get rid
of the fucking body,
dipshit.

459
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,098
I don't know.

460
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,135
I don't know.

461
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,405
<i>I don't know.</i>

462
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,259
<i>- Hey, Jerry.
- How you doing?</i>

463
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,761
Oh, hey, Sheriff Weinbacher.
I'm good, really good.

464
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,564
Well, what happened here?

465
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,402
A deer jumped in the window.

466
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,605
It was horrible.

467
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,241
<i>-  But you're okay?
- Uh... um, yeah.</i>

468
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,710
What did you do with the deer?
That's probably good meat.

469
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,912
Oh.

470
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,847
Uh, I ju... I left it
on the side of the road.

471
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,449
But I shouldn't have
done that.

472
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,884
I screwed up.
I'm really sorry
about that.

473
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:35,585
No, it was an accident.

474
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,255
I'm not gonna write you up
for hunting out of season.

475
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:41,224
Thank you.

476
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,659
Thank you,
Sheriff Weinbacher.
I appreciate it.

477
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,495
No problem, Jerry.
You get that window fixed, okay?

478
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,631
- - Yeah, I'll do it
right this afternoon.

479
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,366
Cool.
Drive safely, Jerry.

480
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,734
You, too.

481
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,803
Hello?

482
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,840
Oh, crap.

483
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:59,876
That's... that's right now,
isn't it?

484
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,711
Okay.

485
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,248
Yeah, no, I'm on my way.

486
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,650
On my way.

487
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:18,195
Headaches?

488
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:20,697
<i>- Trouble sleeping?
- No.</i>

489
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,635
- Suicidal impulses?
- Uh-uh.

490
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,939
Do you hear voices?

491
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,841
I hear your voice now.

492
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,777
<i>Disembodied voices.</i>

493
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,746
<i>Voices that seem to be
coming from somewhere else.</i>

494
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,215
Not really.

495
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,690
Jerry...

496
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,825
do you find yourself
crying a lot lately?

497
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,327
Uh-uh.

498
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,329
No.

499
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,764
<i>-  No?
- Mm-mm.</i>

500
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,569
Are you still taking
the medication?

501
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,271
Usually.

502
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,375
You have to take it
every day without fail.

503
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,943
I know.
I know, but...

504
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,778
But what?

505
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,752
The medication,
it smooths things out,
and that's okay, right?

506
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,690
But even though
there were bad moments...

507
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,260
<i>-  Very bad moments?
- Very bad.</i>

508
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,864
There are also moments
of inspiration and beauty,

509
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,634
when all the world
makes sense

510
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:33,303
and the elegant
secret mechanics
of Man and God

511
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,305
are revealed
in their many dimensions,

512
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,407
and the universe
is laid out before mine eyes

513
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,942
and it is a blessed place.

514
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,912
You totally stopped taking
the pills, didn't you?

515
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,614
Totally.

516
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,484
Thanks for your honesty,
Jerry.

517
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,953
Our relationship depends
on the cooperation

518
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,988
of the Department
of Corrections.

519
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,925
If you become noncompliant,
I have to report that.

520
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,629
- They'll put me away?
- Let's not find out.

521
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,665
Let's make you compliant.

522
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,534
- Take the pills.
- Okay. Okay.

523
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,869
Let's not find out.

524
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,536
Ow.

525
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:49,566
<i>Aw, what's the matter, buddy?</i>

526
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,201
I really liked her.

527
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:52,669
<i>I know you did, buddy.</i>

528
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,838
She's a good kid.

529
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,006
I bet you miss her a lot.

530
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,175
Yeah.

531
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,010
I love you guys.

532
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,062
<i>Don't take those pills,
Jerry,</i>

533
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,731
<i>unless you wanna say good-bye
to your old friends.</i>

534
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,032
I'm not sure
it's a good idea

535
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,868
to be talking
to your cat, anyway.

536
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,569
Yup.

537
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,972
- Or dog, either.

538
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:32,876
<i>Take those drugs
and you will enter</i>

539
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,238
a bleak and lonely
world, Jerry.

540
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,220
<i>Jerry.</i>

541
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,022
<i>Jerry.</i>

542
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,058
Hi, Fiona.

543
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,860
Look what you did to me.

544
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,929
I'm so sorry.

545
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,766
Friday I had
a pretty cushy gig.

546
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,036
I had lots of friends.
I was the office hottie.

547
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,639
Now I'm a severed head
in a fridge.

548
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,674
Sucks to be me,
Jerry.

549
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,210
What can I do about it now?

550
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,612
<i>Take the meds,
you useless wanker.</i>

551
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,681
Take them.

552
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,982
Take them!

553
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,396
See?
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

554
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,246
<i>Mama?</i>

555
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,351
<i>- Mama?
- Jerry!</i>

556
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:52,055
<i>- Mama?
-  Where are you?</i>

557
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,990
Jerry.

558
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,925
<i>- - Pass him over.</i>

559
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:59,228
<i>Go.
Pass him over.
I got him.</i>

560
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,931
- I love you, Jerry.
- Bunny Monkey is my friend.

561
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:06,002
Bunny Monkey
is not real!

562
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,241
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

563
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,246
Gotta learn reality
from fantasy, Jerry.

564
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,082
You've got to.

565
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,617
It's a sock!

566
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,052
- Be brave, Jerry.
- I love you, Bunny Monkey.

567
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,355
- It's a...
- Don't listen to Mack.

568
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:28,224
- ...a fucking...
- Stay with me
in my world, Jerry.

569
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,393
...sock!

570
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,894
- Just a sock!

571
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,197
<i>A fucking sock.</i>

572
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,439
<i>I wish you
were never born!</i>

573
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,763
<i>You and your mother,
you're fucking psychos.</i>

574
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,892
No.

575
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,227
Bosco?
Hey.

576
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,937
<i>-  Mr. Whiskers?</i>

577
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,142
Say something.

578
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,304
Come on, say something.
Tell me to go F myself.

579
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,484
Don't leave me alone.
Come on.

580
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,985
- Tally ho, Jerry.
- Fiona, you're back!

581
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,254
Quite.
And jolly well high time.

582
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,956
Bloody blooming right
it's jolly well high time.

583
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,026
- You look smashing.
- Those bleeding pills
are rubbish.

584
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:19,495
I super-hate those pills.

585
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:22,131
I only took them
because you told me to.

586
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:27,069
Tsk.
Beastly drugs.

587
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,238
They made me look like
a sodding Jack-o-lantern.

588
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
You know what.

589
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,477
And you're stinky, too.

590
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,012
But now you smell like...

591
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:38,347
You smell
like baby shampoo.

592
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,317
- You're beautiful.
- Thanks, Jerry.

593
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,352
What a fab cracking day
to come back.

594
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,221
Perfect day.

595
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:48,257
And I'm eating
Honey Nut Crunchys
with 2% milk.

596
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,559
Hip hip, hooray!

597
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,165
How's the cereal,
chummy chum?

598
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,200
Mmm, delicious.

599
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:59,068
Scrummy.

600
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,570
God save the queen.

601
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:02,138
<i>-  Hey, Jerry.
- Mm-hmm?</i>

602
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,439
Jerry.

603
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,441
Can you get me a friend?

604
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,876
A friend?

605
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,245
I get so lonely
in the fridge.

606
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,615
Mmm.

607
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,452
Like, kill someone on purpose?

608
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:19,455
By George,
that's it.

609
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,490
Kill someone.

610
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,861
What about Lisa
from Accounting?

611
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:27,163
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

612
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,298
Please, Jerry?

613
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,301
Don't be such
a Nancy Boy about it.

614
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:33,369
Please?

615
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,907
I don't know.

616
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,243
- I love you, Jerry.
- I love you, too, Fiona.

617
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,365
I love you so much.

618
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,918
<i>Want some of my Crunchys?</i>

619
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,887
All right, then,
Governor.

620
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,058
Mm. Mm-mm.

621
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,426
- Ow!

622
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,040
Hey, Jerry.

623
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,541
Hey, Mr. Kowalski.

624
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:48,377
I saw you on Friday.

625
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:49,545
You saw me?

626
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:51,681
Yeah, I saw you.
You didn't see me?

627
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,382
No, I didn't
see you at all.

628
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:54,717
You were at Shi Shan.

629
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,519
I saw you in the window
eating beef chow mein.

630
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:58,554
Oh! At the restaurant.

631
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,056
Yeah, it's my favorite.

632
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:01,557
Shi Shan.

633
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,125
Thank you for seeing me.

634
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,295
I-I didn't do it on purpose.

635
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:09,598
No, I mean,
I'm just thankful for...
for seeing each other.

636
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,634
You okay, Jerry?

637
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,970
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

638
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,471
If you say so.

639
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,073
- See you, Jerry.
- Okay.

640
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:20,576
Oh, one more thing.
Have you seen Fiona?

641
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:22,111
Fiona?

642
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:25,047
English Fiona
from the party.

643
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,615
Mm-mm. No.
What's up?

644
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,117
It's the end
of the quarter.

645
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,585
We're trying
to close out the books

646
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,454
and she's not
answering her phone.

647
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:34,590
Plus, her car is still
in the factory parking lot.

648
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,693
That's sad.

649
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:40,096
She was nice.

650
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,530
Maybe she went back
to her own country.

651
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,666
She wouldn't need
her car anymore.

652
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:46,002
I'm gonna miss her a lot.

653
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,110
Jerry.

654
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,515
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

655
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,319
<i>Oh, that's very good.</i>

656
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,526
<i>Oh, that's even better.</i>

657
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:21,737
Oh, Jerry, change
the fucking channel
before I explode.

658
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,807
<i>Oh, that's more like it.</i>

659
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:27,376
Oh, I feel
so much better.

660
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,645
<i>- Jerry is back.
- Yeah!</i>

661
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:33,049
<i>Fuck those pills.
That headshrinker doesn't
care if you're happy.</i>

662
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:34,383
<i>She just wants you
to be obedient.</i>

663
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,218
She's not a bad person.

664
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,220
Not if you want to be
a slave to drugs.

665
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,355
Just say "no."
I do.

666
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,257
<i>Check it out.</i>

667
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:43,392
<i>A crocodile killed
a motherfucking antelope.</i>

668
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:44,527
It's a gnu.

669
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,829
Oh, yes, of course.

670
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,098
Are you gonna
kill someone else?

671
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,634
Me? No.
Of course not.

672
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:54,703
Sick, disturbed cat.

673
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,238
<i>Why not, Jer?</i>

674
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,107
<i>- We both know
you want to.
- No.</i>

675
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,842
<i>You killed by accident.
That felt good.</i>

676
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:02,078
<i>Now do it on purpose,
Jerry.</i>

677
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,312
<i>Just once.</i>

678
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:04,814
<i>-  See what it's like.
- Shut up.</i>

679
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:07,516
I don't have to listen to you.
You're just a cat.

680
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,785
Well, a cat that can
talk and reason.

681
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,487
That's a miracle
for the ages.

682
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,322
So what?

683
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,424
<i>But a guy who
talks to his cat...</i>

684
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:17,827
<i>well, that's one step away
from the loony bin.</i>

685
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:19,462
<i>Find someone else,
kill them,</i>

686
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:21,730
and you'll discover
what it feels like

687
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,800
to be truly alive.

688
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,470
- By killing?
- It's better than sex.

689
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:30,172
He is wrong.

690
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:32,808
We're not like
the pussy, Jerry.
We have morals.

691
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,311
- That's a good boy.
- Did you hear that?

692
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:37,313
I earned the right
to be called a good boy.

693
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:39,882
You earned the right
to be hit by a mini-van.

694
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:52,795
Knock, knock.

695
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:55,264
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

696
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,766
What's up, big guy?

697
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,169
I was over here.

698
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:02,651
Just thought I'd see
what you're up to.

699
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:08,377
I'm trying to figure out
how to get out of here early.

700
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,712
Early?

701
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,414
Shoot, man.
It's past 5:00 now.

702
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,682
Oh.

703
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,155
- Do you wanna get a drink?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

704
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:21,891
You wanna go
to TGI Fridays?

705
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:23,759
Fridays kind of sucks
on Tuesdays.

706
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:24,793
We could go
to David's, though.

707
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,928
It's cool.
You'll really like it.

708
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,297
- Good. Yeah.
- Okay.

709
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:31,734
You wanna... now?

710
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,470
- Yeah, now.
- Yeah.

711
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,238
Yeah.
If you're ready, I'll...

712
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:48,918
The divorce was final
in September or something.

713
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,920
I mean, it went,
like, really quickly

714
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:54,190
because I basically
agreed to everything.

715
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:57,226
You know, he got the house
and the car and I got the cat.

716
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:58,394
What kind of cat?

717
00:49:58,396 --> 00:50:01,230
Um, I don't know.

718
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,765
Like a black and white.

719
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,800
It's a rescue.
It's cute.

720
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,369
Are you good with cats?

721
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,971
No, the real question
is are cats good with me?

722
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:11,740
Because
they pretty much own us,
not the other way around.

723
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,742
Oh, my God, yeah.

724
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,578
<i>- Right?
-  You've got that right.</i>

725
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,714
Yeah, I mean,
if I don't give my cat
everything he wants,

726
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:19,882
it's just like,
watch out.

727
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:22,318
Yeah, yeah. Me, too!
Me, too. Me, too.

728
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,788
Yeah, I tried switching
to dry cat food.

729
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,324
He was not having it.
He tore up my couch.

730
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:29,825
<i>-  No.
- I know.</i>

731
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,360
- Serves me right, though.
- They're very demanding, huh?

732
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,895
Yeah.

733
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:35,231
- What's your cat's name?
- Mr. Whiskers.

734
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,499
And he is a son of a bitch.

735
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,468
- How about you?
- Pig Head.

736
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,936
- 'Cause...

737
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:43,672
...that's what he is...
a pig head.

738
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:45,407
- Oh.
- Pig Head.

739
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,943
- He's so cute, though.
Do you wanna meet him?
- Yeah.

740
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:50,879
He's probably tearing up
my apartment right now.

741
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,881
Oh, now?

742
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,417
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

743
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,586
O-okay.

744
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,788
Uh, yeah, okay,
if you're okay to drive.

745
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,423
I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom.

746
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,425
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

747
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,791
I'm not, um,

748
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,327
in the habit of...

749
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,963
going home with somebody
after one date, you know.

750
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,831
I... but...

751
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,868
um, sometimes you just
gotta say, "what the hell,"
I guess.

752
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:50,406
Yeah, you just gotta
cut loose.

753
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,708
Oh, actually, I'm...
I'm that way, actually.

754
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,576
Can we go...
can we go somewhere else?

755
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,679
Where?
- It's a surprise.

756
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:23,706
Where are we?

757
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,148
This is where
I grew up.

758
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:28,811
It's beautiful.

759
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,346
You think so?

760
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:33,382
Yeah, this is so romantic.
What did you guys grow?

761
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,851
Hah. Nothing.

762
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,553
My stepdad had big plans,

763
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:41,390
but he was gone
all the time with the Army.

764
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:45,561
- And my mom...
well, she pretty much...
- What was she like?

765
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:46,595
Uh, German.

766
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:51,900
Beautiful...

767
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,602
but mostly sad.

768
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,107
Why was she sad?

769
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:00,776
He made her choose
between leaving him

770
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:03,112
and leaving Berlin.

771
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:05,954
She spent
the rest of her life
homesick.

772
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,884
You okay?

773
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,388
Huh.

774
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,889
That was
my favorite window.

775
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,851
I spent
a lot of time there.

776
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,027
You didn't have
any friends?

777
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,763
No, not really.

778
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,464
They called...
the kids called me

779
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:24,099
"Gesundheit"
and "Fahrvergnügen"

780
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:27,436
and the "The Ultimate
Crying Machine."

781
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:30,406
- Kids are cruel.
- I know.

782
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,109
I used to...
I used to sit there

783
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:37,679
and I would
look up at the...
at the night sky

784
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,949
and I'd make believe that
the stars were my friends.

785
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,086
That's stupid, huh?

786
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:46,488
- No, it's sweet.
- Oh.

787
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,594
They're coming for me,
Jerry.

788
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,097
I'll...
I'll stop them.

789
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,833
It's too late.

790
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:33,168
They already know.
I told them.

791
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,103
What...
what did you tell them?

792
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,175
I told them
that sometimes I can hear

793
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:42,945
the secret conversations
of the world.

794
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,247
Things no one else hears.

795
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,650
The animals...

796
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,154
the angels talking to me.

797
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:55,057
Sometimes I hear them,
too, Mom.

798
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,560
I know you do, Jerry.

799
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,533
Never tell anyone.

800
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:07,135
I told them
and they won't let me alone.

801
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,971
Promise me you'll never tell.

802
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,173
- Promise.
- I-I promise.

803
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,708
<i>Never.</i>

804
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,743
They don't understand.

805
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,879
<i>They can't understand.</i>

806
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,752
What's that sound?

807
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:30,592
It's the hospital people...

808
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,554
and they have the sheriff
with them.

809
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,232
- I can't go back.
I can't go back.

810
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:40,302
I can't go back.
I can't go back.

811
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,640
I can't go back.

812
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,959
Finish it.

813
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,594
Finish it.

814
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,262
Finish it, please.

815
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,567
Jerry, finish it,
please.

816
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,269
Please.

817
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,007
Please, Jerry...

818
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,609
finish it, please.

819
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,587
Jerry.

820
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,591
What is it?

821
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,764
My... my mom... my mom died
up in that room.

822
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,007
- Sorry... I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

823
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,141
Hey.

824
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,212
It's okay.

825
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:07,889
It's just...
I'm s... sad.

826
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,648
Take me home...

827
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:33,208
Hey.

828
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,710
Thanks.

829
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:40,882
That was
a wonderful night, Jerry.

830
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,818
I think so, too.

831
00:58:45,354 --> 00:58:47,889
I'm really glad
you asked me out.

832
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,358
- Me, too.

833
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,927
You're so mysterious,
you know.

834
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:56,064
The first time
you came up to Accounting

835
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:58,266
I could tell
there was something
deep about you.

836
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:01,169
Hmm.

837
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:06,074
You seem
a million miles away.

838
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,243
What's on your mind?

839
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:11,445
This night
turned out differently
than I was expecting.

840
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,852
- Different good?
- Definitely.

841
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:21,857
- I don't feel alone.
- Me, neither.

842
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,494
We have to get going.

843
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,164
Work. Oh.

844
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,432
- Yeah. I know.
- Oh.

845
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:32,367
It seems like the last thing
I wanna think about.

846
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:34,402
I know.
I gotta go home
and feed my cat and dog.

847
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,071
They're gonna be
furious with me.

848
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,472
- Do you want me
to give you a ride?
- No, it's okay.

849
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,307
- I'll walk.
- Yeah?

850
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:40,909
Yeah. Come up
to Accounting later.

851
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,410
Just pretend you're
delivering something.

852
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,979
We can make out
in the copy room.

853
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:45,981
- I'll try.
- Okay.

854
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,916
- Bye.
- Bye.

855
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,052
<i>-  Bye.
- Bye.</i>

856
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,009
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

857
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,044
- I want to smell
her crotch, Jer.
- Come, here. Hey, sit.

858
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:19,381
Where the fuck's my food,
fuck face?

859
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,917
Aw, I had the best night
of my whole life.

860
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,118
Mwah!

861
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,086
<i>Who's a good boy?</i>

862
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,389
Yeah.
Oh. Oh.

863
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:31,259
Food.

864
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,894
Hey, Mr. Whiskers.

865
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,197
<i>Food. Now.</i>

866
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,401
I left you a little gift
on the sofa.

867
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:42,070
<i>A reminder why you can't
leave us alone without food.</i>

868
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,085
Jerry.

869
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:58,420
Hey.

870
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:00,455
Get me a friend!

871
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:04,359
<i>- What am I supposed to do?
-  I do not know.</i>

872
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:08,196
<i>-  Pretend everything's fine.
- Really?</i>

873
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:10,398
<i>Well, it got you this far,
didn't it?</i>

874
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,200
I guess so.

875
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,359
- Hey, Jerry?
- What?

876
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,427
They need you
up in Accounting.

877
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,528
Some problem
with payroll
or something.

878
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,364
Okay.

879
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:48,970
I found some irregularities
in your records.

880
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,272
We need to do an audit.

881
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:51,907
- What?
- Come on.

882
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,411
- Close the door.
- Close the door.

883
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,914
Come here.

884
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,483
Oh.

885
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,922
Oh.

886
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:09,057
Oh, thanks, Jerry.
Jerry was just, uh...

887
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,227
he just faxed...
uh, fixed the copier.

888
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,428
I can make a copy later.

889
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,964
I gotta...
I'm gonna go.

890
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,265
Okay.

891
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,441
- Lisa, you dog.
- Woof, woof.

892
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:28,209
Hey, are you
still doing payroll?

893
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:31,212
Yeah, I'm a payroll lifer.
Why?

894
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,514
Can you give me
Jerry's address?

895
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,582
I wanna bring him
a gift or something.

896
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,084
Like a whoopie cake.
It's nothing.

897
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,954
Or you could just ask him.

898
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:41,423
I want it to be a surprise.

899
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:42,691
Please?

900
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:49,698
That's a lot
of cheese sandwiches
to eat in one sitting. 41?

901
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,334
<i>And that tiny Sonya Thomas
always wins.</i>

902
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,002
<i>And now a grimmer story.</i>

903
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:55,537
A woman murdered...

904
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:58,340
<i>her partial remains
dumped in the woods.</i>

905
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:00,342
- So sad.
- So terrible.

906
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:01,743
Reporter Sheila Hammer

907
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:04,079
<i>has an Action One News
exclusive.</i>

908
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,548
The grisly discovery Tuesday
near Milton

909
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,417
of an unidentified
female stabbing victim

910
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,720
has local police on the hunt
for a serial killer.

911
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,321
Jerry,
you're a serial killer.

912
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:14,622
- Sheriff Weinbacher.
- No, he isn't.

913
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,658
- Shh!
- Now, with the aid
of the FBI

914
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,661
we have developed a profile
of the unknown killer.

915
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:22,630
Male, late 20s
or early 30s,

916
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,432
white,
lower-middle class.

917
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,501
<i>-  Trouble fitting in.
- That's you, Jerry.</i>

918
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:28,303
<i>- Can I have an autograph?
- Shh!</i>

919
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:31,172
Will he kill again?

920
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,675
Well,
if he's not stopped soon,
every indication is...

921
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:36,177
<i>he will kill again.</i>

922
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,046
You hear that, punk?

923
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:39,180
No, no, no.
No, no.

924
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:40,715
- You're a killer.
- Oh, my God.

925
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:42,550
- A serial killer!
- I don't wanna be a killer.

926
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:46,054
Too late, shitbag!
There's no turning back.

927
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:48,790
You're a stone-cold
murdering maniac!

928
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,363
<i>Told you so.
- Told me so what?</i>

929
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,399
Well, I told you
you like killing.

930
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:59,801
And now the cops,
they say the same thing.

931
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:01,603
<i>Jerry.</i>

932
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,774
<i>Jerry.</i>

933
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,312
<i>Jerry.</i>

934
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,215
What are they saying
about you, love?

935
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,052
- That I'm a killer.
- Take me out.

936
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:19,487
Let's talk about it.

937
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:22,157
What if I am?

938
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,392
- Serial killer?
- Yeah.

939
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,494
Well, is it something
that you are...

940
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,563
like being brown-eyed
or right-handed...

941
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:31,599
or is it something
that you choose,

942
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,134
<i>like being an accountant?</i>

943
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,469
I wish I knew.

944
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:36,137
You can still make
the choice, Jerry.

945
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:37,672
You're still a good man.

946
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:41,276
Well, I try to be a good man.
I wanna be a good man.

947
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,645
- Then there's the cat.
- Fuck you, blaming it on me.

948
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:45,480
Hold... hold...
hold on a second.

949
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:48,550
Look, I know
what is good.
I know.

950
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:50,652
I-I wanna lead
a righteous and just life.

951
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:52,587
I wanna be
an upstanding member
of the community.

952
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:56,091
But, I mean,
you know, Mr. Whiskers,
he makes me do bad things.

953
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:58,660
The cat was nowhere near
when you killed me, Jerry.

954
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:01,329
See? See?
Thank you, lady-head.

955
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,264
Okay, first of all,
not true.

956
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,367
Second of all, I know
right from wrong, okay?

957
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:09,737
I know it.
I try to be good.

958
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,539
But then certain...

959
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:18,113
horrible things happen
and I'm filled with...

960
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:21,316
with terror and dread,
standing outside of myself.

961
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:24,586
<i>Even though I know
what I've done,</i>

962
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:28,590
I also feel like...
like it wasn't me.

963
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,427
Pretty complicated
inside the human mind, huh?

964
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:35,130
It was you
that killed me, Jerry.

965
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:36,731
- You.
- Okay, that's true,

966
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:39,667
but in a certain sense,
it wasn't me.

967
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,903
It was, uh...

968
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:44,706
- You gonna say it was me?
- No, I wasn't gonna say that.

969
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,274
<i>- Oh, oh, all right.
- Devil's ad-vo-cat.</i>

970
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,775
Let's say it was me...

971
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,211
but, you know that
I'm a talking cat.

972
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:51,546
There's no such thing.

973
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,749
Everything I say
is really you.

974
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,551
It's true, buddy.
It's all you.

975
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,453
<i>- What?
- Come on, Jer.</i>

976
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,554
You know that.

977
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:02,590
Your pets are spot-on,
Jerry.

978
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:06,361
I kind of suspected that.

979
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,465
But if there's me,

980
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,800
the regular me,
standing here,

981
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,802
the me who's talking now,

982
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,238
and... and...

983
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,540
and I wanna be good...

984
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:20,875
then there's you,
you, and you

985
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:23,077
trying to make me be
something else.

986
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,214
Am I good?

987
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:28,349
No. You're bad.

988
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,951
She's wrong.
You're a good boy.

989
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:32,620
They're both wrong.
You are what you are.

990
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:35,456
That's it.

991
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,625
I am...

992
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:42,664
<i>Someone's here!
Intruder! Intruder!
- Bosco, Bosco.</i>

993
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,366
I got your back, Jerry.
I got your back, Jerry.

994
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:46,968
- I got your back Jerry.
- Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay.

995
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:49,804
Just a second.
Just trying to put my dog away.

996
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:51,706
Hey, Jerry,
is that my new friend?

997
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,644
Oh, Jerry, I just need
a whiff of her butt.

998
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,479
- Jerry.
- Shh.

999
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,381
Oh, Jerry!

1000
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,653
<i>- Hey, Lisa.
-  Hi, Jerry.</i>

1001
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,525
Um, surprise.
Sorry.

1002
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,360
No, I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm so glad that you came.

1003
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,995
No, no.
I'm imposing.
I can tell.

1004
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:15,897
- Oh. You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1005
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:18,533
Um, I brought you
some cakes.

1006
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:23,271
You're amazing.
Thank you for this.

1007
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:24,706
There's four of them.

1008
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,309
Sorry, if...
do you have company?

1009
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:30,278
Or am I interrupting?

1010
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,946
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1011
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:35,316
Yeah... I... it's just that
what you heard is, um...

1012
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,418
that I... sometimes
I talk to my pets.

1013
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:39,887
- A lot of the time.
- No, me, too.

1014
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,422
All the time.

1015
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,759
And they sometimes
talk to me sometimes.

1016
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,794
- I get that.
- Yeah?

1017
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,430
- Thank you for the cake.
- Are you locked out?

1018
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,032
Uh, it's okay.

1019
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:53,935
I'll figure out
how to get in somehow.

1020
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:57,305
You don't need
to stay around.

1021
01:07:57,307 --> 01:08:00,608
And how are you gonna get in?

1022
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,644
There's a skylight.

1023
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:04,812
I can totally get in
through the skylight.

1024
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,581
Really?

1025
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,550
You know, I...
I'm pretty good
at getting in places.

1026
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:11,319
I lose my keys
all the time, so...

1027
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,354
I'm gonna use the skylight.

1028
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:16,057
Oh.

1029
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,672
Jerry?
You okay?

1030
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:33,308
<i>Um, fine!
How are you?</i>

1031
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,976
Fine.

1032
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:38,346
Jerry, I'm... um...

1033
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,714
Jerry, I'm gonna
just... okay.

1034
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,082
<i>Okay.
Bye, Lisa!</i>

1035
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:42,750
<i>Thanks for stopping by.</i>

1036
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,075
Jerry, I got it open.

1037
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,965
Ooh! Hey.

1038
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,600
Hey, buddy.

1039
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,102
- Oh.

1040
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,371
Hey, Jerry?
Jerry!

1041
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:05,573
Uh... come on.
Come on.

1042
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:06,874
No, no, no.
I don't wanna play.

1043
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,043
- Come on.

1044
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,845
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1045
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:12,680
Okay, good boy.
Good boy.

1046
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,948
Lisa.

1047
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,950
I-I told you I was gonna
go through the skylight.

1048
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,485
Jerry, I'm sorry.

1049
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:26,487
- Why... why would you...
- I apologize.

1050
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,489
...go through
the door like that?

1051
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,824
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

1052
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:31,793
- I'm just gonna go home.
- No, no, no, no.

1053
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:34,429
Please, please.
Please, please stay.
It's okay, it's okay.

1054
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:38,032
She... she's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1055
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:39,567
She's the best.

1056
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,035
Jerry,
who are you talking to?

1057
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:42,737
No, no.

1058
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,206
Wait, wait.

1059
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:48,176
No!
No! No! No!

1060
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:49,710
- Jerry, I'm just gonna go.
- No, I'm not gonna...

1061
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,746
I'm not gonna hurt her.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1062
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:53,047
I'm not...
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1063
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:54,549
It's fine.
It's fine.

1064
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:56,451
It's...

1065
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,686
- They're really
gonna hate me.
- No...

1066
01:10:58,688 --> 01:11:01,608
No, no, Lisa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1067
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,758
Lisa. Hey.

1068
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,761
- Lisa, plea... please.

1069
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,831
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1070
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,132
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?</i>

1071
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,870
Please, open the door.

1072
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,807
- No!

1073
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:22,710
<i>No!
Lisa, come on!</i>

1074
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,712
She won't...

1075
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,820
Ow!

1076
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:36,123
- Lisa.

1077
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:42,930
Ow.

1078
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,774
Lisa?

1079
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:03,911
I'm... I'm gonna
come in now, okay?

1080
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,100
I am so, so sorry.

1081
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,969
Jerry,
I won't tell anyone.

1082
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:24,639
I... I wish
that you didn't
have to see that.

1083
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:26,140
I just wish
that we could go back

1084
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:27,942
<i>to the beginning,
you know?</i>

1085
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,545
We can.

1086
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:31,846
We can.

1087
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,150
I'm really sorry.

1088
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:37,685
No, I'm sorry.

1089
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,254
I'm sorry
I got scared earlier.

1090
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:41,923
I know.
That was scary.

1091
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:43,624
I didn't...

1092
01:12:43,626 --> 01:12:44,759
I didn't mean to...
to scare you.

1093
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:46,727
It's okay.

1094
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,336
I'm fine now.

1095
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:57,838
I know, I know.
I know.

1096
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,808
You hit me so hard.

1097
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,311
No, it's okay.

1098
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,693
Oh, are you okay?

1099
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,330
Oh, God, I don't know
how that happened.

1100
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,701
- I'm so sorry.
- Jerry...

1101
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,005
I-I wanna go home.

1102
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,177
Jerry.

1103
01:13:43,885 --> 01:13:45,987
<i>It's okay.
It's okay.</i>

1104
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:47,888
<i>I know you're suffering.</i>

1105
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,857
<i>I'm gonna help you.</i>

1106
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,094
Shite.

1107
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:30,097
You did what you
had to do, Jerry.

1108
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,767
Figure it out
in the morning.

1109
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:34,035
Meow.

1110
01:14:35,937 --> 01:14:38,172
Oh, it's okay, buddy.

1111
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:39,707
Everything's...

1112
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:43,711
Everything's gonna be okay.

1113
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:45,046
You're a good boy.

1114
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:46,914
Woof.

1115
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,182
Woof.

1116
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,055
<i>What?</i>

1117
01:14:55,223 --> 01:14:58,225
You want a piece, huh?

1118
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:00,394
Wha... huh?

1119
01:15:00,396 --> 01:15:01,962
What?
Want some of this?

1120
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:03,431
Hah!

1121
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,207
What?

1122
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:25,119
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,

1123
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,454
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

1124
01:15:26,456 --> 01:15:27,988
on earth as it is in heaven.

1125
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,890
Make Jerry and Mr. Whiskers
and Bosco good boys.

1126
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:32,426
<i>Amen.</i>

1127
01:15:32,428 --> 01:15:35,796
<i>Hey, Lisa, sweetie,</i>

1128
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:38,432
maybe give me a call
or a text when you get this?

1129
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:39,967
Hope you're okay.

1130
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,936
I can't reach her,
either.

1131
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:44,805
Are you guys watching
the video of the baby
peeing on the senator?

1132
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:48,309
No email,
no Facebook updates.

1133
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:51,212
She was going out
with that Jerry guy
from Packing and Shipping.

1134
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:54,315
- I can't reach him, either.
- Jerry the pizza guy?

1135
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:56,917
- God he's weird.
- You've heard the rumors,
right?

1136
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,152
No.

1137
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:00,474
Go to the "Tri State
Herald" website.

1138
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:06,260
July 9th, 1997.
Front page.

1139
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,436
Oh.

1140
01:16:57,445 --> 01:17:00,581
<i>Intruder! Intruder!</i>

1141
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,116
<i>I'll take the bullet
for you, Jerry.</i>

1142
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,984
<i>I'll take
the bullet for you, Jerry.</i>

1143
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,920
<i>- Oh, oh!
- Don't pee yourself.</i>

1144
01:17:05,922 --> 01:17:08,389
It's not the dog catcher,
unfortunately.

1145
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:11,358
Shh.
What do we do?

1146
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,994
Oh, Jerry.
I got an idea.

1147
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,205
Hi, Jerry.

1148
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:25,306
Hi, Alison.

1149
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,323
- Hey, Jerry?
- Yeah?

1150
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,625
<i>You remember last week
when, uh... when you...</i>

1151
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:46,427
when you said
there was an invisible line

1152
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:47,862
that separates
good from evil,

1153
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:49,530
and you thought
you'd crossed it.

1154
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:51,498
<i>And I said,
"No, no, no, no.
You're a good boy"?</i>

1155
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,533
Yeah, I remember.
So what?

1156
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:54,235
I've changed my opinion.

1157
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,472
So you think
I'm evil, Bosco?

1158
01:17:58,474 --> 01:17:59,940
I'm certain of it.

1159
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:06,146
Welcome to my world,
Jerry.

1160
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,282
I don't wanna be
a part of your world.

1161
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,150
<i>You're already there.</i>

1162
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:11,952
<i>Become what
you're meant to become.</i>

1163
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,022
Fiona?

1164
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:16,924
What do you think
I should do?

1165
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,362
Well, you can't
go back to work.

1166
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,631
Can't stay here, either.

1167
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:25,466
I think it's time
to see if the cat

1168
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:28,002
knows what
he's talking about.

1169
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:30,271
- She's right.
- I totally agree.

1170
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:32,473
Well, meow to that.

1171
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:33,941
Just go around
killing people?

1172
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:35,142
I like people.

1173
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:38,145
Aye.
Fuck the dog.

1174
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,180
Do it for the pleasure
it brings.

1175
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,349
<i>Come on, Jerry.</i>

1176
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:43,651
<i>We'll get a bigger fridge.</i>

1177
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:45,386
<i>The first five
are always the hardest.</i>

1178
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,388
<i>Don't listen to him, Jerry.</i>

1179
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,189
<i>I don't know about you girls,
but that Jerry guy...</i>

1180
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,058
<i>And he's going crazy.
He's losing it.</i>

1181
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,495
<i>He's in a troubled place
right now.</i>

1182
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:56,330
- - Hey, that's my boy.
You can do it.

1183
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:16,283
Shut up!

1184
01:19:28,129 --> 01:19:30,631
Hi.

1185
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:32,633
<i>Jerry.</i>

1186
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,670
I got a lot
going on right now.

1187
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:39,373
What happened?

1188
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:42,509
Well, um,
I've been crying a lot.

1189
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,378
All the time.

1190
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,613
And I stopped
taking the drugs.

1191
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,049
What? Why?

1192
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:50,551
The cat made me do it.

1193
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:53,520
Your cat made you?

1194
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,223
Mm-hmm.
No, no, kind of.

1195
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:58,225
I mean,
Mr.... Mr. Whiskers
does the talking,

1196
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:00,060
but it's really me.

1197
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,562
See?
I'm making progress.

1198
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:03,397
It's not the cat.
I know that now.

1199
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:06,066
Jerry,
we had an agreement.

1200
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:08,349
<i>I know.
I'm sorry.</i>

1201
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,605
Dr. Warren,
I'm a bad person.

1202
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:14,375
<i>Don't be so hard
on yourself.</i>

1203
01:20:14,377 --> 01:20:16,643
<i>I appreciate your honesty.</i>

1204
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,047
I'm disappointed,

1205
01:20:20,049 --> 01:20:23,350
but, hey, it's not like
you killed someone.

1206
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:26,220
Um...

1207
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:27,688
<i>What, Jerry?</i>

1208
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:30,691
It... uh, it is
kinda like that.

1209
01:20:30,693 --> 01:20:33,660
Kinda like that
times three.

1210
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,733
What are you saying, Jerry?

1211
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:43,537
Three peo... three people
who aren't alive anymore
because of me.

1212
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:47,541
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. I know.

1213
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,576
I feel terrible about it.

1214
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:52,179
And I... I really need
your help right now.

1215
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,416
- I'll help you, Jerry.
- Thank you.

1216
01:20:55,418 --> 01:20:57,151
Go ahead.
I'm listening.

1217
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:59,086
Oh...

1218
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,323
Okay, you remem...
you know the conga line?

1219
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:05,726
At your company party.

1220
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:07,828
<i>-  Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

1221
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,666
Uh, everyb... everybody sang
"Happy Song."

1222
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:15,602
<i>And you know
that English girl Fiona?</i>

1223
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:19,306
<i>We congaed and
we were supposed
to go to Shi Shan...</i>

1224
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:22,709
see an awesome show and...

1225
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,344
What are you doing,
Dr. Warren?

1226
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:25,646
- Give me that.
- No!

1227
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:29,116
- I'm being held!
- It was an accident!

1228
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,852
I liked all of them
and I wish they were all alive.

1229
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:33,587
But there's nothing
that I can do about that now.

1230
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:36,457
- Do you have packing tape?
- What? Why?

1231
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:39,059
Because I can't
let you go and I still
need a lot of therapy.

1232
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:43,430
No, stay there!
You stay there now!

1233
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:46,667
- Back! Back!
- Jerry, you're really
upset right now.

1234
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:48,435
Let's discuss this.

1235
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:50,237
- Okay.
- Stay calm.

1236
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,839
I understand.
Jerry, don't do this.

1237
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:53,961
- Don't do this, Jerry. No.
- Shh, shh. It's okay.

1238
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:08,322
Okay, we haven't got
a lot of time,

1239
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:09,623
so we gotta get
into the big issues.

1240
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,158
Do you believe in God?

1241
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,160
- Mm.
- Me, too.

1242
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:14,661
And I totally think
that He has it out for me.

1243
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,330
<i>He gives...
cuts everyone else slack</i>

1244
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:17,564
and then totally craps
all over me,

1245
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:20,367
and I wanna know why.

1246
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:23,303
Why would
He put a little boy in a home
with a father like that,

1247
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,771
make my mother
lose herself so completely

1248
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:28,442
that she'd rather die
than be with me?

1249
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,144
But if He is all-knowing,

1250
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:31,845
then God must be okay
with me killing people.

1251
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:33,247
Mm-mm.

1252
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:35,215
Ah, a shrink
who wants to talk.

1253
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:36,750
Mmm.

1254
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:38,385
But if I untape you,
we're gonna get

1255
01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:40,721
on the fast road
to mental health, okay?

1256
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:42,623
Hey, you start doing
the silent shrink thing,

1257
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,258
and I can't predict
what I'll do.

1258
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:47,861
<i>- Uh...
-  Now...</i>

1259
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:49,830
why do I hear voices?

1260
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:54,868
Oh, a lot of people
hear voices.

1261
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,471
Or thoughts they can't stop.

1262
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,473
A lot of people?

1263
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,175
<i>Yeah.</i>

1264
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:03,277
It might be a voice
telling them

1265
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:05,746
they're worthless
or stupid or...

1266
01:23:05,748 --> 01:23:09,249
or it could tell them
to indulge every desire...

1267
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:11,285
drink that drink,
take that drug,

1268
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:13,287
follow every sexual impulse.

1269
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:14,721
Or it could be
a cynical voice

1270
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,590
<i>telling them
nothing matters,</i>

1271
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,725
<i>that their efforts
are insignificant.</i>

1272
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,260
You hear stuff like that?

1273
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:23,564
Yeah.
I have thoughts.

1274
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:25,366
Not exactly
the same as you,

1275
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:28,302
<i>but similar.</i>

1276
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:31,805
<i>They tell me that I'm fat
or psychotherapy is...</i>

1277
01:23:31,807 --> 01:23:35,776
is not a worthwhile exercise,
that... that it's not real,

1278
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:38,845
that I should've aimed higher
than a government job,

1279
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,748
that my potential
is being squandered,

1280
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,384
<i>that I'm unworthy of love.</i>

1281
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:48,288
But none of that's true.

1282
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,556
So what do you do about it?

1283
01:23:51,492 --> 01:23:54,328
Well, I can't
shut them off entirely...

1284
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,663
nor would I want to...

1285
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:59,333
but I can argue
against them.

1286
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:00,601
Just because
you have thoughts

1287
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:02,736
doesn't mean
you have to act on them.

1288
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,909
You don't have
to act on them?

1289
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:11,545
<i>No.</i>

1290
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:14,414
Being alone in the world

1291
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:17,251
is the root of all suffering.

1292
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:19,353
<i>But, Jerry,</i>

1293
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:21,888
<i>you're not alone.</i>

1294
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:27,928
Whoa.

1295
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:35,002
See, that's like
10 years of therapy
in 10 seconds.

1296
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:44,344
- Where are we going?
- Home.

1297
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:45,679
I gotta feed my pets.

1298
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:05,999
- All right, let's go.
- No, no, no.

1299
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:08,635
You go inside,
I'll wait here
and watch the road.

1300
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:14,841
So that if I see him coming,
I can honk the horn
and warn you,

1301
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:16,877
and then you can
run back immediately.

1302
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:18,912
You're a real hero,
John.

1303
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,632
Alison?

1304
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,114
Ah...

1305
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,918
John, call the police.
Call the...

1306
01:26:51,672 --> 01:26:53,907
Mr. Whiskers?

1307
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:56,877
- Bosco.

1308
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:59,746
- Oh, my God, Jerry,
what have you done?
- Please be quiet.

1309
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:02,482
- Please be quiet.
- Let me go, for God's sake.

1310
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:03,683
Mr. Whiskers?

1311
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:05,552
What are you gonna do?

1312
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:06,853
I told you
I don't know, already.
All right?

1313
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:10,424
- Bosco!
- What are you gonna do?

1314
01:27:10,426 --> 01:27:12,793
- What are you going to do?
- I told you, I don't know.

1315
01:27:12,795 --> 01:27:14,895
My pets are missing.

1316
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,837
Jerry, let me go,
for God's sake.

1317
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,507
Everything is gonna be okay.

1318
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:51,031
Mr. Whiskers?!

1319
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,599
Bosco?!

1320
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,769
Bosco?!

1321
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:03,810
Hey, loser.
Is this the bitch
you've been fucking?

1322
01:28:03,812 --> 01:28:06,847
No. No. No. No.

1323
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:08,849
Mr. Whiskers.
That is my psychotherapist.

1324
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:10,717
Great job she's doing.

1325
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,552
<i>You're the picture
of mental health.</i>

1326
01:28:12,554 --> 01:28:14,120
- Where's Bosco?
- He got hit by a mini-van.

1327
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,823
<i>- I'm lost without him.
-  Good.</i>

1328
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:20,594
Now you can kill her without
all his pathetic yelping.

1329
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:24,164
<i>- No, no, no.
- It's okay.</i>

1330
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,832
It's okay.
I'm gonna just do this.

1331
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:27,968
Oh, God.

1332
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:31,037
- Jerry?
- Yeah.

1333
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,907
- I'm scared.
- She wasn't scared last week

1334
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:36,076
when she threatened
to send you back to
the loony bin.

1335
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:37,944
Me, too.

1336
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,082
Wha... what can I do
to make you more comfortable?

1337
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:43,717
Huh?

1338
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:45,952
- I want to make a phone call.
- She'll call the cops.

1339
01:28:45,954 --> 01:28:48,989
- You'll call the cops.
- No, no, no, I... I...

1340
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:51,691
I just don't
want to be alone.

1341
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:56,062
Oh, oh, oh!
Stay right there.

1342
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,164
Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait...

1343
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:02,302
You don't have to be alone.

1344
01:29:02,304 --> 01:29:04,738
Ah, here, here, here.

1345
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:11,945
Mr. Whiskers!
Dr. Warren!

1346
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:13,880
Fiona!
Cut it out!

1347
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:18,251
- Mr. Whiskers!

1348
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:42,342
Hey.

1349
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:46,079
You did the best
that you could.

1350
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:48,615
It's not your fault.

1351
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:51,251
What are you gonna
do to me?

1352
01:29:51,253 --> 01:29:53,086
N-nothing.

1353
01:29:53,088 --> 01:29:55,355
Nothing.
It's... it's fine.

1354
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,933
Put me the fuck down,
you goddamn psycho.

1355
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:08,735
I'll shit in your hand.

1356
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,372
<i>The suspect's car is
in the parking lot.</i>

1357
01:30:12,374 --> 01:30:13,940
<i>- Here. Here.
-  I want you two on the right.</i>

1358
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:16,142
Fan out and spread around
the building.

1359
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,678
- Cover all exits.
- All right, keep low, guys.

1360
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,615
<i>- Keep low.
- Watch, around the back,
around the back.</i>

1361
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:32,926
Ahh!

1362
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:39,132
<i>Is this your brilliant
escape plan, Jerry?</i>

1363
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:41,134
<i>Sneak out the back door.</i>

1364
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:42,836
<i>It's your favorite door,
isn't it?</i>

1365
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:44,118
It's the best I've got.

1366
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:55,315
<i>This'll fool 'em
since you're bulletproof
and invisible.</i>

1367
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,753
<i>Run, Jerry.</i>

1368
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:01,688
<i>It's been nice
knowing you, pal.</i>

1369
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,741
<i>- Sheriff's department.
- I'm here.</i>

1370
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:23,943
<i>- Nobody move.
-  Don't hurt me!</i>

1371
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,879
I smell gas.

1372
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:30,350
- Can't you smell that?
- We'll check on it.

1373
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:32,752
- Where'd Jerry go?
- He went in there.

1374
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:35,755
Suspect last seen
in the bathroom.

1375
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:38,358
- Was he armed?
- I don't know.

1376
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:40,860
<i>I found a cat.</i>

1377
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:45,965
<i>- - Come in here.</i>

1378
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,111
<i>Jerry.</i>

1379
01:32:01,348 --> 01:32:02,916
<i>Hey, we found a cat
and a dog.</i>

1380
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:04,751
<i>Call the animal shelter.</i>

1381
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:06,953
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

1382
01:32:06,955 --> 01:32:08,822
We believe
he's in the bowling alley.

1383
01:32:08,824 --> 01:32:10,190
- You think he's armed?
- I don't know.

1384
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:14,027
- Then we have to assume he is.
- Please don't hurt him.

1385
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:15,462
He's very ill.

1386
01:32:15,464 --> 01:32:18,231
Our first priority
is our own safety, Doctor.

1387
01:32:23,904 --> 01:32:26,473
Tactical team on scene.

1388
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:28,875
First responders... clear.

1389
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,477
Bedroom... clear.

1390
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,953
- Go! Go!
- Preparing to descend.

1391
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,324
Gas leak!

1392

<i>- Jerry.
- Jerry.</i>

1393

<i>Jerry, you're almost home.</i>

<i>Come, come with us.</i>

- Come, Jerry.</i>

<i>We're all waiting
for you.</i>

<i>Come.
You'll never

<i>Come home, come.</i>

<i>You'll never

<i>Jerry, come with us.</i>

1402
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:39,345
<i>As in you're gonna be
charbroiled, Jerry.</i>

1403
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,347
<i>- You run.
 No.</i>

1404
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,349
<i>You stay.</i>

1405
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:46,052
<i>You're no good to yourself
or anybody else.</i>

1406
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:47,554
<i>You let the fire
put you to sleep.</i>

1407
01:33:47,556 --> 01:33:51,891
<i>Isn't that what they say
right before they kill you?</i>

1408
01:33:51,893 --> 01:33:53,193
<i>Jerry knows that.</i>

1409
01:33:53,195 --> 01:33:55,395
<i>He can end
the suffering tonight.</i>

1410
01:33:55,397 --> 01:33:57,197
<i>- Unless you want to be
- Jerry The Human Torch,</i>

1411
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,065
<i>get the hell out.</i>

1412
01:33:59,067 --> 01:34:01,367
<i>Stand your ground, buddy.</i>

1413
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:04,070
<i>There's nothing left
for you in this life.</i>

1414
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:23,022
<i>We could've filled 10 more
refrigerators, Jerry.</i>

1415

<i>Shush, pussy.</i>

1416
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,360
<i>If he survives,
he'll only cause
more suffering,</i>

1417
01:34:27,362 --> 01:34:29,362
<i>pain, and death.</i>

1418
01:34:29,364 --> 01:34:31,531
<i>It's over.</i>

1419
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:33,032
<i>Jerry's going home.</i>

1420
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,516
You win, pup.

1421
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:51,985
I have to confess...

1422
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:55,154
this alpha thing
suits you well.

1423
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:57,423
I kind of like you,
Bosco.

1424
01:34:57,425 --> 01:35:00,159
Me, too.

1425
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:03,429
I like you,
Mr. Whiskers.

1426
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:06,266
But now it's time
for each of us to go
our own way.

1427
01:35:07,534 --> 01:35:09,569
Good-bye, friend.

1428
01:35:09,571 --> 01:35:11,170
Good-bye, Mr. Whiskers.

1429
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:25,418
- Mom?
- Hey, Jerry.

1430
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,387
- Dad?
- Creep.

1431
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:30,023
Hey, Fiona, Lisa.

1432
01:35:30,025 --> 01:35:31,745
- Good evening, love.
- Hi, Jerry.

1433
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:36,996
- Mmm... Alison?
- Hey, Jerry.

1434
01:35:36,998 --> 01:35:39,132
I'm sorry
I killed you guys.

1435
01:35:39,134 --> 01:35:40,500
Let's not bring up
the bad things.

1436
01:35:40,502 --> 01:35:42,268
Let's just be happy.

1437
01:35:48,609 --> 01:35:50,143
Jesus.

1438
01:35:50,145 --> 01:35:51,477
Hi, Jerry.

1439
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:53,613
Thanks for the love
and thank you for coming.

1440
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:56,015
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1441
01:35:56,017 --> 01:35:58,584
- Are my pets gonna be okay?
- You betcha.
