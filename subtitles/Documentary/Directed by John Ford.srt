In the '60s. Orson Welles was interviewed.

00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,111
One of the questions he was asked was
who his favorite American directors were.

21
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:41,188
He said. “Well. I prefer the old masters.

“Did you show that quote of mine to Ford?“

I'd watch that film.

The inner tension of trying to express
different things in different ways.

153
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,623
And knowing that both are kind of true.

154
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:36,355
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,
which I saw at a drive-in movie theater...

155
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,730
...growing up. uh. in Phoenix. Arizona. uh.
made a tremendous impact on me.

156
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:48,399
Because I always felt like I was.
you know. the. uh. reluctant fighter.

157
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:50,736
And. uh. in the Jimmy Stewart character...

158
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,212
...and I really related to his dilemma.
his moral dilemma.

159
00:10:55,371 --> 00:11:01,049
Isn't it enough to kill a man
without trying to build a life on it?

160
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:03,851
Now. wait a minute. Now. wait a minute.
Just a minute. Jim.

161
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,890
How come you checked with an ace showing?

162
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,892
Was that an ace?

163
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:10,292
I'm blind as a bat.

164
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,195
Well. I wanted very. very much
to please him...

165
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:16,462
...first time I worked for him.
and I still do.

166
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:21,200
If I'd make another picture
for him tomorrow. I'd wanna please him.

167
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:23,742
And I think he does that to people.

168
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,248
He. uh. dares you to do it right...

169
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:31,282
...to do it good.

170
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:35,747
And. uh. it's sort of a competitive thing.

171
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:41,055
And there's that feeling on the set
when you're working for him.

172
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,720
Uh. it isn't a relaxed set.

173
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:47,398
You know. so many people say.
“Oh. it's so nice.

174
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,969
It's such a relaxed set.
and everybody sort...“

175
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,161
It's.uh...

176
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,603
With Ford. it's not a relaxed set at all.

177
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:56,300
It's-- There's tension every place.

178
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,809
There's. uh...

179
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,745
Everybody's on edge.

180
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:05,375
After we'd been on. uh. Stagecoach
for three weeks...

181
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:10,854
...and they had quite a bit of film
in the box. he. uh. said:

182
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:14,223
“Would you like to see some of the film?“
And I said. “I'd love to.“

183
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:18,059
He says. “All right.
Lovey's. uh. cutting up there now.

184
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,360
You won't have to work for a couple of hours.

185
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,730
Go on up. tell him to run you
what they have.“

186
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,098
So I went up and saw this.

187
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,106
And it was beautiful photography.
You know. it's wonderful stuff.

188
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:32,440
And I came back. and he said. um.
“Well. how'd you like it?“

189
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:36,414
Then I said. “Oh. ifs. you know. wonderful.
Jeez. the greatest photography.“

190
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,677
“Well." he says. “It was directed all right?“

191
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,377
And I said. “Oh. it's wonderful.“

192
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:42,750
He says. “How was Mitchell?“
And I said. “Fine.“

193
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:47,292
And he said. uh. “How are you?“
And I said. “Well. I'm playing you.

194
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,158
You know what that part is.“

195
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,199
So. uh. ahem. he kept asking me questions.

196
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,700
He says. “How'd you like this?
How'd you like that?

197
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,237
Isn't there anything that you.
uh. didn't like?“

198
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,635
And now my propman thing.

199
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:03,869
I said. “Listen. I told the propman
at the first of this picture...

200
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,035
...to get some of those exercising things...

201
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,944
...to put at the end of those lines.
so Andy'd have a--“

202
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:13,747
He says. “Okay. hold it. Come on down.
Come on down off the lights.

203
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,945
Everybody down.“

204
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:18,320
He got everybody in the center of the stage.
and he said:

205
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,722
“I want you fellows to know something.

206
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:25,593
Our star. uh. just loves the picture
as it's going.

207
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:29,532
He thinks he's fine in it.
but he can't stand Devine's performance.“

208
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:33,504
Well. you know. luckily. uh.
I was a good friend of Andy's...

209
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,870
...and he understood it.

210
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,909
I wanna tell you. this fellow puts you--

211
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,946
You know.
he keeps pretty good control of you.

<i>On 3 Godfathers...</i>

213
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:47,179
...there's this scene
where Wayne and Armendériz and myself...

214
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:51,155
...were in our bedrolls
and we're covered up. you know...

215
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,419
...uh. because there had been
a sandstorm so...

216
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,529
And then we sit up from the bedrolls...

217
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:58,393
...and Duke wakes up. and then Pete wakes up.

218
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:03,101
And then I <i>look</i> around.
I <i>look</i> like that and say--

219
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,330
KEARNEY: Where'd you pick up the horses?

220
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:10,075
CAREY: So we do it and he said. “Cut.

221
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:13,976
Don't look all over Death Valley...

222
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,777
...for the horses. just look where they were.

223
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,646
Where they were.“

224
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:23,817
So it's no use trying to say.
“Well. I thought-J' because that's dead.

225
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,757
Anyway. ahem. I did it the next time.
I did it again.

226
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,591
And he threw this rock at my head.

227
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:35,302
And. uh. if it had hit me.
It would have killed me.

228
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,804
So it hit Armendériz
in a terrible spot on his body.

229
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:41,736
And. uh. very painful.

231
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,203
Because I ducked and it hit Pedro.

[CHUCKLES]

233
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,872
And that made Ford laugh.

234
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,144
So it got him back out of that mood...

235
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,585
...but. uh. it was one of those bad days.

236
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,985
You know in a Ford picture.
and this is a very well-known fact...

237
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,790
...every day someone is at the bottom
of the list. in the barrel. as they say.

238
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:06,524
But there's a long story with that.
We won't go into it.

239
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:07,963
But the bottom of the list.

240
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:12,129
And strangely enough. Duke Wayne.
who. over the years. you know...

241
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:15,674
...has made lots of pictures with Ford.

242
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,143
Duke Wayne has been
at the bottom of the list. in the barrel...

243
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:22,078
...more than anybody else.
which is sort of remarkable...

244
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,411
...because they love each other.

00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:26,417
They're like father and son.

<i>And. uh. 'm Liberty Valance...</i>

247
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:33,622
...the picture I did with Duke. Duke came up.

248
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:36,491
But the picture was about, oh.
more than halfway finished.

249
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,393
Duke came to me one day and he said:

250
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:42,593
“How's it come that you've gone
through this whole thing...

251
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,760
...and never been at the bottom of the list?

252
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,100
What's there?
You been red-appling the old man?

253
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:49,573
What's the idea?“

254
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,837
And I said. “I don't know.“

255
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,105
And I didn't know.

256
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:57,081
But I must say I got a little smug about it.

257
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,584
And. uh. went on.

258
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:05,090
And it went around the company.
they say. “Jeez. this Stewart is never...

259
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,285
He's always right up there.“

260
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:13,293
Well. the day before the picture finished.
we had a scene. it was a funeral scene.

261
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,629
Duke's funeral.

262
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,862
And Woody Strode...

263
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:24,171
...who played the part of the wonderful
Negro friend of. uh. Duke's...

264
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,438
...who was at the funeral.

265
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:32,746
And Woody was dressed in blue overalls
and blue work shirt and boots.

266
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,379
And for some reason--
He does this quite often...

267
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:41,256
...but I think this is a part of the tension.
a part of Ford.

268
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,397
For some reason. he came up to me. and he--

269
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,261
And before we did the scene he said:

270
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,232
“What do you think of Woody's costume?“

271
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:54,070
Now. why I said this. I'll never know.

272
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,339
What possessed me to say what I did.
I'll never know.

273
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,778
And it just came out. and I said:

274
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,114
“Well. it looks a little Uncle Remus-y.
doesn't it?“

275
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,849
And he froze and walked away.

276
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,857
Then he said. uh. “Blow a whistle.“

277
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:16,826
And they blew a whistle.

278
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:22,334
He said. uh. “Everybody.
would you please gather around?“

279
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,104
And he said to me.
“Would you come over here?“

280
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,743
And everybody. the whole company.
they were around.

281
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:34,439
He said. “Ladies and gentlemen.
we have an actor.“

282
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,839
“Actor?“

283
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,281
“We have an actor here...

284
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:45,716
...who objects to the costume
on Woody Strode.

285
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,885
He. uh. says that it's too Uncle Remus-y.

286
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:54,091
Now, I don't know if this is a sort
of a prejudice on Mr. Stewart's part.

287
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,259
I don't know whether he's anti-Negro.

288
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,132
I don't know what it is...

289
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,832
...but I just wanted to point this out
to the whole cast.“

290
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,409
I wanted to shoot myself.

00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,343
And I looked at Duke Wayne...

294

“It's the very top of the painting.“

“When you can come to the conclusion...

...that putting the horizon at the bottom
of a frame or the top of the frame...

383

...is a lot better than putting the horizon
right in the middle of the frame...

00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,167
I said. “Oh. that will be easy.“

450
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:23,325
But these girls are all very pretty.

451
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:26,200
The cowboys are sort of straightening
their kerchiefs up...

452
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:29,638
...straightening their hats
and trying to look as pretty as possible...

453
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,334
...and. uh. shining up to these gals.

454
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,472
So. uh. I says. “I'll fire a pistol.
and you. you and you do a horse fall...

455
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:38,584
...all fall off your horse.“

456
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,313
Well. the cowboys looked at one another.
So I fired the shot.

457
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:44,957
And then every cowboy--
I think there were 30 of them.

458
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:47,093
They all fell off their horses.

459
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,287
And, uh, I said to Mr. Bernstein,
“That's about it, isn't it?“

460
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:53,228
He says. “Oh. no. keep on going.
What can you do now?“

461
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:58,235
So I put a lot of kerosene and gasoline
on the place and burnt the town down.

462
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,407
Of course. the sets were cheap.
Just built of plywood.

463
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:02,701
Didn't cost anything.

464
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,869
So I burnt the town down.
and they thought it was great.

465
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:08,139
They had a picture coming up
with Harry Carey.

466
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:11,409
And they had no director.
and. uh. Mr. Laemmle says:

467
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:16,921
“That Jack Ford. he yells real loud.
He'd make a good director.“

468
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:24,889
About the second day on the picture.
there's quite a big scene going on...

469
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:29,001
...in which I have one line
toward the end of the picture.

470
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:30,636
The end of the scene.

471
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:35,639
And. uh. it's telling the sheriff
that I'll go whichever way he goes.

472
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,438
And. uh. in the meantime.
to keep me busy in the background...

473
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,014
...he has me. uh. washing my face
and drying it.

474
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:47,176
They're playing the scene.
I was washing my face and he'd say. “Cut.“

475
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:51,017
All right. He'd look over at me and say,
“Let's do it again.“

476
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,252
And I had become conscious that he's
certainly paying a lot of attention to me...

477
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:57,727
...with that scene going on over there.

478
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:02,198
So finally. I did it. And he says. “Cut.
Duke. you're dabbing your face.

479
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:03,893
Can't you wash?“

480
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:07,131
I said. “I am washing. I'm doing this.
What more can I do?

481
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,867
I'm using the towel hard like that.
What more can I do?“

482
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:14,276
Well. a big scene came up
and he just bawled me out...

483
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:19,943
...to where. finally. all the crew.
all the actors...

484
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:23,146
...uh. the cast was completely on my side.

485
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:26,919
And. uh. from then on.
I had the cast helping me. you know...

486
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:32,555
...as my first time really in the big time
working with so many top people.

487
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:34,496
BOGDANOVICH:
You think he planned it that way?

488
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:36,897
I know he planned it that way.

489
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,630
As a matter of fact.
he had little Tim Holt...

490
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:42,639
...who was not. uh. much more
in the business than I.

491
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:45,870
And Holt finally said.
“Stop picking on Duke.“

492
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:51,950
And this topped it for Jack. you know.
and then he knew he got his point across.

493
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:55,418
I think he did it on purpose.

494
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:58,524
He has a way of picking on actors...

495
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,789
...when they're. um. uh. not too important
a part of a scene...

496
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,831
...in order to get them on their toes
so they'll come ready...

497
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:12,132
...when they really have something to do.
and then he handles you like a baby.

498
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:17,673
Ford knew that there were
150. 200 people in the company...

499
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:22,646
...with a large cast and all this crew
that would be stuck on this location...

500
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:26,081
...with nothing to do at night.
and we were there for three weeks.

501
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,982
And every night...

502
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:33,491
...uh. after mess. after chow. after dinner.
there would be a campfire.

503
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:36,595
And there would be. uh. something different
happening every night.

504
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,663
He put me in charge. as a matter of fact.

505
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,360
And I was the camp director
of Camp June Alaska. we called it.

506
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,368
A camp for boys between the ages of 14.

507
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,734
I remember that was a phrase.

508
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,876
But there would be a program every night.

509
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:53,070
And. um. during the day.
when you're on the set...

510
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:57,081
...between takes, you're talking about it
and planning it and organizing.

511
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:01,085
Anyway. it was something
that people got to look forward to.

512
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:03,780
And I remember at the end.
at the end of the program...

513
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,017
...whatever it was each night.
Ford would give the cue to--

514
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:09,389
There was. um. a bugle player.

515
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:14,591
He was probably an actor.
a small-part actor, who played a bugle.

516
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:18,465
And he would be given the cue when
nobody could see Ford give it just on set...

517
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,631
...and he would disappear
into the woods there.

518
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,745
And suddenly. when it had got
to the last song. whatever it was...

519
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,814
...he would blow “Taps“
from way back in the woods.

520
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,282
And I tell you that people would cry
with nostalgia.

521
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:35,581
It was like being a child again at camp.

522
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:39,419
If you came into the Ford set.
Into the sound stage...

523
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:43,119
...it was like walking
into a cathedral or a church.

524
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:47,056
There was a spell
that was in there in that set.

525
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:51,466
And he cast the spell. I mean. he did.
It just emanated from him.

526
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:56,700
When you look at the amount of. uh. films...

527
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:59,505
...that a guy like John Ford has done.
you know...

528
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,342
...when he walks on the set.
he's not sitting there...

529
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:06,884
...quaking about what the first shots
gonna be and how am I gonna handle this...

530
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:12,355
...and what the actors are gonna think.
how am I gonna establish rapport.

531
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,289
He's gonna just step right up and say:

532
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:17,089
“Okay. here's the first shot.
We're gonna come over here.

533
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:18,822
Somebody's gonna go over there.“

534
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,398
That's the way it's gonna be.

535
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:22,432
Bad directors don't try to say anything.

536
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,969
Good directors. I think.
try to say something.

537
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:26,970
And if you're really a good director...

538
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:30,599
...you at least try
to maybe say several different things.

539
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:35,714
Ford. of course. was a master at staging.
shooting. all the things you wanna say.

540
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,374
Poet. Catholic poet.

541
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,181
They were always.
always trying to keep it moving.

542
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:44,483
You got the feeling
you were going somewhere...

543
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:46,250
...when you were making a picture.

544
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:48,394
The feeling at beginning of every day...

545
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,996
...you were gonna complete
a certain segment of it...

546
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:55,863
...and. uh. not be coming back to it
the next day...

547
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,368
...and revisiting the same thing over...

548
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:02,634
...because the guy wants to do 40 takes
on some guy's close-up or something.

549
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,539
A key scene for me in any of the Ford
pictures. maybe not one of his strongest...

550
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,305
<i>...Two Rode Together.
BOGDANOVICH:</i> Yeah.

551
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,679
And it's the scene with Jimmy Stewart
and Rich Widmark on the riverbank.

552
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,343
- BOGDANOVICH: Yeah.
- One take.

553
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:15,783
Dialogue.

554
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:18,618
Uh. the relationship of the two. the humor.

555
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:23,427
And I said. “I wanna make scenes like that.
I wanna deal with characters like that.

556
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,929
Uh. I wanna create films like that.“

557
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,431
The first thing Ford did
was walk out in the river.

558
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,800
Nobody knew how deep it was.
and everybody sort of sat there...

559
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:38,240
...and no one knew
exactly why he walked out in the river.

560
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,404
Because we didn't really know
that this was where...

561
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,948
...we were going to shoot the scene.

562
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,482
Uh...

563
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:50,151
But as happens so often. uh.
Ford walked out in the river.

564
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:53,589
Fortunately. it wasn't too deep.
It was about up to here.

565
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:57,992
So everybody else walked out in the river.

566
00:33:58,153 --> 00:34:03,535
They said. you know. “If the boss did.
I guess he's out there for some reason.“

567
00:34:03,692 --> 00:34:08,141
So the cameramen went out. and the gaffer.

568
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,607
And. uh. Ford said. “Right here.“

569
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:16,409
Which meant. uh.
“This is where the camera will be.“

570
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:23,011
So they all got the camera together.
and it was a rather long scene on the water.

571
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:28,651
The sound man said.
“I can't-- The sound. it's a river.“

572
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,161
And Ford said. “What?“

573
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:35,925
And then the sound man
didn't say anything more.

574
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:39,538
And. uh. so we did the scene.

575
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:42,140
Discussing that scene
with Jimmy Stewart one time...

576
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:45,801
...he said
that just before they made the shot...

577
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,072
...Ford had taken Stewart aside and said:

578
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:52,309
“Watch out for Widmark.
He's a good country actor.“

579
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:56,945
And. uh. Jimmy said that that kind of
put him on his guard for the whole scene.

580
00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:59,786
And he told me
that after they'd finished the scene...

581
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,360
...he was discussing everything
with Widmark...

582
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,293
...and was told that Ford
had come up to Widmark...

583
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,525
...just before they made the scene
and said exactly the same thing.

584
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,034
“Watch out for Stewart.
He's a good country actor.“

585
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:12,633
I can't figure it out.

586
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:15,001
No fuss.

587
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,074
No argument.

588
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:20,111
What made you decide to come along?

589
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:22,880
Ride all night on some wild goose chase.

590
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,575
I'll tell you this.
you didn't decide me to come along.

591
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,811
- I tell you that.
- I didn't figure I did.

592
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:32,785
Those things come. uh. one in a box?

593
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,927
- Don't you ever buy your own cigars?
- Sure.

594

And...

610
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,840
...just lately. she started calling me Guth.

611
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:33,714
I noticed that.

612
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:37,618
Guth. The first time I heard it, I thought
she got something stuck in her teeth.

613
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,814
Guth. Guth. Guth.

But she didn't have
anything stuck in her teeth.

...that he tried to get everything
on the first take...

680

on technique...

like it's the first time.

00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:40,337
- Well?
- It's a risky operation at best.

748
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:42,974
- Can you halt?
- You know I can't.

749
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,575
For 30 minutes. Nathan.

750
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:46,439
Twenty minutes. For a man's life.

751
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:50,310
Doctor. I couldn't give you five minutes.
Not if it was my own son.

752
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:53,577
Quayne's a soldier.
He'll have to take a soldier's risks.

753
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:56,654
He knows that. I'm the one that's begging.

754
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:57,949
I'll give you all I can.

755
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,116
Troop halt! Dismount leads.

756
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,989
Thank you. Nathan.

757
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,721
Hold your cap in the ranks.

758
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:29,118
So many times I have read
and been told about the Ford luck.

759
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:30,312
Ford luck.

760
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,152
But that wonderful scene
when I walked down...

761
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,851
...after being married
to the mine owner's son.

762
00:45:36,017 --> 00:45:38,930
And I walked down the steps
from the church...

763
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:42,795
...and my veil up on the back of my neck
went and spiraled up in the sky.

764
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:45,096
And everybody said. “Oh. that Ford luck.

765
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:48,240
How wonderful that was.
What an effect it had.“

766
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:50,569
Rubbish. It wasn't Ford luck.

767
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:53,940
It was three wind machines.
placed by John Ford...

768
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:56,945
...and I had to walk up and down
those steps many times...

769
00:45:57,104 --> 00:46:01,883
...while he worked out that
the wind machine would do exactly that.

770
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:29,242
Now. in that clip. the man under the tree...

771
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:32,384
...is Walter Pidgeon.
who's the minister of that church.

772
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,884
He's madly in love
with Maureen O'Hara's character.

773
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,114
She's madly in love with him.
but she has to marry someone else...

774
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:42,955
...because their relationship
has been deeply frowned on by the society.

775
00:46:43,117 --> 00:46:46,496
So he's obviously very unhappy
under the tree.

776
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:51,433
And Ford has them ride off.
and you just see him under the tree...

777
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:54,471
...and that's the end of the sequence.

778
00:46:55,129 --> 00:46:57,803
So they shot this shot...

779
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:01,674
...and the cameraman. Artie Miller.
came over to Ford...

780
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:05,716
...and said. “Jack. you think we should get
a close-up of Walter under the tree?“

781
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:09,320
And Ford said.
“Oh. Jesus. no. I mean. they'll just use it.“

782
00:47:09,477 --> 00:47:11,889
Because he shot in the studio system...

783
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:15,118
...and all those people shot
in the studio system in those days...

784
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:20,459
...where groups of executives
would come and scrutinize your dailies...

785
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:23,625
...and they could come along
and maybe bring in another editor...

786
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:27,967
...and try to edit along simultaneously
with you or something.

787
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:29,802
I think they didn't want to do that.

788
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:32,877
They wanted to just put down their picture.
so they would quit.

789
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:36,948
I've worked with directors like that.
They would just cut. stop...

790
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,246
...where they wanted the camera to stop
so that you couldn't edit it...

791
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:42,683
...too many different ways.

792
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,982
You know. Ford. always said:

793
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:49,026
“I had a thousand fights with the studios
and I lost them all.“

794
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:54,394
<i>And. uh.</i> still <i>there's The Grapes of Wrath
and My Darling Clementine...</i>

795
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:58,628
<i>...and They Were Expendable,</i> and so...

796
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,000
I'd like to lose some fights like that.

797
00:48:01,162 --> 00:48:04,700
I really admired the way he would
stage and block his characters.

798
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:10,110
And often he would hold shots
where everybody would be in a full shot...

799
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:12,376
...composed in a painterly fashion...

800
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:17,387
...not as archly operatic
as Cecil B. DeMille...

801
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:21,254
...but they still looked like.
you know. beautiful poses.

802
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:27,127
And yet he'd find some naturalistic way
to get your mind off of the frame...

803
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:30,030
...and get yourself inside the story.

804
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:33,331
The beauty of his compositions.
I just said at the time...

805
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,804
...the pictures. the way they looked.

806
00:48:35,963 --> 00:48:41,311
Um. and later on I tried to analyze why.
and. um. obviously it's the authenticity.

807
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:44,541
In a sense. the authenticity
of the way the people behave...

808
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:47,709
...the dust on the clothes.
uh. body language.

809
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:49,479
Nobody ever staged better.

810
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:54,319
Nobody ever staged actors to camera better.

811
00:48:54,482 --> 00:48:57,429
But at the same time. it seems organic.

812
00:48:57,585 --> 00:48:59,963
He would just allow a shot to be set.

813
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:03,466
And the shot would just evolve.
and it would just keep evolving.

814
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:06,537
Pretty soon you got a chance
to study it. much like a painting.

815
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:10,574
I think the thing I learned so much about.
you know. by watching John Ford films...

816
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:12,574
...is he is a painter.

817
00:49:12,733 --> 00:49:14,838
And. uh. he was a great painter.

818
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:18,381
It just took him a hundred crew members
to help him paint the canvas.

819
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,146
The opening scene in The Searchers where
Ward Bond. uh. arrives at the house...

820
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:25,085
...and asks for some coffee.
and. uh. asks for those doughnuts...

821
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:27,954
...and the way he's behaving.
the way everybody's moving...

822
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,288
...in that frame. in the kitchen...

823
00:49:30,451 --> 00:49:33,330
...I think to me that was Ford.

824
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:37,526
Um. that when I felt that I wanted
to spend time with people I love...

825
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:40,467
...and I knew they were being handled
with love in the film.

826
00:49:40,628 --> 00:49:41,902
That was Ford to me.

827

He starts the day by everybody being
there on time at 9:00 in the morning.

854
00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:56,439
Then he calls you over to the set.

855
00:50:56,604 --> 00:50:57,639
Usually he'd say:

856
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,979
“Well. you come in that door.
you come in this door over here...

857
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:05,419
...you're sitting on the couch."
and just run through the lines.

858
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:08,355
Now. he'd let you run through those lines...

859
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:12,930
...and develop your, uh. actions...

860
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:17,729
...your physical actions to the lines
in those rehearsals.

861
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:20,303
He doesn't say. uh.
“I want you to come into the door...

862
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:23,169
...and come over
and stand right there by that plant.“

863
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,436
He doesn't-- There's no. “You must.
you must. you must.“

864
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,740
He just says.
“Rehearse the scene quietly.“ You know?

865
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,952
Ford has-- He puts some flats up
and has a long table...

866
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:40,616
...and we go before a scene
and. uh. we read the scene.

867
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:45,693
But I've never really felt
that Ford. uh. used this as a rehearsal.

868
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,265
I've always felt that he used it...

869
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:53,496
...because he wasn't sure
he liked some of the dialogue.

870
00:51:53,661 --> 00:51:55,299
He has such an analytical mind.

871
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:57,669
He knows the difference between the trivia...

872
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:02,337
...and the meat of a scene
like no one I ever worked with.

873
00:52:02,503 --> 00:52:06,610
He would have Dudley Nichols
rewrite scene after scene after scene--

874
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:09,254
This was before the picture started.

875
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,220
--And then just reach down
and take a line out of this one...

876
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,859
...a line out of this one.
and then three lines...

877
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:17,188
...out of all this wonderful writing...

878
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:22,061
...but. uh. flowery. uh. language
of Dudley Nichols.

879
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,364
He'd just go right to the valuable thoughts.

880
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:30,100
Because I'd know we've done this
and we've read something...

881
00:52:30,264 --> 00:52:32,266
...and I would read something. and he'd say:

882
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:36,813
“Wait a minute. What script do you have?“

883
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:41,614
Well. you know. I said.
“This is the script you gave.“

884
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:44,449
He said. “This. it's not the script I have.

885
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:47,421
I never had-- That's a terrible line.“

886
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,959
I said. “Well. there. there's the line.“

887
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:53,496
He said. “Well. isn't everybody
agreed that that's awful?“

888

[BOGDANOVICH CHUCKLES]

Everybody said. “ Yeah.“

890
00:52:56,957 --> 00:53:00,336
Duke Wayne said. "Well. maybe
it's the way Stewart reads it, you know.“

891
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:04,533
And. uh. pretty soon the page is torn out.

892
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:08,373
And he said.
“Now let's go over it without that page.“

893
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:12,915
I think that. uh.
lots of times he does that...

894
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:16,646
...just to sort of cut down on the dialogue.
