1
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,542
- Shit! Shit! Shit!

2
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,584
- Hey! Stop, please!

3
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,847
<i>In a related story,</i>
<i>the high court had also refused...</i>

4
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:33,352
to stay Friday's execution of former
philosophy professor David Gale.

5
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,684
- Oh, boy.
<i>- Gale had sought a review</i>
<i>of his 1994 conviction...</i>

6
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:41,090
for the rape and murder
of his University of Austin
colleague Constance Harraway.

7
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,689
The case has received
nation wide media attention
because Gale and Harraway...

8
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:50,168
were activists for DeathWatch,
a nonprofit abolitionist organization.

9
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,069
Do you understand how much money the
taxpayers pay in the state of Texas...

10
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,164
to put one person to death?

11
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,005
- What do we want?
- No more executions!

12
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,011
Governor,
can't we all just admit...

13
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,547
that the capital punishment system
in this country is not working?

14
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,516
They're not gonna stay Gale.
It's on TV right now. Listen.

15
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,951
<i>Defense lawyers</i>
<i>had hoped to argue...</i>

16
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,047
that Gale's former activism
against capital punishment...

17
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,558
<i>unduly prejudiced</i>
<i>the Texas judicial system.</i>

18
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,959
The deal was, Bitsey
would get the interview
if the stay was refused.

19
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,055
He'll talk to her
for two hours a day...

20
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,965
Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday.

21
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,233
Can't do Friday, no.
'Cause Friday's the day
they execute him.

22
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,641
<i>- The lawyer said only Bitsey.</i>
- Gale's going down.

23
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,578
"Only Bitsey" means only Bitsey.

24
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,616
I don't get to make
the rules, Joe. Please,
I'm a fat black woman.

25
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,450
- Tell him I said...
<i>- What we need is to put her</i>
<i>on a plane to Texas.</i>

26
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,989
Why do you get like that around legal?
Hold on. We're coming over.

27
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,628
So what's this "Only Bitsey
means only Bitsey" stuff?

28
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,063
- They asked for you and no substitutes.
- Who's "they" exactly?

29
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,728
Gale's lawyers.
More exactly, Gale's <i>lawyer...</i>
some good ol' boy in Austin.

30
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,671
- Why do they want me?
- You're telling me you don't
want the assignment?

31
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,768
No. I just can't see why a guy
on death row about to be
executed should ask for me.

32
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,780
I think they like the kiddie
porn piece you did and going
to jail and stuff.

33
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,476
I don't know.
Maybe he saw your picture
and thinks you're cute.

34
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,918
- So how much access do I get?
- Three interviews.
No time for any more.

35
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,979
By Friday, the guy's a goner.

36
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:21,550
- Okay. What exactly is our story?
- Rape, murder, death row.

37
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,461
Very intelligent guy.
Hey, maybe he's even innocent.

38
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,521
Yeah, right.

39
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,762
<i>No, no. Tell him</i>
<i>I'll call him back. Thanks.</i>

40
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,100
- Okay, so what's your problem?
- Hi, Barbara.

41
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,696
<i>Good morning, Bitsey.</i>
<i>Okay. Here's my concern.</i>

42
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,767
Setting aside the cost, although
half a million dollars...
in cash, I might add...

43
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,814
for three days of interviews
is not only illegal, it's obscene.

44
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,611
That's market value.
The guy's never talked.

45
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,586
Aside from that, I... we... are still
uncomfortable with the arrangement.

46
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,421
- Why?
- You just spent a very
public seven days in jail...

47
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,619
for a very public
contempt of court citation.

48
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,822
For protecting sources.
If you're so goddamn
uncomfortable with the story...

49
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,162
why did you slap it
on both the domestic
and the international covers?

50
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,534
Look, what makes me... us...
uncomfortable is the fact
that a rapist-slash-murderer...

51
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,631
has asked to spend the last three days
of his life giving an interview...

52
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:13,338
his very first...
to a reporter who is now famous
for protecting sexual deviants...

53
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,506
<i>a reporter who's also</i>
<i>a very attractive woman.</i>

54
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,039
Aw, come on!
This is disparate treatment.

55
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,586
<i>- Oh, boy.</i>
- I could go if I were an ugly guy?

56
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,748
There's an agenda issue here
which would be defused
with the presence of a man.

57
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:30,524
I hear lawyers gleefully
saying the words <i>"Bloom vs.</i>
NEWS Magazine, <i>Incorporated. "</i>

58
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,157
Your Honor, I started to notice
my assignments being determined
on the basis of my sex.

59

<i>- No.</i>
- You've gotta let her go now.

60
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,062

- He's gotta let you go.

61
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:43,404
<i>All right, all right. Enough.</i>
<i>But the intern will be</i>
<i>with you at all times.</i>

62
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,572
- Okay.
- What? Intern?
No. You gotta be kidding.

63
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,343
- That's what he said. He's the boss.
- He's a jerk.

64
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,907
Come on. Not an intern.
I always work alone.

65
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,351
- Not this time, Bitsey.
- Look, I'm not baby-sitting.

66
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,300
<i>Gale's D.N.A. Was everywhere.</i>
<i>His semen was inside her.</i>

67
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,275
<i>He was seen leaving her house.</i>

68
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,573
<i>His prints were all over the kitchen,</i>
<i>including one on the bag.</i>

69
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,046
- Half a thumb print.
- Okay, half a thumb print.
That's enough.

70
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,676
He could've touched it
before it was a murder weapon.

71
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,743
Do you fondle
your friends' garbage bags?

72
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,950
I get very touchy
around household plastics.
I'm particularly fond of Tupperware.

73
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,993
- Tupperware?
- Look, I'm just saying...

74
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,621
the bag could've been sitting
up on the counter or something.

75
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,757
- Zack? He did it. Now he's gonna die.

76
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,563
And you know something?
Maybe that's exactly what he deserves.

77
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:47,595
But the murder's way too fuckin' clumsy.
This guy is a major intellectual.

78
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:52,633
Top of his Harvard class,
Rhodes scholar, tenured at 27,
two books published.

79
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,944
He's an academic stud.
Look at his wife,
a regular Grace Kelly...

80
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,816
old money svelte,
father was ambassador to Spain.

81
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,151
Shit. The light's on again.

82
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,952
- Ignore it. It's a rental.
- Do you smell anything?

83
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,289
No. Besides, the guy's
a flaming liberal.

84
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,352
A person's politics
has nothing to do...

85
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,762
- with his propensity
to commit a crime.
- Wrong.

86
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,697
Aren't we supposed to smell
something if it's overheating?

87
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,497
Seventy-three percent of
all serial killers vote Republican.

88
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,471
Look, throw your cigarette out
so we can smell.

89
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,373
- No. You'll stink up the car.
Throw it out.

90
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,935
- I'm not gonna fuckin' pollute.
- Zack!

91
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,853
There is definitely
something wrong with this car.

92
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,795
Shit. This is so irritating.

93
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,665
- How far to Huntsville?
- Look. I'm gonna pull off.

Whatever.

99
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,802

- Ow! Jesus! Yes. Isn't it always?

100

A little early for that, isn't it?

107

Oh<i>. Dialogical Exhaustion</i>

109
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,971
- The guy's a genius.
- What time is it?

110
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,847
9:15. There are, like,
10 prisons around here.

111
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:23,685
Death row's in the Ellis unit,
but they're moving it to the
Terrell unit end of the year.

112
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,954
The waitress's boyfriend works
there, but her last boyfriend
worked in the Huntsville unit.

113
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:32,259
The two before that in Walker.
The Estelle unit has the cutest guys.

114
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:36,392
And, I'm quoting, "My butt's too big
to get an Estelle guy."

115
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,032
Ellis is 15 minutes out of town,
so we've got five and a half hours.

116
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,043
Never eat in a place where the menus
have pictures of the food.

117
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,171
Maybe we should drive into Austin
and check out the crime scene.

118
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,807
That could be some great stuff
for our story, you know?

119
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,717
This isn't "our story."
It's not even a story.
It's an interview.

120
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,848
<i>Most importantly for you to remember...</i>
<i>it's my interview.</i>

00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,189
Okay. What do I do
for the next five hours?

122
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,094
Drive around. Look for
a decent restaurant.

123
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,497
You know, Bitsey,
your reputation...

124
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,332

128
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,643
- So, what can I get you, ma'am?
- Coffee. Just coffee.

129

00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,918
- Yes. Hello.
- Stemmons.

143
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,516
Stemmons. Sorry.
Won't happen again.

144
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,461
I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C.J.
Community relations.

145
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,556
He's usually
real good with names.

146
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,660
And these days, I always like to ask,
do you prefer Miss, Mrs. Or Ms.?

147
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,638
- Bitsey.
- Bitsey it is.

148
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,369
- Margie, I'm stealin' your guests.
- Okeydokey.

149
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,707
- Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
- Yes.

150
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,770
- On death row?
- No.

151
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,215
I.D.'s again, please.
All executions in the state of Texas...

152
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,377
occur over at
our Huntsville unit downtown...

153
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,944
but death row is here
for the time being.

154
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,856
This is home to all 442 offenders
prior to their date.

155
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,394
Average stay on row
is nine years.

156
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,124
Now, some get commuted,
but most get put to death.

157
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,598
- Earl. It'll put you off your supper,

158
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,897
But, then, it's supposed to.

159
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,165
<i>Carla, New York guests</i>
<i>for Mr. Gale.</i>

160
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,003
- Can I get your bags?
- We have three concerns here...

161
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,908
<i>- safety, safety and safety.</i>

162
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,914
<i>Visitation area's entirely secure. We</i>
<i>just ask that you don't touch the glass.</i>

163
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,643
- Windex gets expensive.
<i>- Oh, hey.</i>

164
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,710
<i>- You're not carrying a weapon,</i>
<i>are you, Bitsey?</i>

165
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,915
- Bitsey?
- Sorry. No.

166
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,892
- Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?
- No, sir.

167
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,757
<i>- Cell phone?</i>
<i>- They're not working. No service.</i>

168
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,854
Then you won't mind
leaving them here.

169
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,196
We also have rules against the carryin'
of large sums of cash...

170
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:06,329
- Thank you.
<i>- And the wearin' of open-toed shoes.</i>

171
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,067
<i>Those will do just fine.</i>
<i>You want to step on through now?</i>

172
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,132
<i>There you go. Mm-hmm.</i>

173
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,770
- Thank you, ma'am.
<i>- That's fine.</i>

174
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,277
- Open-toed shoes?
- Drives 'em crazy.

175
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,681
<i>Your turn, Mr. Stemmons.</i>
<i>Right on through there.</i>

176
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:25,213
Good, good. Now, should
anything unpleasant occur
in the visitation area...

177
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,282
we ask you to stay put.

178
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,419
And please, follow the instructions
of our fine correctional officers...

179
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,487
should they see fit
to give you any.

180
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:36,523
Bobby. Now, anything you say
can be overheard...

181
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,538
and any discussion of criminal
activity on your part is admissible.

182
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,040
You're not plannin' on
a jailbreak now, are you, Bitsey?

183
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,441
<i>- Uh, no.</i>
<i>- Well, rain seems to be holdin' off.</i>

184
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,608
You watch your step here, Bitsey girl.
This cement can get pretty slippery.

185
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:55,416
This is our Japanese garden.
Now, we ask you not
to throw coins in the pond.

186
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,118
Right this way.
Almost there.

187
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,993
Here we are.
This is our visitation area right here.

188
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,694
All yours, Mr. Belyeu.
Well, that's it for me.

189
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,534
- You folks have a safe visit. Bye now.
- Thank you.

190
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,541
- Ms. Bloom? Come right on in here
and make yourself comfortable.
<i>- Yes.</i>

191
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,544
<i>Did that P.R. Man</i>
<i>validate your parkin'?</i>

192
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:25,208
- He said the gift shop would do it.
- She's a smart one.

193
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,253
- Braxton Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.
- This is Zack Stemmons.

194
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,586
My good pleasure.
And right over here,
we have the man of the hour.

195
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,567
- Hello.
- Hello.

196
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,538
- Hi.
<i>- Sit down,</i>
<i>Gale. Prisoner will not stand.</i>

197
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,098
Now, why can't they
turn that thing down?

198
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,510
My lawyer respectfully requests
that you adjust the volume
on the speaker system.

199
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,573
Gale. Sit down.

200
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,785
They're practicing
being cruel and unusual.

201
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,385
Well, Ms. Bloom, I'm sure
you're bitin' at the bit.

202
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,795
It is our understanding that you
are to have three two-hour sessions...

203
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,892
<i>- today, tomorrow and Thursday.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,028
<i>All at 3:00 in the p.m.</i>

205
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,299
I'm sorry we can't
afford you more time...

206
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,035
but, contrary
to popular rumor...

207
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,135
<i>we have not yet begun to fight.</i>

208
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,703
<i>It is our understanding</i>
<i>that you will do this alone.</i>

209
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,977
- The magazine would
prefer that I'm here.
- Alone. Understood.

210
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:37,353
<i>It's also our understanding</i>
<i>that you will use no recording</i>
<i>equipment of any kind.</i>

211
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,550
<i>- Correct.</i>
<i>- Excellent.</i>

212
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,150
Now, I have a few papers for which
I need your Jo Ann Hancock.

213
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,459
So if you'd be kind enough
to stop by my Austin office
at your earliest convenience.

214
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,626
Thursday mornin', say?
Expenses and so forth.

215
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,908
Fine. Till Thursday then. Good luck,
Ms. Bloom. I'll stop by later.

216
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:04,108
Mr. Zack, what say you and me
partake of a death-defyin' cigarette...

217
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,118
in the visitors' parking lot?
Bye-bye, y'all.

218
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,319
- So.
- Please pull up a seat.

219
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:31,275
- He's quite a character.
- Yes. He's about the only
outside contact I have now.

220
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,972
- And a good friend.
- Where's your ex-wife?

221
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:39,882
I don't want you to ask me
questions about her or my son.

222
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,446
What I offer you is one thing,
but questions about them
are not part of our deal.

223
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,084
Okay. Anything else,
just say "Off the record."

224
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,687
I'll take it to my grave.
You can trust me on that.

225
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,199
- Does this count
as recording equipment?

226
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:01,497
- How do we start?
- We start with...

227
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,373
you telling me
what I'm doing here.

228
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,538
No one who looks through that glass
sees a person. They see a crime.

229
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,546
<i>I'm not David Gale.</i>
<i>I'm a murderer and a rapist...</i>

230
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,019
four days shy of his execution.

231
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,821
You're here because
I wanna be remembered
as much for how I led my life...

232
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,829
and the decisions that I made
as for how my life ended.

233
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,032
- Why me?
- Why not?

234
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,537
- You spent some time
behind bars yourself recently.
- I certainly have.

235
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,732
Because you do take things
to your grave.

236
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,243
Protecting sources,
even kiddie porn scum,
is the magazine policy...

237
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,302
<i>and mine.</i>

238
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,042
I know.
That's your reputation.

239
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,216
Well, I have a hard story
for you to tell, Ms. Bloom.

240
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,280
It's not going to be easy.

241
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,019
So where do we begin?

242
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,355
Well, I suppose I should
tell you how I became
the head of philosophy...

243
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,402
<i>at the University of Austin.</i>

244
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,638
<i>Come on. Think.</i>

245
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,373
<i>I want you to reach back into</i>
<i>those minds and tell me, tell us all...</i>

246
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:20,077
What is it that
you fantasize about?

247
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,916
World peace?
I thought so.

248
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:26,549
- Do you fantasize about
international fame?

249
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,619
Do you fantasize about
winning a Pulitzer Prize?

250
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,166
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

251
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,397
- An MTV Music Award?

252
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,965
Do you fantasize about meeting
some genius hunk, ostensibly bad...

253
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,408
but secretly simmering
with noble passion...

254
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,845
- and willing to sleep
on the wet spot?

255
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,816
- I'll take two! I'll take two!
- What was that?

256
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,875
Kimberly will take two.

257
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:59,822
You get Lacan's point.
Fantasies have to be unrealistic...

258
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,520
<i>because the moment... the second...</i>
<i>that you get what you seek...</i>

259
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,586
you don't...
you can't want it anymore.

260
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,462
<i>In order to continue to exist...</i>

261
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,993
desire must have its objects
perpetually absent.

262
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:17,201
It's not the "it" that you want.
It's the fantasy of"it."

263
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:22,213
- So, desire supports crazy fantasies.

264
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,010
Sorry.

265
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,849
This is what Pascal means when he says
that we are only truly happy...

266
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,189
<i>when daydreaming</i>
<i>about future happiness.</i>

267
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,752
- It came today.
<i>- Or why we say...</i>

268
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,957
<i>the hunt is sweeter</i>
<i>than the kill.</i>

269
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,560
Or be careful what you wish for,
not because you'll get it...

270
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,834
<i>but because you're doomed</i>
<i>not to want it once you do.</i>

271
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:52,707
So the lesson of Lacan is,
living by your wants
will never make you happy.

272
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:57,806
<i>What it means to be fully human is</i>
<i>to strive to live by ideas and ideals...</i>

273
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:03,014
and not to measure your life
by what you've attained
in terms of your desires...

274
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:07,422
but those small moments
of integrity, compassion...

275
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,155
<i>rationality, even self-sacrifice.</i>

276
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:16,565
Because in the end, the only way
that we can measure the
significance of our own lives...

277
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,103
is by valuing the lives of others.

278
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,510
All right.
I'll see you all on Monday.

279
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,295
Sorry about being late.

280
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,395
There was, you know, a thing.

281
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,765
Yeah, there usually is, Berlin.

282
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,374
Look, I know that
I'm not doin' too well.

283
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,172
And to torture a cliché...

284
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,112
I would do anything to pass.

285
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,357
- Anything, huh?
- Any... thing.

286
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,092
Okay, Berlin.

287
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,164
I will give you a good grade...

288
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,406
I will give you
a very, very good grade...

289
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:38,939
if you would just...

290
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,643
study.

291
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,325
The T.A. Finished transcribing
all the governor's radio and TV
comments. Listen to this gem.

293
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:01,566
Journalist: Governor, don't
you think three executions
in one week is excessive?

294
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,804
Governor: 'I say,
bring'em in, strap'em down
and let's rock and roll."'

295
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,937
It's good to hear that
our governor's in touch
with his inner frat boy.

296
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,209
- Tell me again why you're
not doing this debate.

297
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,116
- Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.
- Oh, I hadn't noticed.

298
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,053
- I know.
- No. I didn't mean that.

299
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,612
I've highlighted stuff.

300
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,729
He'll do the whole
"down home wisdom" thing...

301
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,597
capital punishment is God's law,
an eye for an eye.

302
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,935
Stick to arguments about rational facts.
And watch your ego.

303
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,099
Don't come across as one of those
"I hate authority...

304
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:41,612
'cause everyone around here
wears big hats and nobody
in charge reads <i>The New Yorker."</i>

305
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,581
- Anything else?
- I'm getting new federal stats
from Amnesty tonight.

306
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,879
Well, bring them by Greer's party.

307
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,147
I have papers to grade.

308
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,384
- And if you have
a hangover tomorrow...
- I'm walkin' away.

309
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:56,257
- 10:00! Bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.
- Bushy-tailed.

310
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,435
Hey, Jamie. Did you
mark your calendar yet?

311
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,502
Yep, I sure did.

312
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,879
One, two, three, four more days
until Mom comes home.

313
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,943
Only four more days?
That's great news.

314
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,354
Can I ask you something?
It's really, really important.

315
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,916
- Of course you can.
- Can we have pancakes for breakfast?

316
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,088
Okay.

317
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,600
- With syrup and strawberries?
- Well, we'll have to see.

318
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:42,072
- And chocolate shavers?
No, no. It's chocolate <i>shavings.</i>

319
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,938
- And whipped cream?
- Whipped cream?

320
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,877
That's a lot of requests
for one little boy.

321
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,279
- Why don't you go to sleep?
- Do Cloud Dog too.

322
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,579
Okay. Good night,
Cloud Dog.

323
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,246
There you go.
You go to sleep.

324
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:01,991
Good night.
Don't forget to feed the fish.

325
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,257
- What?
<i>- Don't forget to feed the fish.</i>

326
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,798
- Okay.

327
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,897
Jo Edna, I'll be back before midnight.
Here's the phone number to reach me.

328
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,065
There's chicken and stuff in
the refrigerator if you want some.

329
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:20,100
That's fine, Mr. Gale. Maybe I'll
fix myself something later. Bye.

330
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,203
Bye.

331
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,956
<i>- Dad, did you feed the fish?</i>
- Yes, I did. Now go to sleep.

332

- He's the Immanuel Kant of the NFL.

335
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,364
He's consistent,
he's accurate, he's effective.

336
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,309
And let's not forget...
boring. He is boring.

337
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,972
If you want boring, read
William Bennett's <i>The Book of Virtues.</i>

338
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,038
I'm still asleep.
Someone wake me up.

339
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,449
- Professor Gale.
Where's your better half?
- John, how are you?

340
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,784
Better half? Oh, my wife.
Um, she's in Spain.

341
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,949
Again? I am sorry.

342
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,220
John, have you seen Alma?
She's been looking for you.

343
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,354
So my wife's affair is
just this big open secret.

344
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,694
Uh, hermeneutical bias.

345
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,326
The only fun truths are
the ones someone's trying to hide.

346
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:21,099
She's been to Barcelona four
times this year. I don't think
she's trying to hide anything.

347
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,265
Well, her father
is the ambassador.

348
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:26,174
Yeah, except the embassy's
in Madrid.

349
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,474
Ah. Oh, by the way,
Berlin's here...

350
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,741
and, uh, pretty livid.

351
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,806
- Why?
- We've expelled her.

352
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,115
She got the letter today and
took the opportunity to throw
a little fit in my office.

353
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:40,021
- Talkin' about me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact,
we were.

354
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,082
Did he tell you that I said,
when you were circumcised...

355
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,685
they threw away the wrong part?

356
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,926
Yes. I believe he mentioned it.
It's called schmuck.

357
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,968
- What?
- The part of the foreskin
they throw away...

358
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,197
after circumcision,
I think it's called schmuck.

359
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,035
- Aren't we so fucking clever?
- I think perhaps I shall get another.

360
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,098
- David?
- Black Bush.

361
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,974
You were a jerk this afternoon.

362
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,913
Well, for what it's worth,
I didn't know about
the expulsion till just now.

363
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,007
Is that supposed to be an apology?

364
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:10,953
No. It's more like a... conciliation.

365

There once was a lesbian
from Cancun...

376
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,013
- Oh, get dirty!
- Who took a young man up to her room...

377
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,017
where they argued all night
as to who had the right...

378
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,282
to do what and how much
and to whom.

379
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,823
Enough. Enough.

380
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,327
- Ross! Ross!

<i>- I have no more.!</i>

383
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,593
I'm not a student anymore.

384
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,871
I do not think
I wanna know what that means.

385
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,543
There once was a girl
named Berlin...

386
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,274
who liked a bit
now and again.

387

- Oh, yeah. Very cute.

391
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,220

Let's say we found
an innocent on death row.
What would change?

419
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,016
After the retrial, the governor
would simply go on TV...

420
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:18,085
and say, "See? Thanks to the good people
at DeathWatch, the system works."

421
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,790
Sure, if we had absolute proof
that he had executed an innocent...

422
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,062
we could demand a moratorium,
like in Illinois.

00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,660
- Are you okay?
- Sorry. Yeah.

424
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,468
But that won't happen.
The dead men can't make a case...

425
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,100
- and almost-martyrs don't count.
- Got it.

426
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,407
- So, keep it rational. And stop that.
- Mm-hmm.

427
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,449
- What?
- Active listening.
I hate active listeners.

428
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,781
I feel like they're too busy
pretending to listen to
actually hear what I'm saying.

429
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,287
I can listen and actively listen
at the same time.

430
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,687
- I'm good at that.
- Did you bring the Amnesty stats?

431
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,556
Yes. No. Oh!
I left them at home.

432
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,820

433
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,434

- Nothing.

434
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,498
Everything.

435
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,344
Something profoundly
stupid happened last night.

436
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:14,078
I hope you used a condom.

437
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,578
Oh. Jesus Christ, David.

438
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,555
- Was she one of yours?
- It was Berlin.

439
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:29,464
Oh, great!

440
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,833
Oh, that's great.
I can hear the grapevine now.

441
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,271
"They had to suspend her so that Gale
could dick her with a clear conscience."

442
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,501
A power differential equals coercion.
That is great.

443
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,511
- You're so weak.
- You're not my wife, Constance.
Thank God.

444
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,605
Well, don't worry.
It's not a position
I aspire to, so fuck you.

445
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,345
- I didn't mean it that way.
Are you okay?
- Let's go. Yes!

446
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,819
- Really?
- Yes. Let's go.

447
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,651
There are
17,000 murders a year
in the United States.

448
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,160
<i>Ten of the 12 states</i>
<i>that have abolished</i>
<i>the death penalty...</i>

449
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,789
they have a murder rate that's
lower than the national average.

450
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,698
And if he starts with
the religious stuff, just say that...

451
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,932
nearly every denomination
in the United States
opposes the death penalty.

452
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,996
- Are you listening? Okay.
- Yes.

453
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,518
- All right.
Ten seconds, everybody.
<i>- Roll tape, please.</i>

454
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,649
Count 'em in, Mack.

455
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,720
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Five, four...</i>

456
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:40,230
<i>Welcome back to</i> Batter's Box.
<i>We continue our very special</i>
<i>four-part program...</i>

457
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,467
<i>with Governor Hardin, and</i>
<i>arguing capital punishment with him...</i>

458
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:47,204
is DeathWatch regional codirector,
Professor David Gale.

459
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,679
- You are up, Governor.
- You know, Alan,
I always say the same thing...

460
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,148
and I'm gonna keep on sayin' it...
I hate killin'...

461
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,378
and my administration
will kill to stop it.

462
00:35:55,453 --> 00:36:00,584
- How about it?
- Murderers are not deterred
by the thought of execution.

463
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,649
They're just not,
and you know it.

464
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,161
Every single study that's
been done on this subject...
and there's been over 200...

465
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,289
and you've read them...
has reached the same conclusion.
They all say the same thing.

466
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,357
Well, maybe you should
read your Bible.

467
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:14,165
Deuteronomy 19:21.
An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

468
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,604
What did Gandhi say about that?

469
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,610
"The old law of an eye for an eye
leaves us all blind."

470
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,408
Well, I'm sorry...
and with respect...
that's fuzzy liberal thinking.

471
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,949
<i>- You really believe that, Governor?</i>
- Of course.

472
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,180
That's interesting. 'Cause you
said that yourself in a speech
in your first campaign.

473
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,620
<i>He got... He got you there,</i>
<i>Governor. How about it?</i>

474
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,523
Yes, he did.
Yes, he did.

475
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,458
If you're not a liberal at 30,
you've got no heart.

476
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,792
And if you're still a liberal at 40,
you've got no brain.

477
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,230
- That's Winston Churchill.
- Touché.

478
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,860
So what you're essentially
saying and what you feel is...

479
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,700
and this is to choose another quote...
"that a healthy society...

480
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:52,106
must stop at nothing
to cleanse itself of evil."

481
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,539
Uh, yes. Uh...
I'd have to agree.

482
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,640
- Did I say that too?
- Oh, no, sir. That was Hitler.

483
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,083
<i> Ooh.</i>

484
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,280
Oh!

485
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,621
Can't we just admit that
the capital punishment system
in this country is not working?

486
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,959
We are condemning people to death
based on phony expert testimony...

487
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,624
on junk science,
on-on jail house snitches...

488
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,330
<i>Alan, did you know that Texas</i>
<i>has the highest per capita</i>
<i>incarceration rate in the world?</i>

489
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,396
- Forty-three people
that you executed...
- Alan, could I...

490
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:28,070
were represented by lawyers who were
at one time disbarred or sanctioned.

491
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,375
There are two men on death row
right now, on this day...

492
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:34,782
- whose lawyers fell asleep
during cross-examination.
- I'm not a lawyer.

493
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,150
And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
ruled that that was not...

494
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,519
that was not a basis for a retrial.

495
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,423
Governor, that's just a flawed,
insane, crazy system.

496
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,189
And a flawed system
will kill innocent men.

497
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,391
Okay, all right.
Let him answer.

498
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,094
All right, Mr. Gale,
we'll play your game. Name one.

499
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:54,763
Name one innocent man that Texas
has put to death during my tenure...

500
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,103
of the hundred or so executions...

501
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,472
It's 131, Governor,
in case you lost count.

502
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,171
- Let him finish.
<i>- Fine. Thank you. Whatever.</i>

503
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,477
Just give me a name...
I'm gonna write it down...

504
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,040
<i>a man that you can prove</i>
<i>was innocent...</i>

505
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,485
- There you go.

506
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,545
And I'll call a moratorium.

507
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,449
Mr. Gale.

508
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,787
- Are we through here, Alan?
<i>- You know what?</i>
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

509
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:24,824
I'd like to thank my guests,
Governor Hardin and Professor
David Gale from DeathWatch.

510
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,668
- Roll credits.
<i>- Thank you for joining me today.</i>
<i>Hope you will join me tomorrow.</i>

511
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,266
<i>Your exact words were...</i>

512
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,335
<i>"Just tell me when my ego's</i>
<i>getting in the way of the work. "</i>

513
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,643
<i>I'm telling you, your ego's</i>
<i>getting in the way of the work.</i>

514
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,706
I didn't wanna do this
in the first place.

515
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,345
You put up two seconds of
protest at the thought of
being on a televised debate.

516
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,548
- What does that mean?
- It means that DeathWatch
suffers because...

517
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,751
you're so anxious to finger authority,
to publicly prove that David Gale...

518
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,351
is so much fucking smarter
than the powers that be!

519
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:55,160
Learn to work without
an audience. Try squeezing
money from the donor list.

520
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,223
Have you licked one single
mail-out envelope?

521
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,202
- Mr. Gale?
- Hey, guys, the governor went that way.

522
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,501
Ramirez... Austin Police.
This is Officer Hasermann.

523
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,598
What, is debating the governor
a crime now?

524
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,441
No, sir. Rape is.

525
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,249
- Berlin had my bite marks.
- Gale! Time's up.

526
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:24,021
Bruises. Her clothes were ripped.
My skin was found under her fingernails.

527
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,962
I mean, it didn't look like anything
but rape. Then she drops the charges...

528
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,192
and leaves town, making
it look like I was guilty...

529
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,928
and she was too traumatized
to face a trial.

530
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,903
My wife had to read
all about this while she was
sitting in the airport...

531
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,805
wondering where I was,
why I wasn't there to pick her up.

532
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,070
It took me almost two weeks
to get bailed out.

533
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,135
- And the grad student Berlin?

534
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,376
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>she did it?</i>

535
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,408
Poke her finger at authority,
show the powers that be
how much smarter she was.

536
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,149
Grad student's revenge.
I don't really know.

537
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,214
- Do you know where I can find her?
- No.

538
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,385
First year I was in here,
I got a postcard from San Francisco.

539
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,420
<i>It was signed, "From the student</i>
<i>who would do anything. "</i>

540
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,933
Did she say anything else?

541
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,561
"I'm sorrier than you can know."

542
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,935
<i>- Move it, Gale.</i>
- I'm running out of time.

543
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,611
<i>Can you imagine his wife letting</i>
<i>him stew in jail for two weeks?</i>

544
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:23,551
Who can blame her? We'll get
an address for the Berlin girl
from the university.

545
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,612
You still don't think
he's telling the truth.

546
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,089
- On the Berlin rap?
- On the whole rap.

547
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,526
Who knows? Anyway,
there is no truth, only perspectives.

548
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,224
If you say there's no truth,
you're claiming
it's true there's no truth.

549
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:39,395
- It's a logical contradiction.
- Working on our Philosophy
Merit Badge, are we?

550
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,166
When it comes to rape,
an accusation's as good
as a conviction.

551
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,208
- It sticks like shit.
- That's an appetizing metaphor.

552
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,302
Technically, a simile.
I think he's telling the truth.

553
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,438
This you know from sitting
in a prison lobby?

554
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,780
- It's just my perspective.
- Three different courts
found him guilty, Zack.

555
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,343
That's enough perspective for me.

556
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,251
Okay, okay, okay.

557
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,687
1-33-0-what?

558
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,951
Seven.

559
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,483
Thirty-three... oh-three.

560
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,656
3305. 3307.
Right there.

561
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,331
Geez. Look at the sign.

562
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:04,379
<i>¶ The stranger in your life ¶</i>
- Hi.

563
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,253
- I'm Bitsey Bloom.
This is Zack Stemmons.

564
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,724
- We're... Uh, yeah.
- You want the tour?

565
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,921
There's a $20 mandatory
donation... apiece.

566
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,125
<i>But you get</i>
<i>a reenactment photo pack,</i>
<i>and it's got five pictures.</i>

567
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,033
- Okay.
- I gotta collect first.

568
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,129
Oh, sure. I got it.

569
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:29,112
Go sign the book.
It doesn't have to be
your real name though.

570
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,080
The first page just says
you're here to do research
on violent crime.

571
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,242
The state requires it
for nonprofit shit.

572
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,483
Take a reenactment
photo pack.

573
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,524
Uh, if you guys could share one,
it'd be really cool...

574
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,957
'cause the fuckers that
do my prints jerk my chain.

575
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,053
That's me.
My boyfriend took it.

576
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,622
We also got a video.
It's 50 bucks 'cause you
can see my tits.

577
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,760
There's a version
without tits. It's 35.

578
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:57,466
- Do many people take the tour?
- Not so much anymore.

579
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,669
We thought this'd be, like,
a busy week with Gale getting
the prune juice and all.

580
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,304
So you... you don't mind
living here?

581
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,508
It's better than livin'
with my dick-wad parents.

582
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,111
It starts over here.
She let him crash here sometimes.

583
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,781
<i>He was, like,</i>
<i>constantly wasted.</i>

584
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,984
Exhibit one.
He drank scotch religiously.

585
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,688
- The rest is in the kitchen.

586
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,791
<i>Here's number two.</i>
<i>This is where the tripod was.</i>

587
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,837
My boyfriend borrowed the one
we usually show to folks.

588
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:31,705
They never found a camera
or photos or video or anything.

589
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,868
Gale must have buried them.

590
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,971
These serial killer dudes
take photos to whack off to later.

591
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:41,677
He-He's not exactly
a serial killer.

592
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,550
Whatever.

593
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,147
<i>She was, like,</i>
<i>totally naked right here.</i>

594
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,818
The meter man saw her
through the door.

595
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,657
Gale handcuffed her,
taped her mouth...

596
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,857
<i>and then taped a bag over</i>
<i>her head so she couldn't breathe.</i>

597
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,901
He used those housewife gloves
so he wouldn't leave prints.

598
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,232
They found sticky stuff
from the tape on them.

599
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,468
- Uh! We ask folks
not to touch the exhibit.
- Right.

600
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,669
<i>Totally sick part</i>
<i>is where they found</i>
<i>the key to the handcuffs.</i>

601
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:12,307
- Yeah. We know.
- Wait. What? Where was it?

602
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:18,185
It was in her stomach, dude.
Gale made her swallow it
before he bagged her.

603
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,849
<i>That's pretty much</i>
<i>the highlights.</i>

604
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,083
<i>Got questions?</i>

605
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,493
I can still smell
the cigarette smoke.

606
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,700
It's the barbecue.

607
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:42,678
Can you imagine?
The key was in her stomach.

608
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,182
That's so fucking cold, man.

609
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,587
<i>- Zack?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

610
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,521
Isn't that the cowboy
from the rest area?

611
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,960
- The same truck.
- Weird coincidence, huh?

612
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,328
Well, coincidences
are always weird.

613
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,368
That's why
they are coincidences.

614
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,270
<i>Off the record.</i>

615
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:15,202
Okay. We're off.

616
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,304
Constance
was murdered...

617
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,646
by what's known as
the Securitat method.

618
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,209
You're handcuffed,
forced to swallow the key.

619
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,653
is sealed around your head...

620
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,714
and you're left there
to suffocate.

621
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,783
The Securitat did it to Romanians
when they wouldn't inform or confess.

622
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:34,126
Sometimes the bag was ripped off
your head at the last moment
to give you a second chance.

623
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:38,191
Otherwise, you died knowing
that the key to your freedom...

624
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,828
was inside of you
the entire time.

625
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,134
<i>It's a cheap</i>
<i>but effective method.</i>

626
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,334
The problem is...

627
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:51,036
I once mentioned it
in an article that I wrote.

628
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,007
Prosecution never knew that.

629
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,582
- Someone's framing you?
- Oh, it's more than that.

630
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,525
- There was a tripod.
- Right.

631
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,364
Facing her body.
We back on the record?

632
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:13,165
Yes. The tripod
had no fingerprints on it.

633
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,296
That means that
somebody brought it there...

634
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:19,365
set it up,
wiped it clean and left it.

635
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:24,437
Why? It's as if they wanted me
to know that somewhere out there...

636
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,484
is a record of exactly
what happened that afternoon...

637
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:31,385
as if they wanted me to die knowing
that the key to my freedom...

638
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,480
is out there somewhere.

639
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,049
Maybe you're being paranoid.

640
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:41,154
Miss Bloom, I used to be the state's
leading death penalty abolitionist...

641
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,324
and now I'm on death row.

642
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,597
<i>Doesn't that strike you</i>
<i>as a little odd?</i>

643
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,662
Any idea who "they" are?

644
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,369
No, but I've got someone
working on that...

645
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,741
someone I'm relying on
to prove my innocence.

646
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,906
Belyeu's hired a detective?

647
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,510
A journalist.

648
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,576
She has to help me.

649
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,252
- You know I'm innocent.
- No.

650
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,861
- No, I don't.

651
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,936
Wear me like a fur, Daddy.
Wear me like a fur.

652
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,242
Okay. Who's your hero?
Who's your... Ow! Ow!
You go get Cloud Dog.

653
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,647
Hey! Cloud Dog!

654
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,380
Call me when you land.

655
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,687
- Has any couple ever survived
a trial separation?
- Don't.

656
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,091
Isn't separating contrary
to the whole idea of trying
to work things out?

657
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,959
<i>- Don't.</i>
- Boo!

658
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,590
Jamie, get in, sweetie.

659
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:54,436
- See ya later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile.

660
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:58,907
- Take it easy, "Japaneesee."
- Okeydokey, "artichokee."

661
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,967
<i>Scoot.</i>

662
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,407
- Listen...
- I sent you an E-mail.

663
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:11,178
- An E-mail.
- Just read it.

664
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,215
<i>Jamie.</i>

665
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,423
<i>- Come on, sweetie.</i>

666
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:04,002
Just read it.

667
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,352
<i>You could at least hide the bottle.</i>

668
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,728
Well?

669
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,127
Officially, you're on sabbatical.

670
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,468
<i>Unofficially,</i>
<i>they want you out of here.</i>

671
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,137
It was 4-2.

672
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,740
How did Ross vote?

673
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,546
I'm not supposed to dis...

674
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,480
Against you.

675
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,325
And you?

676
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,892
For you...

677
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,396
and against my politics.

678
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,300
<i>- Yes. Mada...</i>

679
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,277
- No. M... Please, please.

680
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:52,440
Madam<i>. Atenc...</i>
<i>¡Atención.! Attenzione.!</i>

681
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,610
Uh, I am...
My name is David Gale.

682
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:59,746
I have phoned before.
Yes? Yes?

683
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,791
- Can...

684
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,055
No. Uh<i>... Por favor.</i>

685
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:12,599
What? No, never mind.
Can you please get Sharon Gale?

686
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:16,127
<i>- Ah.! Señora Gale.</i>
- Ah! Yes. Miss Gale. Yes.

687
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:29,743
- Hello? Hello?

688
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,829
So I... I wanted to hear
your feedback on the idea.

689
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:52,307
Look, Professor Gale, I could sit here...
as I'm sure others have...

690
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:57,142
and plead departmental cutbacks,
claim you need more publications...

691
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,615
I need a minority... whatever.

692
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,812
All bull <i>geschichte.</i>

693
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:08,290
Your record's brilliant.
You're an original voice,
worth in today's...

694
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:11,555
"scarcity defines value capitalist
system under which we toil..."

695
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,528
your weight in gold.

696
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:17,158
Hell, it's... It's not even
your alcohol problem.

697
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:21,967
It'd be nice to have a faculty member
whose crutch wasn't Prozac.

698
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,735
But to speak plain,
if I were to hire you...

699
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:31,111
in the eyes of the regents,
the alumni and every freshman
with an ear for gossip...

700
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,172
I'd be hiring a rapist.

701
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,880
- Those charges were dropped.
- People would say
you had a good lawyer.

702
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:42,220
- I was innocent.
- You don't get it, do you?

703
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,852
You're not politically correct,
Dr. Gale.

704
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,897
Welcome to the club.

705
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:54,263
- Socrates is...
is sentenced to death.

706
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:58,398
Socrates is sentenced to death.
I bet you didn't know that.
He was sentenced to death.

707
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:02,343
But Athenian law... Athenian law
let the condemned...

708
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,609
- come up with their own
alternate punishment.

709
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,982
Isn't that a great idea?
So where are the Athenians
when you really need 'em?

710
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,656
So anyway, Socrates...
And he was ugly.

711
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,784
- Did I mention that? Did I
mention that Socrates was ugly?

712
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,955
He was ugly.
Socrates was ugly, Plato was fat...

713
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,127
and, uh, and Aristotle
was a prissy dresser.

714
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,899
So anyway, Socrates
comes up with this idea.

715
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:33,306
He says... He says, "Well, what if
I pay a fine instead of death?"

716
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,039
He suggests a fine.
All he has to do in order to live...

717
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:41,106
is to come up with
an appropriately punitive figure.

718
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,175
Punitive figure.

719
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:46,450
Guess what he suggested?
Thirty bucks.

720
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:51,955
Thirty bucks?
Does that make any sense?

721
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:55,464
Thirty bucks. That's 30 mina.
That was the currency
of the day... a mina.

722
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,126
Well, it's minae.
Minae. That's the plural.

723
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,192
Minae.

724
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,730
Thirty bucks!
Thirty pieces of silver.

725
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:08,608
And the judges are so pissed that
more of them voted to kill him...

726
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:10,669
than had voted him guilty
in the first place.

727
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,682
That just doesn't make any sense.

728
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,014
Thirty pieces of silver.

729
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,852
Just like the Judas guy,
the Jesus kisser...

730
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,857
who was also a prissy dresser.

731
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:08,329
Without a successful completion
of an alcohol-treatment program...

732
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,703
you can forget visitation.

733
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,174
You'll be lucky
to get a Christmas card.

734
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,234
That's if there even is
a custody hearing.

735
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:21,574
- What does that mean?
- If your wife convinces
a Spanish court...

736
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:25,917
that you're a danger to the child,
then you'll never see him again.

737
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,958
He just has to come home.
He's gotta come back.

738
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,084
Hey, Pete, can we have
another round here.

739
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,831
I'm fine.

740
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,597
- I just have to go get him then.
- Europe's not Mexico, David.

741
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:46,267
They got real borders over there.
You might be able to get yourself
in easy enough...

742
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,937
but getting out
with a six-year-old...

743
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,277
That's a whole different
kettle of crawdads.

744
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,080
<i>Then you get your life together.</i>

745
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,519
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Pronto.

746
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,530
Who wants to start?

747
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:24,012
Hi. My name is David, and...

748
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,048
I am an alcoholic.

749
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,107
Hi, David.

750
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:37,552
So, Mr. Gale...

751
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:40,289
tell me three
personal qualities...

752
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,490
that you feel you have...

753
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,931
that would make you
a successful Radio Shed manager.

754
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,963
- Three.
- Three.

755
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,943
Okay. Well...

756
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,875
No, I'm sorry.

757
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,944
I'm...

758
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,013
Oh, I'm sorry.

759
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,024
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

760
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,118
- You look good.
- I feel good.

761
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:50,496
Look, there's somethin'
that you gotta see.

762
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,797
Betty Sue Johnson's
been rescheduled.

763
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,860
Her execution date
is set for the eighth.

764
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,929
I have a conference call
with Washington tonight.

765
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,997
If the new national director
will commit to emergency funds...

766
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,441
So Betty Sue gets commuted,
and you only prove the system works.

767
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,502
But I'll save a life.

768
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,571
Hey, where'd you
get that bruise?

769
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,173
Oh, just... doin' chores.

770
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,778
- Is your cowboy gettin' rough with you?
- Ha ha.

771
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:17,390
Oh, there he is.
Hey, Dusty...

772
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,395
does she ever invite you overand not put you to work?

773
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,432
Hey, David.

774
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,559
All right.
Tell me her story.

775
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:29,002
She was sentenced at 17.
I really wanna get behind this one.

776
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,939
- She's so articulate.
- Who did she kill?

777
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,342
- She'll put a face
on the death penalty.
- Constance, who did she kill?

778
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:40,007
- A cop.
- Oh, you're crazy.

779
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:43,246
Not just your medium-range
"thinks she's Roosevelt's bathrobe,"

780
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,483
<i>but I mean stark-raving, screws-loose,</i>
<i>in-the-belfry insane.</i>

781
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:51,960
Seventeen... four years before
she could legally drink a beer.

782
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,087
But she killed a cop, Constance.

783
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,326
- Are you gonna help?
- Of course.

784
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,493
Oh. You're burnin' up.

785
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,904
Jo Edna.

786
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,439
- Hi, Mr. Gale.
- How are you, Jo Edna?
It's good to see...

787
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,129
- Caffeine jolt. We deliver.
<i>- Howdy, David.</i>

788
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,691
- Howdy, folks.
- Oh, my, this is service.

789
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,330
- Thank you.
- Gladly. Latte on the left
there for you, Josh.

790
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,397
- Mocha.
- Ooh, thanks.

791
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:43,309
- She's on the phone to Washington.
<i>- The new national director.</i>

792
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,246
- Uh-huh. That's right.

793
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,910
I'm sure we can get some pulpit time.
Maybe some cable.

794
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,510
<i>Cable's good.</i>
<i>Listen, I need to run.</i>

795
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,989
<i>For now, I agree the first</i>
<i>press release should focus</i>
<i>on the woman's youth.</i>

796
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,686
I'll have the Washington people
look into counsel competency...

797
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,785
<i>though I'm almost sure</i>
<i>she's exhausted this on appeal.</i>

798
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,456
- Let's see what
kind of resources these...
- Uh... John, David's gonna go...

799
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:06,093
Oh, I almost forgot.
Gale's not around, is he?

800
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,332
- No.
<i>- Good. Keep it that way.</i>

801
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,339
<i>His relationship</i>
<i>with DeathWatch is over.</i>

802
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,376
<i>- Last thing we need is</i>
<i>this rape thing coming back...</i>
- John.

803
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,413
<i>To bite us on the butt,</i>
<i>and these guys don't stay</i>
<i>on the wagon for very long.</i>

804
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,745
<i>- John.</i>
<i>- I'm serious, Constance.</i>
<i>Ban him from the premises.</i>

805
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,614
<i>I realize the two of you both...</i>

806
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,886
- David!

807
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:51,746
<i>Sharon, pick up the phone.</i>
<i>I'm begging you.!</i>

808
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,910
He's my son, all right?
He's my son too,
and I wanna talk to him.

809
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,453
- You've not let... Hello?

810
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:03,823
Jamie? Jamie, is that you?
Hey. Hey, little moose.
How are you?

811
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,555
I miss you so much.
It's Daddy.

812
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:10,429
Yeah. Hello. Don't...
Jamie, wait.

813
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,094
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up the phone.

814
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,763
Goddamn it! Damn!

815
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,398
God... damn it!

816
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,344
Ow! Fuck!

817
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,698
- Oh, you scared me.

818
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:22,067
My sheep needs a manager...
a manger.

819
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,333
My sheep needs a manger.

820
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,400
Are you okay?

821
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:33,039
I fell off the wagon
and I hurt myself.

822
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,209
Come on.
Come on inside.

823
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:44,959
Do you know why Saint Jude
is the patron saint of lost causes?

824
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,928
'Cause his real name was Judas.

825
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:51,125
<i>Judas. There were</i>
<i>two Judases...</i>

826
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,432
<i>Judas, who was the saint guy,</i>
<i>and then the other one...</i>

827
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,769
<i>Judas, who was the bad one.</i>

828
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,776
He's the one that ratted out Jesus
and tried to kiss him.

829
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,438
In medieval times, they would
never pray to the good Judas...

830
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,915
for fear of getting the bad Judas
on the line just by mistake.

831
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:13,923
Ergo, they never really gave him
business unless absolutely desperate.

832
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,858
That's why... And then they
changed his name.

833
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:21,158
Your mail is blowing.

834
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,189
Constance.

835
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,363
Hey! Hey!

836
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,533
Hey! Oh, shit!

837
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,782
- Are you the doctor?
What's wrong with her?
- Yes.

838
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,842
- She's gonna be fine.
- How do you know?
You haven't looked at her.

839
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,912
- Just calm down.
- She just collapsed. She was
opening her mail and just fell.

840
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,980
- Please have a seat
in the waiting room.
- I don't know what's wrong.

841
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,390
- Please. Is there a doctor...
- She's gonna be fine.

842
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,394
- Wait here. Professor!
- I have to go with her.

843
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:56,124
You wanna get arrested again?

844
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,798
- How do you know who I am?
- I watch the news.

845
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,237
Now go wait.

846
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,030
Ah!

847
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:41,099
- How are we doing?
- Fine. How's Constance?

848
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:46,012
Sleeping. Mr. Gale, a leukemia
patient's condition...

849
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:49,381
- is highly susceptible
to external stress.
- What? What?

850
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:53,445
Constance's illness
requires a degree of regularity.

851
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,286
Constance has leukemia?

852
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:03,924
You didn't know?

853
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,298
Wait. Wait.

854
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:13,073
No, I didn't.

855
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,048
It's funny how selfish
we can be, isn't it?

856
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,658
When I first heard Constance
was dying, I was so mad at her.

857
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,221
<i>I thought, "How can you</i>
<i>do this to me?</i>

858
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,494
You know how hard it is
for me to need other people."

859
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,502
Why hadn't she told you?

860
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,830
She said she was too busy.

861
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,704
<i>I guess, since death</i>
<i>was chasing her...</i>

862
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,647
she just wanted
to help other people avoid it.

863
01:05:55,284 --> 01:06:00,244
That's what she did with her life.

864
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,659
Constance...

865
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,720
left this world a better place
than she found it.

866
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:15,166
It's a small...
but difficult thing.

867
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:45,463
- Good shot! Good shot!

868
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,469
- Geez.
- Let's go.

869
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,880
- So, what'd you get?
- I talked to the Austin prosecutor.

870
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,749
Belyeu's a joke. Actually,
the exact phrase he used was...

871
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,811
"Big hat, no cattle."

872
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:10,381
- He was sanctioned twice.
Fucked up the penalty phase.
- What?

873
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:13,292
Gale could've got life
on mitigating factors.

874
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:17,093
And despite major pro bono
offers from some of the top
lawyers in the country...

875
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,157
Gale stuck with him all through
the appeals process...

876
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:22,068
which, by the way,
Belyeu continued to screw up.

877
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:25,164
So Belyeu's a joke.

878
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,937
Great.

879
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,069
<i>- Anything else?</i>
- Nothing on Berlin.

880
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,307
Oh, we pick up the payola money
in Houston tonight.

881
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,544
- Houston?
- That's what the head office said.

882
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:39,145
- Overheat light
came on twice. Um...
- Come on.

883
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:05,637
- Ah!

884
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:08,740
Oh, man! I never knew a million bucks
could weigh so much.

885
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,446
- Half a million.
- Well, it's still heavy.

886
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,511
But a million sounds
better for our st...

887
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,319
Excuse me. Your story.
A million bucks.

888
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,587
No, no. Wait.
A million bucks in cash.

889
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,892
Just relax, Zack.
It's only money.

890
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,164
So, you comin' in?

891
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:36,708
- Excuse me?
- You wanna come in?

892
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,408
- Please.
- I thought you were
into guys with money.

893
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:49,115
- Zack? It's open.
<i>- What?</i>

894
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,955
- Well, maybe the maid forgot.

895
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,724
- Look.

896
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,430
Well...
We gotta call somebody.

897
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,435
Wait.

898
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,124
- What is that?
- I don't know.

899
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,834
This is not good.

900
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,023
- I'm gonna
check the bathroom.
- No, no. Bitsey, no.

901
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,085
You wait there.

902
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,969
- Bitsey!
- What? Zack,
There could've been prints.

903
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,029
Look.

904
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,152
The lady at reception says
that no one asked for you.
All the room keys are different.

905
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:08,594
- Just she and her husband have masters.
- What'd you tell her?

906
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:12,122
- That you have
a jealous boyfriend.
- Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?

907
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,534
She didn't ask. I think
she assumed it had something
to do with why he was jealous.

908
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,936
- You sure we shouldn't
call the cops?
- No.

909
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,498
Anyway, whoever got in here
without a key in broad daylight...

910
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,567
was probably smart enough
not to leave prints.

911
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:25,443
I have the remote. Here.

912
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:28,278
- Are you sure you wanna see
what's on here?
- No.

913
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,044
- Try three.
- Three.

914
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,919
I hope this isn't
what I think it is.

915
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,428
Oh, my God.

916
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:49,493
- Is it her?
<i>- Yeah, it's her.</i>

917
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,846
<i>- Oh, man.</i>

918
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,611
<i>Geez.</i>

919
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,892
Belyeu said to bring the tape
first thing tomorrow.

920
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,628
He also said you were right
about not calling the police.

921
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,694
You gonna be all right?

922
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,802
No.

923
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:25,329
He deserves it though, probably.
There's a lot of sick people
in this world.

924
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,392
And if they done wrong
and they're found guilty...

925
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,937
All right. Let's just say
Gale's telling the truth.

926
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:33,168
Maybe some right-wing fuck set him up,
arranged the perfect murder.

927
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,939
Why would you send
a magazine journalist proof
a few hours before you've won?

928
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:41,005
- It does not make sense.
- No. It's perfect.

929
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,416
Whoever this is knows how
hard it is to get a retrial in Texas.

930
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:48,422
They know the magazine can't
give this any substantial play
before the execution.

931
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:52,221
We'd have to give it to a daily
or a network. That won't happen.

932
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:56,890
- But mostly, they know
I'll tell Gale today.
- So?

933
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:02,303
What if Constance's murder was
just a means of getting at Gale...

934
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,534
not only to get rid of him,
but to make abolishionists look crazy?

935
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,837
Of course he sympathizes
with murderers. He is one.

936
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,936
They make sure he sits
six years on death row...

937
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,709
for a brutal rape and murder,
then they let him die...

938
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,546
die knowing everyone will
remember him with disgust.

939
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,916
They destroy his life,
his work, his memory...

940
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:23,549
- and they make him watch.
- That's a lot of hate.

941
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:29,557
- Well, then why release it?
- Hate's no fun if you
keep it to yourself.

942
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,616
<i>Whoa. We got company.</i>

943
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,153
- The cowboy?
- Mm-hmm.

944
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,951
And doing a lousy job
of hiding.

945
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,449
Oh, he must think
we're idiots.

946
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,155
<i>- Is he gaining?</i>
<i>- No. He's just sitting back there.</i>

947
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,824
Get a license plate number.

948
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:09,970
- Ohh. He's turned off.
- God, I'm sorry.

949
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,734
What does this guy want?

950
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,981
<i>Fine. And, uh, Bobbi,</i>
<i>could you make a quick copy</i>
<i>of that videotape...</i>

951
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,482
and bring in Miss Bloom's
original when that's done?

952
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:27,484
- I don't blame you for
not watching that twice.
- I couldn't sleep afterwards.

953
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:31,356
I understand. I tell folks I'm no more
afraid of the Grim Reaper...

954
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:34,520
than I am of a Presbyterian
on Mother's Day, but, uh...

955
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,655
watching that tape, well, uh...

956
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:40,668
I had to keep
telling myself that's not
Constance just to get through.

957
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,261
Unfortunately,
others may argue the same.

958
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:47,172
But it's in her kitchen,
in her house.

959
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:50,405
<i>Currently home to</i>
<i>Weirdos, Incorporated.</i>

960
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,382
Arguably, that tape could have
been made by anybody with $20
and a tolerance for vulgarity.

961
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,214
- Will it get us
a postponement?
- Us?

962
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:02,280
This ain't my first rodeo, Miss Bloom.

963
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:05,622
<i>Now, I got to tell you that</i>
<i>there's a machine a-runnin'</i>

964
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:09,152
<i>And come tomorrow night at 6:00,</i>
<i>that machine gonna wanna be fed.</i>

965
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,995
- All here, Mr. Belyeu.
<i>- Thank you, Aaron.</i>

966
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:16,504
Now, to add to our troubles,
your own credibility
may come into question.

967
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,837
- Why?
- Well, you've been fraternizing
with the condemned.

968
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:24,368
- I've been what?
<i>- He's the most likely candidate</i>
<i>to have put you onto that tape.</i>

969
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:28,678
<i>He's a persuasive man,</i>
<i>you an out-of-state woman.</i>
<i>That don't look so good.</i>

970
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,083
Mr. Belyeu, someone
put the tape in my room.

971
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,145
<i>That's a fact for which</i>
<i>we have no evidence.</i>

972
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:37,555
- Thank you, Bobbi.
- Thanks.

973
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:41,824
<i>Let's not throw a pity party</i>
<i>and sit around reading Kafka.</i>

974
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:44,525
<i>Could be we find</i>
<i>a sympathetic judge.</i>

975
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,831
- I'll file within the hour.
You goin' over to see Gale?
- Yeah.

976
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:51,361
Fine. I'll give you
a call over to the motel
later with an update.

977
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:08,513
My coat. Shoot.

978
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:30,110
- What? Who?
- Did you see him? The cowboy.

979
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,805
- He was here?
- He's in the lobby.

980
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,906
Go see if his truck's out front.
Tail him, get a license number.

981
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,611
Find out who he is.
Don't screw this up. It's important.

982
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,211
- How are you gonna get to the prison?
- Taxi.

983
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,691
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

984
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,602
<i>I don't think you're</i>
<i>being straight with me.</i>
<i>I walk out of Belyeu's office...</i>

985
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,836
<i>- the guy's in the lobby.</i>
- Maybe you should just calm down.

986
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,141
<i>Visitor, please stay seated.</i>

987
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,882
Maybe you should sit down.

988
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:52,820
His name is Dusty Wright.
He's the local DeathWatch
director before Constance.

989
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,055
<i>He's a bullhorner.</i>

990
01:18:55,130 --> 01:19:00,932
He's a zealot who thinks
that a good demonstration has
to end with riots and arrests.

991
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,664
DeathWatch fired him because
he punched somebody at a rally.

992
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,300
But Constance kept him in
the organization. He adored her.

993
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,970
They were close.
Real close.

994
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,014
He testified at my trial.

995
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:17,848
Testified to support you
or to oppose the death penalty?

996
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,217
He testified against me.

997
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:23,348
- Against you?
- He testified about the drinking.

998
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,519
Alcohol is a mitigating factor
in capital cases.

999
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,523
I always told myself that
he did it in some sick way...

1000
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,897
to try to help me
get a reduced sentenced.

1001
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,727
I guess he believes
I really killed her.

1002
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,070
<i>Dusty's a man easily</i>
<i>blinded by hatred.</i>

1003
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:44,907
Maybe he hated you because
you were seeing Constance.

1004
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,380
I wasn't seeing Constance.

1005
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,246
She had your semen inside her.

1006
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,343
I know. Look, it's just... It's
a little more complicated than that.

1007
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,482
<i>Respect for life means every life.!</i>

1008
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,925
<i>Respect for life</i>
<i>means every life.!</i>

1009
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,759
Respect for life
means every life!

1010
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:06,460
Respect for life means every life!
Respect for life means every life!

1011
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,628
Respect for life
means every life!

1012
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,109
When you kill someone,
you rob their family.

1013
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:25,642
Not just of a loved one
but of their humanity.

1014
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,245
<i>You harden their hearts with hate.</i>

1015
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,759
You take away their capacity
for civilized dispassion.

1016
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:35,388
You condemn them
to blood lust.

1017
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:38,626
It's a cruel
and horrible thing.

1018
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:43,069
<i>- But indulging that hate</i>
<i>will never help.</i>

1019
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:45,436
The damage is done.

1020
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,840
And once we've had our pound of flesh,
we're still hungry.

1021
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,844
We leave the death house muttering...

1022
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:54,313
that lethal injection
was just too good for them.

1023
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,316
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>a civilized society...</i>

1024
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:59,376
<i>must live with a hard truth.</i>

1025
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:02,946
<i>He who seeks revenge</i>
<i>digs two graves.</i>

1026
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,652
They're bringing
Betty Sue's people out.

1027
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,553
Thank you, Dusty.

1028
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:27,647
Just look.
Look at those losers.

1029
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:31,311
Rednecks, ghetto hustlers,
drug addicts, schizophrenics.

1030
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,718
They're murderers,
and who cares if they die?

1031
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:39,693
<i>Who cares if the cycle, if it just</i>
<i>goes on and on and on and on?</i>

1032
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,752
Who cares?

1033
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,856
Who cares?

1034
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:02,446
Hey, did you make it
to your meeting today?

1035
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:07,250
Yeah. I think I have to
find one less guru-like.

1036
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:12,384
- Did you take your, uh, medicine?
- Mm-hmm.

1037
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,792
Feel better?

1038
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:20,092
- Mm-hmm.

1039
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:25,768
You know those stages
of Kubler-Ross?

1040
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,967
The ones the dying go through?

1041
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:32,140
Um, anger...

1042
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,772
denial...

1043
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,943
bargaining...

1044
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,544
uh...

1045
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:43,318
- Depression.
- Depression, acceptance.

1046
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,359
- Which one are you?
- Denial.

1047
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,260
Well, denial's good.
That's a... That's a good one.

1048
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:53,461
- The whole idea of there being
a process makes me tired.

1049
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:56,595
I'm not up to the job
of dying person...

1050
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:59,071
<i>marveling at blades of grass...</i>

1051
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,109
lecturing strangers
to relish every moment.

1052
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,612
- Mending bridges.
- Mending bridges.

1053
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,478
- Confessing regret. Ohh.

1054
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:11,417
- Oh, what, no regrets?
- Nope.

1055
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,949
Wow.

1056
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:18,749
I take that back.

1057
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:23,494
- I wish I'd had a child.
- Yeah, so do I.

1058
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,556
- I'm sorry, David.
- No.

1059
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:32,731
I guess I just wish
I had risked more.

1060
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:38,176
Oh, and not enough sex.
Should have had more sex.

1061
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:40,942
- Really?
<i>- Mm.</i>

1062
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:48,781
Well, how... How many
lovers did you have?

1063
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:52,258
- Including college?
- Including college.

1064
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:06,863
Well, sex is really... You know,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

1065
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:10,206
- It's so overrated.

1066
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,542
<i>- You should have had more sex.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

1067
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,342
You work so hard not to be
seen as a sex object.

1068
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:22,551
Before long,
you're not seen at all.

1069
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,884
Hey.

1070
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,887
I see you.

1071
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:39,201
- You want to make it five?

1072
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:43,370
- Complete the hand.
- What, a pity lay?

1073
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:48,311
- No, thanks.
- Hey.

1074
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:56,048
It wouldn't be pity.

1075
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:17,806
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Don't worry.

1076
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:20,006
No, it's good.

1077
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:22,549
Just talk to me.
Let me hear your voice.

1078
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:26,678
- I'm here. I'm here.
- Okay. Just hold me tight.

1079
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:30,290
Just tight. I'm so scared.

1080
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,588
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- No. Don't stop.

1081
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,594
- Just...
- Okay.

1082
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:37,631
Stay with me, please.
Please stay with me.

1083
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:41,635
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I just need to feel you inside.

1084
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:43,637
I'm right here.

1085
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:46,105
I'm so tired.

1086
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:52,779
I'm so tired
of being so afraid.

1087
01:25:54,516 --> 01:26:00,045
- I'm right here.
- Help me. Help me, please. Just...

1088
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:02,885
- Just make it go away.
- Okay. Okay.

1089
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:07,621
- Make it go away.
- Okay. I'm right here.

1090
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,455
I'm not going anywhere.

1091
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:53,361
- Can I help you?
- Oh. No. I'm leaving.

1092
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,425
I-I'm sorry. Thanks.

1093
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,437
It was Dusty.

1094
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:14,606
He had a motive.
He knew you both.
He visited that morning.

1095
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:17,674
If I could answer that for sure...

1096
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:20,653
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

1097
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:23,816
It's what I need you for.
That's why I chose you.

1098
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:27,759
- Now I've told you everything.
- But I still don't know.

1099
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:31,128
- I need more time.
- You'll find time.

1100
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,292
You should have
done this earlier.

1101
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,098
You're not here to save me.

1102
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:39,105
You're here to save
my son's memory of his father.

1103
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:43,103
That's all I want.

1104
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:47,013
You're gonna
let them kill you.

1105
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:50,573
Bitsey, we spend our whole lives
trying to stop death.

1106
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:55,985
Eating, inventing,
loving, praying...

1107
01:29:56,991 --> 01:30:00,518
fighting, killing.

1108
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:04,321
<i>But what do we really</i>
<i>know about death?</i>

1109
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,492
<i>Just that nobody comes back.</i>

1110
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,193
But there comes
a point in life...

1111
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:13,296
a moment...

1112
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:16,866
when your mind
outlives its desires...

1113
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,203
its obsessions...

1114
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:24,282
when your habits...

1115
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:26,343
survive your dreams...

1116
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:31,985
and when your losses...

1117
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,057
Maybe death is a gift.

1118
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:46,934
- You wonder.
- That's it. Let's go, Gale.

1119
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,674
All I can tell you is that by
this time tomorrow I'll be dead.

1120
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:58,975
I know when.

1121
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:02,078
I just can't say why.

1122
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,854
You have 24 hours to find out.

1123
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,300
Good-bye, Bitsey.

1124
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:12,115
- Ms. Bloom?
- Yeah.

1125
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:16,691
Thought I'd return your coat.
Gettin' kinda chilly.

1126
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:20,860
- Any news from
our video intruder friend?
- No. Any word on the appeal?

1127
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,961
Denied. Tape went to a federal judge
two hours ago.

1128
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:27,007
Now what you got
was definitely a snippet.

1129
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:30,305
Could be your video supplier friend
has more nasty previews scheduled.

1130
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:33,836
<i>Best you not get into too much</i>
<i>sightseeing right now.</i>

1131
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:36,679
Just stick close
to your motel room.

1132
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:43,551
- How's David?
- He's holding up.
Gonna be a hard night.

1133
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:48,027
Will you tell him
I'll take care of it?
About his son, I mean.

1134
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:51,064
I'll do that.
You stayin' for the execution?

1135
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:56,199
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Watch yourselves.

1136
01:32:57,204 --> 01:32:59,035
Mr. Belyeu?

1137
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,974
Were Dusty Wright
and Constance close?

1138
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:06,172
Oh, yeah.
Thick as thieves, those two.

1139
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:11,048
- Lovers?
- Whoa. You plowin' a little too
close to the cotton, Bitsey.

1140
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:15,248
<i>That was just a rumor.</i>
<i>Nothing more. Night-night.</i>

1141
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:19,664
Zack, wake up.

1142
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,674
- Did you throw the towel on the floor?
- What?

1143
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:24,370
This towel was
on my bathroom floor.
Did you throw it there?

1144
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,413
Yeah, I guess.
What, it's a motel.

1145
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,414
- Would you do that at home?
- No.

1146
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:31,349
Jesus, Bitsey,
it's not like we're staying
in the friggin' Four Seasons.

1147
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:34,410
Come on. Get the TV.
We're taking it with us.

1148
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:36,422
Taking it with us?
What are you talking about?

1149
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,822
- Where we going?
- Austin.

1150
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:41,054
- Get the TV.
- All right.

1151
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:47,590
Come on.

1152
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,650
- Wanna make a hundred bucks?
- A hundred bucks? What do I gotta do?

1153
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:14,785
<i>We're going over</i>
<i>the crime scene.</i>

1154
01:37:14,862 --> 01:37:16,853
Put the TV on the bed, Zack.

1155
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,628
Now, for the next hour,
I want you to do exactly
what I say when I say to do it.

1156
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:26,639
If I say jump, you jump.

1157
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:28,834
- You want me to jump?
- That's just a figure of speech.

1158
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:31,844
- Your boyfriend put the tripod back.
- He's not my boyfriend anymore.

1159
01:37:31,912 --> 01:37:33,937
- Do you still have a video camera?
- Yeah.

1160
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:35,948
- Good. Get it.
- I gotta collect first.

1161
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:38,314
Zack, give her the money.

1162
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:49,493
Can you move that stuff
off the counter for me?
By the lamp? Yeah.

1163
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:52,589
<i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>

1164
01:37:56,737 --> 01:38:00,332
<i>- Put the gloves on the dish rack.</i>
- I don't have a dish rack.

1165
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:03,240
<i>- Zack, could you...</i>
- Yeah.

1166
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:10,173
Turn them inside out.

1167
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,217
<i>And put-put the duct tape</i>
<i>on the floor.</i>

1168
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:18,555
By the stove.

1169
01:38:20,861 --> 01:38:22,795
Okay.

1170
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:27,027
- Now. Could you...
What's your name?
- Nico's fine.

1171
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:32,198
Nico, I want you to lie down
facing the counter.

1172
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,039
We can imagine that part.

1173
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:43,640
- Zack, put her in position.
- Okay.

1174
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:48,687
All right. Move...
Just move this way.

1175
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:52,385
- All right.
<i>- Yeah, forward.</i>
<i>Forward. There.</i>

1176
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:55,758
Okay. On her side. Right.

1177
01:38:55,829 --> 01:39:00,528
Her top leg out a little. There.

1178
01:39:02,803 --> 01:39:05,431
Okay. Now, look at this.

1179
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,578
She moves her foot.
I noticed this back at the motel.

1180
01:39:14,648 --> 01:39:19,881
She moves her foot quite deliberately,
and then she's still.

1181
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:23,117
For another 15 seconds she's still.

1182
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:26,455
And then she starts to struggle.
Now that doesn't make sense.

1183
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:30,657
If this was a murder, she'd just
be struggling and then be still.
She'd be dead.

1184
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:34,428
Maybe she was faking,
hoping he'd go away.

1185
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,461
Or...

1186
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:45,071
- We've got to bag her.
- We're going a little bit too far here.

1187
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:49,939
Okay.

1188
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,055
- I'll do it.
- Uh...

1189
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:59,225
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1190
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:01,284
Uh-huh.

1191
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:05,826
Well, thank you, Bobbi.
Thank you.

1192
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:20,645
Supreme Court death clerk
gave the go-ahead.

1193
01:40:29,923 --> 01:40:32,687
Give the keys to Zack
and stand over there by the tripod.

1194
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,058
I want you to wait three minutes
before you take the bag off.

1195
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:37,427
I'm really not so sure about this.
It's way too dangerous.

1196
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:40,763
Three full minutes, Zack.
Stand over there with her.

1197
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:43,359
And keep your eyes
on your watch.

1198
01:41:14,034 --> 01:41:17,663
Go ahead.

1199
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,707
- Twenty-two seconds...
- She shouldn't be doin' this.

1200
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:43,027
Oh, my God.

1201
01:41:48,402 --> 01:41:50,267
This isn't cool!

1202
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:54,738
- Bitsey?

1203
01:41:54,808 --> 01:41:58,073
No more experiments, all right?
Just tell me what's going on.

1204
01:41:58,145 --> 01:42:01,012
- Are you okay?
- She did it herself.

1205
01:42:01,081 --> 01:42:03,709
Ohh.

1206
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:07,015
She did it herself. Ohh.

1207
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:33,802
She used the gloves to keep
her fingerprints off the tape and bag.

1208
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,815
Then she put them
back on the disk rack...

1209
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:39,512
but upside-down and inside-out,
a housewife's habit.

1210
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:42,555
Now, a murderer would have
just tossed them aside...

1211
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:46,753
- like you do with a towel
in a crap motel.
- Maybe. All right, maybe.

1212
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:51,662
- But why wear these?
- Well, they threw me.
But she needed them.

1213
01:42:51,732 --> 01:42:54,496
She knew that she would
instinctively try to rip the bag off.

1214
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:56,900
<i>And she swallowed the key</i>
<i>so she couldn't get to it.</i>

1215
01:42:56,970 --> 01:42:59,200
She made sure there
was no way out.

1216
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:02,140
Why not hang yourself
or take pills?

1217
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:05,508
<i>- Why take your clothes off?</i>
<i>Why make it look like a murder?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

1218
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:07,604
It's so calculated.

1219
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:10,616
She's handcuffed,
taped at the mouth,
the gloves, the tripod...

1220
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:14,620
Why, Bitsey,
why fake your own murder?
It doesn't make sense.

1221
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:18,180
The woman's
a bleeding-heart abolitionist.
Why frame an innocent man?

1222
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,021
<i>- Why send Gale</i>
<i>to the chair for what...</i>
- What?

1223
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:23,153
She had to know some
innocent jerk would take the fall.

1224
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:28,763
Oh, my God, Zack.
That's it.

1225
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:31,997
That's why.
To prove it happens.

1226
01:43:32,072 --> 01:43:36,008
- To have absolute proof that
the system convicts innocents.
- Get out of here.

1227
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:38,806
No. That's how she thought.

1228
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:41,439
Come on, think about it.
This woman lived for DeathWatch.

1229
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:44,643
If she's gonna die anyway,
why not die for it?

1230
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:49,052
That's why the tripod was here,
to record proof, undeniable proof.

1231
01:43:49,122 --> 01:43:51,955
<i>- That's why we got the video.</i>
- So a dead woman put
the tape in your room?

1232
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:54,357
No, of course not.
I mean, she needed help.

1233
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:59,456
Someone to keep it, release it.
Someone dedicated to the cause.

1234
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:02,696
Someone she could trust.

1235
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:47,744
What a dump.
The guy's a freak.

1236
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:51,841
Come on.

1237
01:45:08,769 --> 01:45:12,899
Dusty's a bullhorner, a zealot
who's O.D.'d on too many good causes.

1238
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:15,441
<i>You know, the original plan</i>
<i>was probably for Dusty...</i>

1239
01:45:15,509 --> 01:45:17,909
to release the tape
after Gale's conviction.

1240
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,912
You know, after a year or so.

1241
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,608
It'd force him to dry out,
give him back his dignity.

1242
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:27,249
So Dusty Wright is sitting
on this tape, waiting.

1243
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:30,449
And he's the only one
who knows about it.

1244
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:33,118
So good ol' Dusty starts to think
that an erroneous execution...

1245
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:35,593
is a lot more politically useful
than a last-minute save.

1246
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:38,756
Because a last-minute save would
only prove the system works.

1247
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:41,528
Almost-martyrs don't count.

1248
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:46,129
Dusty's thinking, what's one murder
if it stops thousands?

1249
01:45:46,206 --> 01:45:50,006
So he'll release the whole tape
only after the execution.

1250
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:56,072
Which means he must have
the original somewhere.

1251
01:45:57,484 --> 01:46:00,578
- What time is it?
- It's 4:50.

1252
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:02,645
Oh, Bitsey, Jesus!

1253
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:30,849
I wanna talk about your tape.

1254
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:34,478
No. Meet me down the hill
at the gas station in 15 minutes.

1255
01:46:34,554 --> 01:46:36,715
Zack!

1256
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:39,452
Don't move from the phone.

1257
01:46:39,526 --> 01:46:42,222
<i>Call the second you see his pickup.</i>
<i>Let it ring just once.</i>

1258
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:44,456
- Then get into the woods.
- I know. Go.

1259
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:47,125
- Into the woods, Zack.
- Go!

1260
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:13,221
<i>Details of Gale's last meal</i>
<i>were released today.</i>

1261
01:47:13,293 --> 01:47:15,591
And they included pancakes
with maple syrup...

1262
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:19,325
All executions in the state of Texas
take place at 6:00 p.m.

1263
01:47:19,399 --> 01:47:22,926
- Four pancakes. Maple syrup.
- Four pancakes. Maple syrup.

1264
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:27,838
- Fresh strawberries.
- After completion of last words,
the injection is administered.

1265
01:47:27,908 --> 01:47:30,604
- Fresh strawberries... large.
- Fresh strawberries... large.
- Fresh strawberries.

1266
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:33,009
Sodium penthonal
for sedation purposes...

1267
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:35,843
- Reddi-wip whipped cream.
- Puts you to sleep.
- Reddi-wip whipped cream.

1268
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:37,907
- Pancuronium bromide...
- Chocolate shavings...

1269
01:47:37,984 --> 01:47:40,111
<i>- extra chocolate.</i>
- To collapse the diaphragm and lungs.

1270
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:42,451
Potassium chloride
to stop the heart.

1271
01:47:42,522 --> 01:47:45,457
- Chocolate shavings, extra chocolate.
- And chocolate shavings.

1272
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:47,789
The whole cocktail
costs the state of Texas...

1273
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:52,264
approximately $86.08
per elimination.

1274
01:49:40,373 --> 01:49:43,342
<i>- What do you miss most? Food.</i>
- Food.

1275
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:53,146
<i>- Talk to her in horse talk?</i>
- No.

1276
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:56,745
Damn.

1277
01:50:13,306 --> 01:50:15,297
Damn!

1278
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:18,277
Come on, cowboy,
where are you?

1279
01:50:18,345 --> 01:50:22,179
<i>8:30 p.m. We checked</i>
<i>the next hotel on the list.</i>

1280
01:50:26,686 --> 01:50:29,746
- Come on.

1281
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:31,950
Shit!

1282
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:02,815
It's ready?

1283
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:34,268
- Fuck!
- He didn't show up! Come on!

1284
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:40,051
<i>Please, Bitsy, come on.</i>

1285
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:09,181
Call everyone, Zack.

1286
01:53:09,249 --> 01:53:12,548
The governor, the warden,
New York, the goddamn
Supreme Court death clerk.

1287
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:15,247
- How far is it?
- You've got eight minutes, maybe more.

1288
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:17,755
- We'll make it. We'll make it.
- You can do it.

1289
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,815
Go! Go! Go!

1290
01:53:30,336 --> 01:53:32,327
Shower. Go.

1291
01:53:46,619 --> 01:53:48,610
My God.

1292
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:53,489
- Give me the time.
- On that big pile-up on I-35...

1293
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:55,323
Give me the goddamn time.

1294
01:54:14,547 --> 01:54:18,779
Oh, no. Not now.
Not fucking now.

1295
01:54:44,177 --> 01:54:45,940
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1296
01:54:50,416 --> 01:54:52,782
Come on. Fuck. Fuck!

1297
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:31,417
- Stop executions.

1298
01:55:37,397 --> 01:55:39,661
Hey, get the fuck off
my spot, all right?

1299
01:55:43,436 --> 01:55:45,233
Thank you.

1300
01:55:45,305 --> 01:55:47,432
- How tight are you?
- I got your two buttons.

1301
01:55:47,507 --> 01:55:50,237
Testing one, two...

1302
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:53,438
- How's my, uh, light?
- A little shine right there.

1303
01:55:53,513 --> 01:55:57,176
- I think he's doing
<i>Larry King Live</i> at 8:00.
- Oh. Can I smile?

1304
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:59,343
Opinion polls conducted
over the weekend show...

1305
01:55:59,419 --> 01:56:03,048
that 66% of all Americans are
in favor of the death penalty.

1306
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:05,386
Maybe you can get a shot
of the protesters.

1307
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:08,359
<i>You can see over here that</i>
<i>the people are represented...</i>

1308
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:12,694
<i>- by 50% pro, 50% anti-death.</i>

1309
01:56:12,765 --> 01:56:16,531
<i>Hiddee-hiddee-hiddee-ho.!</i>
<i>Time for David Gale to go.!</i>

1310
01:56:20,673 --> 01:56:23,642
When Caine killed Abel,
God cast him out. He didn't kill him.

1311
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:28,340
He raped and killed that poor girl.
As far as I'm concerned,
he should die for it.

1312
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:33,885
<i>Hiddee-hiddee-hiddee-ho.!</i>

1313
01:56:33,953 --> 01:56:36,979
- Murderers!
<i>- Time for David Gale to go.</i>

1314
01:56:42,628 --> 01:56:45,961
<i>They said on TV that he raped</i>
<i>her first and then he strangled her.</i>

1315
01:56:46,032 --> 01:56:49,433
<i>- I think he deserves to die.</i>
<i>- They stick that thing in</i>
<i>his arm and he goes to sleep.</i>

1316
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:51,766
If you ask me, they ought to use
a goddamn pickax.

1317
01:57:16,095 --> 01:57:20,156
- You're the murderer!
- He should die.

1318
01:57:23,269 --> 01:57:26,204
A little-bitty pin prick.

1319
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:31,909
The state of Texas
has executed David Gale.

1320
01:57:33,012 --> 01:57:36,971
He was pronounced dead
at 6:12 p.m.

1321
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,018
<i>Strapped to the gurney at 6:02.</i>

1322
01:57:39,085 --> 01:57:42,452
<i>- David Gale was officially</i>
<i>pronounced dead...</i>
- at 6:12 this evening.

1323
01:57:42,522 --> 01:57:46,481
- Texas has executed David...
- Gale was pronounced dead at 6:12.

1324
01:57:46,559 --> 01:57:50,495
Death was pronounced at 6:12 this
evening at the prison in Huntsville.

1325
01:57:53,499 --> 01:57:55,990
<i>Since none of the victim's relatives</i>
<i>was in attendance...</i>

1326
01:57:56,069 --> 01:57:58,970
<i>there will be no statement</i>
<i>from the victim's family.</i>

1327
01:58:38,177 --> 01:58:42,614
<i>Here's what we know so far.</i>
<i>Last night,</i> NEWS Magazine
<i>posted on their web site...</i>

1328
01:58:42,682 --> 01:58:45,242
<i>a video obtained</i>
<i>by reporter Bitsey Bloom.</i>

1329
01:58:45,318 --> 01:58:48,913
- The footage appears to show...
- Constance Harraway committing suicide.

1330
01:58:48,988 --> 01:58:52,788
Bloom reports that she received
the tape Friday morning in
a motel in Huntsville...

1331
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:56,192
<i>where she was staying while</i>
<i>conducting Gale's last interview.</i>

1332
01:59:01,367 --> 01:59:04,131
<i>Apparently, the tape has</i>
<i>been in the possession...</i>

1333
01:59:04,203 --> 01:59:08,003
<i>of former DeathWatch employee</i>
<i>Dustin Emil Wright.</i>

1334
01:59:10,476 --> 01:59:13,274
As you can see, police have been
in and out of his cabin all morning...

1335
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:15,576
<i>looking for clues</i>
<i>to his whereabouts.</i>

1336
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:19,948
- Since his 1994 conviction...
- On death row awaiting execution.

1337
01:59:20,019 --> 01:59:24,217
Blacks and Latinos are
five times more likely to face
the death penalty than whites.

1338
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:26,656
A fanatic in the movement
to stop the death penalty.

1339
01:59:26,726 --> 01:59:29,752
- It's all there?
- Actively seeking a Dustin Wright.

1340
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:33,959
- A Dustin Wright.
- It appears Wright
withheld a tape to make...

1341
01:59:34,033 --> 01:59:37,992
a political point
about the potential for error
in capital punishment cases.

1342
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:41,437
Passport and ticket as well.

1343
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:43,600
Dana, what
everyone here is asking...

1344
01:59:43,676 --> 01:59:46,008
It's a terrible tragedy,
and there will be a full investigation.

1345
01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:49,741
<i>And I assure you this man</i>
<i>Dusty Wright will be caught</i>
<i>and shown swift justice.</i>

1346
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:53,182
- Justice for Christ's sake!
<i>- The people of Texas are not deterred.</i>

1347
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:56,312
We're still solidly behind
the death penalty because it works.

1348
01:59:56,389 --> 02:00:00,325
<i>The system cannot be blamed</i>
<i>for the acts of one deranged</i>
<i>individual with an ax to grind.</i>

1349
02:00:00,393 --> 02:00:02,918
<i>And people have been put to death</i>
<i>in the name of this justice.!</i>

1350
02:00:02,995 --> 02:00:06,431
Let's not throw the baby out
with the bath water, folks.

1351
02:00:11,437 --> 02:00:14,429
<i>Of course, the ultimate irony</i>
<i>is that David Gale...</i>

1352
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:16,668
The man who became
an unwitting martyr...

1353
02:00:16,742 --> 02:00:18,835
May achieve in death
what he worked for...

1354
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:20,879
But could not
accomplish in life.

1355
02:00:20,947 --> 02:00:24,144
This is A.J. Roberts reporting
from Bastrop, Texas.

1356
02:00:51,377 --> 02:00:54,039
<i>- Gracias.</i>
<i>- De nada.</i>

1357
02:01:25,378 --> 02:01:27,369
This just came.

1358
02:01:56,976 --> 02:01:59,103
- Is it David's?
<i>- Sí.</i>

1359
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:53,494
"Key to your freedom." What?

1360
02:03:49,889 --> 02:03:52,323
