Now, the E Street Band has come

Where we want to go, we can't

We need you.

12
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,207
So I got one question
that I want to ask you.

13
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,310
Can you feel the spirit?

14
00:01:55,882 --> 00:02:02,521
If you can feel the spirit, I want you
to answer me with a "Yeah, yeah!"

15
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,357
Can you feel the spirit?

16
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,195
ALL: Yeah! Yeah!

17
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,365
Can you feel the spirit now?

18
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:20,439
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

20
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:40,459
My three words for Bruce Springsteen
are hope, heart and perspective.

21
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,562
Intense, passionate
and earnest.

22
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,298
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

23
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,236
Bruce is power.

24
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,871
Bruce is belief.

25
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,675
Bruce is togetherness.

26
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:01,180
My first experience with Bruce
Springsteen was in here

27
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,950
<i>in this venue, 1987, The
Tunnel Of Love Express Tour.</i>

28
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:08,954
And my journey
started on that night.

29
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:14,326
I was nine years old and I was
hanging in the fences up here

30
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,929
and having a blast
and, you know,

31
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,399
there must have been 100 people
behind me who couldn't see the show.

32
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:24,336
But I was a kid at the time,
so they probably thought,

33
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,805
"Hey, let the boy
enjoy himself."

34
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,975
But I remember
I recorded the entire show,

35
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:34,546
three and a half hours,
on an old Walkman,

36
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,417
and on the old cassette tapes,
and I still have them at home.

37
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,386
I keep them in a box and...

38
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,856
Once every now and then,
I stumble on to this box

39
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:49,628
and I look at it and I smile, you
know, because I actually remember.

40
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,799
I remember the night. It was
a beautiful summer night.

41
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:57,803
What these tapes represent
is basically why I keep them

42
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:03,242
and they represent a great day
in a nine-year-old boy's life

43
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,711
and that's priceless.

44
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,980
My favorite singer
is Bruce Springsteen

45
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:11,883
because I think

46
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,954
he puts like when
he has a concert,

47
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:20,993
he puts a lot of effort
into his singing.

48
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:24,830
Like he takes a deep
breath before every song

49
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,499
and like when the
camera goes close up,

50
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,702
you can just see
his veins popping out

51
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:34,306
because he's working so
hard and after one song

52
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,276
he's as sweaty as
a normal singer would be

53
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,978
after he's done like 10 songs.

54
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,748
These are some of
the pictures that I've...

55
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,318
I won, or I bought
or framed them.

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,888
But this particular one,
it's a little moldy.

57
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,392
I used to hold this
picture up to my son

58
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,361
and say, "Daddy, Daddy."

59
00:04:56,363 --> 00:05:01,533
So I think maybe I played
some head games with my son

60
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:05,637
for the first few years of his life
thinking that this was his daddy.

61
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,639
A song about growing up.

Hi. I'm Theresa Martin

86
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:19,171
and this is what I've
collected over the years.

87
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:26,111
I have an abundance
of love for Bruce.

88
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,948
MAN: So, Theresa, when did you actually
become a Bruce Springsteen fan?

89
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,718
I became a Bruce Springsteen
fan in 1982.

90
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,557
MAN: Really? And do you recall how
many live shows you actually attended?

91
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:42,727
I'm not sure. I'm in
double digits clearly.

92
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,197
But I'd say 30 plus.

93
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,133
MAN: 30 plus, that's quite
an adventure you had.

94
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:52,537
I also understand that you've won
a few Bruce Springsteen contests.

95
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,708
Is that correct? That is correct.
I've won two.

96
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,980
One being... The first
contest I won was...

97
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,253
<i>Help me.
The Today Show.</i>

98
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,922
That's one. And you know what?
I'm good.

99
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,558
<i>Because you know what?
It was The Today Show.</i>

100
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,128
<i>It was in 2002 when
The Risifirst came out</i>

101
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,700
and I gave birth
to my first son.

102
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,870
And he was a month old.

103
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:28,874
And I actually was home

104
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,977
<i>and The Today Show
had questions.</i>

105
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,981
I answered them and I won and
we went to New York City.

106
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:40,252
So I'd kind of like to
introduce my son Dominic.

107
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,523
And this is my son now.

108
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:48,093
He's 10 years old and...

109
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:53,164
MAN: Well, Dominic, you had a little
bit of a special moment, didn't you?

110
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,233
What's the question?

111
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,569
You had a bit of a special Bruce
Springsteen moment, didn't you?

112
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,238
Yes, I did. And can you
explain that to us?

113
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,742
I've got it.

114
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,550
This is the picture
I got after the concert.

115
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,251
We were waiting on the curb

116
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:16,588
and a friend was going
to get the vehicle.

117
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:23,662
And the police came and stopped all
the cars from where they were going.

118
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:28,233
And a black SUV came.

119
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,170
And in the back seat with his
window down was Bruce Springsteen.

120
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,806
Everyone ran up to the car.

121
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:38,009
She was told to back off by the
policeman standing next to her.

122
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:44,249
And I shook his hand while
getting this close-up picture.

123
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,786
Dominic,
where was that concert at?

124
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,721
Fenway Park in Boston.

125
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,223
Awesome. Awesome.

126
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,860
So now you're the next generation
Bruce Springsteen fan.

127
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,163
Yes, I am.
Excellent.

128
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,165
What's your favorite
Bruce song?

129
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,033
<i>Death To My Hometown.</i>

130
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,301
Why?

131
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,804
I like it.

132
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,872
Which is good. However...

133
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,141
Because of the words.

134
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,812
Taught to me by
this person right here.

135
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,381
And when Mommy tells you
to listen to the words,

136
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,050
or understand the words,
what do you say?

137
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,785
Okay.

138
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,255
And do you hear the words?
Yes.

139
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,658
Do you really hear the words?
Yes.

140
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,393
Okay, I just want to make sure.

141
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,662
Thank you, goodbye.

142
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,932
MAN: Thank you, Dominic.
DOMINIC: Yeah!

143
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,067
So we got to the
park at four o'clock

144
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,703
with our signs with us,
our home-made signs.

145
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,372
<i>♪ You can't start a fire</i>

146
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,807
I had my "I'll be your
Courtney Cox" sign.

147
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,710
<i>♪ I'm stranded with
a broken heart</i>

148
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:49,180
I had my Aviator sunglasses on.
It was pouring with rain.

149
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,650
I had my
Courtney Cox T-shirt on.

150
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,352
<i>♪ You can't start a fire</i>

151
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,389
Then James said to me, "Rachel, come on.
Get on my shoulders."

152
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,691
And I was like,
"Oh, no, I don't want to."

153
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,694
I felt bad for the people behind us.
They wouldn't be able to see.

when we're going to see Bruce again."

Literally, a couple of
seconds into the song,

156
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,403
Bruce spotted me
and started laughing

157
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,039
and he was pointing at me
and I was waving at him.

158

Next thing I know, I get put on
the big screen with my sign.

159
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,851
The next thing I know, the girl in
front of me just turned around to me

160
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,455
and screamed, "He wants you on the stage!

That was it.

166

We took a bow

Hi. My name is Kitty.
I'm a truck driver.

194
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:17,989
And Bruce Springsteen is my favorite
artist to listen to on the road.

195
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,391
Recently I drove
through Arizona

196
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:25,263
<i>and I listened to
his album Nebraska</i>

197
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:30,401
<i>and the song
Atlantic City came on.</i>

198
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:35,607
And it just felt really good,
listening to that loud,

199
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,042
while driving
through the desert.

200
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:48,386
In fact, I think every
important moment of my life

201
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,624
has a theme song
that's Bruce Springsteen.

202
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,193
So all of these CDs in my car,

203
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:59,063
absolutely every single one
is Bruce Springsteen.

Wait, actually one is his wife
Patti, my favorite album from Patti.

But that's all
we listen to in this car,

206
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,573
so my three sons,
they have no choice.

207
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,608
I only listen to Bruce

208
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,113

rammed down my throat 24/7.

It really does.

So how many concerts
have you been to?

It was about eight.

Eight that
I've actually been to.

I've seen some beautiful cities

265

always had this little bit

where I've had to go to a
concert in the middle of it,

267
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:11,302
which tends to spoil it for me.

00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,705
And his dream was to get
on stage with Springsteen.

269
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,675
I heard him talking about
it from the time we met

270
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,777
until it actually happened.

271
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,813
That's my lifelong dream. And I said,
"You're really going to do it?"

272
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,449
And he goes. "I'm going to do
it." I said, "Do you promise?"

273
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,418
And he said, "I promise."

274
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,355
So he puts a suit on. He's dragging
me across the street to get there

275
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,592
and as soon as he got up there,
people are going, "Hey, Elvis."

276
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,762
And they're high fiving him and
they're wanting their picture taken

277
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,598
and they're asking him to sing
songs and he just kind of...

All the anxiety
just melted away.

"Okay, King, come on up."

<i>♪ Hey, yeah</i>

306
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,102
Right when he was about
to start singing,

307
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:29,673
his son texted me and said, "Did
my dad get on stage? Ha-ha!"

308
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,109
And I went,
"He's up there now."

309
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,479
<i>♪ My hands are shaky
and my knees are weak</i>

310
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,948
<i>♪ I can't seem to stand
on my own two feet</i>

311
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,684
I was so happy. I really was.
I grabbed my buddy.

312
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,787
I said, "He's singing
with Bruce Springsteen."

313
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,522
"He's singing
with the Boss."

314
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:47,091
He had the faith
and he handed me the mic

315
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,628
and I said,
"Okay, this is it."

316
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,998
So I did my best
and as I was singing,

317
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,435
at one point,
I dropped to my knees...

318
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:01,605
<i>♪ Who do you thank

321
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,452
Take it, Bruce!

322
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,521
And I kick out my leg, which
when you look at the video,

323
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,057
it looks like an Elvis move,
but the fact of the matter is

324
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,526
when I dropped to my knees,
I pulled my hamstring.

325
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,096
I immediately kicked out my leg,
because I'd pulled my hamstring

326
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:29,500
and then I stood up and my
leg was hurting a little bit

327
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:32,570
and at that point that's
when I said, "Hit it, Bruce."

328
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,004
And he did his guitar solo.

329
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,959
And then I realized
that during the guitar solo

330
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,728
<i>that there is no guitar
solo in All Shook Up</i>

331
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,698
and didn't quite know
what to do at that moment

332
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,501
and I turned around
and looked at Max

333
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:07,638
and I backed up, thinking that I'm
going to have to change the song.

334
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,809
And out of no disrespect to Bruce
or the band, but I backed up

335
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,779
and looked at Max and right at
the end of the guitar solo,

336
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:20,050
<i>I went into Blue Suede Shoes and
the band was right there with me.</i>

337
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,521
<i>♪ Well, it's one for the mony
Two for the show</i>

338
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:27,525
<i>♪ Three to get ready Now
go guys go But don't you ♪</i>

339
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,561
And I remember in the corner of
my eye, I see Bruce coming up

340
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:33,030
and I remember, as I'm
singing, saying to myself,

341
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,967
"Uh-oh, I think you're done, Nick,"
because just by looking at Bruce

342
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:40,638
and I said, "Okay, Bruce, take
it home." And he grabs the mic.

343
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,706
Take it home, Bruce!

344
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,543
Elvis has left the building!

345
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,047
Elvis has left the building!

346
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,985
Thank you, King.

347
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,656
And then I remember
jumping off the stage and...

348
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:02,593
He got totally mobbed by the crowd
because they were all so excited.

349
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:05,863
Everybody wanted to hug him and,
you know, like high five him

350
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,867
and I'm just waiting, because I
just can't wait to like hug him

351
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,037
and kiss him and say, "Oh, my
God, we've realized your dream."

352
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,105
And it was like a scene from...

353
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:19,009
<i>Wasn't it like a scene from Rocky and
Adrian were yelling for each other</i>

354
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,946
just to try to catch up to
each other so we can embrace?

355
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,214
And once we did,
it was like the most...

356
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,651
I don't know. The tears fill your
eyes, because you're so happy.

357
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:40,998
And as we turn around, we look up and
Bruce was holding that last note.

358
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,343
He pointed to us
and he kept saying,

359
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:55,279
"The Philly Elvis.
The Philly Elvis."

360
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,382
The Philly Elvis!

361
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,319
The Philly Elvis!

362
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:07,358
Then the last thing he said, which I'll
never forget. He looks and says...

363
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,328
I have no idea where the
(BLEEP) he came from.

364
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,932
Thank you, King.

365
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:22,272
He means inspiration.
He means joy.

366
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:26,110
And he means salt of the earth.

367
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:29,713
I know it's three words,
of the three words

368
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,982
but I don't want to alter
salt of the earth.

369
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,085
He's just the best.
He's the best.

370
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,922
Happy, handsome and hot.

371
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:44,695
Supernatural,
divine, inspiration.

372
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,196
My soul brother.

373
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:50,234
A local legend.

374
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:55,305
In three words, I would
say, in him we trust.

375
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:58,042
Am I looking okay? Okay.

376
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,811
Passion, passion, passion.

377
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,383
It was March 29th, 1976,

378
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,219
right smack in the
middle of the '70s.

379
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,356
And it seemed like
all our parents were gone.

380
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,459
Just working,

381
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:18,128
busy, drunk
at the country club.

382
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,399
So somehow it was okay
for a group of girls

383
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:28,338
to go to see a rock 'n' roll
concert on a Monday night

384
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,708
in March of our 9th grade year.

385
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,445
I don't remember what happened
when we got to the concert.

386
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:37,081
I don't know what happened
to the other girls,

387
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,349
but I know that
as soon as I got there,

388
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,318
as soon as the lights went out,

389
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,354
I made my way
to the front of the stage,

390
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,423
back when you could do that.

391
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:54,765
And was front and center up against
the stage right in front of Bruce.

392
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:58,068
Even after all these years and
all the shows that I've seen,

393
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,438
the concert still
defies description.

394
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,011
And I think that only the people
who saw him in the early days

395
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:13,884
in the small venues,
before the mega crowds...

396
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:18,222
And when you could get so close
that you were sharing the sweat

397
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:22,259
and spit of whatever band
member you were closest to,

398
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:28,932
can really know the ferocity and
intimacy of those concerts.

00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:59,283
After graduation, I
couldn't really get a job

436
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:05,188
and so I started
working at Jamba Juice

437
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,191
making oatmeal
in the early morning.

438
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,494
I'd have to get up
at three o'clock.

439
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:15,098
I didn't have a car,
so I rode my bike to work

440
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,702
<i>and that was when
Working on a Dreacame out.</i>

441
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:22,639
I would listen to that on my
way to work and feel like,

442
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:27,477
"Oh, I'm such
a hard-working person."

443
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,212
(CHUCKLES)

444
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:33,116
"I'm the backbone of
America." That's what...

445
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:39,022
Well, sometimes I feel like that
when I listen to Bruce like,

446
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:45,195
you know, like I'm really
important, the work I do, the...

447
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,035
The more physically
demanding my job is,

448
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,671
the more important I am,
when I listen to Bruce.

449
00:32:54,673 --> 00:33:00,010
I don't know if that makes any
sense, but that's how I feel.

450
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:04,081
<i>Madison Square Garden,
2000, the Reunion Tour.</i>

451
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,150
I'd worked in
a factory for 20 years

452
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,454
and I'd saved up
enough money eventually

453
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:14,458
to afford to go on a Bruce
trip as we call it,

454
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,096
four days in New York, two
concerts at Madison Square Garden.

455
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:24,334
So me and my lovely wife Kath
stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania,

456
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,038
across the road from
Madison Square Garden.

457
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,640
We went down to the bar
to pick up our tickets

458
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:35,012
on the night of the
concert, the first concert,

459
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,616
and excitedly opened the
envelope, looked at the tickets,

460
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:43,286
looked at the map seating plan

461
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:47,257
and we were right at the
back, right at the top.

462
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,394
So a bit disappointed,
but we were in New York,

463
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:53,263
America for the first time.

464
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:57,701
So looked at the positives,
we went across the road,

465
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,204
up the escalators right to
the top, right to the back,

466
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,373
and as we got to the top level,

467
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:09,246
this rather bear-like character
in baggy shorts and a beard,

468
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:12,816
as he walked past me,
muttered the immortal words,

469
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,420
"You want to be upgraded?"

470
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:20,057
Sorry? Didn't know what he meant?
Didn't quite hear him.

471
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,326
"Let me see your tickets," he said,
so I showed him our tickets.

472
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,262
He looked at them and said,

473
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:27,664
"I think we can do better than that.
Give me your wrist."

474
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,168
I put my wrist out and he
slapped an orange wristband

475
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,604
on my wrist and Kath's and
I said, "What's that for?"

476
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:38,075
He said, "Don't remove that from your wrist.
Don't leave the building."

477
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:41,144
"If you leave the building,
you won't be allowed back in."

478
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,680
And like he'd
said it 1,000 times.

479
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,649
He put our tickets
in his pockets

480
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,852
and then he peeled off a couple
of tickets, gave them to us

481
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,687
and said something like,

482
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,690
"I work for Bruce. I don't
want any money from you."

483
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:57,761
"I don't want any recognition. Please
don't point me out to other people."

484
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,363
"Thank you for your support.
Enjoy the show."

485
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,432
And he was gone.

486
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:07,537
So we're looking at the tickets,
entrance whatever it was.

487
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,639
We thought, "We'd better
find this entrance, then."

488
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:13,276
So we walked round Madison
Square Garden at the top

489
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,346
and there was no entrance
and I thought,

490
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:19,549
"I've just given my tickets
to a complete stranger"

491
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:23,320
"and we've got tickets that
don't get us in anywhere."

492
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:27,390
Kath, my wife, pointed out that
we'd just gone past a cocktail bar,

493
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:32,362
like they do in America, not a
beer stand like in England.

494
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:35,565
And she said, "There's a couple in
there with orange wristbands on."

495
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,201
"Let's go and ask them."
We went to the cocktail bar.

496
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,670
Sure enough, very elegant
couple sitting there,

497
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,440
and we said, "Excuse me".
And we told them our story.

498
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,475
He said,
"Let me see your tickets."

499
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,744
He looked at the
tickets and he goes,

500
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,780
"You got the best seats in the house.
What's your problem?"

501
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:54,317
I still found it
a bit hard to believe.

502
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,721
But sure enough we went to
a staff member, showed him

503
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,324
and he just pointed us down
through that entrance

504
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:05,929
and then the next level down,
keep going, keep going.

505
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,665
We got to the back
of the front section

506
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,767
with the maroon rope
across and thought,

507
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:14,571
"Oh, we must be behind here somewhere.
This is fantastic."

508
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,607
We showed the man.
He unclipped the rope.

509
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,943
"Down to the front, sir."

510
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:24,848
And we ended up on the front
row at Madison Square Garden

511
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,751
to see Bruce Springsteen
and the E Street Band

512
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:30,687
in the year 2000.

513
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,257
I got so excited
I bought my wife

514
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:38,195
three glasses of champagne
at seven dollars a glass.

515
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,830
And I was a factory
worker at the time.

516
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,467
And it was phenomenal.

517
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,904
So that's what it's like to
be a Bruce Springsteen fan.

(HUMMING)

534
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,617
Here we are just hanging out in the
evening at home in our living room,

535
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,487
talking about Bruce Springsteen,
like we do every night.

536
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,790
Yes, we do.
(LAUGHS) Okay.

537
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:26,062
Anyway, this is my vintage shirt.
Remember this one?

538
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:29,999
I hardly ever wear it, because
I have to preserve it.

539
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,737
And I never even went to a show.
How did you get that shirt?

540
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,472
I never even went to a show.

541
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,541
We'd never been able to get
tickets when we had money

542
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,478
and then we didn't have
money, so we couldn't go.

543
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,048
Unfortunately not, but we're
still huge Bruce fans.

544
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,450
Oh, God, honey.
What? We are.

545
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:49,452
I know we are.
All right, so?

546
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,855
(LAUGHS)

547
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:55,892
Anyway, yes, this was my ex-boyfriend
who I was living with in Manhattan

548
00:39:55,894 --> 00:40:02,432
and he was a musician and I was
a writer-actress-waitress.

549
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:07,036
And I think he went to the show,
but I was already seeing you.

550
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:09,873
Then he was trying to woo me
back with the Bruce shirt.

551
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,542
And it didn't quite work.
And I won.

552
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,845
He might have been able to woo me
back if he'd bought Bruce with him.

553
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,817
Anyway, yeah, so it's
my favorite shirt.

554
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,720
I don't wear it too often.
I don't want to wear it out.

555
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:26,022
Right, but for this occasion...

556
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,857
But it's funny because we
were talking the other night.

557
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,259
We were saying about how...

558
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:39,035
You know, we were talking about like
how Bruce is kind of in our lives

559
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,771
and stuff like that and...

560
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,475
And we were talking about
like the fact that we're...

561
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:48,711
It sounds so stupid, but we
are kind of like the people

562
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,514
that are in his songs
in different ways.

563
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,517
Very much so, blue collar.
Blue collar.

564
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,786
Together 28 years.
Struggling.

565
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,888
Yeah, struggling with the kids

566
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,592
and you go to work
every day in Manhattan

567
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:06,763
and works with his hands and has
been doing that for over 30 years.

568
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,567
But we're still together.
That's the main thing.

569
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,704
But if you say it one more
time, we might not be.

570
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:18,675
<i>MAN: So I've got these tickets to see
Bruce with my girlfriend in Hamilton</i>

571
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:23,179
<i>and she calls me on October 20th,
the night before the concert,</i>

572
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:28,218

tells me, "It's over."</i>

583

00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:43,626

00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:35,498
And I think that in general Polish
people could relate to his music,

627
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,736
especially during communism, because
he was singing about freedom.

628
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,072
When you... At the time people
couldn't speak English so well,

<i>so when like in the song

630
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:50,847
they could understand
only the chorus,

631
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:53,449
so everybody was thinking that,

632
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:57,887
"Oh, he's praising the fact that
he's an American. It's so great"

633
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:02,225
<i>I guess that if you hear him singing

And a special moment
for me was when

653
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:19,268
<i>Bruce decided to go on the Reunion

655
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:28,845
And I was here. It was one
of those nights to remember.

656
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:33,416
I remember during
the encore of the show,

657
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:36,052
<i>Bruce decides to

00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:39,121
beautiful song, beautiful song.

659
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:43,259
And during the
last verse of the song,

660
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:47,263
the guy next to me...
I don't know his name.

661
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:51,167
I'd never seen him before.
I haven't seen him since.

662
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:53,636

put his arm around me.

663
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:58,174
You know, all of a sudden, this
big guy has his arm around me.

664
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:02,178

I remember walking home
after the show with my girl

683
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:07,503
and she said to me, "At some point, I
felt like I was the only one there."

684
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,206
"I felt like he
was playing for me."

685
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:15,644
And I said, "I know. I know exactly
what you're talking about. I know."

686
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,691
Hello. My name is Jane.

687
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:35,097
I'm living in Helsingor, in
Denmark, just a small town.

688
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:38,367
This is the first time I've
ever tried to make a video

689
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,771
from my camera,
so this is not very good.

690
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:47,209
However, I wish to say
something about me and Bruce.

691
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:51,247
We have been friends
ever since 1985,

692
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:55,818
though he do not know me.

693
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:01,424
I have listened to his music
every day since '85.

694
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:04,060
I know the lyrics.
I know the music.

695
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:10,232
Every day when I go home for work,
I hear his records in my car.

696
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,468
I sort of relax.

697
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:17,640
I sort of get in a very good
mood when I listen to Bruce.

698
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:22,845
It doesn't matter whether it is
the new music or the old music.

699
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:26,182
I just love listening
to his music.

700
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:29,852
I'm not the kind of fan who
knows the size of his shoes,

701
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:33,589
or the names of his children,
although I know he has three children

702
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:37,827
and he has a lovely wife Patti.

703
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:42,798
Which is also...
She has a wonderful vocal.

704
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,503
And, of course, I understand
why he loves his woman.

705
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:53,409
One of the best music I have
heard him sing is the...

706
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:55,344
<i>Red Headed Woman.</i>

707
00:51:55,346 --> 00:52:00,483
It is the kind of song that a man
who really loves his woman has made

708
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:06,455
and it must be wonderful to be
Patti to receive such a song.

709
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:13,262
I don't know what to say. I'm the
kind of fan who has attended

710
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:17,867
all his concerts
since '85 here in Denmark.

711
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:23,139
I always stand in the first
row, screaming and shouting

712
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:26,709
and dancing like a teenager
to a Beatles' concert.

713
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,813
This summer I was that lucky

714
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:35,885
that finally, after all
these years, I touched him.

715
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:40,523
We touched each other twice
in Roskilde in Denmark

716
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:46,695
and I cried like... I wept
because it was so big.

717
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:50,533
It's a great song about a great
subject, cunnilingus. That's right.

718
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:56,605
Yeah. I hope I'm pronouncing
that correctly.

719
00:52:56,607 --> 00:53:01,844
Yeah, as I like to say, if you can
pronounce it, you can probably do it.

720
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,546
That's right.

721
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:10,519
And what can I say about it?
It's a college town.

722
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,222
There's probably people
practicing cunnilingus out there

723
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:15,824
as we speak tonight.

724
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:19,728
I hope so
and I do mean practicing,

725
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,498
because you young
whipper-snappers,

726
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,467
it takes a while to get that
under your belt. (CHUCKLES)

727
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,873
It's like balancing a plate
on the end of your nose.

728
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,942
It's not as easy as it looks.

729
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:41,650
It takes some dedication,
it takes discipline,

730
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:44,620
attention to craft and detail.

731
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:47,823
That's right.
It takes... Yes.

732
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:54,997
It takes patience, patience
and more patience.

733
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,536
As I usually say.

734
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:04,573

I hadn't been to a ton
of rock 'n' roll yet,

756
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:35,331
but I'd seen my share of shows.

757
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,434
And I understood in some way
that what I was witnessing

758
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:44,973
was something far beyond me
and my world as I knew it.

759
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:51,780
I was way too in the moment to
know that my life was changing,

760
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:57,720
but I did know that with each song,
I was leaving something behind.

761
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,558
The really critical
departure happened during

762
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:08,464
<i>the long soul-shaking
instrumental in Jungleland.</i>

763
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:13,435
He turned his back to us and
he walked towards the drum.

764
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:22,144
He swayed and he danced to the sax,
the bass, the organ, the piano.

765
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:29,985
He was young and taut
and all that man and men

766
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:36,024
and song and sound
became something bigger

767
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:41,430
and more powerful than anything
I understood or knew yet

768
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:44,900
in my young body.

769
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:48,036
And it was something
about rock 'n' roll and sex

770
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:52,674
and men and music and myself

771
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:59,114
and I grew a few years
and a few inches

772
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:05,954
when that incredibly beautiful
man had his perfect body

773
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:13,195
moving perfectly to
that crazy, sexy, sad song.

774
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:18,100
Everyone was totally
transfixed, tranced out.

775
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:23,205
I don't know if
anybody else was there,

776
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:26,041
but it was like the genie had
been let out of the bottle

777
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,610
and for me there
was no going back.

778
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:34,817
I think I cried.
I must have.

779
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:37,619
I was ripped out of my skin.

780
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,055
I was ripped out of my senses.

781
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:45,727
It was like the thunderbird had
swooped and had me in its talons.

782
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:50,866
And then someone behind me
lifts me up onto the stage,

783
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:53,836
really gently,
just lifts me up,

784
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:57,172
and I stand up and I'm standing
right there next to him.

785
00:57:57,174 --> 00:58:01,844
And I'm so close I can see
the sweat through his jeans

786
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:05,681
and his dirty Converse.

787
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:08,984
And I look at him and he's
looking at me and he smiles

788
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,986
and I sort of moved to the side

789
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,655
and the next thing
I know someone comes

790
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:20,262
and really gently lowers me back
down to where I was before.

791
00:58:20,264 --> 00:58:25,000
And I look around and there are
men all around me smiling.

792
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,770
I'm soaked to the skin

793
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:31,039

WOMAN: What would you say

01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:05,387
it's quite a long
period of time.

846
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:09,191
I'm thinking. "What time

852
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:41,456
getting ready to play some cafes and
this guy comes up to me and says,

853
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:44,326
"Hey, Bruce is coming
down the street."

854
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:48,163
And I said, "Oh, yeah."
Just another hero for me.

855
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:51,066
Didn't really believe it, but
then I looked across the street

856
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:54,770
and I see Bruce out there and
this tall black man with him

857
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:59,875
and that was Clarence Clemons
and I said, "Well..."

858
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:03,779
I shouted out, "Hey, Bruce, why don't
you come and play us the real thing?"

859
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:07,415
He kind of looked at me and
thought it was just funny

860
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,885
and then I said again,
"Hey, come on."

861
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:12,954
And then he made a U-turn.
He came across the street.

01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:16,424
And that's where this picture
started happening here.

863

and give, you know...</i>

892
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:54,282
He wasn't... He was just
one of us, you know.

893
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:58,253
Okay, he had had success, but
he was still just one of us

894
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:02,123
and that's what I really
loved about it, you know.

895
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,459
I really loved that.

896
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:10,999
<i>We just said goodbye to one another
and he went his way and I went mine.</i>

897
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:15,103
<i>It was exactly how it should
happen on the street, you know.</i>

898
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:25,380
Hi, my name is Gillian.

899
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:28,116
Hi, my name's Gillian.

900
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,151
Hi, my name's Gillian

901
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,420
and I'm a pretty big...
I'm a...

902
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:36,758
Hi, my name's Gillian and I'm a
pretty big Bruce Springsteen fan.

903
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,161
After my first
Bruce brought... Hi.

904
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,230
No. (LAUGHS)

905
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,065
No.

906
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:52,307
Hi. My name's Gillian and I'm a
pretty big Bruce Springsteen fan.

907
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:55,276
After my first
Bruce concert in April,

908
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:58,546
I was so excited
and so full of emotion

909
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:03,018
and I wanted to let Bruce know
how important he was to me,

910
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,354
so I wrote him a letter, thinking
I'd be able to send it to him,

911
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:11,026
but I couldn't find
a fan mail address.

912
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:14,295
So I wrote it anyway
and just put it out there

913
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:17,766
in case I'd ever have the chance
to tell him how important he is

914
01:07:17,768 --> 01:07:20,402
and his music is in my life.

915
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:23,238
So this is the perfect
opportunity for that,

916
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,074
so I'm going to share
that letter now.

917
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:29,044
<i>Dear Bruce, to say
I am a fan of yours</i>

918
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:31,613
<i>would be quite
an understatement.</i>

919
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:34,449
<i>Your music is woven
into my very being.</i>

920
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:37,452
<i>It has become a part
of the story of me,</i>

921
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:42,190
<i>turning into a kind of soundtrack of
the past couple of years of my life.</i>

922
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:45,226
<i>I first discovered your
music about four years ago.</i>

923
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:48,496
<i>I heard Glory Days on the radio
and I guess it spoke to me</i>

924
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:51,232
<i>and to where I was
at that point in my life.</i>

925
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,334
<i>I started looking
at more of your songs</i>

926
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:56,371
<i>and my parents were quite amused
that I was suddenly listening</i>

927
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:59,574
<i>to music from their time.</i>

928
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:04,679
<i>But that's the thing, Bruce, your
music doesn't have a time or a place.</i>

929
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:08,750
<i>Your music is a story and it
bends and flows into the stories</i>

930
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:11,286
<i>of everyone who listens to it.</i>

931
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:15,356
<i>I guess what I'm trying
to say is thank you.</i>

932
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,725
<i>It seems like every time
I hit a bump in life,</i>

933
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:20,628
<i>I turn to you
and to your songs.</i>

934
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,765
<i>They pick me up and dust me
off in a way that no one</i>

935
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,701
<i>and nothing else can.</i>

936
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:29,404
<i>We all go through
dark times in life</i>

937
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:32,373
<i>and sometimes things
aren't going to get better</i>

938
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:34,776
<i>and they're not going
to be all right.</i>

939
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:38,613
<i>In those times, music can
be the best companion,</i>

940
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:42,517
<i>because it reminds you there can
still be beauty in this world</i>

941
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:46,521
<i>and that all is not lost
in spite of it all.</i>

942
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:51,793
<i>Without you, I would be lost.
Thank you.</i>

943
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,895
Thank you.
Thank you.
