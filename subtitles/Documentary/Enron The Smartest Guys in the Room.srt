1
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:20,970
You bastard.

2
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,340
You should've protected her.

3
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:25,015
How could you kill her, you bastard?

4
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:26,555
Look here.

5
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,155
Do you think I killed Ae-gyeong?

6
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:37,525
Do you really?

7
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:43,760
I said I would bring her back.

8
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:45,535
I never said I would kill her.

9
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:51,705
I'm a businessman.
I'm not a gangster anymore.

10
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:56,375
A businessman does not commit murder.

11
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:57,810
We do business.

12
00:00:57,815 --> 00:01:00,755
<i>Let's see what's going on in the hearing.</i>

13
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:03,225
<i>Ae-gyeong Kim, please come forward.</i>

14
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:13,495
You do know the hearing is today, right?

15
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:32,085
-Do you like this too?
-Wow. Thank you.

16
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:35,285
What a good kid.

17
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:38,820
When is Mommy coming?

18
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:41,055
<i>Please stand and take your oath.</i>

19
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:45,095
Well...

20
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:48,765
<i>I swear</i>

21
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:52,600
<i>to tell the truth, the whole truth,</i>

22
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:55,435
<i>and nothing but the truth.</i>

23
00:01:56,235 --> 00:02:00,270
It's Mommy. Mommy's on TV.

24
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:03,910
Please ask her your questions in order.

25
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,440
Ae-gyeong Kim,

26
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:09,380
Mayor Sang-do Bae received a bribe
and helped Chairman Yeong-guk Jo, correct?

27
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:11,925
When someone is above the law...

28
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,295
he doesn't fall into the gutter.

29
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:22,265
Do you understand whom you just took on?

30
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,805
No, he did not.

31
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,845
Wait a little while.

32
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:35,415
I'll make the same things happen
as three years ago.

33
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:48,150
<i>There is circumstantial evidence
that you were present</i>

34
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,090
<i>when Yeong-guk Jo bribed
Mayor Sang-do Bae.</i>

35
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:51,365
<i>Do you still deny it?</i>

36
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,825
<i>It is not true.</i>

37
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:55,735
<i>Stop perjuring yourself.</i>

38
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:57,205
<i>I am not.</i>

39
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,170
<i>We heard you know Mayor Sang-do Bae</i>

40
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,805
<i>and Yeong-guk Jo well.</i>

41
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,645
<i>I've never met Mayor Sang-do Bae.</i>

42
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,520
<i>The people are watching.</i>

43
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,985
<i>Why do you think you're here?</i>

44
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:24,065
<i>I do not know.</i>

45
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,965
Je-mun, you punk.

46
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:40,870
<i>People had been discussing
the possible reason</i>

47
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,840
<i>for Ae-gyeong Kim
not appearing to testify.</i>

48
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:44,980
<i>Therefore, her appearing
at the hearing now</i>

49
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:47,010
<i>has a huge implication.</i>

50
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:50,485
<i>Won't this hurt
the prosecution's position?</i>

51
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,680
<i>It was their assertion</i>

52
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:56,150
<i>that Yeong-guk Jo
was intentionally hiding her.</i>

53
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:59,020
<i>But she appeared to testify.</i>

54
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:01,360
<i>She testified that
no illegal connections were used</i>

55
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:04,800
<i>to win the bid
for the Inseo redevelopment.</i>

56
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:07,170
<i>-In that case...
-Yes, that's correct.</i>

57
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:10,400
<i>You can tell by looking
at the change in numbers.</i>

58
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:12,300
<i>Ever since Ae-gyeong Kim testified,</i>

59
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:14,540
<i>Mayor Bae's approval rating</i>

60
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,680
<i>went up by six percent.</i>

61
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:19,240
<i>Hyeonseung Group's stock also went up</i>

62
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:21,380
<i>about 23% today to...</i>

63
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,585
Seong-cheol.

64
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:24,925
Yes?

65
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:28,425
You're taking that often lately. You okay?

66
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,720
Why wouldn't I be?

67
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,365
Take a break once this is over.

68
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,635
A break? What for?

69
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,670
Don't worry. I have Pil-sun.

70
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:43,105
She takes good care of me.

71
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,245
-Yes?
<i>-What will you do now?</i>

72
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:55,710
How will you get
Ae-gyeong Kim's testimony?

73
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,125
Do you have a plan?

74
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:01,625
I'm thinking it over.

75
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:05,295
So, you have no plan.

76
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:10,260
Why did you lose her?

77
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,265
Why did you lose her to Yeong-guk Jo?

78
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:17,075
If things go wrong, we're all dead.
Do you realize that?

79
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:24,085
Let's go classic. What we do best.

80
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:28,485
AE-GYEONG KIM ACCOUNTING OFFICE

81
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:31,325
We're with the Prosecutors' Office.

82
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,220
Hey. Search it all.

83
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,625
Ae-gyeong Kim!

84
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,065
-What is it?
-We're with the Prosecutors' Office.

85
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:42,365
We're executing
the search and seizure warrant.

86
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,765
Grab the laptops.

87
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,775
-<i>Let's corner her before we die ourselves.</i>
-Move quickly!

88
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,170
<i>Someone who dealt with dirty money
must've gotten her hands dirty.</i>

89
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:54,275
We'll dig into that woman's finances

90
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,815
<i>and find every detail
of every transaction she made.</i>

91
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:58,510
Ma'am.

92
00:05:58,515 --> 00:05:59,945
Check the drawers.

93
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:05,250
<i>-Dig deep,</i>
-Min-su.

94
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:07,850
<i>-bring me anyone who received</i>
-Mommy.

95
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:09,295
-It's okay.
<i>-a dime from her.</i>

96
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:10,790
Be careful!

97
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,020
<i>Get them to come voluntarily
or arrest them.</i>

98
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:14,835
<i>Just bring them to me by tomorrow.</i>

99
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:15,990
<i>So...</i>

100
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:17,500
-Hello?
<i>-Ae-gyeong.</i>

101
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:22,835
People suddenly barged in here,
supposedly from the Prosecutors' Office.

102
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:25,270
<i>They say the money I got from you</i>

103
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,440
was a gang's laundered money.

104
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:28,675
I'm coming.

105
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,680
Min-su, stay at your nanny's, okay?

106
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,680
<i>I know it's dirty, but we have no choice.
Just do it!</i>

107
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:40,555
-Please.
<i>-The police may fall,</i>

108
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:42,720
<i>but we cannot.</i>

109
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,020
Conglomerates may fall, but we cannot.

110
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:49,095
<i>The government may fall, but we cannot.</i>

111
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,000
-Dad.
-Ae-gyeong.

112
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,730
Why did you come here?

113
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:59,905
Dad. Everything will be fine,
so don't worry.

114
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,540
-Mom...
-Let's go.

115
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:06,910
-Dad.
-Mr. Kim.

116
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:10,085
<i>In Korea, we are the authority.</i>

117
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:11,955
We are the truth.

118
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:14,425
We are justice.

119
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:17,095
<i>If we fall,</i>

120
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,560
<i>our nation falls.</i>

121
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,865
Ae-gyeong.

122
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:24,135
I don't understand what's going on.

123
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:37,080
-Hello?
-The vendors are calling,

124
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:40,555
saying the prosecutors
are raiding their offices.

125
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,155
<i>They're being asked about
what their relationship is with you,</i>

126
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:46,255
<i>and about the money that was exchanged.</i>

127
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,055
What should I tell them?

128
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,590
<i>Hello?</i>

129
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,130
<i>Must we do that to people
who have nothing to do with Yeong-guk Jo?</i>

130
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,630
<i>We're trying to get Yeong-guk Jo,
not Ae-gyeong Kim.</i>

131
00:07:57,635 --> 00:07:59,230
It'll be a problem later.

132
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:03,105
If you worry about later,
you'll regret it later.

133
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:12,245
Which prosecutor issued the warrant?

134
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:16,185
<i>If we lose Yeong-guk Jo again,
we won't have another chance.</i>

135
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:18,955
<i>Do you want to get screwed over again
like three years ago?</i>

136
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:20,825
You said you got tough.

137
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:24,825
You said you could do anything
if you could catch him.

138
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:29,195
Then show me

139
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:32,805
how well you sharpened your knife
over the past three years.

140
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,440
I didn't do anything...

141
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:44,810
I followed the policies...

142
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,815
We'll investigate. So please be quiet.

143
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,085
What did I do wrong?

144
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,825
You must've brought me in
because I did something wrong.

145
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:55,320
-Please sit down.
-Is it a crime to be rich?

146
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,860
-Please...
-I followed the policies...

147
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:58,990
Why did you drag me down here
all day long?

148
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:01,130
-I never did anything wrong.
-Tell me!

149
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:02,695
I never washed money...

150
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,205
Mr. Woo.

151
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:09,035
It's okay. You don't have to say it.
I know.

152
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,645
This...

153
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,175
This isn't your idea, is it?

154
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:20,655
Keep up the good work.

155
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:31,925
Where should I go?

156
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,195
This way.

157
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:01,755
One <i>sundaeguk</i> and soju please.

158
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,920
I don't have any <i>sundaeguk</i>. I'm all out.

159
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,695
Then give me anything I can eat.

160
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,400
How long has he been here?

161
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:17,705
About two hours.

162
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,455
What are you doing here, Je-mun?

163
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:33,225
You're not the only regular here.

164
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,395
Why do you look like that?

165
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,220
Where's your wig?

166
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:39,995
I lost it while working.

167
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,295
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

168
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:49,530
Being a human rights lawyer
is good and all,

169
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:51,845
but think of your own rights too.

170
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,770
Whose rights was it about this time?

171
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,580
I'm representing the residents of Inseo

172
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:59,845
being displaced by the redevelopment.

173
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,415
I got a few punches in too.

174
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,185
I've always been a good fighter.

175
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:09,120
Seriously. Good for you.

176
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,625
Fight in the courtroom, will you?

177
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,660
Don't get beaten up on the streets.

178
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:14,995
Think of your well-being.

179
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,665
We need to get to the courtroom
to fight there.

180
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:24,170
When I was a prosecutor, I was there
more than I was in my own home.

181
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:25,670
That's how the court is.

182
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:29,245
Why did its walls get so high
once I retired?

183
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:34,610
Why do you live like that?

184
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,350
Live like the other guys.

185
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,520
Pick up some divorce cases and make money,

186
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,450
and buy a nice wig. Please.

187
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:42,490
Is this why you took the bar exam?

188
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:43,820
This isn't living.

189
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:47,290
Then what? What is "living well"?

190
00:11:47,295 --> 00:11:50,235
Teach me, so I can live like that.

191
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:59,345
Je-mun. You know,

192
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:03,475
I wish Seowon, our town

193
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:07,185
would be like this.

194
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:11,985
<i>Where common sense trumps senselessness.</i>

195
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,525
<i>I wish following the law
would trump cheating.</i>

196
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:22,535
I wish coexistence would trump
survival instincts.

197
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:25,735
I wish warm hearts would trump
cold hearts.

198
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:29,900
I wish nonviolence would trump violence.

199
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,175
<i>If our town is to be like that...</i>

200
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:37,180
<i>If our town has to become
where people don't get sick</i>

201
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,680
<i>and don't get hurt</i>

202
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,515
<i>as much as possible,</i>

203
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,785
this is the only way.

204
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:47,255
Lose every day, get beaten up every day,

205
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:49,095
and cry every day.

206
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:52,660
I don't know anything about it.

207
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:53,860
I've never seen it before.

208
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,090
Do you know Gwang-seon Oh?

209
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:56,265
No, I don't.

210
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,935
In 2016...

211
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:03,435
<i>Even if people mock me,</i>

212
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:07,645
<i>saying I'm stupid, stubborn, and clueless,</i>

213
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,815
<i>living like this...</i>

214
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:14,085
<i>Living like this and changing it...</i>

215
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:20,025
That's what I must do
to be proud of myself.

216
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:23,895
Every town needs an idiot like me.

217
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,095
A few more would be nicer.

218
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,135
Yes, Mr. Woo.

219
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:39,745
Let those people go.

220
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,410
Let's start over.

221
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:44,345
<i>Let's not harass innocent people.</i>

222
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,015
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:56,655
Excuse me.

224
00:13:58,665 --> 00:13:59,865
Let them all go.

225
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:04,665
I said to send them home.

226
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:07,130
Thank you for today.

227
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:09,875
We'll be in touch, so go home for today.

228
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:17,645
We'll treat you properly
like prosecutors next time.

229
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,425
Jun-hyeok, was it your idea to have
Ae-gyeong Kim

230
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:29,695
testify at the hearing?

231
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,200
Why are you hanging out
with Yeong-guk Jo and Sang-do Bae?

232
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:41,870
You weren't like that.

233
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,145
Don't you know what they're like?

234
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:47,305
Of course, I do.

235
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:49,040
I know very well.

236
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,480
Then why are you mingling with them?

237
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,515
Mayor Bae was voted by the people.

238
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:58,055
We should respect
the people's judgment and decision.

239
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,725
And what if the people judged incorrectly?

240
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,725
Why should we judge that?

241
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:08,595
Because we're prosecutors.

242
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,935
You think prosecutors can do anything?

243
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:15,205
Did you become a prosecutor
to gain authority?

244
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:17,335
Jun-hyeok.

245
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:19,870
Do you remember when we were

246
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,075
on the National Council
of Student Representatives?

247
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:24,345
You were so cool back then.

248
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:29,415
When you spoke on the platform
in front of hundreds of underclassmen,

249
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,885
you were so cool.

250
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:37,865
Do you know what I thought
when I saw you up there?

251
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:41,535
"That is authority.

252
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:45,805
That guy Jun-hyeok Ban has the authority."

253
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:47,205
That's what I thought.

254
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,935
What are you trying to say?

255
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,415
Where people are, is authority.

256
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:59,285
And if I don't grab it, someone else will.
That's how authority is.

257
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:02,010
You may deny it all you want,

258
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,680
but we prosecutors are authoritative,

259
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:06,720
and we prosecutors have authority.

260
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:09,655
That's why the government created us.

261
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:12,325
Stop mingling with them.

262
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:14,635
It'll look bad

263
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:18,665
if it gets out that he had a prosecutor
in his back pocket.

264
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,475
Do you understand?

265
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,305
I'm not sure.

266
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,810
We'll have to wait and see

267
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:29,910
which way things turn.

268
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:33,585
You don't seem to have
any more hands to play.

269
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:36,155
You've been cornered.

270
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,585
Many people suspect you too.

271
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:40,250
Think about it.

272
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:43,890
What if the knife
you were pointing at those people

273
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,260
suddenly targets you?

274
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:49,390
And what if everything
you wanted to hide so badly

275
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:51,105
all came to light?

276
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,930
Which way do you think things will go?

277
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,230
Jun-hyeok.

278
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,670
Are you threatening him?

279
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:58,305
It's okay.

280
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,815
Jun-hyeok.

281
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:06,045
Do you want to succeed that badly?

282
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,680
Enough to stab your own family?

283
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:09,955
There are

284
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:13,125
many people who are
in a different category than you.

285
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,555
You should know by now, don't you think?

286
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:29,605
So?

287
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,175
Where's Je-mun now?

288
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,525
Je-mun.

289
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,320
The chief prosecutor didn't look happy.

290
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,695
Did something happen?

291
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,175
Why did you let them go?

292
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:12,915
Holding her family hostage and forcing her
to say what we tell her to

293
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,055
is too degrading.

294
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,415
That's not what a prosecutor should do.

295
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:22,295
If it isn't, what should a prosecutor do?

296
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:26,820
I would like to keep professional
boundaries when we work.

297
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,895
We're not gangsters.

298
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,760
What are we doing,
detaining innocent people?

299
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:34,535
Do you think you're the only good,
true prosecutor?

300
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:39,075
That's why you'll never make it,
you moron.

301
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:45,645
Do you know why you aren't promoted,
while junior prosecutors surpass you?

302
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:47,850
You know that line you refuse to cross?

303
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:49,780
The others crossed it already.

304
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:53,050
Then what?
Should we torture Ae-gyeong Kim?

305
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,090
Should we bring her child as well
as her parents and lock them up?

306
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:57,925
Is that what I should do?

307
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:02,135
Yeong-guk Jo said last time

308
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:05,630
not to use someone I cherish
and want to keep close to me

309
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:08,505
for a long time to hold the dagger,
since he may die.

310
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:12,445
Do you know what I did?

311
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:17,315
You. I called you
to point the dagger at him.

312
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:22,755
Call them back in.
Call them back, and torture them.

313
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:24,620
Who knows?

314
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,655
I may not call you next time
for something like that.

315
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,250
I can't do that.

316
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:32,165
I can do anything to Yeong-guk Jo
and the East Gang.

317
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,460
I'll do anything you ask.

318
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,865
But let's not bring in innocent people
and show off our strength.

319
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:40,135
We're prosecutors after all.

320
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,335
Then kill him.

321
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:48,115
Go and kill Yeong-guk Jo.

322
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:53,145
You said you would do anything I ask.

323
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,825
What? You can't do it?

324
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:01,525
You have no guts whatsoever.

325
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:03,820
That's your problem.

326
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:07,025
That's why your wife left you, loser.

327
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:36,990
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

328
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,925
Hi, Ms. Kim. I heard you were called
into the Prosecutors' Office.

329
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:44,860
<i>Good work. Did anything happen?</i>

330
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:47,700
No, sir. Nothing happened.

331
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,575
Really? Nothing happened?

332
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,245
<i>Ms. Kim.</i>

333
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,775
<i>You're not hiding
something from me, are you?</i>

334
00:20:57,545 --> 00:21:00,685
Of course, not. I am not hiding anything.

335
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,085
Okay.

336
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,555
I believe you.

337
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,685
<i>Stop by when you have time.</i>

338
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:10,125
<i>Let's have dinner or something.
It's been a while.</i>

339
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:12,560
Yes, sir. Good night, sir.

340
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:13,795
Okay.

341
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:20,105
Tie up loose ends now, Sang-mo.

342
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:30,575
That feels refreshing.

343
00:21:42,195 --> 00:21:43,395
You took a while.

344
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:47,225
You haven't eaten yet, right?

345
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,910
You didn't tell my mom, right?

346
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:03,940
-About what?
-About what happened before.

347
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:05,445
If she finds out, I'm dead.

348
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:07,185
Exactly.

349
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:10,580
If you're worried about your mom,
don't go to places like that.

350
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:13,725
I'm not worried about my mom.
I'm worried about myself.

351
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:16,995
I'm the one who will die.
Anyway, keep your promise.

352
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:20,165
I won't forgive you if you tell my mom.

353
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,305
Kids these days.

354
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:40,315
Eat up before it gets cold.

355
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:50,455
It's good.

356
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:01,335
Sorry.

357
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:08,045
You should just eat first.

358
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:10,175
I wanted to live.

359
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:13,485
That's why I did it.

360
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:23,055
<i>If you can't take it anymore,</i>

361
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:25,425
if it's too hard to endure,

362
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:27,935
you should leave.

363
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:29,435
That's all.

364
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,165
So that I can end up like you?

365
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,375
<i>Lose everything I have, get hurt,</i>

366
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:40,705
and run a restaurant in a place like this?

367
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:43,010
I can't live like that.

368
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:44,245
No.

369
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,715
I won't make Min-su live like that.

370
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:49,980
I just need to endure it.

371
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:52,925
As long as I hold it in and endure it,
my son Min-su...

372
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,065
I just need to endure it.

373
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:07,405
Then everyone will be happy.

374
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:16,245
<i>You asked last time, right?</i>

375
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:21,915
<i>Whether we're living in the right times.</i>

376
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,850
<i>I suddenly feel like</i>

377
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:26,585
it's right for you,

378
00:24:28,955 --> 00:24:30,925
but not for me.

379
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:34,965
This damned life.

380
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:49,645
Did we get a new doctor?

381
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:58,755
Excuse me.

382
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,985
There was nothing injected.
Her condition hasn't changed.

383
00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:35,750
-Ju-myeong.
-Yes?

384
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:38,750
Put some boys here that we can trust.

385
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,085
Okay.

386
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:44,455
It was Yeong-guk Jo.

387
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:47,425
That bastard ordered it.

388
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,730
No. We don't know for sure yet, so...

389
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,200
Drop the bullshit.
We're not sure about what?

390
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:54,505
Who else would try to kill my sister?

391
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:58,275
He's taking out the trash.

392
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:00,370
Now that things are over,

393
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,215
he's trying to kill my sister again,

394
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:05,545
since he failed the first time.

395
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,025
There's no way

396
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,255
to catch those bastards now, right?

397
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:26,165
Say something!

398
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:33,075
Let's go before my sister gets back.

399
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,355
Shouldn't we stop him? He seems dangerous.

400
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:52,195
You're kidding, right?

401
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:55,790
Gang-ju may kill Yeong-guk Jo.

402
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:57,465
You know that as well.

403
00:27:57,835 --> 00:28:00,605
Just leave him. Let him do whatever.

404
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:09,145
To be honest, I don't know...

405
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:13,685
I don't know
what kind of a person you are.

406
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:18,155
Earlier, you said to let those people go,
and now...

407
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:19,955
I mean...

408
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:24,795
Aiding and abetting a murder is a crime.

409
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:28,260
Hey. You think people

410
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:31,735
are either black or white, right?
But they're not.

411
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:34,700
Everyone in this world is gray.

412
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:36,300
You should know by now.

413
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:37,835
Even still...

414
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:42,810
What are you trying to do?

415
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:45,280
I'm saying we shouldn't do anything.

416
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:47,580
Whether or not Gang-ju kills Yeong-guk Jo,

417
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:49,210
you cover your eyes and ears,

418
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,385
and stay quiet. Is that so hard?

419
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:55,355
Sir.

420
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,265
Hey.

421
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:00,525
Jin-pyeong.

422
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:05,865
You can't understand why I'm dying
to get Yeong-guk Jo so badly, can you?

423
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:24,610
<i>It was their assertion</i>

424
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:28,120
<i>that Yeong-guk Jo was intentionally
hiding her.</i>

425
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:31,090
<i>But she appeared to testify.</i>

426
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:32,495
<i>She testified...</i>

427
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:44,135
Find out Yeong-guk Jo's schedule.

428
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:49,675
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

429
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:51,845
Starting tomorrow...

430
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:57,415
can you track Gang-ju, please?

431
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:18,405
It's still quiet so far.

432
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:20,800
What is this about?

433
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:23,210
<i>Why did you ask me
to track Gang-ju out of the blue?</i>

434
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:25,040
<i>It's nothing big.</i>

435
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:26,615
Well...

436
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:30,015
The thing is...

437
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:35,590
<i>Depending on the situation,
it may become big.</i>

438
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:37,755
What are you talking about?

439
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:40,490
Did Mr. Woo order this...

440
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:42,160
No, he did not.

441
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:44,565
<i>I'm doing this on my own.</i>

442
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:46,965
<i>So...</i>

443
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:51,235
<i>I would prefer that</i>

444
00:30:52,705 --> 00:30:55,340
<i>Mr. Woo doesn't find out about this.
Do you understand?</i>

445
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:58,840
I'll take the blame
and any responsibility for this,

446
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:02,280
so please just let me know
wherever Gang-ju goes.

447
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:04,580
<i>I'll make sure you aren't hurt by this.</i>

448
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:06,255
You can do that much, right?

449
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,225
Just tell me this.

450
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:11,765
No one will get hurt
because of this, right?

451
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,625
It's to live...

452
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:19,665
I'm doing this so that we can all live.

453
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,175
Please trust me on this one.

454
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:26,745
Okay.

455
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:29,015
I'll let you know
if Gang-ju goes anywhere.

456
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:32,315
Okay. Thank you.

457
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,115
Okay.

458
00:31:49,295 --> 00:31:50,995
Hold on.

459
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:00,165
Hey, Gang-ju!

460
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,505
You punk. What are you trying to do?

461
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:09,745
Is that a knife in your hand?

462
00:33:12,545 --> 00:33:13,745
Hey, Gang-ju!

463
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:19,225
You punk. What are you trying to do?

464
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:23,455
Is that a knife in your hand?

465
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:44,015
<i>Gang-ju ran.</i>

466
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,910
<i>He took a weapon with him.</i>

467
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:47,580
I don't know where he went.

468
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:49,755
<i>What's going on right now?</i>

469
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:26,150
Wow. There are a lot of you.

470
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:29,195
Hello, I'm Yeong-guk Jo of Hyeonseung.

471
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:37,690
My employees
will explain the details slowly,

472
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:41,635
and in easy-to-understand terms shortly.

473
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,830
To be honest,
I don't understand it either.

474
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:46,205
There are too many big words.

475
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,245
Shit.

476
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:57,510
There is only one thing
I can tell all of you

477
00:34:57,515 --> 00:34:59,280
gathered here today.

478
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:00,655
"Inseo is a town

479
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:03,950
where people who have nothing
gather and live!

480
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:05,860
They are leeches

481
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:09,360
who eat up our tax money!
Those Inseo bastards!"

482
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:10,730
Many people are saying that.

483
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,730
How close are the Inseo bastards?

484
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,300
They're almost here.

485
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:15,200
You're here today

486
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,130
-because you're trying to survive too.
-Damn it.

487
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:18,300
Those annoying bastards.

488
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:19,745
Should we call the boys?

489
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:24,640
-It may be ugly now, but it won't be
-Call over the chairman's bodyguards.

490
00:35:24,645 --> 00:35:26,245
once it is redeveloped.

491
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:36,125
Bundang started with shacks,

492
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:40,225
Seocho was farmland
and there's nothing but water at Haeundae.

493
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:43,890
But look how they are living now.

494
00:35:43,895 --> 00:35:46,730
They're doing well and are proud now.

495
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,805
Why do you think that is so?

496
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:56,715
People!

497
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,710
It's because the people changed.

498
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:01,880
Once the people changed,
the surroundings changed.

499
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:04,155
Once the surroundings changed...

500
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:07,925
My gosh. The land price changed.

501
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:11,055
INSEO REDEVELOPMENT PRESENTATION

502
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:17,760
The Inseo that I envision

503
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:19,560
will be the same.

504
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:22,770
A town where if you say,
"I live in Inseo,"

505
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:25,600
everyone will envy you.

506
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:28,305
I'll turn it into a town like that.

507
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:30,910
You know I do
anything I set my mind to, right?

508
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:32,485
Yes!

509
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:43,925
Should we block the entrance?

510
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:46,560
Send the boys back to the chairman.

511
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:48,395
-Sorry?
-Send them back!

512
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:52,330
I ended up talking for too long.

513
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,035
Listen to the presentation now.

514
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:09,015
Thank you.

515
00:37:51,655 --> 00:37:54,160
We oppose the Inseo redevelopment!

516
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:56,160
We oppose!

517
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:58,190
Lock up Yeong-guk Jo!

518
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:02,030
Lock him up!

519
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:03,830
Best in the country? That's garbage!

520
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:05,170
Garbage!

521
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:07,605
Mr. Chairman, we want to talk!

522
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:50,055
Let's not go that far.

523
00:38:58,255 --> 00:38:59,665
That bastard!

524
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:09,935
Let go!

525
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,475
Die!

526
00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:14,805
Damn it!

527
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:35,665
Kill that bastard!

528
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:38,865
Kill him!

529
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:44,605
Chairman Jo!

530
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:59,885
<i>Hey. Jin-pyeong.</i>

531
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:04,750
<i>You can't understand why I'm dying
to get Yeong-guk Jo so badly, do you?</i>

532
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:07,365
That bastard manipulates people.

533
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:10,465
<i>"I have authority and money,
and you don't.</i>

534
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:13,005
<i>Those with, are on my side.
Those without, are enemies.</i>

535
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:15,030
<i>Those without are trying to take from us,</i>

536
00:40:15,035 --> 00:40:16,330
<i>so fight with me."</i>

537
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:18,370
<i>That's how he starts a fight
between people,</i>

538
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,175
<i>and hides behind them.</i>

539
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:23,045
Isn't he an evil bastard?

540
00:40:23,845 --> 00:40:25,140
<i>That's life.</i>

541
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:27,715
<i>If you don't have anything,
you can't succeed in anything.</i>

542
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:29,315
<i>When that happens,</i>

543
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:32,320
<i>you get nervous,
which leads to resentment.</i>

544
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:34,150
<i>Resentment leads to misery.</i>

545
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:35,950
<i>That's why murders occur.</i>

546
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:39,325
<i>The killer and the killed
both become miserable.</i>

547
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:43,595
Hey. Must we live like that?

548
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:45,330
<i>Must we keep fighting?</i>

549
00:40:45,335 --> 00:40:48,500
<i>If you have money, you should help.
If you don't, ask for help.</i>

550
00:40:48,505 --> 00:40:50,370
<i>Isn't that human decency?</i>

551
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,105
<i>Isn't that how we should live?</i>

552
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:58,015
Yes.

553
00:41:00,045 --> 00:41:02,215
I understand what you mean, but...

554
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:08,785
You're toying with Gang-ju too.

555
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:13,595
Then what makes you any different
from Yeong-guk Jo?

556
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:18,635
-What was that?
-What the heck?

557
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:29,415
This...

558
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:32,745
This isn't right.

559
00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:44,495
<i>Gang-ju was there today?</i>

560
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:45,925
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

561
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:48,560
My instincts told me to stop him,

562
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:50,465
so I was able to this time...

563
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,630
But those rats will try again.

564
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:58,805
How could civil servants
do something like that?

565
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:02,515
Those bastards

566
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:05,980
must've been there to kill me, right?

567
00:42:05,985 --> 00:42:08,345
Yes, I believe so.

568
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:09,550
<i>Okay.</i>

569
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:13,025
If that's what you think, it must be true.

570
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:15,825
<i>What do you think we should do?</i>

571
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:19,290
How do you think we should punish them?

572
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:21,095
Tell me your opinion.

573
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:47,955
To be honest,

574
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:51,155
I didn't think you would go there.

575
00:42:52,095 --> 00:42:53,525
What do you mean?

576
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:58,130
I thought you would leave Gang-ju alone
to cause trouble.

577
00:42:58,135 --> 00:43:00,860
Hey, I'm still a prosecutor.

578
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:02,535
Exactly.

579
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:06,645
I realized for the first time
that you were a prosecutor.

580
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:11,170
You punk. Don't start with me.

581
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:13,885
I'm just happy, that's why.

582
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:17,950
You're a prosecutor,
and I'm an investigator.

583
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:20,850
When people like us do something,

584
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:23,850
it's by governmental authority.

585
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:26,360
Governmental authority
can't ignore the law

586
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:29,690
and kill people directly and stuff.

587
00:43:29,695 --> 00:43:31,735
People like us

588
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:34,200
shouldn't like using a knife.

589
00:43:34,205 --> 00:43:36,000
It should stink.

590
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:41,370
We should think the law is the best thing

591
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,715
in the world. Don't you agree?

592
00:43:53,685 --> 00:43:55,655
I think Sang-mo Ha

593
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:57,990
saw Gang-ju's face earlier.

594
00:43:57,995 --> 00:44:00,020
Protect him well, Ju-myeong.

595
00:44:00,025 --> 00:44:02,590
He may retaliate.

596
00:44:02,595 --> 00:44:04,795
Yes, sir. Of course.

597
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:06,705
Of course, we must.

598
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:10,375
Why are you in such a good mood today?

599
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:13,475
Did something good happen?
Did your wife go to her parents?

600
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:26,180
Why did you tell me, when you promised
Jin-pyeong you would keep it a secret?

601
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:27,485
Out of loyalty?

602
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:32,720
No. Allegiance.

603
00:44:32,725 --> 00:44:36,395
I know I've been all over,
like some peddler,

604
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:38,930
but I'm your investigator.

605
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:42,465
Forever. I'm yours.

606
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,570
You punk. Listen to you.

607
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:47,845
You're like this to other people too,
aren't you?

608
00:44:48,775 --> 00:44:50,815
It's a trade secret.

609
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:52,740
I need to pee.

610
00:44:52,745 --> 00:44:55,715
I must be incontinent.
I keep having to pee lately.

611
00:45:27,985 --> 00:45:29,185
Yes?

612
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:33,385
Yes, I'm fine.

613
00:45:36,755 --> 00:45:40,160
<i>Due to raised suspicions,
a public hearing is in progress.</i>

614
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:43,460
<i>The conflict between the people
regarding the Inseo redevelopment</i>

615
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,165
<i>is intensifying.</i>

616
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:46,300
<i>In Seowon...</i>

617
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:47,865
Is it bad?

618
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:51,335
I'm fine.

619
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:54,305
I'll go get it.

620
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,185
Hey.

621
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:04,655
Go to the hospital.

622
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:08,855
What will you do without me?

623
00:46:09,195 --> 00:46:10,990
You'll really die at that rate.

624
00:46:10,995 --> 00:46:13,365
What are you babbling about?

625
00:46:13,865 --> 00:46:15,220
Don't worry about me, and go.

626
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:17,665
You should go to the hospital
if you're not well.

627
00:46:17,795 --> 00:46:18,960
Not like they would...

628
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:21,165
What the heck...

629
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:25,675
Let's talk when I get back.

630
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,615
Shit.

631
00:46:32,045 --> 00:46:33,310
Damn it.

632
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:35,810
<i>A brawl broke out among the people</i>

633
00:46:35,815 --> 00:46:38,710
<i>regarding the Inseo redevelopment.</i>

634
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:42,080
<i>This morning,
at the Inseo Redevelopment Presentation,</i>

635
00:46:42,085 --> 00:46:45,390
<i>both people for and against
the redevelopment appeared,</i>

636
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:47,725
<i>and five people were injured.</i>

637
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:50,390
<i>Some of the oppositionists</i>

638
00:46:50,395 --> 00:46:52,860
<i>crashed the presentation and threw eggs</i>

639
00:46:52,865 --> 00:46:54,605
<i>-at Chairman Jo.</i>
-Hello.

640
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:56,930
<i>-It's a valued project</i>
-Kimchi stew please.

641
00:46:56,935 --> 00:46:58,330
<i>of Seowon and Hyeonseung Group.</i>

642
00:46:58,335 --> 00:47:00,100
<i>-The redevelopment is expected</i>
-Okay.

643
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:02,445
<i>to face difficulties.</i>

644
00:47:02,575 --> 00:47:05,040
<i>What do you think about it?</i>

645
00:47:05,045 --> 00:47:08,010
<i>Well, the presentation
held in Inseo in Seowon City</i>

646
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:10,580
<i>came to an abrupt end.</i>

647
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:13,580
<i>Those who oppose the redevelopment</i>

648
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:15,750
<i>and attendants of the presentation</i>

649
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:17,250
<i>created mayhem at the venue.</i>

650
00:47:17,255 --> 00:47:18,495
<i>The attendants...</i>

651
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:23,735
So cold.

652
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:25,800
What?

653
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:29,405
Why won't this work?

654
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,745
Hi.

655
00:47:41,885 --> 00:47:43,610
My child has a fever.

656
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,980
I have to take her to the doctor,
but I have no car.

657
00:47:45,985 --> 00:47:49,125
Could you give us a ride?

658
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:05,605
Why is it so small suddenly?

659
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:11,010
Well, I only get what they give me, so...

660
00:48:11,015 --> 00:48:13,245
Then you should ask for more, you bastard.

661
00:48:15,345 --> 00:48:16,850
What's wrong? What is it?

662
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,525
-Pardon?
-You're sweating. Are you sick?

663
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:23,355
No. That... That's not it.

664
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:31,735
I don't... I don't have a choice
about this either.

665
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:34,365
What are you talking about?
No choice about what?

666
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:40,575
You're high, aren't you?

667
00:48:47,445 --> 00:48:49,185
What's taking her so long?

668
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:12,575
Damn it!

669
00:49:14,575 --> 00:49:16,575
Shit. This punk.

670
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:40,660
You're not skimming, are you?

671
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:43,605
No. I didn't do that.

672
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:49,275
I... I'm sorry.

673
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:50,870
I'm so... so sorry.

674
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,570
Stop stuttering, and talk properly.

675
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,145
Sorry.

676
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:55,915
About what?

677
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,885
What?

678
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:00,285
Okay, good night.

679
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:05,455
Here you go.

680
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:37,755
Who are you?

681
00:50:44,995 --> 00:50:46,435
You little...

682
00:50:47,635 --> 00:50:49,605
-Ju-myeong.
-Mr. Woo...

683
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:04,715
Let go!

684
00:51:06,385 --> 00:51:07,885
Damn it, let go!

685
00:51:09,825 --> 00:51:11,025
Let go!

686
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:21,605
What are you doing?

687
00:51:24,575 --> 00:51:26,240
Don't come here.

688
00:51:26,245 --> 00:51:27,305
Pil-sun!

689
00:54:22,285 --> 00:54:24,055
Damn, you bastard!

690
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,515
Hey.

691
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:07,315
<i>Every town needs an idiot like me.</i>

692
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:10,115
<i>A few more would be nicer.</i>

693
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:14,425
Look.

694
00:57:16,355 --> 00:57:18,290
I'm sorry to say this,

695
00:57:18,295 --> 00:57:20,325
but that's nonsense.

696
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:37,645
<i>If common sense trumped senselessness,
it wouldn't be like this.</i>

697
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:42,780
<i>If following the law trumped cheating,</i>

698
00:57:42,785 --> 00:57:44,255
<i>we wouldn't be here.</i>

699
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:46,215
<i>This wouldn't have happened to you.</i>

700
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:57,365
They asked me to just call you over.

701
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:15,685
Pil-sun.

702
00:59:07,365 --> 00:59:10,535
<i>Look at you. What is that?</i>

703
00:59:11,135 --> 00:59:12,435
Our town

704
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,670
won't end up how you wish it to be.

705
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:16,475
<i>If it could, it would've already.</i>

706
00:59:35,095 --> 00:59:36,935
<i>Just keep living with that attitude.</i>

707
00:59:37,235 --> 00:59:39,235
I'll continue cleaning up dirty shit.

708
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:05,055
So? What do you want to tell me?

709
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:09,125
-I have a favor to ask.
-What?

710
01:00:09,525 --> 01:00:12,430
I don't care if they're detectives
or our guys.

711
01:00:12,435 --> 01:00:14,635
Send me 20.

712
01:00:15,435 --> 01:00:20,345
Then I'll bring you that bastard
Yeong-guk Jo's head.

713
01:00:20,775 --> 01:00:22,640
You want an all-out war?

714
01:00:22,645 --> 01:00:24,475
There will be consequences.

715
01:00:26,545 --> 01:00:28,315
I don't care.

716
01:00:29,145 --> 01:00:30,815
I'll quit if they want me to.

717
01:00:31,485 --> 01:00:33,485
I'll go to jail if they want me to.

718
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:36,555
Just let me kill Yeong-guk Jo.

719
01:00:37,455 --> 01:00:39,155
That's all I ask.

720
01:00:45,995 --> 01:00:47,265
Hello, Commissioner.

721
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:50,375
Can you send me ten guys?

722
01:01:00,315 --> 01:01:01,940
Hold on. Hello?

723
01:01:01,945 --> 01:01:05,485
<i>I want ten of my men and ten of yours
to do something.</i>

724
01:01:06,855 --> 01:01:10,120
What kind of guys do you want?

725
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,525
You want young guys who fight well, right?

726
01:01:13,925 --> 01:01:15,225
It doesn't matter.

727
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:17,535
Just scumbags.

728
01:01:19,165 --> 01:01:20,830
Scumbags will do.

729
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:22,200
Yes. No.

730
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:24,575
I can talk. Go ahead.

731
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:27,005
What? Go ahead.

732
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:29,375
Yes.

733
01:01:32,175 --> 01:01:33,685
Yes, sir. I'll go now.

734
01:01:34,985 --> 01:01:38,255
Hear that? Send me ten scumbags.

735
01:01:38,985 --> 01:01:41,950
Shit. Do you have wet wipes in the car?

736
01:01:41,955 --> 01:01:42,950
-Yes.
-You do?

737
01:01:42,955 --> 01:01:44,990
-Yes.
-We have to go. We've been called.

738
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,025
By whom?

739
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:48,020
-Je-mun Woo.
-Je-mun Woo?

740
01:01:48,025 --> 01:01:49,490
Did you pack the stuff?

741
01:01:49,495 --> 01:01:51,030
-Yes. Here it is.
-Good.

742
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:53,395
-Did you check it?
-Yes, I did.

743
01:01:53,735 --> 01:01:55,860
<i>-Satisfied?</i>
-Hurry up!

744
01:01:55,865 --> 01:01:57,405
<i>Now, go get Yeong-guk Jo.</i>

745
01:01:58,805 --> 01:02:01,275
<i>Catch him and kill him.</i>

746
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:05,275
Remember this. If you fall,

747
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,615
Korea falls.

748
01:02:41,515 --> 01:02:44,215
<i>Je-mun Woo. How much does he know?</i>

749
01:02:44,715 --> 01:02:46,080
<i>Should we kill Yeong-guk Jo?</i>

750
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:48,555
That doesn't sound so bad,
if that would end it.

751
01:02:48,755 --> 01:02:49,850
<i>I'll also fight dirty now.</i>

752
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,220
<i>Don't even think of leaving
until we kill Yeong-guk Jo.</i>

753
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:53,720
<i>Kill before you get killed.</i>

754
01:02:53,725 --> 01:02:56,060
<i>How did we end up here?</i>

755
01:02:56,065 --> 01:02:59,060
<i>In the Seowon that I envision,
there's no place for Chairman Jo.</i>

756
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:00,465
Where's Yeong-guk Jo?

757
01:03:01,705 --> 01:03:04,730
Who hired you? Who was it?

758
01:03:04,735 --> 01:03:07,445
<i>You still don't get
what's happening, do you?</i>

759
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:09,505
<i>Shut up, you bastard.</i>
