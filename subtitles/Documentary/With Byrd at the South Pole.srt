1
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:41,022
Damn it! My little brother's trying
to follow me to school again.

2
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:44,262
Ike, you can't come to school with me.

3
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:48,802
- Go home, you little dildo.
- Dude, don't call my brother a dildo.

4
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:50,772
- What's a dildo?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:54,312
- Cartman doesn't know either.
- I know what it is!

6
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:57,212
- Well, what?
- I'm not telling you.

7
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:59,472
What's a dildo, Kenny?

8
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:06,512
Yeah, that's what Kyle's
little brother is, all right.

9
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,222
- That kicks ass.
- Check this one out.

10
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:13,662
- Ready, Ike? Kick the baby.
- Don't kick the baby.

11
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,232
Kick the baby.

12
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:20,992
Looks like you didn't get much sleep.

13
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:24,972
- I had these bogus nightmares.
- Really? What about?

14
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:29,412
Well, I dreamt that I was lying
in my bed, in the dark...

15
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:33,812
...when all of a sudden,
this bright blue light filled the room.

16
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:38,282
And slowly my bedroom door opened.
The next thing I remember...

17
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:41,352
...I was being dragged
through a hallway.

18
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:45,982
Then I was on a table, and these
scary aliens wanted to operate on me.

19
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,792
And they had big heads and black eyes.

20
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:51,062
- Dude, visitors!
- What?

21
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:55,332
- Those were visitors.
- It was just a dream. My mom said so.

22
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:59,372
- They're are real.
- They abduct people and mutilate cows.

23
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:03,502
Shut up. You're trying to scare me,
and it's not working.

24
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:06,342
- Hello, children.
- Hey, Chef.

25
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:10,922
- What's for lunch today?
- Salisbury steak with buttered noodles.

26
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:14,922
- Bean casserole or vegetable medley.
- Kick ass.

27
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:18,532
Did any of you see
the alien spaceship last night?

28
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,252
Yeah, fat boy saw it.

29
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,302
That was just a dream.
And I'm not fat, I'm big-boned!

30
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:27,922
Was it the ones with the big heads
and black eyes?

31
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:32,272
- They took him on their ship.
- Did they give you an anal probe?

32
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,432
What's that?

33
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,632
That's when they put a metal hoop
up your butt.

34
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:42,152
- They gave you an anal probe, Cartman?
- No! I mean, why would they do that?

35
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:45,582
They did, huh?
Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!

36
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,752
- Anal probe.
- Shut up, dildo!

37
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:51,222
I gotta get to the cafeteria.
Watch that fat boy, now.

38
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:53,492
He could be under alien control.

39
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:00,432
They were real. Sorry about your ass.

40
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:05,372
Goddamn it, they didn't do anything
to my ass! It was just a dream.

41
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:10,012
- Why you walking so funny?
- Shut up!

42
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:12,342
No, Ike, go home.

43
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,542
This is it. This one's for the game.
Kick the baby.

44
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:23,292
- Good morning, Mrs. Crabtree.
- Sit down, we're late!

45
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:30,232
- He's still there.
- Don't worry.

46
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:33,892
If something happens to him,
my parents will blame me.

47
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,372
Sit down back there!

48
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,472
- Whatever, you fat bitch.
- What did you say?!

49
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:42,012
I said, I have a bad itch.

50
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,542
Oh, my God!

51
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,712
- Visitors!
- Oh, no!

52
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:50,512
Ike! Stop the bus!

53
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:53,282
You have to stop this bus!

54
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,252
- Do you want an office referral?
- No.

55
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:58,192
- Then sit down!
- But l...

56
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:09,972
- Are those the same visitors you saw?
- Shut up, it's not working.

57
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:12,732
- We have to do something.
- We can't.

58
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:16,212
- That fat bitch won't let us.
- What did you say?!

59
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:21,822
- I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
- Well, yes, they certainly do.

60
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:26,992
What am I gonna do? My brother
has been abducted by aliens.

61
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,122
You farted.

62
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:32,052
Somebody's baking brownies.

63
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,862
That's the third cow this month.

64
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:44,632
At this rate, all my cattle will die
before the winter's through.

65
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:49,612
This isn't unusual. Cows turn
themselves inside out all the time.

66
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:54,012
People been saying
they've seen UFOs around.

67
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,212
UFOs?

68
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:59,382
And black Army CIA helicopters
and trucks.

69
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:03,652
That is the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

70
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,102
- What was that?
- That was a pigeon.

71
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,602
What am I supposed to do?

72
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:16,002
Just stand here and watch my cattle
get mutilated one by one?

73
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:20,202
My cattle!

74
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:27,412
See? There is something
funny going on.

75
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:31,612
There's nothing funny going on.
I'll get those cows back.

76
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:39,492
And now our friend Mr. Hat is going
to tell us about Christopher Columbus.

77
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:41,532
That's right, Mr. Garrison.

78
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:46,402
Columbus discovered America
and was the Indians' best friend.

79
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:50,402
He helped them win their war
against Frederick Douglass...

80
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:54,912
...and freed the Hebrews from Napoleon
and discovered France.

81
00:05:55,082 --> 00:06:00,512
I have to help my stupid brother. If I
go home without him, my dad will yell:

82
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:04,382
"Where's your brother?
You weren't looking out for him."

83
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:07,492
- Let's go find him.
- "He can't think on his own.

84
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,722
Brush and floss.
Where has that finger been?"

85
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,762
- Dude!
- Is there a problem?

86
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,662
- Yes, I have to go now.
- Really, Kyle?

87
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:21,772
- What is it? Another prostate tumor?
- My brother's been abducted by aliens.

88
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:25,502
It's true. Ask Cartman.
They gave him an anal probe.

89
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:30,172
- That's a little joke.
- Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go.

90
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:34,542
- Can I please be excused?
- I don't know. Did you ask Mr. Hat?

91
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:37,512
I don't wanna ask Mr. Hat.
I'm asking you!

92
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:42,892
- I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
- Mr. Hat, may I please be excused?

93
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:46,462
Well, Kyle, no!
You hear me? You go to hell!

94
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:50,832
You go to hell and you die!
You'll have to take your seat.

95
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:54,632
- Damn it!
- Ha-ha, Mr. Hat yelled at you.

96
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:57,132
- My ass!
- Damn, Cartman!

97
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:01,782
- My ass!
- Dude, he's farting fire!

98
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:05,742
It's the alien anal probe.
It's shooting fire from his rectum!

99
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:07,712
No, that was just a dream.

100
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:12,182
Do you need to sit in the corner
until your gas is under control?

101
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:15,292
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.

102
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:30,292
You cows can't get on this train.
This is a people train.

103
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:35,412
You cows have no business on a
people train, all right? You're cows.

104
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:40,242
Don't try any of that cow hypnosis
on me, all right?

105
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:44,322
- Because it's not gonna work.
- Hold it right there, cows.

106
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:46,512
Come back here!

107
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:58,232
- I sure am hungry.
- How can you eat when you fart fire?

108
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:01,202
Shut up, you're being
totally immature.

109
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:04,342
- Look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
- Where?

110
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:26,732
- Stan wants to kiss Wendy Testaburger
- Shut up, fat ass, I don't like her.

111
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:31,662
I'm not fat. You like her because
you throw up when she talks to you.

112
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,392
- I do not.
- Hi, guys.

113
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:34,732
Hi, Wendy.

114
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:38,272
Here, Stan, this is for you.

115
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,812
Bye, Wendy.

116
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:42,472
Dude, what does the note say?

117
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:46,812
Holy crap! She wants to meet me
at Stark's Pond after school.

118
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:50,782
- Whoa, maybe you can kiss her.
- Or slip her the tongue.

119
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:55,492
What? How do you know she has a cat?

120
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:03,352
Let's figure out how to ditch school
so we can get Ike back.

121
00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:05,902
Hello, children. How are you?

122
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:07,502
- Bad.
- Why bad?

123
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,472
Have you ever had something happen
but nobody believed you?

124
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:16,842
Children, that's a problem we've all
had to face at some time or another.

125
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:21,452
Here, let me sing you a little song.
It might clear things up.

126
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:44,132
Chef!

127
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,342
- Do you feel better?
- No.

128
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:53,112
Come on, children, what can be so bad?
It's Salisbury-steak day.

129
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:56,642
- Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
- What?!

130
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:59,792
What are you doing
eating Salisbury steak?

131
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:02,582
- Find him!
- Mr. Garrison won't let us go.

132
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:06,662
- He thinks we're making it up.
- You are making it up.

133
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:14,992
- What?
- That was cool!

134
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:18,572
It's some kind of symbiotic
metamorphosis device.

135
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:22,072
This could mean the visitors
want to talk to us.

136
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:25,242
I see. You're joining in on the joke.

137
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:28,042
It's no joke, children. This is big.

138
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:31,482
If I don't get out of school
and get Ike back...

139
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,652
...my parents will disown me.

140
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:36,952
Hold on now.
You got to help the children.

141
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:40,692
You guys are going a long way
to try and scare me.

142
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:42,992
I want my Salisbury steak.

143
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:48,502
Fire drill, fire drill! Everybody out!
Okay, children, this is your chance.

144
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:51,232
Killer. Thanks, Chef.

145
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:56,842
First contact with the alien visitors.
I've gotta get myself ready.

146
00:10:57,012 --> 00:11:00,412
We got out of school
No more school today

147
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,242
We got out of school

148
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:07,412
- You guys, my ass, seriously!
- Okay, you can stop farting fire now.

149
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:11,652
- I can't, you son of a bitch!
- How do we get my brother back?

150
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:14,802
Would you stop going on
about your brother?

151
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:18,262
It was just a dream!
I didn't have an anal probe!

152
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,922
I am not under alien control!

153
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:35,552
- What was that?
- He is under alien control.

154
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:40,622
- His butt's linked up to the visitors.
- Son of a bitch!

155
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:46,992
Guys, shut up.
I'm not under alien control.

156
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:51,622
If you visitors can hear me,
bring back my brother, goddamn it!

157
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:54,292
That hurts, you butt-licker!

158
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,262
- Kyle, look, it's them.
- Give me back my brother!

159
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:06,572
- Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!
- You bastards!

160
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:11,982
Come back here! Come back!
Damn it, we were so close!

161
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:15,592
Hey, look. I think Kenny's okay.

162
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:26,962
Wow, poor Kenny.

163
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,232
- Now do you believe us?
- No.

164
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:32,402
- Cartman, they killed Kenny.
- He's not dead.

165
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:35,542
Dude, Kenny is dead. See?

166
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,702
- Shut up, you guys.
- He's dead, Cartman.

167
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:43,942
Damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!
Screw you guys, I'm going home.

168
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:48,022
- Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
- Dildo!

169
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:51,852
- You're all I have left.
- Sorry, I gotta meet Wendy.

170
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:56,622
You can't. Poor Ike must be so scared,
up there all alone. Help me.

171
00:12:56,802 --> 00:13:01,362
Like Chef says, "I'm getting a piece
of loving while the getting's hot."

172
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:02,532
Rats!

173
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:07,102
- Hello, Eric.
- Hi, Mom.

174
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:10,402
- How are you doing?
- Well, I'm pissed off.

175
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,042
Here, I made you powdered-doughnut
pancake surprise.

176
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:18,022
I don't want it!
All the kids in school call me fat.

177
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:21,382
- You're not fat, you're big-boned.
- That's what I said.

178
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:24,652
You can have an eensy-weensy bit,
can't you?

179
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:28,732
- Just a weensy-eensy woo-woo?
- No. Leave me alone, Mom.

180
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:32,462
How about a nice chocolate
chicken potpie then?

181
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:35,532
Well, that does sound pretty good.

182
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,842
- Mom?
- Yes, hon?

183
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:41,242
If anybody calls or visits,
I'm not here, okay?

184
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:45,872
- Sure. You want some Cheesy Poofs too?
- Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.

185
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:52,182
She's not coming.
Let's look for the visitors.

186
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:55,912
- But her note said she'd be here.
- Hi, Stan.

187
00:13:56,522 --> 00:14:01,622
- He throws up when you talk to him.
- But why, Stan?

188
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:05,432
Would you get down to business
so we can find Ike?

189
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:09,132
- Make sweet love by the fire.
- What happened to Ike?

190
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:11,332
As UFO sightings increase...

191
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:16,032
...more mysterious crop-circle
patterns are appearing in fields.

192
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:20,672
These crop circles, when viewed
from above, form strange patterns.

193
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,912
Hey, that kind of looks
like Tom Selleck.

194
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:28,892
Could it be that aliens are trying
to make contact with us on Earth?

195
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:35,162
No, Kitty, this is my potpie.

196
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,702
No, Kitty, you bad kitty.
No, Kitty, this is my potpie!

197
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:42,932
Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!

198
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:48,632
Then I know a certain kitty-kitty
who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.

199
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:50,742
What?!

200
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:54,752
I have to go home without him,
and my parents will kill me.

201
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:57,352
- Why don't you get the fat kid?
- Why?

202
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:01,152
If the fat kid has something
implanted in his ass...

203
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:04,222
...maybe he's a part
of the visitors' plan.

204
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:07,662
Use the fat kid as bait
to bring them back.

205
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:11,662
You're right. Come on, Stan.
We have to get Cartman.

206
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,992
Come on, Stan.

207
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:18,102
Hey, wait. When do I get
to make sweet love?

208
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:25,042
No, Kitty, you can't have any!

209
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:30,012
No, Kitty, this is my potpie!
Bad kitty!

210
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:32,752
Excuse me, Kitty.

211
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:36,222
- Eric, look who's here.
- Good work, Mom!

212
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:39,592
- Let's play at the bus stop.
- I can't, Mom says...

213
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:43,422
That's okay. You need to spend time
with your friends.

214
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:47,032
- But I don't want to spend time...
- Don't be difficult!

215
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:52,232
- Now, you go and play in the fun snow.
- Goddamn it!

216
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:57,572
- I have to get home.
- Don't be such a fraidy cat.

217
00:15:57,752 --> 00:16:01,702
This rope will make sure
they can't take you onboard again.

218
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:05,082
- This sucks!
- How come they aren't coming?

219
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:08,152
I think we have
to signal them somehow.

220
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,792
Hey, he's like Rudolph.

221
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:15,362
All you have to do is fart
and the visitors are sure to come.

222
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:19,562
Really? I don't think I have
to fart anymore tonight.

223
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:22,132
- Sure, you do.
- Come on, fart!

224
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:25,102
- I don't wanna!
- He can't hold it in forever.

225
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:28,332
- Fart, damn you!
- Okay, that does it!

226
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:32,102
Why is it that everything today
has involved things...

227
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,552
...either going in or coming out
of my ass?

228
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:38,512
I'm sick of it!
It's completely immature!

229
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,482
It's happening again.

230
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:46,082
- Whoa, look at that.
- Now do you believe us?

231
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:49,492
You can't scare me.
You're making it all up.

232
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:53,762
There's an 80-foot satellite dish
sticking out of your ass!

233
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,162
Sure, you guys, whatever.

234
00:16:58,012 --> 00:17:02,072
Oh, boy, the aliens are going
to make first contact.

235
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:06,772
Hey! Down here!
We are ready for your wisdom.

236
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:11,842
And you only got 20 minutes
before Sanford and Son is on!

237
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:16,582
You guys, I am seriously
getting pissed off right now.

238
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:19,562
I know there's no such thing
as aliens!

239
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:24,062
Oh, goddamn it!

240
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:29,232
What the...? I tell you, there's
crazy stuff going on in this town.

241
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:32,132
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

242
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:35,972
Come down here, you stinking aliens!

243
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:40,682
Ask them for your little brother back.

244
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:45,812
Visitors, you took my brother. He's
freckled and looks like a football.

245
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:50,192
At first I was happy you took him,
but I've learned something:

246
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,992
Having a little brother is special.

247
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:56,602
Heck, I'm just a kid all alone
in this crazy world.

248
00:17:56,762 --> 00:18:00,672
If you can find it in your hearts
to give my brother back...

249
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:03,362
...it would make my life
brighter again.

250
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,232
That was beautiful.

251
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,172
- Did it work?
- No.

252
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:11,182
You scrawny-assed shit!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

253
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:15,212
You must be some kind of fuck
to ignore a crying child!

254
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:19,442
You know what you fucking like?
You like to fuck!

255
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,552
Hey, Wendy, what's a fuck?

256
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:32,792
Ike, jump down! Now!
For the love of God, Ike, jump!

257
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:34,132
Don't hurt me.

258
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,982
I promise I'll be nice to you
from now on.

259
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:55,852
Don't kick the baby.

260
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:03,662
What are they talking about?

261
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:22,652
Ike, do your impersonation
of David Caruso's career!

262
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,582
It's my turn.

263
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:40,672
You guys, get me down from here!

264
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,672
Help! Sons of bitches!

265
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,812
Dildo!

266
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:52,372
- I'm sure glad that's over with.
- Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike!

267
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:54,542
She's fly at the sky.

268
00:19:54,952 --> 00:19:58,582
Wait! Where are you going,
alien visitors? Come back!

269
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:02,282
Where's this amazing thing
you were gonna show us?

270
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:05,252
It's in the bedroom, ladies.
Come on in.

271
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:07,892
We can make it in time for dinner.

272
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:10,092
- Thanks for helping.
- Whatever.

273
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:12,762
- Hey, I didn't throw up.
- Cool.

274
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:22,642
Sorry.

275
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:25,242
- Hey, look, a French fry.
- Cool.

276
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:28,282
- What's that?
- It's part of a Cheesy Poof.

277
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:31,422
- Hey, what's that?
- That's a hamburger.

278
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:34,922
- That's from two days ago!
- What about that?

279
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:36,392
I don't know.

280
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:41,222
The bus will be here.
Cartman's still gone.

281
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:43,492
We're running out of friends.

282
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:46,532
I wonder what the visitors
gave the cows?

283
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:53,962
Cows, I got you cornered.
Let's see you get away now.

284
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:05,982
Hey, Cartman.

285
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:09,882
The visitors dropped you off
just in time for school.

286
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:14,292
- I had a crazy nightmare last night.
- Really? What about?

287
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:16,992
Well, I was standing out in a field.

288
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:20,602
I had this satellite dish
sticking out of my butt...

289
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:23,262
...and then there were
cows and aliens.

290
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:27,002
Then I went on the ship,
and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.

291
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:29,542
That wasn't a dream.
That happened.

292
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:34,442
- Right. Why don't I have pinkeye then?
- You do have pinkeye!

293
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:36,952
Son of a bitch!
