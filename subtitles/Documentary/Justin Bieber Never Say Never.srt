1
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:27,214
The rings, please?

2
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,483
Oh, God!

3
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,522
-No!
-Oh, my God!

4
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,928
You haven't made it
until you've played New York

5
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:17,192
and you've sold out the Garden.

6
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,638
He came from such a small town,
it gives us hope.

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,484
Madison Square Garden represents
the pinnacle of success.

8
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,047
Justin leans over and looks at me

9
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,957
and he said,
"I don't care how hard I have to work,

10
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,826
"or what we need to do,
I'm selling this place out in a year"

11
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:37,403
I love Justin Bieber!

12
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:41,067
I think about him, like, 99% of my life.

13
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:48,246
-His voice, his personality.
-His hair, his looks, everything.

14
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,615
No one used to know him a year ago,
and now everyone knows him.

15
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:57,854
He was born March 1st, 1994,
at 12:56 a.m. on a Tuesday.

16
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,387
One day, I tweeted him 100 times.

17
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:06,264
He is so much cooler than my brother!
So much!

18
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:08,968
Justin Bieber,

19
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,729
make sure you don't have
no more girlfriends,

20
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:12,395
'cause I'm your girlfriend.

21
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,932
He's just, like, a regular kid
who had a dream

22
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:17,475
and it just, like, came true.

23
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,577
I was young.

24
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:30,284
I wanted to make sure
that I gave him everything,

25
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:33,849
that I would be the best
that I could be for him.

26
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:37,890
It was hard work,

27
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,988
but it was worth it.

28
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,734
My parents helped a lot.

29
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:45,704
We're small-town people.
Even Toronto's too big for us.

30
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:51,473
His dad and I split
when he was about 10 months old.

31
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,907
I had a place of my own
and I lived with Justin.

32
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,482
Just me and Justin.

33
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,041
I knew he needed stability in his life.

34
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,651
And God really gave me
a lot of strength.

35
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:06,951
We were pretty excited.
He was such a little sweetheart.

36
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:10,485
Justin and my dad were so close.

37
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:12,689
They just really bonded.

38
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,290
He was always with Justin, every day.

39
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,801
If he wasn't with him,
he'd be talking to him.

40
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,461
They were great like that.

41
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:21,972
I remember there's been days
when Justin would run away from school

42
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,404
because a teacher said something.

43
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:26,377
And instead of running home,
he ran over here, to Grandpa.

44
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,174
-Hi, Justin.
-Hi.

45
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:34,684
What are you going out to do?

46
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:36,344
Shovel.

47
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:37,819
Shovel what?

48
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,720
Snow.

49
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:42,350
And you're going to do the job, are you?

50
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:45,396
It was definitely challenging
to be a teenagen

51
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,026
and have to stay home
while all your friends are going out.

52
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:50,461
Justin! You're on my team...

53
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,697
I just knew that that's what I had to do.

54
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:56,536
If he didn't have sports,
I don't know what he would have done.

55
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,938
He would have drove us crazy.
He drove us crazy, anyway.

56
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,011
Okay, go for it, Justin.

57
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:11,679
Okay, once again, that's it.

58
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,019
Everybody's gonna be a hitter,
wait and see.

59
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:17,988
My son, Ryan, and Justin
have been friends since grade four.

60
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:21,828
He was a soccer coach for three, four
years, and Justin was always over here.

61
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:23,992
He would not release the ball.

62
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:26,961
He's the same with hockey,
he wouldn't pass the puck.

63
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,502
In soccer, he wouldn't pass the ball.

64
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,274
Me and him always used to sit
beside each other.

65
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,936
There's me, that's him, on the left.

66
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:37,611
Pass the ball. And when he did,
it worked out. It was great.

67
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,840
I had to stress to him

68
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:41,510
that making the goal
was as important as scoring the goal.

69
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,813
What is it?

70
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,290
Okay, now what do you do with it?

71
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:55,723
He never had any lessons or anything.

72
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:02,771
I just never thought of it
being anything other than for fun.

73
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,332
I would have friends oven

74
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:08,606
and they would bring their guitars
and jam out at the house.

75
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,870
Justin, as a two-year-old,

76
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:13,347
he would wander up to the stairs,
right in front of the drum kit,

77
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,941
and just stare at Dan, the drummer
in the band at the time.

78
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:18,043
So how do you
usually count in your head?

79
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,646
One, two, three, four, five. One, two...

80
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,280
And he would just be mesmerized.

81
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,361
And he'd grab a pair of drumsticks
and he'd start hitting the stairs.

82
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,930
And everybody noticed
that his timing was amazing.

83
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,725
"Where does this talent come from?
Does he play drums?

84
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,863
"Man, you'd better get that kid a kit. "

85
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,407
There was a little plastic, miniature kit

86
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:45,481
and he got to bang on that
for two years.

87
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,178
And then he outgrew that kit.

88
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,351
Pattie's friends were musical
and they encouraged Justin.

89
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,855
And their church would have music in it.

90
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:02,890
They would be, you know, showing him
how to do a chord on the guitar

91
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:09,097
And then the boys at the church said
Justin had a musical talent.

92
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,199
And they had a benefit
down at one of the local hotels.

93
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:16,370
When we were preparing him
for his show,

94
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:18,376
he had to learn four jazz standards.

95
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,804
Come on up here, Justin.

96
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,281
Play a couple of songs
for the people here this evening.

97
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,113
And for an 8-year-old to play jazz,

98
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:27,121
it was quite difficult,
but he was up for it.

99
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,359
They made enough money that night
to buy Justin a big set of Pearl drums.

100
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:47,230
He'd go into the furnace room
and he would bang those drums

101
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:48,467
like you wouldn't believe.

102
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,044
And the worst part of it was,
he was good.

103
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,840
I love, like, pretty much everything
about him.

104
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,243
He's cute, he's awesome,
and we just love him so much.

105
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:29,181
Yeah, that's what I was just about
to say.

106
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,045
-We'll all be his wife, sooner or later.
-Yeah.

107
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:34,816
I'll be his first wife.
I'm his first wife, okay?

108
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:39,293
He's basically, like, giving back to us
because we love him so much.

109
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:42,727
-We do love him so much.
-Yeah, more than you could imagine.

110
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:45,823
I can't help it, I'm obsessed.
I love him. He's so cute.

111
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,333
I mean, I don't want him that way.
But he's just so cute.

112
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:51,895
He's really hot. He's adorable!

113
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:55,474
I remember my first concert
I went to with my mom, and so...

114
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:58,340
And it was your birthday present, yes.
We've been waiting for months for this.

115
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:01,210
-And what was your first concert?
-Michael Jackson, Thriller

116
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,337
When I was her age.

117
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:05,110
So I'm hoping she'll remember this one
for a long, long time.

118
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:06,746
-JB!
-JB!

119
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:55,259
Two, and three.

120
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:57,497
-Thank you, sweetheart.
-Thank you.

121
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:02,363
On three. One, two, three.

122
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:19,150
Justin?

123
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:27,992
I like this.
What do you think? You like it?

124
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,625
-I love it.
-I like it, too.

125
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:32,726
Put that hood under it, obviously.

126
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:35,567
It was his first show
and I went to his house to get him.

127
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:38,540
We were gonna go.
And he came up in this church suit.

128
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:41,408
Just like an Easter Sunday suit.

129
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:44,641
I was like, "Man, you don't have
to dress like that anymore."

130
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,181
-I like Bigger in the white jacket.
-Okay.

131
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:49,617
Purple. It just sort of looked cool.

132
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:52,087
They're gonna do a five-minute
on-the-fly thing with you.

133
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:54,624
They'll ask you questions while
you're standing and whatnot today.

134
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:56,723
Ryan's like the coolest
older brother ever.

135
00:12:56,813 --> 00:13:00,025
Ryan's also like his jester
When Justin's down,

136
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,856
I'm like, "Ryan, go make him laugh."

137
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:06,134
Come on! Come on!

138
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:07,736
And Justin's cracking up.

139
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,299
Allison's the stern one.

140
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:11,197
I'm going to shave my head.

141
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,242
No, you are not!
Put that razor down right now!

142
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,539
-Say, "l love you, Justin."
-I love you, Justin. Put the razor back.

143
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,374
She's the one that handles business.

144
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,729
Carin works wardrobe with Ryan,
and she's like Justin 's big sister.

145
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:38,791
This is Justin's guitar.
it's a lefty. Justin's a southpaw.

146
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:43,638
Dan Kanter is Justin's musical director.
Super cool dude.

147
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,071
This is Scrappy.

148
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:48,042
Scrappy is the hardest working man
on the Justin Bieber tour,

149
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,202
maybe next to Justin.

150
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:52,881
Justin is a pleasure to work with,
most of the time.

151
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,751
I kind of look at him like a little brother.

152
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,390
That's twice!
You don't give me twice for that!

153
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,706
Kenny is technically
Justin 's security guard,

154
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,978
but Kenny's Justin's everything.

155
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:34,014
Kenny's with him 24/7.
He lives on the bus with him.

156
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:37,491
He has a definite trust with Kenny,
he feels like he can tell him anything.

157
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,925
It'll take two seconds.
I just want to drive it a little bit.

158
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:45,259
It's an uncle-nephew relationship.

159
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,562
In my phone,
I have him programmed in as "Nephew".

160
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,937
Kenny. What are you doing?

161
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,540
Scooter's kind of in the road family,
definitely Dad.

162
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,267
Justin, Justin, that's not funny.

163
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,504
-Turn it off. Not funny.
-It is funny.

164
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,548
You know, I think 90% of my job
is helping him become a good man.

165
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,547
It's a family.
So, we're supporting each other

166
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,207
and making sure the kid's okay.

167
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,967
Deeper. No, not like that.

168
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,391
There you go.

169
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:26,134
I'm a 54-year-old childless woman,
and they call me Mama.

170
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,073
Yo, I need a razor. Do you have one?

171
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,338
A razor? Really?

172
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,107
Here's something really cool
about vocal cords.

173
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,080
They can take my heart out of my chest
and put it in your body

174
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,240
and make that work.

175
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,282
Hey, don't cut your face, okay?

176
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,882
But they cannot replace
the human voice.

177
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,416
This entire tour hinges

178
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,657
on those two little strips of fiber
that sit in his neck.

179
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,161
While you're changing, do it, okay?

180
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,066
One of the hardest things, I think,
for a kid on the road to understand

181
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,797
is that he's a working man.

182
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,800
All right, I'm about to change my pants,
so you're gonna have to go.

183
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,712
Come on, come on, come on.

184
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,659
Don't waste it. Let's get you dressed.
Come on, let's go, it's walk time.

185
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,458
-Yo, all right.
-Yo, yo, it's walk time.

186
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,055
-This is Mama Jan.
-Hi, Mama.

187
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,930
-She's my vocal coach. This is my dad.
-My pleasure.

188
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,627
-Pleasure is mine.
-I think I saw you this afternoon.

189
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,067
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Nice to meet you, sir.

190
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,197
Nice to meet you.

191
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,606
You ready to kill this, or what?

192
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,903
How's your voice?

193
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,641
Good. How is it?

194
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,901
It's getting there.

195
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,648
All right, we're going into focus mode.
Here we go.

196
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,509
I know you're prepared!

197
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,921
And you've been waiting
for this moment!

198
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,484
Everything you're feeling right now
is normal!

199
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,756
These people came to see you!

200
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:02,030
I'm here because you're here!
Let's rock! Let's rock!

201
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,800
All right, let's bring it in!
We're gonna say a prayer!

202
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,443
Thank you for the production crew,
all the staff, the players...

203
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:14,171
On the road, with a group of people,

204
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:16,976
it becomes
a very functional dysfunctional family,

205
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:18,982
all centered around one goal.

206
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,415
One more thing. I got to say something.

207
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,114
It's Jeremy's first show.
We got the grandparents.

208
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,484
We got a lot of stuff.

209
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,583
This one tonight
is a proud Canadian boy coming home

210
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,250
and representing for his nation.

211
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:35,734
Ducks, ducks, ducks, ducks!
Quack, quack, quack, quack! Zoom!

212
00:18:25,468 --> 00:18:26,470
Sing it.

213
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:32,847
Make some noise
for Boyz II Men, everybody.

214
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,902
Sing it!

215
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,989
I can't hear you. Everybody!

216
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:16,387
All right.

217
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:43,317
Come on, sing it!

218
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,676
Sing it!

219
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,943
All right, Boyz II Men, sing it!

220
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:14,914
All right. One more time.

221
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:32,670
Your grandma's house is right here,
ain't it?

222
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:34,674
Yeah, this is it. Great.

223
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,315
Hey! Hi, Grandpa.

224
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:58,522
Look at my bed. This used to be huge.

225
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,293
Yeah, once upon a time,
it used to be huge for you.

226
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,801
-Good night.
-Good night, sweetheart.

227
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,848
What's up?

228
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,218
-I got my phone working.
-Nice.

229
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:23,848
Hey, buddy.

230
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:26,255
It went from, like,
hanging out every day almost

231
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:29,854
to only seeing each other
a couple of times a month, if that.

232
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:31,487
Who had the best shooting percentage
in that game?

233
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,862
I did. No backboard, please.

234
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:37,435
Now that we don't see each other
really anymore,

235
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:39,300
we just kind of, like, cherish the time
that we have together.

236
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,805
-You want to see something...
-Excuse me, sweetheart.

237
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,275
You can't go out
till you clean your room, okay?

238
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,675
-Can you go clean your room, please?
-Yes, I will.

239
00:21:45,732 --> 00:21:46,939
-I've got to get your stuff on the bus.
-I will.

240
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,536
-All right, one second. One second.
-Thank you.

241
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:53,452
These are some animals
that my grandpa has collected.

242
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:56,148
And this is a wolf. This is a fox.

243
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:57,449
-They're roadkills, honey.
-And we...

244
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:00,925
Me and him were playing, like,
mini-sticks one day,

245
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,262
and I knocked off the leg, you know.

246
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:08,861
It wasn't very nice.
And then we tried to, like, tape it there.

247
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,371
And at one time, it just fell over,
and I blamed it on Chaz.

248
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:15,566
No, actually, we blamed it on Nolan.
And he wasn't even here.

249
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,732
That was fun.

250
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,298
All right, let's go.

251
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:20,242
I'm waiting for him to clean his room.

252
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,477
Seat belts, everyone.

253
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:37,217
Put your hands in the air!

254
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,640
Let's go to my old stomping grounds.

255
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:54,146
This is where we used to shoot ball
and work our abs.

256
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,787
First shot of the day.
Let's see how I am.

257
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,497
-Cut.
-You can edit that, right?

258
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:18,330
Yeah, edit that out.

259
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,340
I'm going to shoot this ball into that net,
all right?

260
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:26,536
That's how you do it.

261
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:42,148
Put your hands in the air! Go!

262
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:45,117
Hey, Ryan!

263
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,061
Hey, buddy!

264
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:50,733
Hey, buddy. How you doing, man?

265
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:52,234
How's work?
I'm just gonna come in to work with you.

266
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,460
Hey, yo, Sean! Sean, what's up, man?

267
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,304
He was in town,
and he stopped by the school.

268
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:36,971
As a matter of fact,
he did autograph his locker,

269
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:38,672
but our cleaning staff is very diligent

270
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:41,343
and they thought it was graffiti
and they washed it off.

271
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:49,347
Sing it!

272
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:53,383
I can't hear you!

273
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,089
I think we got to turn up the music
for all you people!

274
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:16,974
You want to say grace?

275
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:18,916
Thank you, Lord, for this pizza,

276
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:22,583
this cheese,
pineapple, bacon, pepperoni.

277
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:25,217
-And thank you to Hawaiian people...
-People.

278
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,760
-...for making our pizza.
-For making... Yeah.

279
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:29,889
Thank you. Thank you, Lord. No.
Thank you that we have great friends.

280
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:32,525
We are able to hang out together
and have a good time.

281
00:25:32,954 --> 00:25:34,154
-Amen.
-Amen.

282
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:49,748
-Hello.
-Hi.

283
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:51,512
-How are you?
-Are you Justin Bieber?

284
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:55,217
-Yes, I am. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

285
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:56,347
I used to sit right here.

286
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,861
I used to sit on those steps
and I used to play here, too.

287
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:02,760
-So keep playing.
-Thank you. Thank you.

288
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:04,695
And always follow your dreams, okay?

289
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:05,821
-Okay.
-All right.

290
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:07,834
Thank you very much. Have a good day.

291
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:14,934
He was about 12 years old

292
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:19,106
when he wanted to go
and play in front of the Avon Theater.

293
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:31,523
Those apartments
across the road there,

294
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:33,891
their windows would be all closed
in the summertime.

295
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:35,427
But the minute they heard him sing,

296
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:38,363
they would just all open up
and just let his voice right in.

297
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:44,137
-He is amazing.
-Yeah. This kid is about to be famous.

298
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,099
His voice carried all over this area.

299
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:04,355
All right, take it away.

300
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,583
Hey, everybody.

301
00:27:08,915 --> 00:27:12,662
I was like, "You're only 12 years old.
You've never had any singing lessons.

302
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:15,258
"So if you don't make it, it's okay."

303
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:20,672
He asked me to come
to his Stratford Idol Competition.

304
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:21,797
So I went and saw that.

305
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:27,105
I was definitely worried
that he could beat me.

306
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,650
He was singing all styles of music.

307
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:35,814
R&B, he was rapping some,

308
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:40,190
and he would have little dances
made up for them, break dancing and...

309
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:53,141
That natural instinct was in Justin,
to respond to little mistakes like that.

310
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:55,105
He made it
an entertainment opportunity.

311
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:59,474
I was like,
"Whoa, where'd this come from, man?"

312
00:28:00,332 --> 00:28:02,644
Our next Stratford Star winner.

313
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:09,878
Even though he got second,
he still got the attention he needed.

314
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,653
People recognize my face
from the videos,

315
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:16,426
just knowing that I'm the girl
who beat Justin Bieber.

316
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:24,228
We have family that live in
different provinces that wanted to come.

317
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:28,263
At this time, he was playing around
on YouTube and he'd seen some stuff.

318
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:30,866
So he said, "Why don't we just put it up
on there and send her the link?"

319
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:35,441
The next thing you know,
we had hits from strangers

320
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:38,005
just requesting other songs.

321
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:39,071
I was like, "This is fun.

322
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,209
"They want you to post another video.
Let's do this one."

323
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,017
And I was like,
"You got 100,000 subscribers.

324
00:28:46,077 --> 00:28:48,582
"Where'd that come from?"
He's like, "People like my stuff."

325
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:57,801
I'd just come back
from a night out with friends.

326
00:28:57,855 --> 00:29:00,289
Went online
and I saw this little 12-year-old

327
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,172
singing Aretha Franklin, Respect,
and thought, "That's pretty good."

328
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:05,467
And there was another one.
There were about six videos.

329
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,635
So I click on another one.

330
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,068
Click on another one.

331
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,581
And then I clicked on him
singing Ne-Yo, So Sick.

332
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:27,596
That's when I got the buzz.

333
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,133
I actually canceled all my meetings
the next day,

334
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,103
and said, ”i'm gonna find this kid today. ”
I kind of became obsessed with him-

335
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,508
I remember getting a message
on YouTube.

336
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:42,945
I had a call from my friend saying,
"There's this guy named Scooter Braun

337
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,604
"trying to reach you."

338
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:48,676
He got a hold of Justin's great-aunt,
got a hold of the school board.

339
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:50,754
He contacted the Avon Theater.

340
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:53,420
I was like, "Who is this guy?"

341
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:55,047
I just went to a computer phone

342
00:29:55,111 --> 00:29:56,456
and called him
from an unknown number

343
00:29:56,513 --> 00:29:58,289
just to say, "Please, stop calling."

344
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:02,662
"Hi, it's Pattie Mallette.
You were calling about my son, Justin?"

345
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:06,029
You know, she thought she was gonna
have a phone call to get rid of me.

346
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:10,040
And we ended up talking
for about two to three hours.

347
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:13,839
He said, "Come to Atlanta for a week,
no strings attached,

348
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,399
"and I'll just introduce you
to a bunch of people,

349
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:16,877
"let you know I'm for real.

350
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,448
"And if you don't like it,
you don't want to sign with us,

351
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:23,771
"you get a free vacation out of it,
and, you know, back to life as usual."

352
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,379
So, I pick Justin up from the airport,
and I had a purple Mercedes with rims.

353
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,251
Justin saw it, his eyes got real big
and he's like, "Sweet car."

354
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:29,348
I told Justin,
"Do you want to meet Jermaine Dupri?"

355
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:32,114
And he goes,
"The guy who does Grillz with Nelly?"

356
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,182
We pull up to the studio
and we all get out,

357
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:40,990
and as we're about to walk in
this Range Rover pulls up,

358
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,187
and Usher gets out.

359
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:48,330
And Justin,
he really, really looked up to Usher

360
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:53,663
I'm like, "Justin, don't say a word."

361
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:05,346
Justin just freaks out. "Oh, my God,
is that Usher? Is that Usher?"

362
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:07,010
He's, like, losing his mind.

363
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:08,418
And he goes running right up to Usher
and he goes,

364
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:11,391
"Man, I'm one of your biggest fans.
Can I sing one of your songs to you?"

365
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:13,188
And I look at this kid like,

366
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:15,957
"l just picked you up.
I just told you not to do this."

367
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:22,369
Usher looks at him and he thought
he was, like, my little cousin.

368
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,670
He goes, "it's cold outside, buddy.
Don't worry about it."

369
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:28,106
He pushes him aside,
and Usher goes into the studio

370
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:29,401
and he starts his session.

371
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:32,412
And I look at Justin, I was like,
"l just told you not to sing for anybody."

372
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:33,912
And he goes,
"You said not to sing for Jermaine.

373
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,003
"You didn't say anything about Usher."

374
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:47,461
At the time, Scooter didn't have
a whole lot of experience.

375
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:52,433
But he was so confident in Justin,
we started making plans to go forward.

376
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:58,135
I kept flying him back and forth.
We were doing all these meetings.

377
00:32:58,191 --> 00:32:59,500
And everyone started saying no.

378
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:04,434
Every label said,
"There's no platform for him."

379
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:07,746
"You need Nickelodeon or Disney.
You need the machine."

380
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:11,608
Do you guys read the stats

381
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:13,708
that kids are spending
more time on the Internet

382
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,343
than they are watching TV?

383
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:22,088
And the place where they're watching
most of their videos is You Tube.

384
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:25,158
It was the most frustrating thing
in the entire world.

385
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:30,866
I started thinking,
who would be the perfect person?

386
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:40,076
You're gonna sing with me or what?

387
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,694
Okay, then. All right.

388
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:07,163
-Your friends will believe you now.
-Yeah.

389
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:14,974
I said, "This is like a no-brainer."

390
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:19,708
So now Usher is shocked.

391
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:23,254
And he looks at me and he goes,
"Who is this kid?"

392
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,115
And Justin kind of has
a smile on his face.

393
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,419
"You don't remember me?
You blew me off

394
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,051
"outside of Jermaine Dupri's studio."

395
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:32,723
And Usher was like, "Okay."

396
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,729
I said, "l really feel like
you have something incredible.

397
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,892
"But I think that
we should take it to L.A. Reid."

398
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:40,994
Justin was excited 'cause he knew
this was the guy who had signed

399
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:44,099
Pink, Avril Lavigne, Outkast, Usher
and so many others.

400
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:45,539
And he said, "Yeah, at the Grammys,

401
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,771
"I've heard people thank him
many times. "

402
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,619
My first impression was,
"Wow, the Macaulay Culkin of music."

403
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:58,154
That was the first thing
I thought in my head.

404
00:35:00,277 --> 00:35:03,454
He came in and he soaked up
all the air in the room.

405
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:06,019
And he sang really well.

406
00:35:09,452 --> 00:35:11,627
But it wasn't even that.

407
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:14,194
It was the face.

408
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:18,036
It was the hair. He was brave-

409
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,406
When it was all said and done,
I was beyond convinced

410
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:23,242
that Usher had
absolutely delivered a gift.

411
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,514
He was in grade eight,
it was about halfway through the year

412
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:35,549
He came and he said,
"Mrs. Booker, I'm talking with Usher."

413
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:38,887
And I said, "Great
But I really don't know who Usher is."

414
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:40,254
We're going to pull Justin.

415
00:35:40,317 --> 00:35:42,925
Justin didn't know this.
But, Justin, you were in the studio.

416
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:46,060
Come on over here. He's a good-looking
14-year-old young man.

417
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:48,161
-Have a seat right next to your mom.
-Hey, honey.

418
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:50,000
And he sounds even better
than he looks.

419
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:52,074
-He does.
-What a voice.

420
00:35:52,161 --> 00:35:54,838
Pattie, tell us a bit about
what's happening now in Justin's life.

421
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:55,933
This is hot off the presses.

422
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,376
We just signed with a music label

423
00:35:57,466 --> 00:36:00,279
and we're moving in
about a week to the US.

424
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:05,985
So it's a big step, and he's got
a long journey and great plans.

425
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,115
Congratulations, Justin and Pattie.

426
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:18,394
They were excited to go.
We were a little leery at them going,

427
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:20,732
but we were excited for them to go, too.

428
00:36:21,157 --> 00:36:24,369
I mean, once they walked through
that gate at the airport, it's...

429
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:26,339
That's the end of it. They're gone.

430
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:34,876
There are moments
that you come across all your life.

431
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:38,615
There's always that moment
when you have to let go.

432
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:40,678
And that was one of them.

433
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:57,131
I moved him down to Atlanta
on my own dime.

434
00:36:57,525 --> 00:36:59,438
ATL, shawty!

435
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:02,602
It was summertime.
He wasn't going to school.

436
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:03,937
He didn't have any friends.

437
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:07,471
I called the label and said,
"Let's make some moves."

438
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:08,877
And they were mad at me.

439
00:37:09,637 --> 00:37:13,110
"What do you mean, you spent money?
We're not ready. "

440
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:14,210
Done.

441
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,623
If it was up to them, we'd have come out
with Justin when he was 28 years old.

442
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:20,723
I can grow facial hair really easily.

443
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:24,828
I was coming in to help them
get acclimated to being in Atlanta.

444
00:37:24,885 --> 00:37:26,833
Look, I grew a mustache.

445
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,493
I remember he used to ask me,

446
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:31,300
"When am I gonna get in the studio?
We're just sitting around."

447
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:33,340
Justin was looking at me,
"When are we gonna do something?"

448
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,467
I was like, "That's it. I'm with the kid."

449
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:47,319
That's when they called me in.

450
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:51,326
In addition to singing, Justin also plays
drums, guitar keyboards and trumpet.

451
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:53,792
He's currently being managed by
Usher and Scooter Braun.

452
00:37:53,846 --> 00:37:56,193
I met Justin in December 2008.

453
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,134
Scooter and Usher both know me and
they decided that it was a good thing

454
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:03,865
to bring Justin in to work with me
ahead of time, prior to the recording,

455
00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:06,372
just to get some basics underneath him.

456
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:10,104
Tonight he'll be singing an original tune
entitled Common Denominator.

457
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,701
Here 's Justin Bieber.

458
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:16,180
I'm not five years old.

459
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:26,482
They started a bit too early.

460
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:28,994
Can you start it oven please?

461
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:56,415
So, we started.
We started cutting records in Atlanta.

462
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:00,827
We started working with different
people and trying different things.

463
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,829
I didn't mean to stop you like that,
but this is only a tease.

464
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:15,907
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing to you,

465
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,669
Island Def Jam recording artist,

466
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:19,870
Justin Bieber's
getting ready to go down.

467
00:39:19,932 --> 00:39:22,141
Just so you know, we're in the studio
right now working on it.

468
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,544
Get ready because it's gonna be big.

469
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:24,809
-Ain't that right, Justin?
-That's right.

470
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,636
That's right. So, look out, we're coming.

471
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:30,412
Doing it once again, now.

472
00:39:30,908 --> 00:39:36,330
Check it. We gonna do it like,
when I say, "Justin", y'all say "Bieber!"

473
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:37,827
-Justin!
-Bieber!

474
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,420
-Justin!
-Bieber!

475
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:42,730
When I say, "One", y'all say, ”Time!”

476
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:44,268
-One!
-Time!

477
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:45,961
-One!
-Time!

478
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:01,938
I said, "That song, One Time,
that should be the first single.

479
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:04,207
"'Cause I think it's up-tempo,
it'll get the kids excited."

480
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:11,512
June 2009,

481
00:41:11,574 --> 00:41:15,549
Justin was playing at a water park in
Poughkeepsie, New York, for 40 people.

482
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:20,986
It was raining at the water park,
by the way. Pouring rain.

483
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:24,266
Antonio was dancing-
Marvin was dancing-

484
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,700
Tay was deejaying.
Dan was playing guitar.

485
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,032
And me and Ryan.

486
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,299
I mean, it went naturally.

487
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:35,801
But naturally doesn't mean easy.

488
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:40,378
There's work that goes into that.
And you have to do the footwork.

489
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:44,552
"In radio, we don't play a young kid.

490
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:47,647
"Fifteen years old,
he's got a young voice.

491
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,054
"That's not our thing. "

492
00:41:50,245 --> 00:41:51,247
Everybody, come on.

493
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,724
They didn't understand it.

494
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:58,364
Hand-to-hand combat is what we did.
We put Justin in a van and on airplanes.

495
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,732
And that kid, planes, trains
and automobiles.

496
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,499
-Q102, live in the studio, Justin Bieber
-What's up, guys?

497
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:04,593
AH the hits-

498
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:06,732
Is this being played
anywhere else in the country right now?

499
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,207
Justin, what are you going to
sing for us right now?

500
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:14,507
I'm gonna sing One Time acoustically.
You guys have heard of the track?

501
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:16,707
One Time. it's an acoustic version.

502
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:31,855
He went to every single one.

503
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:33,365
If you weren't playing his record,

504
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,423
he still went.

505
00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:42,309
And he'd play his guitar for you acoustic
and he'd sing, on the spot, any request.

506
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,901
And he won people over.

507
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:51,780
-Wow.
-That was nice, man.

508
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,187
-Justin Bieber, do not forget us, bro!
-I won't.

509
00:42:55,243 --> 00:42:58,159
There's not a deejay that can say
they have not met Justin Bieber.

510
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,331
Waking up early, going to radio stations,
meeting with...

511
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:06,300
You know, it's just adults.

512
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,334
Everything is just adults.

513
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,869
I'm so excited to go to Hartford.

514
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,538
He started twittering.

515
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:16,337
"I'm gonna be at this radio station.
I'm gonna be at this radio station."

516
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,680
First 20 kids, then 40 kids,
then 100 kids.

517
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:26,152
Then a couple of hundred kids started
lining up outside of these radio stations

518
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:27,744
to just get a glimpse of him.

519
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:34,284
And they started to play his record.

520
00:43:37,517 --> 00:43:40,160
Justin, Justin, Justin!

521
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:45,206
Chaos at Roosevelt Field Mall today.
The crowd was so huge

522
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,774
local police are on hand
trying to control this crowd.

523
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,407
I think at that point no one realized how
powerful social networking was or is.

524
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:55,803
Oh, my God!

525
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:10,425
Who caused this? Justin Bieber?
That kid with the hair and that can sing?

526
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:13,129
He caused this whole huge thing?

527
00:44:13,185 --> 00:44:17,103
Justin's fans are the most
loyal group of girls on the planet.

528
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:19,331
They all feel a certain ownership
over him

529
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:21,999
because they feel like they found him
before Scooter found him,

530
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:25,170
before the record labels found him.
He belongs to them.

531
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:28,910
They're there for him.
God, I've never seen fans like this.

532
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,965
What is it you guys love so much
about Justin Bieber?

533
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,598
I like his songs.

534
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,238
I like his songs.

535
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:34,906
I like how he looks.

536
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,371
-His eyes. They're so cute.
-Just...

537
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,678
And his little smile and his laugh.

538
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,978
His laugh is so cute.

539
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,143
-His laugh?
-We're obsessed with that.

540
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,383
-What's it like?
-He's like... That's so cute.

541
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:48,583
I like the way how he smiles.

542
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,862
His hair, I love his hair.
Flip, like, every five minutes.

543
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,897
Yeah, I love his hair.

544
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,752
The hair, it's perfect.

545
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:49,483
I could rock his hairdo, but I want to see
him rock some of these one time

546
00:46:49,538 --> 00:46:51,611
so he could step his game up.
So, Justin,

547
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:53,212
get you some pigtails, man,

548
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:55,324
you know what I'm talking about,
with accessories on the ends

549
00:46:55,411 --> 00:47:00,297
so the girls can play with your hair, man.
That's another tool you'll be able to use.

550
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:05,432
-Do not eat that.
-I put them there! See?

551
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:08,036
-That's disgusting!
-You are a gross monkey.

552
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:10,428
That is the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

553
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:11,761
I put them there.

554
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:14,105
It doesn't matter
who put them in the garbage.

555
00:47:14,162 --> 00:47:15,905
They were still in the garbage.

556
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:18,206
So, we got the stuff,
we gotta get it out of here now

557
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:19,372
'cause the cops are going to
sneak him out.

558
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:26,217
In our business, what happened
with Justin Bieber

559
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:29,417
has never happened before.
Truly a phenomenon.

560
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:33,188
Even groups like NSYNC
and the Backstreet Boys took years.

561
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:37,997
But already over a million copies have
been ordered in the United States alone.

562
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:40,467
I was honestly blown away by his talent.

563
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:44,268
It's called My World 2.0 and it's
the number one album in the country.

564
00:47:44,993 --> 00:47:47,134
You guys know Justin Bieber?

565
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,213
Justin is now in that
rarefied atmosphere-

566
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:55,147
All these giant artists
who sell out arenas

567
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:57,481
every two or three years
when they go on tour,

568
00:47:57,539 --> 00:47:59,077
well, Justin's one of them now.

569
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:00,880
He's become a member of that club.

570
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:04,653
I mean, look at him.
He's like a dreamy Christmas elf

571
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:08,854
On his first record,
in his first year and a half,

572
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:12,568
I don't believe
that's ever happened before.

573
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:17,965
Justin!

574
00:48:23,497 --> 00:48:27,917
I want to marry Justin Bieber.
We will be husband and wife.

575
00:48:31,238 --> 00:48:33,983
Bieber Fever. It is a pandemic-

576
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:35,550
Thousands of screaming teens!

577
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:37,147
Around the world, girls are losing it.

578
00:48:37,278 --> 00:48:40,421
In Sydney, scenes that weren't
that far off Beatlemania.

579
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:41,686
...Justin and Justin...

580
00:48:41,781 --> 00:48:43,763
Justin Bieber's visit to town
is actually good news.

581
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:48,270
Police have called off the event
because of safety concerns.

582
00:48:48,322 --> 00:48:49,927
Bieber is in town.

583
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,303
It's a hysteria
that I've never witnessed before.

584
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:55,001
This is what happened with
The Beatles and The Monkees.

585
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:29,497
The ultimate in our business
is becoming an arena headliner,

586
00:50:29,554 --> 00:50:32,470
being able to sell out
Madison Square Garden.

587
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:37,478
Madison Square Garden represents
the pinnacle of success for an artist.

588
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:40,805
The Rolling Stones. U2.

589
00:50:40,865 --> 00:50:43,644
Michael Jackson. This is the big time.

590
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:50,481
And for this kid
to play Madison Square Garden

591
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:52,888
and he's the headliner?

592
00:50:52,977 --> 00:50:55,391
Give me a break. Come on.
This just doesn't happen.

593
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:01,157
Come on! Say, yeah!

594
00:52:11,053 --> 00:52:14,197
JB, you are. Yeah, man.

595
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,212
-All right! Hey! Hey!
-Hey!

596
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,443
Stop the movie! You, down there!

597
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:28,542
-Texting? Texting!
-Stop texting.

598
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:32,077
Sleeping? Making out back there? Hey!

599
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:33,450
-Enough!
-Enough is enough.

600
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:34,818
-Cut that!
-Cut it.

601
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:37,078
-Bring it back.
-Let's go!

602
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,455
Do you guys have tickets to the show?

603
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:43,192
-You don't have any tickets?
-We don't.

604
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:46,031
-Are you big fans?
-This girl is obsessed.

605
00:52:46,088 --> 00:52:49,231
-This is all she does, is Justin Bieber.
-Really?

606
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,830
-What's your favorite song?
-Sing it.

607
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:55,004
Yeah, sing.

608
00:53:05,607 --> 00:53:07,452
We usually have 10, 20 tickets left.

609
00:53:07,543 --> 00:53:11,495
And we go out, we talk to kids,
talk to families and hear their stories.

610
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:17,632
It's like me and the guy
from Extreme Home Makeover

611
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:19,462
have the best jobs in the world.

612
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:22,664
'Cause we get paid
to just make other people happy.

613
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:49,261
You guys going to the concert?

614
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:51,390
You guys have tickets to the show?
Everybody's got tickets?

615
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:54,663
We give them free tickets,
and they're usually in the first 10 rows.

616
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:57,204
The best price.
Nobody can beat my prices.

617
00:53:57,258 --> 00:53:59,536
I'm the corny one.
I call it, like, "We got to give back."

618
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:05,909
Section 108, Row 8.

619
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:08,679
You're choking me!

620
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:10,239
Thank you.

621
00:54:10,304 --> 00:54:13,186
If it wasn't for these kids out there
camping out and doing what they do,

622
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,279
we don't have jobs.

623
00:54:15,342 --> 00:54:16,583
-Oh, great!
-They're real close.

624
00:54:16,677 --> 00:54:18,157
-Give her a hug!
-Thank you.

625
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:21,458
Thank you so much. You don't even
know how much I appreciate this.

626
00:54:26,253 --> 00:54:29,465
I just happen to have some tickets
in my pocket.

627
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:42,777
-We can't get in.
-What if I gave you tickets?

628
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:45,581
Oh, my God,
do you want me to drop dead?

629
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:47,985
Here. Row 7. You're really close.

630
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,081
This is so awesome!
Oh, my God, Pattie.

631
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:56,256
You're in the second row.

632
00:54:57,784 --> 00:54:59,663
Do you cry when you see him?

633
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,667
We cried when we saw you.

634
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:14,403
It's actually the most gratifying thing
about the job.

635
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:17,979
Little things go a very, very long way.

636
00:55:18,637 --> 00:55:21,211
The moment we forget that,
I think it's oven

637
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:32,328
The fact Justin can do that for families
is crazy.

638
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:37,733
This is the best thing
that happened in my life!

639
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:38,996
Oh, my God.

640
00:57:04,441 --> 00:57:06,787
Do you want to be
the One Less Lonely Girl?

641
00:57:06,843 --> 00:57:09,656
-Yes!
-Okay, come on.

642
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:13,961
The One Less Lonely Girl has become
a tradition of our show,

643
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,864
where we randomly pull a girl
out of the audience.

644
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,765
Come with me.

645
00:57:20,324 --> 00:57:23,570
Every show, we pick a new girl
and bring her onstage.

646
00:57:23,627 --> 00:57:25,198
Justin serenades hen

647
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:27,710
gives her some flowers
and makes her feel special.

648
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:29,260
Was he as cute as you thought
he was gonna be in person?

649
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:31,321
So hot.

650
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,093
I love him so much!

651
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:56,147
One, two, three, four, five and six
and seven and eight.

652
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:57,280
Let's try it again.

653
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,257
-Everything looks cooler.
-Everything is cooler.

654
00:59:59,312 --> 01:00:03,196
This is like in Super Mario Brothers
when you became Big Mario.

655
01:00:03,884 --> 01:00:06,196
-Are you too young or you know that?
-No, I know that.

656
01:00:06,253 --> 01:00:08,964
It's when you eat the mushroom
and it goes...

657
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:14,374
So coming up, Madison Square Garden,
the biggest show of Justin's career.

658
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:17,172
We've made some changes
for the Garden show.

659
01:00:17,264 --> 01:00:18,939
Much bigger screen.

660
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,950
We have some extra screens coming in.
We finally have some explosions,

661
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:25,281
so I can't wait to see what that's like.

662
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,178
Big boy!

663
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:30,021
-I'm ready. This is gonna be sick.
-Yeah.

664
01:00:30,077 --> 01:00:31,853
-I like your mic.
-Thank you.

665
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:33,256
-Is this yours?
-Yeah.

666
01:00:36,148 --> 01:00:37,823
-Your hair's so big.
-I know.

667
01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:51,706
Jaden's here because he's coming
to perform Never Say Never

668
01:00:51,764 --> 01:00:53,871
at Madison Square Garden.

669
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:57,246
It's going to be
his first performance, ever.

670
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:02,221
When your dad is Will Smith
and your mom is Jada Pinkett-Smith,

671
01:01:02,274 --> 01:01:05,953
I think you have some performance
and stuff in your blood.

672
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:08,686
Jaden's watching tonight.

673
01:01:08,747 --> 01:01:12,028
-I don't understand. Why?
-Why is he watching?

674
01:01:12,084 --> 01:01:15,534
'Cause he wants to see everything
so he can learn it.

675
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:18,833
-You think he should do it tonight?
-Of course.

676
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:23,508
You doing it tonight.
Get it out of the way.

677
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:26,808
-Your parents will have a heart attack.
-Why?

678
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:30,372
Everyone wants to come up
for his first performance.

679
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:31,471
We got to tell them.

680
01:01:31,603 --> 01:01:34,678
But in a way, you know what,
"We're just feeling it. We're doing it."

681
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:35,844
"They made me."

682
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:37,479
-"They made me."
-"They made me do it."

683
01:01:37,576 --> 01:01:39,558
"They made me do it. I didn't wanna."

684
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:42,660
-You want to do it tonight?
-Yeah.

685
01:01:42,714 --> 01:01:44,524
My parents
are taking a helicopter out here.

686
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:48,261
-Are they really?
-Yeah, they weren't going to miss this.

687
01:01:48,787 --> 01:01:50,735
I can't believe it.

688
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:52,326
They're probably in the air right now.

689
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,602
I just told them not to come,
but that didn't work out.

690
01:01:59,197 --> 01:02:00,541
Coming in right now.

691
01:02:00,631 --> 01:02:02,579
Justin is in a bus and he's not moving.

692
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:04,911
I think he's dehydrated
from being in the sun all day yesterday.

693
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,882
Did Mama Jan go there and look at him?

694
01:02:06,937 --> 01:02:08,441
She's, like, going in there now.

695
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:10,350
What do you think is going on

696
01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:12,617
in terms of keeping your voice
where you should and not wasting it?

697
01:02:12,677 --> 01:02:17,495
I guess, like, I was at home
for a few days, so I was talking.

698
01:02:17,548 --> 01:02:19,187
But I wasn't screaming.

699
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,787
Hey, Ryan!

700
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:23,427
That's how we do it!

701
01:02:23,488 --> 01:02:25,868
You have so much demand
on your voice already.

702
01:02:25,923 --> 01:02:28,405
Eighty-six shows
is a whole lot of stuff to have to do,

703
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:30,873
on anybody's voice.
We're not talking about just you.

704
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:34,913
You really have to be more cautious
when you do have downtime.

705
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,977
Do the best job you can do, okay?
Have a good show.

706
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:40,949
I'm gonna rock this show.

707
01:04:45,526 --> 01:04:49,410
Justin 's 16.
He's just fighting to be a normal kid.

708
01:04:51,499 --> 01:04:54,676
I remember being at the VMAs
and Madonna came out

709
01:04:54,736 --> 01:04:56,341
to give a speech
about Michael Jackson.

710
01:04:56,438 --> 01:04:58,077
And she said
we took away his childhood.

711
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:00,713
And Justin looks right at me.
He goes, "Don't let that happen to me."

712
01:05:03,911 --> 01:05:07,886
Being a 16-year-old, there's a certain
amount of fear and nervousness

713
01:05:07,948 --> 01:05:10,659
with all the stuff that he's dealing with.

714
01:05:10,718 --> 01:05:13,827
He says he's not nervous,
but when he's nervous

715
01:05:13,888 --> 01:05:17,863
he goes through dance steps.
He does popping and everything.

716
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,030
Okay?

717
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:22,373
All right.
Let me just have a minute alone, guys.

718
01:05:22,863 --> 01:05:26,076
There's not really a whole lot of
training schools for how to handle this.

719
01:05:26,133 --> 01:05:29,879
Sometimes he'll get a little whiny
about having a normal life,

720
01:05:29,936 --> 01:05:31,975
and I'll say, "You know what?
You gave up normal.

721
01:05:32,038 --> 01:05:33,373
"This is your new normal."

722
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:35,719
All right, let's roll.

723
01:05:35,776 --> 01:05:37,758
I have a lot in common with Justin.

724
01:05:38,078 --> 01:05:40,994
We are really lucky to have gotten
this opportunity so young

725
01:05:41,047 --> 01:05:43,154
and to relate to younger fans.

726
01:05:43,216 --> 01:05:45,961
But also, the thing is
we both worked really hard.

727
01:05:46,586 --> 01:05:49,468
Doing tours, even when you're tired
or when you feel sick,

728
01:05:49,523 --> 01:05:50,764
and always having
that smile on your face,

729
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:52,931
it wasn't always easy.

730
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:03,917
Hello, everybody!
How you guys doing tonight?

731
01:08:59,342 --> 01:09:01,984
Give it up for Miley Cyrus, everybody!

732
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,336
-What?
-You tell me on a scale of one to 10.

733
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,372
Seven.

734
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:18,270
Minus three?

735
01:09:18,327 --> 01:09:21,209
It was not a four.

736
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:24,976
Justin needs rest.
That's really our best friend at this point.

737
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:27,549
My voice sounded good
on a couple of them.

738
01:09:27,603 --> 01:09:29,107
Hear how your voice sounds now?

739
01:09:29,171 --> 01:09:31,016
He's giving it everything he's got.

740
01:09:31,073 --> 01:09:37,155
But doing 86 shows for any vocalist
is a lot to ask.

741
01:09:49,124 --> 01:09:53,076
-Justin! Justin! Justin!
-Justin! Justin! Justin!

742
01:09:58,767 --> 01:10:00,042
How is everyone doing?

743
01:10:05,206 --> 01:10:07,849
Does anyone have any questions
or anything they wanna ask?

744
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:09,416
Yes?

745
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,793
I'm feeling all right.
Probably like a four out of 10.

746
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:21,697
Your hair's all back now.

747
01:10:21,823 --> 01:10:23,099
You know. You know.

748
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:26,335
Yesterday, he had an Afro.
It was, like, this big.

749
01:10:26,394 --> 01:10:29,071
The vocal rest really is the most
important thing for Justin right now

750
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,610
because his voice is fatigued.

751
01:10:30,665 --> 01:10:33,547
The bigger part is he's 16 years old
and doesn't know when to shut up.

752
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:35,916
All right, let's take a look.

753
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:39,085
-Hi, girls.
-What are you guys doing?

754
01:10:39,139 --> 01:10:41,087
We're waiting for Justin Bieber.

755
01:10:41,141 --> 01:10:43,784
Justin Bieber's sick.
He's seeing a specialist.

756
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:45,153
-Are you crying?
-Yeah.

757
01:10:45,212 --> 01:10:47,695
No, don't cry. Don't worry about it.

758
01:10:47,748 --> 01:10:49,991
I was able to see that his vocal cords
are swollen.

759
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:53,831
There's a lot of mucus, a lot of junk
and debris all over his throat.

760
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:56,700
Here's perfect timing. Come here.
This is our agent.

761
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,602
-He just walked up.
-How do you do?

762
01:10:58,693 --> 01:11:01,073
-This is the doctor.
-I'm glad you're here.

763
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:04,145
His throat's really infected, so
he really needs to take some time off.

764
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:07,580
When Justin has days off is usually
when he comes back his hoarsest.

765
01:11:07,634 --> 01:11:09,981
-Yeah, he's got to learn.
-He screams and yells.

766
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:12,679
We want him to be
a healthy 16-year-old,

767
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:15,382
but if he's taking on this career
as a commitment,

768
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:16,649
it comes with obligations.

769
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,990
And there's a professionalism
that comes along with it at any age,

770
01:11:20,047 --> 01:11:22,325
where you have to
make certain sacrifices.

771
01:11:22,382 --> 01:11:25,457
And that's why I think
he has to cancel tomorrow's event.

772
01:11:25,952 --> 01:11:29,301
Syracuse is out of the question. No way.

773
01:11:31,825 --> 01:11:35,139
We're telling you we'd like to
postpone till the first, correct.

774
01:11:35,228 --> 01:11:37,837
It's the best thing we can do. I know
you don't want to cancel on anybody.

775
01:11:37,897 --> 01:11:39,503
-I don't.
-I know,

776
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:42,675
but this is where we are. We have to
do this. Otherwise, you could...

777
01:11:42,736 --> 01:11:45,913
If I say, "Justin, it's your choice, we can
do Syracuse tomorrow," you'll say "Yes,"

778
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:48,649
'cause you want to do every show.
But you'll destroy your vocal cords

779
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:50,850
-and we can't risk that.
-I would not let you do that.

780
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:53,518
I already have stepped in,
but I would not let you do that.

781
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:56,222
There's gonna be a lot of kids
that are going to be let down.

782
01:11:56,315 --> 01:11:58,058
Can I tell you something?

783
01:11:59,118 --> 01:12:01,600
Hear me clearly on this

784
01:12:01,687 --> 01:12:04,762
that you do this now
and move one or two,

785
01:12:04,857 --> 01:12:08,365
or we're going to be shutting down
five, six, maybe seven later.

786
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:11,411
Do you want to cancel seven shows
or move one or two now?

787
01:12:11,464 --> 01:12:13,912
-Move one.
-Okay, we're gonna move one now.

788
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:18,351
And, that's the option you have tonight.
You may not have this option

789
01:12:18,404 --> 01:12:21,388
if you don't make smart decisions
about this in a week or two.

790
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,715
That's where we are.

791
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:23,846
We've never canceled a show.

792
01:12:23,909 --> 01:12:25,982
We've done over 120 shows
in the last two years.

793
01:12:26,044 --> 01:12:29,621
We did 14 shows with a broken foot.
Sang through strep throat.

794
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:31,561
We're three days
from the biggest show of our tour.

795
01:12:31,817 --> 01:12:33,491
The timing could not be worse.

796
01:12:36,589 --> 01:12:39,333
-Can you give me an E?
-How about McDonald's tonight?

797
01:12:39,491 --> 01:12:42,475
-No. Give me an E.
-Chicken nuggets?

798
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,564
Fried stuff, the doctor said
you're not supposed to have.

799
01:12:44,663 --> 01:12:45,871
Those are fried.

800
01:12:45,931 --> 01:12:48,847
But he also said, "No one's perfect."

801
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:52,613
And he said, if you do it,
"You're a kid and you can do it."

802
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,811
I'll tell you what,
I'm only trying to help you here.

803
01:12:54,872 --> 01:12:57,151
Is this what you want to do?

804
01:12:59,677 --> 01:13:00,918
You still in the game?

805
01:13:00,978 --> 01:13:03,427
Or you ready to can it
and go home to Canada?

806
01:13:03,482 --> 01:13:05,464
Nope? You're still
in the game then, right?

807
01:13:07,018 --> 01:13:08,054
Okay.

808
01:13:08,152 --> 01:13:12,333
People don't often understand if
a singer says, "My voice is going down."

809
01:13:12,424 --> 01:13:15,965
They understand if
a football player tears a muscle,

810
01:13:16,027 --> 01:13:19,501
but the same thing, really,
can happen to a singer's throat.

811
01:13:19,597 --> 01:13:22,547
This is the strictest vocal rest
he is going to know.

812
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,146
And now, the protocol has to be
carried out by all of us,

813
01:13:25,203 --> 01:13:29,553
and it's not just about the next 36 hours,
this is ongoing for the rest of this tour.

814
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,088
-Why don't you go talk to him?
-I'm happy to.

815
01:13:34,645 --> 01:13:39,121
You and I'll talk about your regiment.
This is fine. You can do this all day.

816
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:43,033
I love you for doing that, okay.
You just can't talk on it.

817
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:30,882
Hello, sweetheart. Don't talk.

818
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:34,443
How's my baby?

819
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,975
Do you not feel good?

820
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:42,055
Okay, I got Justin on board
and we're leaving right now.

821
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:47,197
It's been a rough week.
We're on our way straight to the doctor,

822
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:51,232
and we got to see if
the swelling in his throat went down.

823
01:14:51,288 --> 01:14:54,761
I think we're all a little bit on edge
to make sure he's healthy enough.

824
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:59,734
God, I pray that you will just
help Justin's headache go away.

825
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:02,945
And I pray for complete healing.

826
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,446
New York City.

827
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,088
Okay, let's see what's going on.

828
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,054
Say "Ah".

829
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,824
It's still red in the throat.

830
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:21,290
-I hate this.
-I know.

831
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,298
High voice, falsetto.

832
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,901
JB, do you want more water?

833
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,309
There you go.

834
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,748
So, he's got swelling
on both vocal cords,

835
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,046
that's what indicates to me
he has some reflux.

836
01:15:44,105 --> 01:15:46,178
The vocal strain is partly because

837
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,849
he's trying to sing through the redness
and thickness of the reflux.

838
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,927
And then, on top of that, add the
infection that he had over the weekend,

839
01:15:52,013 --> 01:15:54,622
which is really what
threw him over the edge.

840
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:58,131
I'd like him to try the vapors today
and see what difference that makes.

841
01:15:58,419 --> 01:16:01,666
So, this just proves to the world
he's human.

842
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,499
All right. Can we leave now?

843
01:16:03,557 --> 01:16:05,300
-I'm pretty much done.
-All right.

844
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,344
-As long as you have enough medicine.
-We have enough.

845
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:23,783
You know,
I grew up worshiping this place.

846
01:16:23,844 --> 01:16:26,987
And to think that
a 12-year-old kid I found on YouTube

847
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,527
is going to be in the Garden tomorrow.

848
01:16:32,453 --> 01:16:35,335
It's gonna be... Yeah, I'm excited.

849
01:16:38,726 --> 01:16:41,505
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

850
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,804
It was actually
a year and three days ago

851
01:16:45,866 --> 01:16:48,542
that Justin and I were
in a sound pit just like this.

852
01:16:48,602 --> 01:16:50,982
It was the first time
he had ever been in the Garden,

853
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:54,215
and we got invited to meet Taylor Swift
at her sold-out show,

854
01:16:54,274 --> 01:16:56,517
the first time
she'd ever sold out the Garden.

855
01:16:56,576 --> 01:16:58,489
And I remember the kids were

856
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:01,495
waving their hands side-to-side
all around these stands.

857
01:17:04,151 --> 01:17:07,294
This is really what I want to do. I want
to be doing this the rest of my life.

858
01:17:07,954 --> 01:17:10,631
Justin looked at me and said,
"I can do this."

859
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:13,264
And I said, "I believe you can."
He goes, "No, I can do it in a year"

860
01:17:13,327 --> 01:17:17,507
He kind of believed it, but
at the same time, he was like, "Maybe.

861
01:17:17,564 --> 01:17:21,573
"MSG's really hard to sell out.
it's a really iconic venue."

862
01:17:24,236 --> 01:17:28,017
He looked at me and was like, "I can do
this. I don't care how hard I gotta work."

863
01:17:28,074 --> 01:17:32,424
Scooter usually tells me to
believe in my dreams and just go for it.

864
01:17:34,514 --> 01:17:35,721
But we wanted that Garden.

865
01:17:35,815 --> 01:17:38,161
We looked at the route,
and I saw the first leg and they said,

866
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:40,256
"Maybe we'll save Madison Square
Garden for the second leg."

867
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:41,994
I said, "No, no, no. We're going for it."

868
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:49,101
So, we went on sale
and they call me and they're like,

869
01:17:49,162 --> 01:17:52,009
"We're going to sell out
this entire tour in two days."

870
01:17:52,064 --> 01:17:53,339
And I said, "What about the Garden?"

871
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:56,349
And they said, "The Garden?
That sold out an hour ago."

872
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:57,746
And I said, "What?"

873
01:17:57,803 --> 01:18:00,753
They said,
"Yeah, we sold that out in 22 minutes."

874
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:06,119
Now we're less than 24 hours.

875
01:18:06,212 --> 01:18:09,253
I'm nervous,
but I've seen him pull through,

876
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:12,127
so I got to believe that he can.

877
01:18:58,396 --> 01:19:00,206
Justin! I love you!

878
01:19:18,182 --> 01:19:20,665
-Nobody's in there.
-No one's coming out.

879
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:22,187
Is it that one?

880
01:19:46,543 --> 01:19:48,354
-What's up, buddy?
-How are you, man?

881
01:19:48,412 --> 01:19:50,291
-How you feeling?
-Feeling good.

882
01:19:50,314 --> 01:19:53,298
What were you knuckleheads
doing out there, causing a ruckus?

883
01:19:57,854 --> 01:20:00,336
You're wearing my favorite color!

884
01:20:00,389 --> 01:20:02,531
I said I'd come and I was gonna be
dressed like you today.

885
01:20:02,592 --> 01:20:03,628
It's nice.

886
01:20:03,694 --> 01:20:06,735
Kenny put me onto this kind of T-shirt,
these kind of shirts.

887
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:09,242
I would never have worn this
if it wasn't for Kenny.

888
01:20:11,234 --> 01:20:13,147
-How you doing? Good with you.
-What up, man?

889
01:20:13,202 --> 01:20:14,546
-How are you?
-I'm good.

890
01:20:14,604 --> 01:20:15,606
What up?

891
01:20:26,349 --> 01:20:28,957
This is an honor.
it's an honor to perform with you guys.

892
01:20:29,018 --> 01:20:30,521
While we're doing all this,

893
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,602
I want you to
keep your voice as still as you can.

894
01:20:32,688 --> 01:20:35,102
We're still not out of the woods yet.
We got a big show tonight.

895
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:36,194
So, no talking.

896
01:20:36,459 --> 01:20:38,634
Wow. You're on the floor.

897
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:42,979
-Oh, my God!
-You are a saint! You are a saint!

898
01:20:43,031 --> 01:20:44,478
Thank you so much!

899
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:49,977
It's not that bad.

900
01:20:50,072 --> 01:20:52,281
-Every show you knock that back.
-Breakfast of champions.

901
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:54,219
What does it do?

902
01:20:58,914 --> 01:21:01,396
All the nutrition
that your body ever needs.

903
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:05,668
Oh, God. This smells like liquid poop.

904
01:21:05,754 --> 01:21:08,966
He's not gonna like it.
it's his first time having it, man.

905
01:21:09,024 --> 01:21:11,734
It's like dinosaur pee.

906
01:21:11,793 --> 01:21:14,868
Wait till you hit the stage.
When you got that in your system...

907
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:16,274
When you get to
the second phase of the show...

908
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:17,811
I'm 16. I always have energy.

909
01:21:17,865 --> 01:21:20,610
Okay. But you won't be 16 forever.

910
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,847
Group hug, fellas.

911
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:28,980
-Big moment tonight.
-Bring it in for the real thing.

912
01:21:29,544 --> 01:21:33,894
You're family, the little man in our lives.
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say

913
01:21:33,948 --> 01:21:35,053
we're proud right now.

914
01:21:37,318 --> 01:21:38,765
-Love you.
-Love you, too, man.

915
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:41,063
Should he kill this now in front of you
so you know he drank it?

916
01:21:41,122 --> 01:21:43,628
Please.

917
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,000
Finish it, man. Finish it.

918
01:21:45,059 --> 01:21:46,597
The last part's so bad.

919
01:21:46,661 --> 01:21:49,439
Come on. it's not that bad, dude.

920
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:53,074
Ten minutes! Ten minutes!

921
01:21:58,505 --> 01:22:03,516
I was once chilling in my room,
watching TM just in a regular place.

922
01:22:03,644 --> 01:22:08,530
And now I'm in this big world,
living my dream and doing what I love.

923
01:22:10,617 --> 01:22:13,260
It's just crazy how it all came around.

924
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,613
Let's go!

925
01:22:28,669 --> 01:22:30,240
Bring him down.

926
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:32,207
Got to roll.

927
01:22:41,815 --> 01:22:44,958
New York City.
Are you having a good time so far?

928
01:22:45,018 --> 01:22:47,398
It's the My World Tour!

929
01:22:50,523 --> 01:22:54,168
I thank you for this day, and thank you
for the journey leading up to this day.

930
01:22:54,227 --> 01:22:56,300
Protect everyone, including Justin,

931
01:22:56,362 --> 01:23:00,337
and bless everybody for your glory, God.
In Jesus' name.

932
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,211
-Amen.
-Amen.

933
01:23:03,002 --> 01:23:04,677
Rock and roll, buddy.

934
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:07,981
Everybody get in.

935
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:30,172
I got to tell you something, right?
It's a little motto to live by.

936
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:32,233
Basically, it goes like this.

937
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:35,378
There's gonna be times in your life
when people tell you

938
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:37,712
that you can't do something.

939
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:40,810
And there's gonna be times in your life
when people say

940
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:42,648
that you can't live your dreams.

941
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:47,316
And there's gonna be times in your life

942
01:23:48,413 --> 01:23:49,757
when people say

943
01:23:49,815 --> 01:23:53,130
that you can't sell out
Madison Square Garden!

944
01:23:56,188 --> 01:23:58,363
This is what I tell them.

945
01:24:09,868 --> 01:24:13,114
Never say never

946
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,417
Let's go!
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

947
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:22,056
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

948
01:26:14,857 --> 01:26:16,532
Yeah! Yeah!

949
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:22,511
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
Put your hands up!

950
01:27:39,306 --> 01:27:40,810
All right. You ready?

951
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:47,356
Get your, get your, get your hands up!
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

952
01:27:47,681 --> 01:27:50,597
Get your, get your, get your hands up!

953
01:27:58,558 --> 01:28:02,408
Give it up for little bro,
Jay Smith, everybody!

954
01:28:08,402 --> 01:28:10,907
---if you came here to
fa!! in love with Justin Bieber,

955
01:28:11,004 --> 01:28:14,820
I want you to make some noise!

956
01:28:21,414 --> 01:28:25,925
I want Justin to be able to find
his identity and worth

957
01:28:25,986 --> 01:28:30,633
not from what he can do,
but from who he is.

958
01:28:35,294 --> 01:28:38,335
We've done the best we can
raising him.

959
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,345
Hopefully, as he goes through life,

960
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:44,852
he'll remember what we've said to him
about being respectful to people,

961
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:47,979
and being a good man.

962
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:53,390
There's so many people out there
who think he's just some kid act.

963
01:28:53,446 --> 01:28:56,862
That he's gonna be a teen sensation,
then he's going to go away.

964
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,021
I wouldn't bet against Justin,

965
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:01,261
and I sure would bet
against Justin and his team.

966
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,732
We like being the underdog.

967
01:29:02,788 --> 01:29:06,501
We'd like to stay the underdog
as long as possible.

968
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:09,073
Kind of gives us something to work for.

969
01:29:10,996 --> 01:29:13,239
As he grows,
as he goes through life's experiences,

970
01:29:13,298 --> 01:29:17,341
as he loves, as he finds relationships,
all of this will become part of the story.

971
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:19,783
And, for me,
it's beautiful to watch it all over again

972
01:29:19,838 --> 01:29:22,047
because I understand it firsthand.

973
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:27,221
I mean, this is something that could
definitely be a forever story.

974
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,645
Only if he wants it.

975
01:30:39,417 --> 01:30:40,761
New York!

976
01:34:21,768 --> 01:34:24,307
I love him!

977
01:35:03,642 --> 01:35:05,851
Good job out there, man.
Thank you so much for coming out.

978
01:35:15,487 --> 01:35:16,523
Amazing.

979
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:46,366
-Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin!
-Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin!

980
01:35:54,925 --> 01:35:58,137
MSG is a big deal for me.
You know, performing here.

981
01:35:58,195 --> 01:35:59,938
I'm really blessed to just be
in this position

982
01:35:59,997 --> 01:36:04,211
and have so many great fans
who have followed me since day one.

983
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:07,948
And I want to thank everyone in here-

984
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:10,487
Let's do another song.
You want to do another song?

985
01:36:11,942 --> 01:36:13,581
Who wants to be my baby?

986
01:39:12,853 --> 01:39:13,855
Say what?

987
01:39:55,528 --> 01:39:56,906
You came out with
what you went in with.

988
01:39:58,864 --> 01:40:03,648
Okay. All right. Now, let's cool it down.
Okay, Ninja Man?

989
01:40:04,537 --> 01:40:07,706
Ninja Turtle. All right.

990
01:40:30,195 --> 01:40:31,675
Who wants to be my baby?

991
01:40:35,033 --> 01:40:38,017
This is my classmate from college.

992
01:40:38,069 --> 01:40:40,643
-We've known each other for 30 years.
-We've been hanging a long time.

993
01:40:52,551 --> 01:40:53,997
Spidey.

994
01:40:55,319 --> 01:40:58,303
The Segway sweat.

995
01:41:07,231 --> 01:41:11,912
I'm in Australia. I'm here.
Look what I found just randomly.

996
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:14,977
What's up, man? it's a kangaroo.

997
01:41:15,673 --> 01:41:18,122
Does he have a Bieber shirt on?

998
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:36,177
...give Justin the strength that he needs.

999
01:44:36,237 --> 01:44:39,881
And, my God, help us to all understand
the responsibility that goes with

1000
01:44:39,939 --> 01:44:42,650
what comes after this.

1001
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,457
Bye. I love you.
