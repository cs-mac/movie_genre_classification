Final Episode

4
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,976
This is supposed to be good for you.

5
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:19,904
No.

6
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,034
Broccoli is good for you,

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,288
so let's get some more broccoli, Seo Yeon.

8
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:28,091
Should we buy ice cream, too?

9
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:32,881
Seo Yeon.

10
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,694
Seo Yeon.

11
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,865
Seo Yeon.

12
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:39,799
Seo Yeon.

13
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,655
Seo Yeon.

14
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:46,643
Where did she go?

15
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,078
Seo Yeon.

16
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:53,923
Seo Yeon!

17
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:56,571
Seo Yeon!

18
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:00,749
Seo Yeon!

19
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,325
Seo Yeon.

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,334
Seo Yeon.

21
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:14,589
What do I do?

22
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:17,134
What do I do?

23
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:22,926
That'll be 1,600 won.

24
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,196
Yeah, Mom. What is it?

25
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,944
Where?

26
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:30,841
Mom, where was your head at?

27
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,892
- What is it, honey?
- She lost Seo Yeon.

28
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:35,118
- What?
- Alright. Alright, Mom.

29
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:38,842
I'll go that way. Mom, mom!
Call Father, alright?

30
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,943
I'm sorry, there's been an emergency.

31
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:42,644
- Ho Shik!
- Yes!

32
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,816
Honey, I can't. I'm in the middle of -

33
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:46,949
Alright, it's fine.

34
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:52,071
Seo Yeon!

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,535
Seo Yeon!

36
00:02:08,823 --> 00:02:10,706
Seo Yeon!

37
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:13,486
Where were you going to go?

38
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,017
Where?

39
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,556
Home.

40
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,313
This isn't the bus home.

41
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,456
You came out to buy groceries with Mom.

42
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:24,344
You should've stuck to her side.
How can you wander off like this?

43
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,595
What would've happened if
you got on the bus?

44
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:30,306
You'll forever be a hindrance to my mom.

45
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,367
Come here.

46
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,437
I said come here!

47
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:36,711
I'm going to go crazy.

48
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,632
What is it?

49
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:42,989
Hey!

50
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,615
Hey, hey.

51
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,221
I know it's because you're sick,

52
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:50,095
but please don't give my mom
such a hard time.

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,127
I heard you were dragging around
my mom for three hours yesterday.

54
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:56,985
You think it's easy for an elderly to walk
around during winter for three hours?

55
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,092
I found Seo Yeon.

56
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:05,768
At the bus stop, near the dermatologist.

57
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,266
It's here, here.

58
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,703
Home is this way, here.

59
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:18,868
You can understand what I'm saying,

60
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:22,137
what were you thinking when
you disappeared like that?

61
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:25,490
Tell me. Why did you?

62
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:29,061
Were you going to go home on that bus?

63
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,722
But that bus takes you to a
completely different place.

64
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:34,977
Seo Yeon!

65
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,547
Seo Yeon!

66
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,601
You can't do this when we're out!

67
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,418
It's bad.

68
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:47,409
It's really bad!

69
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:53,468
Tell your father we found her.

70
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:56,249
Let's go, Seo Yeon. Let's go.

71
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,446
I'll get you some tea, Seo Yeon.
Just wait a moment.

72
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:03,947
You're cold, right?

73
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,749
My goodness! In this cold weather,

74
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:09,408
just where were you trying
to go by yourself?

75
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,662
Where did you want to go?

76
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:14,084
You probably lost her while you're chatting
away with someone from the neighborhood.

77
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,569
I wasn't chatting!

78
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,137
I took my eyes off her
for just a moment,

79
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:20,193
it was only for a moment when I was
picking vegetables, just a short moment!

80
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,797
That doesn't mean the same thing
won't happen again.

81
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,434
Let's not lose her for real and
all fall into a state of panic.

82
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,483
Tell my husband to buy a handcuff,

83
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,161
or tie a string around her wrist
when you go out!

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,595
What is it?

85
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,553
It's for your benefit,
for the benefit of all of us.

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,930
I told you not to treat her
like a mindless child!

87
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:54,250
What do you mean handcuffs?

88
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:14,572
You want to wash your hands?

89
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:16,940
Aunt.

90
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,571
What is it?

91
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:22,396
Who is she?

92
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:27,166
Why is she over there, looking at me?

93
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,913
It's... it's you, Seo Yeon.

94
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,852
It's you, you.

95
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,220
Look carefully, it's you.

96
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:39,928
It looks exactly like you.

97
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,710
This is a mirror,

98
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,818
and you're being reflected off
by that mirror.

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,336
Right. When you stand in front
of the mirror,

100
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:56,949
there's another one of you.

101
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,297
You're right, you're right.

102
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,967
Yeah, you're right.

103
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:06,544
I want to take a bath.

104
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:08,823
He said you already took one.

105
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,865
Your husband said that before
I came this morning,

106
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,374
you already took a bath.

107
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,270
They want us to take care of both its
functionality and what it symbolizes.

108
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:46,966
The two contradict each other.

109
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:48,671
It's going to be difficult.

110
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:49,954
But why is it two?

111
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:53,054
I made two of them
with the location of the sun in mind.

112
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,853
This one has a staircase in the center, huh?

113
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,902
That might be more practical.

114
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:05,147
<i>Seo Yeon is deteriorating quickly,</i>

115
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,840
<i>fast enough to shock even her doctor.</i>

116
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:21,926
Seo Yeon.

117
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,361
You have to eat soup with a spoon.

118
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:26,227
Here.

119
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,548
Like this.

120
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,839
You spoon it...

121
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:49,625
How about putting the rice in the soup?

122
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:55,615
Wait, wait...

123
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,183
<i>Seo Yeon often flies into fits of anger,</i>

124
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,478
<i>and when she gets angry,
she's unable to bring it to a halt.</i>

125
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,638
Nuna, I'll do it.

126
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:20,396
Our Ye Eun has so much pretty clothes.

127
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:22,284
Oh my!

128
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:46,126
You put this on top.

129
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,336
Put your hand through here.

130
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:52,935
There.

131
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:05,870
<i>She still has a grasp of who she is.</i>

132
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,418
<i>And every time she faces
that wall and despairs,</i>

133
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:11,585
<i>in a deep corner of her heart she rages.</i>

134
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:15,549
<i>Unable to hold back, she explodes.</i>

135
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,129
<i>At times she vacuums the floors,</i>

136
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:20,727
<i>and even rushes saying
she needs to make the rice,</i>

137
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,083
<i>but she spends much of her time
with an open book,</i>

138
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,281
<i>looking again and again
at the same page.</i>

139
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:32,068
<i>At times, she starts sobbing.</i>

140
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,937
<i>On some days
she sleeps for the entire day.</i>

141
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:38,492
<i>And on others, she watches the orchestra
playing for the whole day.</i>

142
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:45,567
<i>Her aunt says that there's a difference
when I'm there and when I'm not.</i>

143
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:50,530
<i>She says that when I'm not there,
my wife is even more confused.</i>

144
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:56,934
<i>At some point, I'll have to start
working from home.</i>

145
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:59,402
You eat so well!

146
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,812
Ye Eun must like it. Is it good?

147
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:04,611
Is it good? You're so nice.

148
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:07,215
- Let's have another bite.
- Wait a bit.

149
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:09,253
She's having trouble eating it
every time you feed her.

150
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:10,950
Really?

151
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,554
Should we take a rest?
Should we take a rest before eating?

152
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,731
There's only one spoonful left.

153
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,430
Ahjumma, there's only a spoonful left.

154
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:19,558
If we take a rest,
she may lose her appetite.

155
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,730
Fine, then. Feed her the rest.

156
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,407
Alright.

157
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,277
Here.

158
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:30,234
That's right. It's good, right?
It's really good.

159
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:33,629
I'll come back after I put the bowl back.

160
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:42,953
You're already done?

161
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,725
I boiled and dried the bottle correctly.

162
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,744
Did you come here to watch me?

163
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,339
No, I didn't.

164
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:51,978
We may be able to use these until
the day after tomorrow.

165
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,644
I see.

166
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,686
If the wedding hadn't been called off,
you would've been a mom, too.

167
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,754
That's right, isn't it?

168
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:01,921
<i>Dad's here.</i>

169
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:03,940
Ye Eun's dad is here!

170
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,178
Dad, Dad!

171
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:09,663
Did you have fun?
Did you behave well?

172
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:12,073
What is it?

173
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,744
- She peed on grandpa's pants.
- What?

174
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:18,695
Your dad was going to change her diaper,

175
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:22,346
and in that short period she did it.

176
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:26,336
You should've held it in a little, lady.

177
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,174
What did Father say?

178
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:31,215
He said I didn't change the diaper
earlier and blamed me.

179
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,450
I was busy making preparations for dinner.

180
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:38,876
Your father was lecturing
Ye Eun for a long time.

181
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,000
He said she should let us know if
she needs her diaper changed.

182
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:46,264
That it's more hygienic and feels cleaner.

183
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:48,441
He told her she shouldn't kindly
wait for us to notice.

184
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,543
Give her over.

185
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,607
- Are you going to go now?
- Yes.

186
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:57,649
- Hey, Hee Soo!
- Yes!

187
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:00,990
- You're here?
- Yeah.

188
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,534
- I'll take Ye Eun out.
- No, she's heavier than you think.

189
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,764
I know. It's okay.

190
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,932
She's not heavy.
She's not heavy at all, right?

191
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,463
Right?

192
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,242
When did you get here?

193
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,237
About two hours ago?

194
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:22,808
There are two types of bottles in there.

195
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,721
She eats it well.

196
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,835
Just give her half of the milk and
half of the other.

197
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:29,967
Alright.

198
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,906
Your mother is going to be angry with you.

199
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,511
What do you mean?
I just wanted to see Ye Eun.

200
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,809
Don't worry yourself for no reason.

201
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,146
I've met a person I'm thinking of dating.

202
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,621
I should congratulate you.

203
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,561
He's a pianist.

204
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,501
Mom likes him, too.

205
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:55,711
He's nice.

206
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,888
Yeah, I hope it works out well.

207
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,258
You two...

208
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:31,197
What are you two doing?

209
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,360
What is this?

210
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,892
Mom!

211
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:37,998
Why did you lie?

212
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,405
If you said you were going to exercise,
then you should've gone and exercised.

213
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,308
I heard you cancelled
your session yesterday.

214
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:43,964
Mom, Mom!

215
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,142
I remembered that all of a sudden.

216
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:49,180
We threw away the menu while we were
ordering lunch, and ran over here.

217
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:52,495
Even if I grab my head in frustration
and try,

218
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,948
I truly cannot understand you.

219
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:57,714
How could you have no anger?

220
00:13:58,002 --> 00:13:59,531
Is that kid yours?

221
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:02,713
What connection do you two have
that you follow her around?

222
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:04,890
Go, Mom. Go, go.

223
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,177
- Hey, Ji Hyung.
- Yes.

224
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,335
You know she's an idiot, right?

225
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:13,025
Alright, my kid's an idiot
and you're so great,

226
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:15,681
that you stomped on her and
didn't even look back.

227
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,729
If you have even a shred of conscience,

228
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:21,409
don't you need to help Hyang Gi
go on her own path?

229
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:23,702
- Mother -
- Why are you accepting her?

230
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,127
You, and your mom, as well!

231
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:28,512
I'm going to go my own way.
Don't let your imagination run wild!

232
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:31,821
Ahjumma doesn't like it when I'm here,
she's worried about you.

233
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,574
Oppa doesn't like it, either.

234
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm the one who wanted to come.
I wanted to see Ye Eun.

235
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,658
Don't get any misconceptions!

236
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:40,155
Don't say anything more and get in the car.

237
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,687
Hurry and get in!

238
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,727
Sorry, Oppa.

239
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,465
Ji Hyung.

240
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:00,614
Yes.

241
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:02,332
You-

242
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:05,810
It really worries us that Hyang Gi

243
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,187
still hangs around you.

244
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:11,312
You need to help us.

245
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,467
You don't need to worry, Father.

246
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,256
Neither Hyang Gi nor I have any intention
of giving you cause to worry.

247
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:19,481
This is the first time
I've seen Hyang Gi here.

248
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:23,477
I... want Hyang Gi to meet
a nice man and be happy.

249
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:26,432
You're being honest, right?
I can trust you, right?

250
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:27,965
Yes.

251
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,242
Alright, I'll trust you.

252
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,438
Then, I'll be going now.

253
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:34,519
Kid...

254
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,344
If you had just shut your eyes
for a moment,

255
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,476
it would've saved a lot of people
a lot of stress.

256
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,860
Do you know just how undutiful of
a son you are to your parents?

257
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:44,743
Yes.

258
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,802
What is it?

259
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:12,744
I'll do it.

260
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,682
Aunt will do it, Seo Yeon.

261
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:20,670
It's okay. I make the same mistake, as well.

263
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:21,788
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,075
I told you it's okay.

265
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:25,951
Aunt.

266
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:27,746
What is it?

267
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,132
I think Park Ji Hyung ran away.

268
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:32,395
What are you talking about?

269
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:34,735
He didn't run away. He went to work.

270
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,744
He'll be here soon with Ye Eun.

271
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:39,069
It's almost time.

272
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,827
This morning, after giving you a bath,

273
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:46,350
he went out to work at eleven.

274
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,400
Think back.

275
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:52,510
I don't remember.

276
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:55,349
No...

277
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,256
Yeah... I remember.

278
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,926
No... I can't remember.

279
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:11,712
I'm a liar.

280
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,736
Our Seo Yeon isn't a liar.

281
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:22,240
Our Seo Yeon is very honest, smart,
talented, kind, determined.

282
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,675
You don't have any bad traits.

283
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:27,566
You're such a great catch!

284
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:30,960
Why doesn't Jae Min come?

285
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:33,305
He came yesterday.

286
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:39,377
Oh... yesterday. Yeah.

287
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,616
Aunt.

288
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,331
What?

289
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,120
I've become really dumb, haven't I?

290
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:49,291
No, not at all.

291
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,608
You haven't become dumb.
You're exactly the same.

292
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,594
You've stayed exactly the same.

293
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:56,612
Don't worry.

294
00:17:56,746 --> 00:18:02,431
I think... there are times that I disappear,

295
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:07,231
when I feel like I'm not myself.

296
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:23,560
Ye Eun's here, Ye Eun!

297
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,821
Where did you go off to?

298
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,355
Honey, I'm home.

299
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,114
Yeah.

300
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:34,183
- Have you been well?
- Yeah.

301
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,744
And you took your medicine?

302
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,260
Milk, green tea, yogurt and rice.

303
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,818
I ate it all.

304
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:43,127
- I love you.
- Me, too.

305
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,517
Tomorrow, I'll love you 5,200 times more.

306
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:47,727
Me, too.

307
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,321
Seo Yeon! Ye Eun, Ye Eun!

308
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:53,572
Hi.

309
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:55,911
- Let's go in.
- Hi.

310
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:57,797
Yeah.

311
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,449
One moment, okay?

312
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,128
Alright.

313
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:29,474
- You're going to sleep?
- No.

314
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:31,801
What did you do?

315
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:34,757
Just... nothing much.

316
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:38,531
The weather's nice.
Let's go for a drive tomorrow.

317
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:45,719
No!

318
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:47,824
Let's put the food in first.

319
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:52,659
Ye Eun, I'm going to put the food
your grandma sent into the fridge.

320
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:57,131
Don't cry. Don't cry, don't cry.

321
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:01,523
What's in here that's so heavy?

322
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:09,004
No wonder! It's heavy because of this.

323
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,336
She tries to avoid eating this.

324
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:15,258
We still have leftovers from
the last one they sent.

325
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:20,261
I'll make dinner, so you should
go home and rest.

326
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,526
Yes?

327
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:26,277
- Ji Hyung.
- Yes?

328
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:31,125
I went to the market before
and nearly lost her.

329
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,378
Just for a short moment,

330
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,040
in the time I took to put vegetables
in the cart, she somehow disappeared -

331
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:40,325
Where did you find her?

332
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:43,812
Myung Hee found her
about to get on a bus.

333
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:49,128
I don't think I should take her out
with me now.

334
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:55,623
This town's so small, we'd probably
be able to find her.

335
00:20:57,153 --> 00:21:00,177
But what if she gets hit by a car?

336
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:02,711
I was terrified.

337
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,820
Why is she doing things she's
never done before?

338
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,138
Did you ask where she was going to go?

339
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,890
Home.

340
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,375
That's what she said to Myung Hee,
though it's a bus going to Eui Jung Boo.

341
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,920
And before,

342
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:23,339
she looked at herself in the mirror
and asked who it was.

343
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:31,279
She asked why she was looking
at her from there.

344
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,977
I was so shocked I nearly collapsed.

345
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,495
What do we do about this?

346
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,652
Why is she like that?

347
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:49,843
Why is she deteriorating so quickly?

348
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:54,262
What is she thinking?

349
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,548
I can drink it later.

350
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:23,560
Really? Should I leave it?

351
00:22:23,624 --> 00:22:25,638
Yeah.

352
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:38,278
Seo Yeon.

353
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,756
What is it?

354
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:45,254
You can't go out by yourself.

355
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,987
I can't go out alone anyway.

356
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:50,231
In order to prevent me from going out,

357
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,767
you put that on the inside, too.

358
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:55,283
I don't know the code. I can't go out.

359
00:22:57,448 --> 00:23:00,167
Aunt hides it from me so I can't see.

360
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:02,567
When you go out with Aunt,

361
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:07,164
I told you to stick by Aunt's side,
didn't I?

362
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:08,353
I know.

363
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,124
It'll be difficult
if you lose your way home.

364
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,447
I said I know.

365
00:23:12,668 --> 00:23:16,258
Seo Yeon. You love me, right?

366
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,459
Do you think I don't?

367
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:32,308
Do you think I've forgotten
that I love you?

368
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:36,357
No, I wanted to make sure.

369
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:39,287
Even if I forget everything else,

370
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,359
I won't forget that. Don't worry.

371
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:48,714
Park Ji Hyung. My husband.

372
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,398
Ye Eun's father.

373
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:56,202
The person who loves me to death.

374
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:03,541
The person who is going up the mountain
with a cross on his back.

375
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:06,170
You can't give up, Seo Yeon.

376
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,282
For me, who you love...

377
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:15,830
For our Ye Eun, you can never give up.

378
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:20,929
I won't give up.

379
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:25,397
When I look at you, it looks like
you've already given up.

380
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:30,019
I think you've started to let go and
accept whatever happens.

381
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:35,318
It looks like you've given up.

382
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:38,592
Yeah. You're right.

383
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:42,189
I don't like being tired.

384
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:47,599
It's so difficult trying to
hold on and be alert,

385
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,575
you have no idea.

386
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,837
And even if I do, it doesn't mean
the inevitable won't come.

387
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,983
It keeps slipping out.

388
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:00,782
When I look at aunt and you,

389
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:05,131
I think, "Oh, I've made another mistake. "

390
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:08,693
I don't realize it while I'm doing it.

391
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:11,397
I realize afterwards that I've
done something wrong.

392
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:14,551
And I feel like going crazy.

393
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,704
But you still can't give up.

394
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:22,092
You can't just let things be.

395
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,529
The answer is already written.

396
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,969
Just because I hold out doesn't
mean it's going to change.

397
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:31,763
Those thoughts... push those thoughts away.

398
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,708
That's despair.

399
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:38,905
We... for you and I, our child,
every day is special.

400
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,692
Even if it's for just one day more,

401
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:45,668
I want you to stay as yourself by our side.

402
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:48,006
I want to, honey.

403
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,327
But I can't.

404
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:52,280
I can't do it.

405
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:57,275
No matter how hard I clench my fists,

406
00:25:57,532 --> 00:26:01,820
I keep slipping through my fingers.

407
00:26:03,717 --> 00:26:07,272
When I wake up, some days I don't
even recognize my own room.

408
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,762
The bathroom, living room...

409
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:13,484
It's as if
I'm seeing them for the first time.

410
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:17,059
I try to not let it show
and even that's hard.

411
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,999
I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

412
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:24,569
I can't hurt with you. I'm sorry.

413
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:30,450
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:32,752
I'm sorry, really.

415
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:35,437
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:37,706
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,925
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:42,768
I'm sorry, honey.

419
00:26:43,122 --> 00:26:45,344
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:51,525
<i>My wife said the answer is already written.</i>

421
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:55,106
<i>I know the answer is already written,
as well.</i>

422
00:26:56,646 --> 00:27:00,344
<i>Wanting her to be Lee Seo Yeon
for just a day longer...</i>

423
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:08,089
<i>was no more than a selfish wish,
justified by love.</i>

424
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:21,752
Yeah, my husband has such a bad cold.

425
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:24,441
I can't just leave him alone.

426
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:29,248
I'm not showing off the fact
that I have a husband.

427
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,141
Yeah.

428
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:35,063
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:36,758
Yeah.

430
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,928
My daughter will be there with the money.

431
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,469
Yeah.

432
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:42,830
Oh, right.

433
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:45,532
Aren't you going to get insurance?

434
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:47,533
You never know what'll happen.

435
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:50,012
If you each get one...

436
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,845
Really? Six of them?

437
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:54,632
Hang up! Hang up!

438
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,602
I'm going to call my son and tell him to
send someone with the contracts.

439
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:00,152
Hang up, hang up!

440
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:02,822
Alright, hang up.

441
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,316
Son, it's mom.

442
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:12,688
I sold six insurance policies.

443
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:15,830
Yeah, to the members of our gathering.

444
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,794
Yeah, call Myung Hee

445
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,601
and send someone with the contracts.

446
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,285
No, I'm busy right now.

447
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:29,520
Ye Eun!

448
00:28:30,788 --> 00:28:32,489
Ye Eun!

449
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:35,124
<i>Ye Eun is here, Aunt!</i>

450
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,997
If you're going to take her,
you should've said so!

451
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,291
I thought someone stole her,
I was so shocked!

452
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:46,002
Aunt, how could someone steal a child?

453
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:48,989
It's because I couldn't see her.

454
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,803
Ji Hyung said he was going to wash up,

455
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:52,778
and your sister doesn't even touch the kid.

456
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,679
You looked busy doing the dishes.

457
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,117
- What do you think your mouth is for?
- I'm sorry. I was wrong.

458
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:00,560
- Check her diaper.
- I just changed it five minutes ago.

459
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,820
She had a big one.

460
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,439
Who would take your clothes?

461
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:10,337
No one here would do that.

462
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:12,655
They're disappearing one at a time.

463
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,517
I'm not lying.

464
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,641
I'm telling the truth!

465
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,401
I'm not going to move one step
from this spot.

466
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,803
If I'm not here,
all my clothes will be stolen.

467
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:25,250
Who?

468
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:27,235
Who would take them?

469
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:29,126
The ahjumma outside,

470
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,939
in order to give them to her daughter.

471
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,750
Snap out of it.

472
00:29:32,807 --> 00:29:33,946
What ahjumma?

473
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,317
She's your aunt! Your aunt!

474
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:40,463
How can you say that about your aunt?

475
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,234
Why are you getting angry?

476
00:29:43,368 --> 00:29:46,141
What did I do wrong?

477
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:52,368
You... you're Lee Seo Yeon.

478
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,378
You're a writer.

479
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:57,787
You're Team Manager Lee Seo Yeon,
who was known for her competence at work.

480
00:29:58,014 --> 00:29:59,861
This isn't it, Seo Yeon.

481
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,782
This isn't it.

482
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:04,138
I was wrong.

483
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:05,496
You're Lee Seo Yeon.

484
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:09,089
I'm Lee Seo Yeon. Did I say otherwise?

485
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:12,339
This is our house.

486
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:14,509
Your aunt is in the living room.

487
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,709
She comes every day in order to help us.

488
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,903
Moon Kwon didn't go to work today.
He's in his room.

489
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:24,189
There's no one here who would
take your clothes.

490
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,871
Right... let's go for a drive.

491
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:31,679
I need to protect my clothes.

492
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:33,662
Seo Yeon.

493
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:44,044
Drive... let's go.

494
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:50,933
I need to wear my clothes.

495
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,826
Move so I can take out my clothes.

496
00:31:01,948 --> 00:31:03,047
No.

497
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:04,305
It's winter.

498
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:06,334
Wear something else.

499
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:16,638
This is Jang Jae Min.

500
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:18,631
Oh, yes.

501
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,000
You didn't pick up
so I sent a message instead.

502
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:22,216
Yes.

503
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,566
Yes.

504
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,865
My mother's at a gathering right now.

505
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:28,147
No. Of course, not.

506
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:32,702
My mother said it was six people.
There may be more, though.

507
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:34,318
Yes.

508
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:37,375
Yes, goodbye.

509
00:31:39,645 --> 00:31:41,155
Oppa.

510
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:42,755
What are you doing here?

511
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:44,808
I was going to go for a drive with
you guys and get some fresh air.

512
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:46,697
- I suggested we go together.
- What should we do?

513
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:50,706
- Should I follow or should we take one car?
- I called you over so you could drive.

514
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:53,367
Alright. You guys get in the back.

515
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:55,385
Let's go, Seo Yeon.

516
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:59,001
I know.

517
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,626
You're my guard in case I make a mistake.

518
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:03,673
I've been caught, Ji Hyung.

519
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:06,640
That's not it. You were angry that
Jae Min turned his back on you.

520
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:09,297
That's why I told him to come.

521
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,608
Why is the weather so stifling?

522
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:14,557
It's like Gotham City.

523
00:32:14,606 --> 00:32:15,902
I'll start going now.

524
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,466
The driving won't be smooth for about
five minutes, just endure it.

525
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:20,945
Alright, let's go.

526
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,682
<i>Where are we going?</i>

527
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:30,080
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

528
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,411
<i>It's the road you liked.</i>

529
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:34,249
<i>Really?</i>

530
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:37,608
<i>Look at the lake over there,
you'll remember.</i>

531
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:39,797
<i>I'm looking.</i>

532
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:42,441
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

533
00:32:43,202 --> 00:32:44,633
<i>It's okay.</i>

534
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:49,232
I like it because it's new.

535
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:52,609
Kiss me.

536
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,963
The guard is up front.

537
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,549
It's okay.

538
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:03,307
As if you're kissing a baby, kiss me.

539
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,086
More.

540
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:17,840
Do it more.

541
00:33:56,647 --> 00:34:00,215
It's quaint and nice, right?

542
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:02,519
Yeah.

543
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:04,060
Let's go in.

544
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,700
Yeah.

545
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,696
It's delicious. Right, Oppa?

546
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:26,772
Yeah, eat up.

547
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:33,712
How did you find out about this place?

548
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:39,052
I came here quite a few times, with you.

549
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:42,902
Oh... you did.

550
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:44,902
We did.

551
00:35:08,021 --> 00:35:09,864
Before we left,

552
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,690
she mistook Aunt for an
ahjumma for a moment.

553
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:18,167
They say the first thing they forget are
the things most familiar to them,

554
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:21,870
but I guess that's not necessarily the case.

555
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,187
For how long?

556
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:26,804
Just a moment.

557
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,751
A very short moment.

558
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:35,317
Seeing as how that road and
the hotel has been erased,

559
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:39,782
it's probably not far before
I'm erased, as well.

560
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,562
There have been two cases

561
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,365
when I also wondered if she didn't know me.

562
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:55,455
Won't the people closest to her
be the last to be forgotten?

563
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:04,923
Seo Yeon, what is it?

564
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:14,259
What?

565
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:16,943
It suddenly came to me.

566
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,322
I want to die
when the cherry blossoms bloom.

567
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,501
When the petals fall like flakes of snow,

568
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,921
it's sad and beautiful.

569
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:29,035
It's cold. Let's get in the car.

570
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:30,630
I'm not cold.

571
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,712
It's not cold.

572
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,399
it's not cold.

573
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,934
You must be cold, right?

574
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:38,602
That's it, right?

575
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:42,567
Right, I'm cold. I'm freezing to death.

576
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,085
It's so cold!

577
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:05,699
<i>- Nuna!
- Seo Yeon!</i>

578
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:21,798
Why are you yelling?

579
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,397
I was so surprised!

580
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:26,189
I'm going to faint...

581
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:29,290
Hurry and take it from her. Take it!

582
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,975
Nuna...

583
00:37:31,964 --> 00:37:33,684
Seo Yeon, what is it?

584
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,813
This...

585
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,529
It's dangerous.

586
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:48,767
I know.

587
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:50,851
What? What were you going to do?

588
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:53,568
I wanted to give her a haircut.

589
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:55,686
I see.

590
00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:58,410
I don't like her hair.

591
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,725
It's not pretty.

592
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,599
It looks stupid.

593
00:38:02,623 --> 00:38:04,493
Alright.

594
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:07,580
Let's have it trimmed prettily tomorrow
at the salon.

595
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:10,695
You're not a hair stylist.

596
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:14,091
We should put this in the hands
of a professional, right?

597
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:36,449
Don't yell!

598
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:38,125
I don't like it when you yell!

599
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:41,000
Alright, Nuna. Alright.

600
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:58,897
Take her home.

601
00:38:59,064 --> 00:39:01,060
You should go, Aunt.

602
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,079
Alright.

603
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,584
No, no.

604
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,050
Later, later.

605
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,579
You, come here.

606
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,781
Let's do acupressure on your arm.

607
00:39:47,337 --> 00:39:49,376
His aunt over here,

608
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,634
although she's never raised a child,

609
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,191
she knows a lot of things,

610
00:39:57,326 --> 00:39:59,750
and will be of great help.

611
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:02,594
So rest at ease. Leave her to us,

612
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,652
and you can concentrate on your treatment.

613
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:08,411
Yes, Mother.

614
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:10,719
I'll leave her in your hands.

615
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:12,324
If you want to see her,

616
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:14,529
you can come and see her at any time.

617
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:20,615
And Ye Eun can come here
maybe once a week.

618
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:23,285
Of course, she can come at any time.

619
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:25,821
When you want to see her,
just give me a call.

620
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,858
Even if I'm sleeping, I'll get up and
come here right away, alright?

621
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,428
Yes.

622
00:40:31,508 --> 00:40:33,787
Thank you for being so understanding.

623
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:37,595
I know you're doing it because
I may make a mistake.

624
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:40,232
We're not doing it because
you're a danger to the child,

625
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:42,236
that's not it.

626
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:44,403
Yes.

627
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,076
What about the crib?

628
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:51,533
She needs to take the crib, right?

629
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:55,307
No, Seo Yeon said that she may
come over and need the crib.

630
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,977
She told me to leave it.

631
00:40:57,118 --> 00:41:00,344
At times like that she seems fine.

632
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:08,670
Bye, Ye Eun. Take care.

633
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,638
Later, I'll tell you about your mom.

634
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:18,152
I'll tell you everything.

635
00:41:18,262 --> 00:41:21,535
I'll tell you everything there is
to know about her.

636
00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:32,037
Yes?

637
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:34,090
<i>Ye Eun...</i>

638
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:53,597
Ye Eun's leaving.

639
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:57,853
Seo Yeon...

640
00:42:32,478 --> 00:42:34,327
Bye.

641
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:41,899
Take... care.

642
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:10,003
Aunt...

643
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:14,083
Please, please take care of her.

644
00:43:14,232 --> 00:43:17,488
Yes, of course. Don't worry. Don't worry.

645
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:19,385
Here.

646
00:43:20,617 --> 00:43:22,347
Let's go.

647
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:24,911
Ye Eun...

648
00:43:54,914 --> 00:43:58,091
Ji Hyung, Ye Eun's car seat.

649
00:43:58,187 --> 00:43:59,776
Oh...

650
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:02,870
She already left.

651
00:44:03,092 --> 00:44:05,287
I can bring it over later.

652
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,712
<i>Seo Yeon had been so indifferent
to our child,</i>

653
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:31,586
<i>to the point of where I wondered
how she could be so cold.</i>

654
00:44:32,228 --> 00:44:35,629
<i>But for the first time
she placed her hands on our child's face,</i>

655
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,584
<i>and spoke to her.</i>

656
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:41,652
<i>"Good bye. Take care. "</i>

657
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:47,501
<i>My wife did not watch our child leave.</i>

658
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:53,964
<i>My wife smiles.</i>

659
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:56,520
<i>I don't know why she smiles,</i>

660
00:44:56,658 --> 00:45:01,649
<i>or the meaning behind it.</i>

661
00:45:17,712 --> 00:45:21,491
Is it going to get infected?
Why does it hurt so much?

662
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,742
I was cleaning fish
and I got pricked by a bone.

663
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:28,489
They sent it from Bang Bae Dong.

664
00:45:32,508 --> 00:45:36,196
Ahjussi, who are you
that you're eating at our house?

665
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,810
It's your uncle.

666
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:42,952
I'm your aunt and he's my husband.

667
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:45,841
Myung Hee and Jae Min's father.

668
00:45:46,248 --> 00:45:47,881
Oh...

669
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,726
I see.

670
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,628
Hey, come out.

671
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:08,433
Come here. Talk to me.

672
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,557
I don't have friends.

673
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,545
Come out, okay?

674
00:46:16,355 --> 00:46:18,018
Come out.

675
00:46:24,942 --> 00:46:26,487
Seo Yeon.

676
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:30,123
Ahjummoni, Ahjummoni.

677
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:31,269
What is it?

678
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:33,676
There's some ahjussi in my room.

679
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,942
Chase him out. He won't listen to me.

680
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,137
He's your husband, Seo Yeon.

681
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:43,084
Husband. He's your husband!

682
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,274
I... got married?

683
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:52,104
You did. You even had a child!

684
00:46:53,169 --> 00:46:54,912
Oh...

685
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,069
Oh...

686
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:10,340
Aren't you going to work?

687
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:30,657
Honey...

688
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,655
Yeah, what is it?

689
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:37,371
Why are there so many people in our house?

690
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,183
It's so disruptive. Chase them out.

691
00:47:43,912 --> 00:47:47,453
Alright, let's chase them out.

692
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:54,488
Burn it! Burn them all!

693
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:10,518
I love you.

694
00:48:12,563 --> 00:48:16,261
Tomorrow,
I'll love you a million times more.

695
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:19,601
Thanks.

696
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,481
Thanks.

697
00:48:33,616 --> 00:48:35,464
Moon Kwon.

698
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,695
Moon Kwon, where are you?

699
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:42,796
Moon Kwon is at work.

700
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:45,726
Oh..

701
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:47,922
Oh.

702
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,945
He got a job.

703
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,397
It's time for him to be at work.

704
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:55,029
Yeah, I know.

705
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:59,028
<i>For long periods, Seo Yeon is
no longer Seo Yeon anymore.</i>

706
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,329
<i>Now, she doesn't read books.</i>

707
00:49:02,487 --> 00:49:04,956
<i>She no longer recites poems.</i>

708
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:07,028
<i>For short periods she's Seo Yeon,</i>

709
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:09,249
<i>but then
she disappears somewhere else again.</i>

710
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:12,621
<i>She slips into her own world,
into her own game.</i>

711
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:15,291
- How did you take this all out?
- Seo Yeon, please.

712
00:49:15,471 --> 00:49:18,000
- Oh my goodness.
- Seo Yeon, please.

713
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,990
<i>Since last week,</i>

714
00:49:20,071 --> 00:49:22,439
<i>I've started going to the office
only once a week on Monday,</i>

715
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:26,065
<i>and have left most of the work
up to Representative Song.</i>

716
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,701
Tada!

717
00:49:30,816 --> 00:49:32,496
Look!

718
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:35,965
Seo Yeon, pretty, right?
The color's awesome, right?

719
00:49:36,008 --> 00:49:40,319
That's right, it suits her
pearl-like skin perfectly.

720
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:43,368
It's from the mall. It's not cheap.

721
00:49:43,538 --> 00:49:45,786
You want to try it on?
I'll put it on you.

722
00:49:46,647 --> 00:49:48,584
Seo Yeon!

723
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:51,390
You're a bad witch.

724
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,126
Seo Yeon.

725
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:57,405
You're bad. You're really, really bad.

726
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,860
I was wrong, Seo Yeon.

727
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,719
I know I was wrong.

728
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:05,137
You're mean.

729
00:50:06,162 --> 00:50:08,492
I was wrong.

730
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:11,415
Forgive me, Seo Yeon.

731
00:50:11,627 --> 00:50:13,926
I was wrong.

732
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:18,075
Seo Yeon.

733
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:22,716
Seo Yeon.

734
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:32,687
Ahjussi, who are you?

735
00:50:37,093 --> 00:50:39,945
I'm Lee Seo Yeon's cousin, Jang Jae Min.

736
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,058
Oppa?

737
00:50:43,497 --> 00:50:45,369
Oppa?

738
00:50:46,704 --> 00:50:48,548
Dad.

739
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,567
Oppa...

740
00:50:53,436 --> 00:50:55,322
I'm home.

741
00:50:56,342 --> 00:50:58,291
You must've gotten off early
from your part-time job.

742
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,550
From the company.

743
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:01,842
I know, company.

744
00:51:03,454 --> 00:51:05,177
Have dinner first.

745
00:51:05,284 --> 00:51:06,720
<i>Yes.</i>

746
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:09,630
<i>Now all men have become ahjussi,</i>

747
00:51:10,176 --> 00:51:12,806
<i>and all women ahjummoni.</i>

748
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,921
<i>The only one she remembers is Moon Kwon.</i>

749
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:20,935
<i>I've become an ahjussi, as well.</i>

750
00:51:21,129 --> 00:51:23,274
<i>And even though
she doesn't really know who I am,</i>

751
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:25,956
<i>she understands that I take care of her,</i>

752
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:28,907
<i>and it's a relief she doesn't reject me.</i>

753
00:51:32,443 --> 00:51:34,154
- One second.
- Alright.

754
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:36,160
- Yes, Aunt.
- Listen!

755
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:38,099
Seo Yeon has disappeared!

756
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:41,435
- Did you go to the market?
- No, at home.

757
00:51:41,495 --> 00:51:44,443
- Was the door open?
- No, no!

758
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,752
She must've fooled us!

759
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:51,645
I think she knew what the code was!

760
00:51:51,872 --> 00:51:56,399
I saw her sleeping and went to clean
but when I came out,

761
00:51:56,496 --> 00:51:58,697
she had disappeared!

762
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,814
Alright, Aunt. I'm going now.

763
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,436
I'm going now.

764
00:52:06,074 --> 00:52:08,350
What were you doing?

765
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:10,836
Seo Yeon!

766
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:13,685
Seo Yeon!

767
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:17,420
Seo Yeon!

768
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,466
Seo Yeon!

769
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:23,269
Seo Yeon!

770
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:54,368
Ahjumma! Ahjumma!

771
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,091
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

772
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:58,134
Stay here! You'll die!

773
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,022
- Do you want to die?
- Let go, let go!

774
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,304
<i>Come to your senses, Ahjumma!</i>

775
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,973
Seo Yeon!

776
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:17,041
What is this?

777
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,066
Take this off, take this off
and give it to Ji Hyung.

778
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,053
Here, put this on. Here.

779
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:24,104
What is this?

780
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,504
Here, here. Put this on.

781
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:37,374
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

782
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:38,633
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

783
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:40,714
- Seo Yeon!
- What's wrong with her?

784
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:42,051
Seo Yeon!

785
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:43,609
Seo Yeon!

786
00:53:58,854 --> 00:54:01,487
You never know when the economy
is going to get better.

787
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:05,657
You've left everything to Seok Ho.
How long are you going to keep this up?

788
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:09,185
I do the minimum of what I must do, Father.

789
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:12,669
The problem is that you only do a minimum.

790
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,302
It's not even enough if you say
you do everything you can.

791
00:54:15,413 --> 00:54:16,800
In this tough economy,

792
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:19,128
you set up a company and
only do the minimum?

793
00:54:19,528 --> 00:54:21,693
Think of how much you are
inconveniencing your partners.

794
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,829
It would be better if you removed
yourself completely.

795
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,733
I actually suggested that,
but Seok Ho wouldn't hear of it.

796
00:54:26,855 --> 00:54:29,397
They'll take care of it themselves.

797
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,256
You should be working hard
at your age. It's a waste.

798
00:54:33,343 --> 00:54:35,098
Drink your tea.

799
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:43,969
From what your mother has said,

800
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,708
it looks like her condition has nearly
reached the last stages.

801
00:54:48,114 --> 00:54:51,324
It's been a while since going
to the bathroom has become a problem.

802
00:54:54,187 --> 00:54:56,291
You should stop suffering now.

803
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,918
It would be better to put her
in the care of professionals.

804
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:03,402
You've done enough.

805
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,778
I can't do that.

806
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:08,175
Your mother agrees with me, as well.

807
00:55:08,242 --> 00:55:10,616
I promised her that I'd protect
her until the end.

808
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:14,248
- Ji Hyung.
- I'll do it. I can't agree to that.

809
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,611
Stop being so stubborn.

810
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:21,081
Don't suffer with a girl who
doesn't know anything.

811
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:24,889
Leave her with professionals, and you can
go about doing your own job.

812
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:26,770
Even if she doesn't know anything,
she's still mine.

813
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:28,526
She's Ye Eun's mother.

814
00:55:28,587 --> 00:55:32,559
I can't leave her in the hands of another.
Please don't bring it up again.

815
00:55:32,922 --> 00:55:36,020
You don't need to think of it so negatively.

816
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:37,674
Professionals will use their knowledge-

817
00:55:37,776 --> 00:55:39,205
Stop.

818
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:41,492
I told you it wasn't going to work.

819
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,030
Ye Eun's up.

820
00:55:49,154 --> 00:55:51,200
Ye Eun came out to see her dad.

821
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,001
Dad's here. You have to go to dad.

822
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:56,532
Let's go down.

823
00:55:56,697 --> 00:56:00,112
Were you well?

824
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:02,567
Are you happy?

825
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:07,366
<i>Look at Dad.</i>

826
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:09,342
<i>Peek-a-boo.</i>

827
00:56:18,236 --> 00:56:21,543
You know, Ji Hyung...

828
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:23,653
Yes?

829
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:28,497
I think it's time... for a diaper...

830
00:56:30,331 --> 00:56:34,190
It won't be long before she soils herself.

831
00:56:35,578 --> 00:56:40,963
Before... it's a relief I realized
what she was doing.

832
00:56:41,229 --> 00:56:44,093
She was crouched there with
her clothes still on,

833
00:56:44,185 --> 00:56:46,054
and was going to take care
of her business there.

834
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:47,845
Alright.

835
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:50,945
I'll talk to her again.

836
00:56:51,037 --> 00:56:53,353
When she's in a good mood.

837
00:56:53,919 --> 00:56:55,525
Yes.

838
00:57:38,641 --> 00:57:40,931
What are you doing?

839
00:57:43,405 --> 00:57:45,318
Seo Yeon, look at me.

840
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:53,520
Let's go to the bathroom together,

841
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:55,985
and put this on.

842
00:57:59,627 --> 00:58:02,010
It's time for you to use this.

843
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:07,080
Aunt will have less of a hard time that way.

844
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:17,824
Seo Yeon...

845
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:20,765
Why should I?
Am I a baby?

846
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:22,453
Why should I?

847
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,697
Who are you?

848
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:25,207
Who the hell do you think you are?

849
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:27,282
Who do you think you are?

850
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:28,780
I'm Lee Seo Yeon!

851
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:31,015
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm Lee Seo Yeon!

852
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,703
Yeah, you're Lee Seo Yeon.

853
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:34,785
Lee Seo Yeon doesn't need such things.

854
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:36,837
- Alright, alright.
- Don't look down on me.

855
00:58:36,953 --> 00:58:38,600
Don't look down on me!

856
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,329
Don't look down on me!

857
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:48,084
Seo Yeon.

858
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:53,562
Don't do it.

859
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:55,428
Don't do it, Seo Yeon.

860
00:59:55,506 --> 00:59:57,150
Don't do it.

861
00:59:57,453 --> 00:59:59,395
It's okay. Don't do it.

862
00:59:59,815 --> 01:00:03,823
You don't have to do it,
Seo Yeon. Don't.

863
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,649
Don't.

864
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:10,280
Don't.

865
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,996
[Lee Seo Yeon]
[I love you. I'm sorry. Thank you. ]

866
01:01:16,282 --> 01:01:18,065
Say hi to your mom.

867
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:20,212
Mom.

868
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:35,936
Ye Eun's here.

869
01:01:40,786 --> 01:01:42,521
I...

870
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,321
I still...

871
01:01:54,038 --> 01:01:56,591
I still haven't, Seo Yeon...

872
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:02,150
I still...

873
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,200
