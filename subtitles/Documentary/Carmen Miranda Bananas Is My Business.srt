1
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:19,241
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,979
<i>Wide World of Sports</i> is in the
little Republic of San Marcos...

3
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:26,683
Where we're going to bring you a
live, on-the-spot assassination.

4
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:30,186
They're going to kill the president of
this lovely Latin American country...

5
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,856
And replace him with a military dictatorship,

6
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:36,092
and everybody is about as
excited and tense as can be.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,761
The weather on this Sunday
afternoon is perfect,

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,763
and if you've just joined us,

9
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,765
we've seen a series of colorful riots...

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,068
That started with the traditional
bombing of the American embassy,

11
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:48,771
a ritual as old as the city itself.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,174
Following that, the leader
of the labor union, Julio Doaz,

13
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:55,311
was dragged from his home
and beaten by an angry mob.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,715
It was one of the most exciting
spectacles I've ever seen.

15
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:01,651
We'll probably have a videotape
replay of that later on.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,021
All around, there are colorful flags and hats.

17
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,825
<i>The moment we've been waiting for is here.
Everyone is getting quiet.</i>

18
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,927
The president is going to leave his office...

19
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,996
And walk down the steps of the palace.

20
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:16,432
For that, we're going down on the playing area.

21
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,568
Take it away, Howard.

22
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,606
This is tremendous, Don. Just tremendous.

23
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:26,242
The atmosphere... heavy, uncertain,

24
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,244
overtones of ugliness.

25
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:30,246
A reminder, in a way, of how it was...

26
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:33,015
In march of 1964 at Miami beach...

27
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:35,084
When Clay met Liston for the first time...

28
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:37,720
And nobody was certain how it would turn out.

29
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,157
The crowd is tense. They've been
here since 10:00 this morning.

30
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:46,128
And... and I think I see the
door beginning to open.

31
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:49,899
<i>El Presidente</i> may be coming out.

32
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,370
<i>The door opens. It's he.</i>

33
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,641
<i>It's</i> El Presidente <i>waving at the crowd.</i>

34
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:06,532
<i>He turns. He runs toward the building.</i>

35
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:19,062
<i>And down.</i>

36
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:28,504
<i>It's over. It's all over for</i> El Presidente.

37
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:31,007
<i>This reporter is going
to get to him if he can...</i>

38
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:34,744
<i>Through this mob for one
last word before he expires.</i>

39
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:37,529
<i>As you can see, this crowd
is not to be trifled with.</i>

40
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,699
<i>They're in a frenzy. They're trying
to get over to</i> El Presidente,

41
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,970
even as I am trying to do now.

42
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,972
Would you people let me through?

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,074
This is American television.

44
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:52,078
American television. Please, let me through.

45
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:54,080
We're getting through now.

46
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:56,082
Here we are. Here we are.

47
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,284
Sir... sir, you've been shot.

48
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:00,519
When did you know it was all over?

49
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:03,722
Fascist... dictators.

50
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,724
Well, of course, you're upset,

51
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:08,361
and that's understandable
under the circumstances.

52
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:11,197
I guess now you'll have to
announce your retirement.

53
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,369
Well, good luck to you, sir. Good luck to you.

54
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,837
And now if you folks will
bear with me for a moment,

55
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,907
I'm going to try and get in a word...

56
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:22,975
With the new dictator of San Marcos.

57
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,977
That's assuming I can get through...

58
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:27,113
This noisy and demonstrative crowd.

59
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,448
I wonder if you people would let me through.

60
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,051
I see the general off in the distance.

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,621
A new dictator talking to one of his men.

62
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:38,157
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

63
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,559
General, general, congratulations.

64
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:44,096
General Emilio Molina Vargas.

65
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:47,066
General, a word from you, if you
will, sir, for our viewers.

66
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,535
For many years, I have waited for this day.

67
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:51,670
But now I am the state.

68
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,808
You may say that, sir, but many
important diplomats contend...

69
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:58,911
That you remain the most
hated man in the state.

70
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,913
I will shut down the newspapers.

71
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:04,317
I will train my soldiers.
We'll find the rebels.

72
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:06,319
The rebels may be in the form...

73
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:08,988
Of Democratic guerilla
factions off in the hills.

74
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,523
No, sir. We'll find them. We'll find them.
Don't worry.

75
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,326
Good luck to you, sir. Thank you, sir.

76
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:17,029
Well, you've heard it with your own eyes.

77
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:20,232
Now we're going to have to
see what the future brings.

78
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,401
But right now, from the little dictatorship...

79
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,937
Of San Marcos in Latin America,

80
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:29,341
let's go back to Jim mclean
in our studios in New York.

81
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,724

♫ Quiero a-ah-ahh ♫♫

97
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,915
Gentlemen, the Execu-ciser.

98
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:18,617
The latest work in progress
at general equipment.

99
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:21,553
<i>It's only in the development
stage at the moment,</i>

100
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:24,323
<i>but it should be practical and
in the market within two years.</i>

101
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,726
<i>It certainly looks impressive.</i>

102
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:30,596
<i>The Execu-ciser is a device to help busy
executives get in their daily exercise...</i>

103
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:33,132
<i>Without ever pausing
in their crowded work schedule.</i>

104
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,135
<i>As you well know, more Americans
suffer heart attacks...</i>

105
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:38,637
From lack of exercise, and you know why?

106
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,639
<i>Well, it's because there aren't
enough hours in the day...</i>

107
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,810
<i>To keep physically fit and still
function effectively in one's business.</i>

108
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,812
<i>This is Mr. Fielding Mellish,</i>

109
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,814
<i>one of company's research testers...</i>

110
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,283
<i>Who will demonstrate the Execu-ciser.</i>

111
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,202
<i>You notice every part of the body receives...</i>

112
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,338
<i>An adequate exercising workout
with this machine.</i>

113
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,439
<i>The pedaling action develop the muscles...</i>

114
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,009
<i>To keep the leg muscles flexible.</i>

115
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:02,828
<i>When the drawer is pulled out, when 
Mr. Mellish pulls the drawer out,</i>

116
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:04,847
<i>you'll see a weight that has to
be lifted on top of the desk...</i>

117
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,983
<i>Which exercises his arms and his back muscles.</i>

118
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,086
<i>Now you'll notice when he reaches for the
telephone, they're both spring-activated.</i>

119
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:12,088
<i>Now, in that spring-activation,</i>

120
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:16,025
<i>both muscles in the biceps are given
adequate workout to sustain flexible arms.</i>

121
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:19,028
<i>And on the back wall, you'll notice
there's a handle for each arm,</i>

122
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:22,899
<i>and as he pulls those handles, the back
muscles are brought into action...</i>

123
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,184
<i>In a manner that keeps the back
flexible and keeps the back strong.</i>

124
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,536
<i>And notice the basketballs coming
from the side of the machine,</i>

125
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,672
<i>and the basketballs, as they're
handled by Mr. Mellish,</i>

126
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,758
<i>develop reflexes.</i>

127
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:38,043
Have you any idea how many
you can put out in a year?

128
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,999
Well, we'd like you to manufacture them.

129
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,169
We can let you have the idea, have our patents.

130
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,171
We can let you have the whole
thing on a royalty basis.

131
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,207
<i>We can show you how to turn it out
and save money on a cost basis.</i>

132
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,942
<i>And you think they'll sell? No question.</i>

133
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,078
<i>If you can get them in the executive's office,</i>

134
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:55,064
<i>you can get them in the armed forces.</i>

135
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:58,634
<i>In time, you'll do business with
the United States government.</i>

136
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:00,803
I'm not suited to this job.

137
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:04,574
Where do I come off testing products?
Machines hate me.

138
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:07,944
I should be working at a job I
have some kind of aptitude for,

139
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:10,746
like donating sperm to an
artificial insemination lab.

140
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:12,949
Every day we've got to hear this.

141
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:16,052
Why did I quit college? I could
have been something today.

142
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,621
What would you have been if you
would have finished school?

143
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,356
I don't know. I was in
the black studies program.

144
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:23,926
By now, I could have been black.

145
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,928
<i>Consistent loser at the table.</i>

146
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:27,930
<i>That's my weakness. I lose a lot.</i>

147
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,932
I don't know what I'm going to do tonight.

148
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,934
Get a date. We'll double. I'll call Barbara.

149
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:34,103
All right, have her bring a friend.

150
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,105
Forget it. What's the matter?

151
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,374
I had a date. She called it off.
There's a dock strike.

152
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:40,376
Why don't you see what Norma's doing?

153
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:42,678
She's always ready for action. Who?

154
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,117
Thursday night. I gotta break the bank.

155
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:06,485
Are you busy tonight?

156
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:10,706
Some old friends are coming over.

157
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:13,409
We're gonna show some pornographic movies.

158
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:17,613
You need an Usher?

159
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,116
Oh, you're cute.

160
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,184
I'm busy.

161
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:27,265
Get a copy of<i> time</i> magazine.

162
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:32,237
I think I'll take<i> commentary,</i>
and the<i> Saturday review.</i>

163
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:36,642
And, uh, let's see, <i>Newsweek.</i>

164
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:41,146
I, uh... just grab one of these.

165
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,551
Take 'em all.

166
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,119
Fifty, $1.00, $1.25.

167
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:51,223
Hey, Ralph, how much is a copy of<i> orgasm?</i>

168
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,325
Just put them in a bag, will you? What?

169
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,661
<i>Orgasm.</i> This man wants to buy a copy.

170
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,663
How much is it?

171
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,865
I'm doing a sociological study on perversion.

172
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:03,268
I'm up to advanced child molesting.

173
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:06,041
Come back. Back. Back.

174
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,510
More. More. More. Back. Back. Back.

175
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:56,908
Hi. I'm collecting names on a petition...

176
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,910
To request the United States government...

177
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,945
To break relations with San Marcos,

178
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:04,115
<i>which is being ruled by a total
military, brutal dictatorship...</i>

179
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,185
Opposed to any concept of civil liberties.

180
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:09,254
- Would you sign?
- Sure.

181
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,292
Ooh, I'm sorry. I broke your point.

182
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,294
Oh, well, that's okay. You want to come in...

183
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:18,930
And I'll give you another pencil? Oh, good.

184
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,932
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

185
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:22,934
I don't know if you've been
following it in the newspapers,

186
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:25,036
but soon there's going to be
a revolution in San Marcos,

187
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,038
and we feel that the United States...

188
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,841
Should give full support to the
rebels and not to the dictatorship,

189
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,394
which, uh, as you know, has been our history.

190
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,531
May I ask, what do you do?

191
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,818
I'm a products tester for a large corporation.

192
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:42,788
I make sure products are safe and practical.

193
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:45,023
Today I tested an exercise machine...

194
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,827
And an electrically-warmed
toilet seat for cold days.

195
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:51,096
Would you like some coffee or something?

196
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:53,599
Or I could open a can of ribs if you want.

197
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,801
Oh, well, I... ribs?

198
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,269
I'd love some coffee, but I
have a lot of work to do.

199
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:01,506
Oh, well, here. It'll take me two
seconds to make some coffee.

200
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:03,575
How can I find out more about your cause?

201
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,677
Because I have a lot of spare time.

202
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,180
Would you like to volunteer for
"the Volunteers for San Marcos"?

203
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,651
Is it possible to discuss that
over dinner tomorrow night?

204
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
It doesn't have to be
tomorrow night, of course.

205
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,821
I mean, I'm wide open for the next six years.

206
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,425
Oh, I have a yoga class tomorrow
night, and I couldn't miss that.

207
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:23,061
Yoga. I love yoga.

208
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,032
Do you really? Yoga is one
of my great passions.

209
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,702
I love eastern philosophy.

210
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:34,673
It's metaphysical. And redundant.
Metaphysical, yes.

211
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:36,675
Abortively pedantic.

212
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:38,677
I know just what you mean.

213
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:40,679
Thank you.

214
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:42,881
Have you ever read the "I Ching"?

215
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,784
Not the actual Ching itself,

216
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,786
but I have dabbled in Kierkegaard.

217
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:49,788
Oh, well, of course, he's Danish.

218
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:53,191
Yes. He'd be the first to admit that.

219
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,361
Yeah. Yeah.

220
00:15:57,964 --> 00:16:00,965
You know, I was just saying to some...
have you ever been to Denmark?

221
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,969
I've been to, yes, to the Vatican.

222
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:07,906
Oh, to the Vatican. The Vatican's in Rome.

223
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:11,376
Well, they were doing so well in
Rome, they opened one in Denmark.

224
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,613
Oh.

225
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,648
I was just saying to someone the other day...

226
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:21,186
That the Scandinavians seem to have such an
instinctive feel for the human condition.

227
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:25,223
That's very wise, you know.
That's, I think, pithy.

228
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:28,827
Oh, well, it was pithy.

229
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:32,063
It had... great pith.

230
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,716
Yeth, pith.

231
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,735
Pith.

232
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:38,737
Well, lithen, I have to...

233
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:42,073
Listen, I have to go now.
I have a lot of work to do.

234
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:45,544
I'd love to have coffee, but I
have a lot of bells to ring...

235
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:48,029
<i>And an early class tomorrow.
</i> It'll just take a second.

236
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:50,031
I know, but I have more bells to ring...

237
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,967
And an early class tomorrow.

238
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:55,104
Oh, really? You're a student?
Yeah, city college.

239
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,455
That's a great school. I ate in
that cafeteria once. Oh, yeah?

240
00:16:57,524 --> 00:17:00,025
Yeah. I got trichinosis. Oh.

241
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:02,010
I'm a philosophy major.

242
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,129
Oh, yeah? That's a wonderful subject.
That's a wonderful thing.

243
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:07,032
What is the meaning of life and death?
Why are we here?

244
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,267
You like Chinese food?

245
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:11,870
Oh, yeah, that sounds... oh, when?

246
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:14,139
Um, the night after tomorrow.

247
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,141
That's... no, I can't.

248
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,744
I knew... I have a meeting of
my women's liberation group.

249
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,746
You don't... you're not one of those...

250
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:23,599
You don't have hostility
to the male sex, do you?

251
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,401
Women's rights do not
automatically mean castration.

252
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,938
Oh, don't say that word.

253
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,708
Oh, now I gotta walk around
like this for two days.

254
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:36,011
Oh, I know. You know, I'm that
way on the word "appendicitis."

255
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,013
I can't take that. But castration.

256
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:40,181
Castration, appendicitis, either one.

257
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,919
No, there's a difference. No, there isn't.

258
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:46,355
What about Saturday?

259
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,357
Listen. Why don't you take my phone number?

260
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,359
Here.

261
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:54,029
And call me on sat... oh.
Call me on Saturday, okay?

262
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,998
It's those two pieces right there, okay?

263
00:17:57,067 --> 00:18:00,536
Bye. I may be bombing an office
building, but I'll find out.

264
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:02,538
Okay. It was nice to meet you.

265
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:04,606
Nice meeting you too.

266
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:12,214
Oh, wait, you forgot to sign my petition.

267
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,885
Sorry.

268
00:18:16,953 --> 00:18:20,538
Ah, Nancy, you may call me Fielding.

269
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,674
I think Mr. Mellish is a little formal.

270
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,678
Oh, the two of us together.

271
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:29,948
Fielding from Latin meaning
strong or with strength.

272
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,584
You'll come to lean on that
strength after a while...

273
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:34,886
And to know that you can rely on me.

274
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:37,222
I've always been a great
champion of the underdog.

275
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,776
I think anyone could tell you that, my pet.

276
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:47,049
See, Nancy, I've... I've always
been devoted to humanity.

277
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:49,484
To a guy like me, the greatest crimes...

278
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:52,921
Are the crimes against human dignity.

279
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,546
How is it, Mellish? Can you
hear the music clearly?

280
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,250
This should be a great seller in California.

281
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:29,024
Mellish, you want to play poker tonight?
We got room.

282
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,026
I can't. I got an appointment.

283
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:33,395
What kind of appointment? I'm
going to picket an embassy.

284
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,064
What? All right, don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

285
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,908
It's... it's a little light.

286
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:05,977
I'll pull the shade.

287
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,222
Do you have any candles?

288
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,224
No. Why?

289
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,826
I just meant the mood's not right right now.

290
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,530
Light.

291
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,767
That's too light.

292
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,213
Is it warm in here?

293
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,281
Warm? Warm.

294
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,391
Oh, where's the bathroom?

295
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
The bathroom? Right there.

296
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:15,713
Leave a little air.

297
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:02,760
I love you. I love you.

298
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:05,263
Oh, say it in French. Oh,
please, say it in French.

299
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:08,533
I don't know French. Oh, please. Please.

300
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:11,236
What about Hebrew? No.

301
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:15,006
I was, uh, I was always
very shy when it came to girls.

302
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:17,943
I-I remember when I was a little boy,

303
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:22,914
I-I once stole a pornographic
book that was printed in braille.

304
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:26,051
I used to rub the dirty parts.

305
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:30,371
And I, uh, I guess I had a good
relationship with my parents.

306
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,609
I... I... they very rarely hit...

307
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:36,478
I think they hit me once,
actually, my whole childhood.

308
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:39,280
They... they, uh, started beating me...

309
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:42,450
On the 23rd of December, 1942,

310
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,122
and stopped beating me
in the late spring of '44.

311
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,674
<i>I don't know. I was a nervous child.</i>

312
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,911
<i>I was a bed wetter when I was younger.</i>

313
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,830
I, uh, I used to sleep
with an electric blanket,

314
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:59,134
and I was constantly electrocuting myself.

315
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:03,955
It's funny. I have this dream that
I've had since I was a child.

316
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:06,591
I had it again one night last week,

317
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,044
<i>where I'm, uh...</i>

318
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:13,115
<i>♫♫</i>

319
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,352
<i>♫♫</i>

320
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:55,974
<i>♫♫</i>

321
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:04,316
<i>♫♫</i>

322
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,287
I-I have to tell you something,

323
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,289
and I don't know how to break it.

324
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,591
Oh, Fielding. Why? Is something the matter?

325
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,860
Am I... have you seen x rays of me?

326
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:19,931
What? I saw x rays of you.

327
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:24,669
I fail to see the humor of this.

328
00:24:24,737 --> 00:24:26,704
Well, you didn't see the x rays.

329
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:28,907
Tell me what's the matter. No. Nothing.

330
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:31,009
Because I'm wired. You know
when your heart beats?

331
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:33,011
I know. I know. And my heart is beating.

332
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,647
I just don't think we should
see each other anymore.

333
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:39,217
Oh, really? Yeah.

334
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:41,319
Why? What's the matter? I'm sorry.

335
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:45,156
There's just something missing
for me, and I don't know what.

336
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:48,359
What do you mean something?
Something missing from me? Yes.

337
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:52,030
What do you mean? Like what?

338
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:54,465
Like... can you say what is missing from me?

339
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,869
No. If you guess a few things, I could try.

340
00:24:57,938 --> 00:25:01,472
What do you mean? Something's missing.
I don't know.

341
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,575
Is it personality or looks
or something like that?

342
00:25:04,644 --> 00:25:06,577
Well, no. I'm not smart enough?

343
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:08,606
No. Is that what you're saying?
Because I'm not...

344
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:11,415
No. You mean that it isn't...
nothing to do with height?

345
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:13,551
No, it has nothing to do with
the fact that you're short,

346
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:16,787
cavities? Nothing to do with the
fact you're not bright enough,

347
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:19,924
and nothing to do with the fact
your teeth are in bad shape.

348
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:22,126
So, what? What could it
poss... I don't understand.

349
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:25,596
Does it got to do... it's
not my personality. No.

350
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:28,099
Do you have fun when you're with me? No.

351
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:30,101
But it's not that.

352
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,403
It's not that I don't have fun with you.

353
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:35,173
I mean, we laugh. We spend
days, you know. Yeah.

354
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,175
Don't tell me that we haven't laughed.

355
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,844
It's not that we haven't laughed.
We've laughed a lot.

356
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,347
Certainly I laugh a lot.
Sometimes you don't, I notice,

357
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,448
I can't put my finger on it.
And I'm left laughing.

358
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:46,450
Something's missing, that's all.

359
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,452
What's missing? Can you be specific?

360
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:50,454
The relationship isn't going anywhere.

361
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:52,490
Where do you want it to go?
Where could we get it to go?

362
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,493
Well, that's not... I don't know. I love you.

363
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:58,029
That's when, if I love you, and you love me...

364
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,899
No, and it's not because I don't love you.

365
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,967
Really? Then you love me? No, I don't.

366
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,603
That's what I mean. But
that's not the reason why.

367
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:08,572
Just something is missing.
I need a very strong man.

368
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:10,574
It's communication, right? Well, I'm strong.

369
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:12,843
I need a leader. I have all
the qualities of leadership.

370
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,780
But don't you understand? I'm interested
in so many vital, political things.

371
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:17,782
Me too. That bonds us together.

372
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,784
I want to go and work with pygmies in Africa,

373
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:22,353
and I want to work with
lepers in a leper colony.

374
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:24,588
I'm willing... no, it's perfectly okay.

375
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:26,574
I believe... I love leprosy.

376
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:28,576
If that's what you're asking
me, I'm perfectly willing to...

377
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:30,578
I like leprosy. I like cholera.

378
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:33,581
I like all the major skin diseases, so don't...

379
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,583
You're immature, Fielding.

380
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:38,519
How am I immature? Emotionally,
sexually, and intellectually.

381
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:40,521
Yeah, but what other ways.

382
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,524
Well, then maybe it's my fault.

383
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:44,526
Maybe I just can't give.

384
00:26:44,594 --> 00:26:46,561
Then why don't you receive, and I'll give?

385
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:50,381
I'm not ready to receive.
You give, I'll receive.

386
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,717
Well, I can't receive. I'm a
person who can only receive...

387
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:56,254
<i>If another is giving.</i> Well, I can't give.
I'm sorry.

388
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,456
But if we each receive, it might work.

389
00:26:58,524 --> 00:27:01,526
I can't receive. My trouble is
I'm receiving and receiving,

390
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,548
and I'm only not able to give or to receive.

391
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,513
But I would like to give,
if only you could receive.

392
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,848
I can't receive. I don't
know how I can help you.

393
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,435
See, if we both receive or both give...

394
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,870
I told you, I can't receive and I can't give.

395
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,940
It's not going to work out.
It's no use, Fielding.

396
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,576
I'm sorry. Good-bye.

397
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:20,778
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

398
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:24,548
Don't worry about me, sweetheart.

399
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:28,519
I'm like a cat. I'll always wind up on my feet.

400
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:35,593
Can you believe that? She says
I'm not leader enough for her.

401
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:37,595
Who is she looking for? Hitler?

402
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:39,597
Women are very temperamental.

403
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:43,434
We went everyplace together. We did everything.
We fell in love.

404
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,436
I fell in love. She just stood there.

405
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:47,438
Did you have trouble with her in bed?

406
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:52,710
Are you kiddin'? Do I look like the kind
of guy that would have trouble in bed?

407
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,712
I didn't. I didn't.

408
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:56,714
Is that any reason to quit the job?

409
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:58,716
I'm so depressed.

410
00:27:58,785 --> 00:28:00,885
I'd kill myself if I thought
that she would marry me.

411
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:02,887
Well, what are you gonna do?

412
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:06,257
I gotta get out of here. I'm
going down to San Marcos.

413
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:08,526
We were going to go down
there together on a trip.

414
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:10,528
We were going to write a paper on it.

415
00:28:10,597 --> 00:28:12,763
She was going to write it.
I was going to type it.

416
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:14,965
I got to see what conditions
down there are like.

417
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:18,203
Oh, Jesus, life is so cruel.

418
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,538
See what I mean?

419
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,542
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

420
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:26,544
Fielding. Sponge.

421
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,546
I don't mean to disturb you,

422
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:31,182
but I wanted to tell you that tomorrow
I'm going out of the country,

423
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,184
and I thought I would stop by. What?

424
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:35,319
Now, now. Why are you going out of the country?

425
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:37,321
Leave him alone. It's a very long story.

426
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,323
Give me a sponge. It's got to do with a girl.

427
00:28:39,392 --> 00:28:41,325
A girl? What? What are you going to do?

428
00:28:41,394 --> 00:28:43,327
I have to get away. I'm going to South America.

429
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,329
A little country called San Marcos.

430
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:47,331
I never heard of it, dear. It's a tiny country.

431
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,333
Forceps. And, uh...

432
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:51,603
Forceps, Ruth. Nice people there?

433
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:55,206
Nice? Well, it's a turbulent situation,

434
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:57,208
and I've been following it for a while.

435
00:28:57,276 --> 00:28:59,310
You've been following it. You
should have stood in school.

436
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:01,312
You should have followed studying.
Don't get mad, Martin.

437
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,314
I have a son living in South America also.

438
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,316
Would you stay out of this, please? I'm sorry.

439
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:07,685
Ruth, don't talk to him about going away.

440
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:10,354
Talk to him about going to
college to become a doctor.

441
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:12,356
Don't get mad. Who am I going
to leave this hospital to?

442
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,592
Will you cool it, Martin?
Don't get on his back.

443
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:16,661
Let him alone. I've been
very politically involved.

444
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:19,030
You should let him have his own way.

445
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:23,001
Ruth, we've been married 27 years.

446
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:27,471
My name isn't Martin. It's Al.
Al Mellish, remember?

447
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,508
I wanted my son to be a great surgeon.

448
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:32,644
<i>I have no aptitude.</i> Yes, you do, son.

449
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:35,346
He has no aptitude. Listen to me, son.
You can do this.

450
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:38,650
You can be a fine surgeon. Look.
Take over. Give me a clamp.

451
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:40,838
No, Fielding can't... clamp.
Quickly, give me a clamp.

452
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:43,154
Right, give me that. Here, take this, son.

453
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:46,223
I can't. Finish this operation for me.

454
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:49,127
I can't cut. It's ridiculous.

455
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:51,195
Why are you forcing Fielding? The name is Al.

456
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:53,197
This is so ridiculous. Go ahead. Right there.

457
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:55,232
He might lose the patient. You know Fielding.

458
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:57,468
Ask for a sponge. Sponge. Jesus.

459
00:29:57,537 --> 00:30:00,805
I'll finish this one. That's better.

460
00:30:00,874 --> 00:30:03,407
I didn't even wash. Push it in there.
Right there.

461
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:05,409
I've got it in there. Oh, honestly.

462
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:07,411
Now take a clamp and take it out.

463
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,413
Should that be blue like that? Here's a clamp.

464
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:11,849
Where? Right there. Fielding, go.

465
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:13,851
Wait one second. You're doing well.

466
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,321
God bless you. I'm doing the best I can.

467
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,757
Nurse! Put your finger right there.

468
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:21,759
Fielding, get out of here!

469
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:23,761
He's really giving me a feeling of confidence.

470
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,930
Fielding, go! I'm going to
South America tomorrow.

471
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:28,365
God bless you.

472
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:31,235
Go. Gesundheit.
You're really going?

473
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:33,237
You're losing the patient while we're talking.

474
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,239
Martin! Nurse!

475
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,241
Don't worry about it. Please do.

476
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,712
Do you think you could get me
out of here by 7:00 tonight?

477
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,780
I'm going to the theater.

478
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:02,016
And now as is our annual custom,

479
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:06,721
each citizen of San Marcos will come up here...

480
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:09,557
And present his excellency...

481
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:12,560
With his weight in horse manure.

482
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:15,530
Horse manure? I thought they were diamonds.

483
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,532
We are an agrarian country.

484
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:20,801
Yes, but horse... it will
fertilize your personal crops.

485
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,339
Sometimes food is more valuable than gold.

Has he given us any information

You're a liar. That's only two months away.

510
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:11,279
No, no, Esposito is timing it to coincide...

511
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,948
With the American fourth of July...

512

So as to imitate his hero George Washington.

Where does he get enough weaponry?

00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,692
Esposito has a way of getting
weapons, but I do not know the plan.

I was trying to find someplace for practice.

00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:49,543
Ah, senor Fielding.

528

This is Colonel Diaz and Lieutenant Arroyo.

Senor Fielding, may I say what
a great pleasure it is...

00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:01,505
To entertain an American intellectual,

531
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:06,343
somebody with whom I can exchange
contemporary political ideas and opinions.

00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:08,479
I brought you some cake. Thank you very much.

00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:14,785
These are prunes. I like cherry.

534
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:17,989
Oh, they don't make cherry on Tuesday.

535
00:35:18,057 --> 00:35:21,525
Senor Fielding, dinner is served.
Would you please?

536
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,038
Maybe some poison in my food,

537
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,973
but I am okay.

538
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:56,644
I have been poisoned so many times,
I have developed an immunity.

539
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:30,294
You are not tense, are you?

540
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,180
Tense? No.

541
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:46,944
Dinner was delicious. Thank you, sir.

542
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:50,214
The check, sir. Thank you.

Who had the roast beef? <i>I had it.</i>

544
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:55,252
It's $12.60. Who had the
corned beef and cabbage here?

545
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:57,254
<i>That was mine.</i>

546
00:36:57,323 --> 00:36:59,256
I don't understand something.

547
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:01,491
There's two roast beefs on here.

548
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,828
What did you have? Chili Con Carne.

549
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:05,830
Chili Con Carne? Well, there's two roast beefs.

550
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:07,832
There's an extra roast beef.
I had only one roast beef.

551
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,167
Well, here. There's one chili,
there's two roast beefs.

552
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,536
Who had the chili? <i>I had the chili.</i>

<i>You on diners club?</i>

All right. Here.

Let's go to the salon for a Brandy.

00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:38,746
<i>And so I want to do only
what is right for my people.</i>

560
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:43,050
That is to... to protect them from communism.

561
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,486
I am sure you understand that.

562
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,555
Yes, but Esposito and his
rebels are not communists.

563
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,475
- They are communists!
- I think I know a little bit about politics.

564
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,381
Don't get up. Excuse me.

565
00:37:59,218 --> 00:38:01,451
If I'm to give a better life to my people,

566
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,406
I have to exterminate a few troublemakers.

567
00:38:05,474 --> 00:38:09,026
That's the price we pay.

568
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:12,747
Well, look, I got to be going.
It's late for me.

574
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,541
He's perfect.

575
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,677
I could kill him now!

576
00:38:42,745 --> 00:38:44,679
He brings cake for a group of people.

577
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:46,681
He doesn't even bring an assortment.

578
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:49,083
You cannot forget that?

579
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:53,504
No, no. We'll kill him
as planned, dressed as rebels.

580
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:55,606
Then, an outraged United States...

581
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:59,810
Will see how bloodthirsty beasts
Esposito and his men are,

582
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:02,713
and we'll get all the support we need.

583
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:05,048
When can our men get the rebel uniforms?

584
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:07,050
I spoke with the tailor.

585
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,187
He's going on vacation, and then he
needs three days for the alterations.

586
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:12,055
We'll get another tailor.

587
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,041
But he does such nice work.

588
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,043
Take a look at this jacket. It's much too big.

589
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:19,046
He took it in for me, and he
doesn't even charge much.

590
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:21,515
No, no, no. We get another tailor.

591
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:24,518
I want it to look like the rebels killed him...

592
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:27,354
Not later than tomorrow afternoon.

593
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:33,393
- Here he comes.
- I don't feel good in these clothes.

594
00:39:33,462 --> 00:39:36,329
Nor do I. He made cuffs in my pants.

595
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:38,331
What kind of tailoring is this?

596
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,835
He's not our regular man. Do the best you can.

597
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,181
So long, suckers.

598
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:34,555
<i>Hey, wake up. Esposito wants to see you.</i>

599
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:37,157
<i>Are you all right? Hey, wake up.</i>

600
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,159
Hey, you, wake up.

601
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,695
Senor Fielding. Esposito wants to see you.

602
00:40:41,764 --> 00:40:43,997
Where am I?

603
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,200
Please, no more Polish women.

604
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:49,302
<i>We are in the rebel camp with Esposito.</i>

605
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:52,106
Blood. That should be on the inside.

606
00:40:52,174 --> 00:40:54,374
<i>Esposito wants to see you. Come on.</i>

607
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,443
Esposito tried to kill me.

608
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:58,445
<i>No, it was Vargas that tried to kill you,</i>

609
00:40:58,513 --> 00:41:01,248
but in the uniform of our peoples.

610
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:04,135
So your government would
blame Esposito. Come on.

611
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:35,232
I'm Fielding Mellish.

612
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:39,436
Vargas has told everyone that you
are dead, that we killed you.

613
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:41,605
It is in all the newspapers.

614
00:41:41,674 --> 00:41:45,442
I'm very much alive, and I mean
to lodge a formal complaint.

615
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:49,079
- A complaint?
- You cannot bash in the head of an American citizen...

616
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:51,381
Without written permission
from the state department.

617
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,951
Vargas cares very little for
diplomatic procedures, my friend.

618
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,153
Yeah, well, we'll straighten him out.

619
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,923
I'm afraid you cannot leave here. - What?

620
00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:03,560
He uses you to make a big
propaganda against us.

621
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:08,098
The one thing he doesn't want is for you
to show up and tell the world the truth.

622
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,618
<i>What do you think will happen
if you show your face...</i>

623
00:42:10,686 --> 00:42:12,886
Anyplace but here, hmm?

624
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:16,624
He will cut your throat and bury you.

625
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:18,642
Cut my throat?

626
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:20,777
You realize what that will do to my gargling?

627
00:42:20,846 --> 00:42:23,313
It is war, my friend.

628
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:25,349
Yeah, but I'm an American citizen.

629
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,351
Sure. A dead one.

630
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,552
Just how long will it be before
I can go back to New York?

631
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:32,539
After we win the revolution, we are free.

632
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:34,925
And when is the revolution? - Six months.

633
00:42:34,994 --> 00:42:38,045
Six months? I got a rented car.

634
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:40,080
You have a chance to die for freedom.

635
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,751
Freedom is wonderful. On the
other hand, if you're dead,

636
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:46,720
it's a tremendous drawback to your sex life.

637
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,739
Are you such a sniveling dog?

638
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:52,276
Depends what you mean by "such."
I'm a good-sized sniveling dog.

639
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:56,579
History sometimes chooses strange ways.

640
00:42:56,648 --> 00:42:58,982
Today you are fearful.

641
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:02,485
Perhaps one day you will be a tiger.

642
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:06,089
Don't hold your breath. If you
ever need a squirrel, call me.

643
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:10,860
All right, men. Let us sing
the song of the rebels.

644
00:43:12,097 --> 00:43:15,399
♫ Rebels are we born to be free ♫

645
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,601
♫ just like the fish in the sea ♫♫

646
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,734
I'll have the grapefruit
sections, two poached eggs,

647
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:38,038
cinnamon toast, regular coffee.

648
00:43:43,112 --> 00:43:45,112
Perfect.

649
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,685
What the hell is this stuff anyhow?

650
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:53,687
Lizard.

651
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,586
<i>Uno. Dos. Uno. Dos.</i>

652
00:44:43,655 --> 00:44:46,056
<i>Uno. Dos. Uno. Dos.</i>

653
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:10,997
<i>Camouflage
can often save your life.</i>

654
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:13,900
<i>It's essential that you learn the art.</i>

655
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,994
In the event of snakebite,
you make an incision,

656
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,280
and you suck out the poison.

657
00:45:43,348 --> 00:45:47,517
Remember, you suck out the poison.
What do you do?

658
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:49,786
Suck out the poison.

659
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,905
Suck out the poison.

660
00:45:51,974 --> 00:45:54,591
Suck out the poison.

661
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:59,596
I will not... I cannot suck anybody's
leg who I'm not engaged to.

662
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:19,116
Snakebite. I got bitten by a snake.

663
00:46:19,184 --> 00:46:23,019
I got bitten by a snake. Help! Snakebite!

664
00:46:23,088 --> 00:46:25,088
Help! Help!

665
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:35,815
Our food has run out. We must
make a raid on the town.

666
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:38,318
It will be very risky. You must not go.

667
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,004
<i>It is too dangerous. I do not mind the risk.</i>

668
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:44,173
Another will lead the raid.
Not our future president.

669
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:46,810
What about sending Fielding? Me?

670
00:46:46,879 --> 00:46:48,812
The men have a growing respect for you.

671
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:50,814
It is a chance to prove yourself.

672
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:52,749
Oh, look, I don't want to prove anything.

673
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:57,070
You will fight a hero! And, if
necessary, you will die a hero.

674
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:00,890
You better get some rest. You're
beginning to talk gibberish.

675
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,243
The short straw will go.

676
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:13,353
Well, as long as it was fair.

677
00:47:37,462 --> 00:47:39,395
Yes?

678
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:41,464
Uh, coffee, please.

679
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,337
I also want something to go. Yes.

680
00:47:48,406 --> 00:47:50,807
Do you have any grilled cheese sandwiches?

681
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:54,678
Yes, sir. Let me have a thousand.

682
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:58,915
And, um, 300 tuna fish...

683
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,401
<i>And 200 bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches.</i>

684
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,937
You want grilled cheese on rye?

685
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,939
Uh, 490 on rye.

686
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,075
Let me have 110 on whole wheat...

687
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:10,643
And 300 on white bread.

688
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,230
Fernandez wanted on roll.

689
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:15,398
And one on roll.

690
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:17,400
And the tuna?

691
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:19,386
All the tuna on whole wheat.

692
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,122
And all the bacon, lettuce, and
tomato, let me have on toast.

693
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,307
All right.

694
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:26,943
And, uh, what to drink?

695
00:48:27,246 --> 00:48:31,398
Uh, let me have 700 regular coffees,

696
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:33,400
uh, 500 cokes,

697
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:36,503
and a thousand 7-ups. And also...

698
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:38,354
Cole slaw for 900 men.

699
00:48:38,657 --> 00:48:40,340
Right.

700
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:42,676
You want anything with these sandwiches?

701
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:46,380
Uh, mayonnaise. On the side.

702
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:49,465
Right.

703
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:03,179
Everything is ready, sir.

704
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:05,181
Uh, which one is the roll?

705
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,183
I have it right here.

706
00:49:07,252 --> 00:49:09,185
Okay. What about the Cole slaw?

707
00:49:09,254 --> 00:49:11,354
It's coming, sir.

708
00:49:11,422 --> 00:49:13,422
<i>Adelante.</i>

709
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,560
Cole slaw, sir.

710
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:26,836
That will be 24,000 pesos, sir.

711
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:28,838
Get your money from Vargas. We're the rebels.

712
00:49:28,907 --> 00:49:31,474
Let's go. Move this out. Come on!

713
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:39,135
<i>♫</i>

714
00:52:36,978 --> 00:52:40,512
While we carry out the diversionary raid,

715
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:44,851
you three will kidnap the British ambassador.

716
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:47,019
He will be held until Vargas agrees...

717
00:52:47,088 --> 00:52:49,655
To free the sympathizers he has jailed.

718
00:52:49,724 --> 00:52:51,690
<i>I will drive.</i>

719
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,812
<i>You two will seize him, and you will
inject him with the sodium pentothal.</i>

720
00:52:56,881 --> 00:53:01,567
<i>Now, once he's asleep,
there will be no trouble.</i>

721
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:13,415
Should they attack, our men are ready.

722
00:55:14,418 --> 00:55:18,020
Mm. They are too weak to defeat me.

723
00:55:18,088 --> 00:55:21,290
We have nothing to worry about them.

724
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,627
We shall continue our policy of harassment.

725
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:29,598
Of course, if they are foolish
enough to try to overthrow,

726
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:33,502
then I have made a deal for reinforcements...

727
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:36,472
With the U.J.A.

728
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,107
You mean the C.I.A., excellency.

729
00:55:39,177 --> 00:55:42,178
The U.J.A. Is the United Jewish Appeal.

730
00:55:42,246 --> 00:55:46,148
The United Jewish Appeal?

731
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,217
Uh-oh.

732
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:06,869
<i>Any word on where we're headed for?</i>

733
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:08,871
<i>I hear it's San Marcos.</i>

734
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,873
<i>Are we fighting for or against the government?</i>

735
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:12,875
<i>The C.I.A.'s not taking any chances this time.</i>

736
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:16,745
<i>Some of us are for, and some us
are going to be against it. Oh.</i>

737
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,034
Hello. Hello, Miami?

738
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:41,270
Fountainbleu hotel?

739
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:44,072
Listen. I want to make a
reservation for one single room.

740
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:46,242
Yes.

741
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:55,868
What are they... what are your prices?

742
00:56:55,936 --> 00:56:58,504
For a single room?

743
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,801
I can't believe that I'm finally going home.

744
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,803
Well, you have earned it.

745
00:57:30,872 --> 00:57:33,272
Yeah. Well, I'm going to
miss everybody here. Aha!

746
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,142
Well, my friends, we have done it.

747
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,111
You have. And you. All of us.

748
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,313
At last, this country can finally bask...

749
00:57:41,382 --> 00:57:43,849
In the sunshine of a true democracy.

750
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,885
A land where no man is better than the next,

751
00:57:45,953 --> 00:57:49,738
and there's equal opportunity for
all, respect for law and order.

752
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:51,707
Right now, I am the law.

753
00:57:51,776 --> 00:57:54,810
Yes, but soon, we'll hold free elections...

754
00:57:54,878 --> 00:57:57,346
<i>And let the people choose their own leaders.</i>

755
00:57:57,415 --> 00:58:01,616
And you can voluntarily step down
and return to your simple farming.

756
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:03,953
What's the matter?
You look glassy-eyed.

757
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:06,105
Those people are peasants.

758
00:58:06,174 --> 00:58:08,674
They are too ignorant to vote.

759
00:58:08,743 --> 00:58:12,728
- But they have common sense.
- I am the ruler of this country.

760
00:58:12,797 --> 00:58:15,297
There will be no elections until I decree it.

761
00:58:23,841 --> 00:58:26,681
You are accused of killing over a
thousand people in your term of office,

762
00:58:26,694 --> 00:58:29,979
of torturing hundreds of women and children.

763
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:34,133
- How did you plead?
- Guilty. With an explanation.

764
00:58:35,436 --> 00:58:37,886
<i>Ready...</i>

765
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:40,822
<i>Aim... fire.</i>

766
00:58:41,825 --> 00:58:45,294
Uh, okay, 21. Who has 21?

767
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,905
<i>Ready... aim... fire.</i>

768
00:59:19,613 --> 00:59:21,914
Hear me.

769
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,717
I am your new president.

770
00:59:25,787 --> 00:59:28,453
From this day on,

771
00:59:28,522 --> 00:59:30,890
the official language of San Marcos...

772
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,992
Will be Swedish.

773
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:35,010
Silence!

774
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:38,147
In addition to that,

775
00:59:38,215 --> 00:59:40,882
all citizens will be required...

776
00:59:40,951 --> 00:59:43,618
To change their underwear...

777
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:46,621
Every half hour.

778
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,823
Underwear...

779
00:59:48,892 --> 00:59:51,760
Will be worn on the outside...

780
00:59:51,828 --> 00:59:53,762
So we can check.

781
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,797
Furthermore,

782
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:00,752
all children under 16 years old...

783
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:05,273
Are now 16 years old.

784
01:00:05,443 --> 01:00:08,928
What's the Spanish word for straitjacket?

785
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:11,530
Power has driven him mad.

786
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:14,700
We must have a new leader.

787
01:00:14,768 --> 01:00:18,637
Another must represent
the revolution immediately.

788
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:20,639
Like who?

789
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:24,176
There must be someone willing
to put his life in peril,

790
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,713
and, uh, willing to carry on...

791
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:30,666
<i>Against all the terrible hazards that await us.</i>

792
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:32,668
I know you're gonna find the guy.

793
01:00:32,736 --> 01:00:37,105
Now, if you'll excuse me, I was due at my
mother's house for dinner eight months ago.

794
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,074
I'm going home.

795
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:41,076
No! The revolution will fail without you.

796
01:00:41,145 --> 01:00:43,078
Why me? Because the men respect you.

797
01:00:43,147 --> 01:00:45,080
You always loved our cause.

798
01:00:45,149 --> 01:00:47,950
Besides, compared to these
men, you are educated.

799
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,152
What is this with my education?

800
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,087
I had two days of college.

801
01:00:52,156 --> 01:00:55,290
I need 3 years and 363 days to get a degree.

802
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:58,460
This is a country of peasants.
At least you can read.

803
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,462
Fellas, I don't want to be president.

804
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,464
You're making a big mistake.

805
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,466
You got to be smart to be a president.

806
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,669
Look, let me be vice president.

807
01:01:06,737 --> 01:01:08,671
<i>That's... that's a real idiot's job.</i>

808
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:10,806
You're lookin' at me in a strange way, fellas.

809
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,475
Look, I...

810
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,045
I'm going to be president, right?

811
01:01:32,413 --> 01:01:35,133
The Americans won't recognize us
because they think we're communists.

812
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,082
The communists won't recognize us...

813
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,084
Because they think we're American puppets.

814
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,086
The one person in the world
who recognizes us...

815
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,355
Was arrested yesterday on a morals charge.

816
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:46,892
We need money. What is the
chief export of San Marcos?

817
01:01:46,961 --> 01:01:50,362
- Dysentery.
- We grow bananas.

818
01:01:50,431 --> 01:01:53,332
Bananas. Bananas.

819
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,334
If I can only think of a way...

820
01:01:55,402 --> 01:01:57,503
To convince the United States to give us money.

821
01:01:58,539 --> 01:02:00,473
Get me Sanchez.

822
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:04,910
<i>I don't know, my friend, but without
it, the revolution will fail.</i>

823
01:02:04,979 --> 01:02:07,112
Thousands will have died in vain,

824
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:10,483
and soon a new dictator will seize power.

825
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:14,520
Hello. It's me.

826
01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:17,556
Oh, yes. I'm perturbed over
the economic situation.

827
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:19,558
You must go to the United States.

828
01:02:19,627 --> 01:02:22,327
You must convince them. They
will listen to you. Me?

829
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:24,329
You're the president of San Marcos.

830
01:02:24,398 --> 01:02:27,132
Yes, here I'm president, but over
there I'm a college dropout.

831
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,134
But they don't know.

832
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,269
After all, senor Fielding Mellish is dead.

833
01:02:31,338 --> 01:02:34,039
I can't hear you. I think
we have a bad connection.

834
01:02:34,108 --> 01:02:36,876
I know. I will call you back.

835
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:44,249
I think I could go to the
United States and fake it.

836
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:46,919
I know you can do it, Fielding.

837
01:02:46,988 --> 01:02:49,154
I'll bet that I could.

838
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,333
♫ Quiero La noche Quiero ♫

839
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:04,169
♫ Quiero La noche de Amor ♫

840
01:03:07,324 --> 01:03:11,226
I am Mr. Hernandez, the official interpreter.

841
01:03:11,294 --> 01:03:13,228
Welcome to the United States.

842
01:03:13,296 --> 01:03:15,230
Welcome to United States.

843
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:17,332
Thank you. Thank you.

844
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,334
Did you have a good flight?

845
01:03:19,402 --> 01:03:21,336
Did you have a good flight? Yes, I did.

846
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:23,338
Yes, I did.

847
01:03:23,406 --> 01:03:26,074
Well, we hope your stay in our country...

848
01:03:26,143 --> 01:03:28,110
We hope your stay in our country...

849
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:30,946
Will be delightful. Will be delightful.

850
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,948
I am looking forward to it...

851
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,950
I am looking forward to it...

852
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,952
With great anticipation.

853
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,755
With great anticipation.

854
01:03:39,823 --> 01:03:41,857
♫ Dame Tu mundo dame ♫

855
01:03:41,925 --> 01:03:46,361
♫ dame Tu mundo para mi ♫♫

856
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:02,210
Get all these people out of here.

857
01:04:02,279 --> 01:04:04,212
What's the matter? Get them out of here.

858
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:07,516
I'm Bill Simmons. Tom Sloan, F.B.I.
Mr. President.

859
01:04:07,584 --> 01:04:09,584
We're here to see your safety's ensured.

860
01:04:09,653 --> 01:04:13,121
We'll act as your shield in the
event of trouble. Look out!

861
01:04:14,925 --> 01:04:18,477
We missed him. We get most of them.

862
01:04:24,118 --> 01:04:27,286
What am I appearing
at a fund-raising dinner for?

863
01:04:27,354 --> 01:04:29,621
I don't know the first thing
about public speaking.

864
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:33,492
All you have to do is open up
with a joke, a funny story.

865
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:36,962
Once you have them laughing, then you
hit them for money. It's very simple.

866
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,632
Very simple. Open with a funny
story, and then hit them for money.

867
01:04:41,102 --> 01:04:43,551
I'm... I'm reminded tonight of the...

868
01:04:43,721 --> 01:04:48,523
Of the farmer who had incestuous relations...

869
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:52,594
With both his daughters simultaneously.

870
01:04:55,099 --> 01:05:00,001
<i>It's, it's the wrong crowd for this joke.</i>

871
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,403
Um.

872
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:05,657
<i>Although the United States is, uh,</i>

873
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:07,675
a very rich country,

874
01:05:07,745 --> 01:05:10,378
and San Marcos is a very poor one,

875
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:13,749
There are
a great many things...

876
01:05:13,817 --> 01:05:15,751
We have to offer your
country in return for aid.

877
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:20,455
<i>For instance, there... there are locusts.</i>

878
01:05:20,523 --> 01:05:23,291
We have more locusts.

879
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,162
There are locusts of all races and creeds.

880
01:05:27,231 --> 01:05:29,330
These, these locusts, incidentally,

881
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:32,968
are available at popular prices.

882
01:05:33,036 --> 01:05:37,139
And so, by the way, are most
of the women of San Marcos.

883
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:39,641
<i>Now, then,</i>

884
01:05:39,709 --> 01:05:42,878
<i>despite the tiny size of our nation,</i>

885
01:05:42,946 --> 01:05:46,614
few people realize that we
lead the world in hernias.

886
01:05:46,683 --> 01:05:50,218
They also fail to realize that before
Columbus discovered your country,

887
01:05:50,287 --> 01:05:52,487
he, he stopped in San Marcos...

888
01:05:52,555 --> 01:05:56,158
And contracted a disease
which can today be cured...

889
01:05:56,226 --> 01:05:58,326
With one shot of penicillin.

890
01:05:58,395 --> 01:06:00,261
It's the same person, all right.

891
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:03,231
This whole thing smacks of
conspiracy, if you ask me.

892
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,835
Do you realize what a communist missile
base in San Marcos would do to us?

893
01:06:06,904 --> 01:06:09,370
Plus, he has a history of subversive acts,

894
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,006
demonstrations, and peace marches.

895
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:14,003
This man is attempting the overthrow...

896
01:06:14,061 --> 01:06:16,394
Of the United States government
from without and within.

897
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,413
All right.

898
01:06:18,482 --> 01:06:21,716
Let's pick him up, and throw the book at him.

899
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:27,923
We'll make an example of this... hepcat.

900
01:06:33,597 --> 01:06:38,032
<i>Hi. I hope I'm not being pushy, but I
just have always wanted to meet you.</i>

901
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:40,469
I-I don't mean to bother you,

902
01:06:40,537 --> 01:06:43,855
but I think that you're, uh, terrific.

903
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:46,625
Really terrific, and, um,

904
01:06:46,694 --> 01:06:48,694
me and my friends have
backed you from the beginning...

905
01:06:48,762 --> 01:06:51,330
Uh, of this career of yours.

906
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:54,165
And I... we... I'm awestruck.

907
01:06:54,235 --> 01:06:56,735
I really don't know what to say.

908
01:06:56,803 --> 01:07:00,205
You know, it's very funny, but
you remind me of somebody...

909
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:02,841
That I once knew.

910
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:06,227
A boy. He... it was really...

911
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:08,229
No, it was really nothing like you.

912
01:07:08,532 --> 01:07:12,451
I mean, you're terrific. He was
just this little, stupid clown.

913
01:07:12,786 --> 01:07:16,004
You know, just... I don't know
why I even mentioned it.

914
01:07:16,072 --> 01:07:20,008
He was, uh... he was, um...

915
01:07:20,076 --> 01:07:24,412
He was an idiot, you know.
A real idiot and, uh...

916
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:27,015
Would you... would you mind if I kissed you?

917
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,818
Uh, once?

918
01:07:29,887 --> 01:07:33,855
Could I kiss you once?

919
01:07:36,593 --> 01:07:38,777
<i>Oh, that was wonderful.</i>

920
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,880
<i>It was practically a religious experience.</i>

921
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:43,881
<i>I have a confession to make.</i>

922
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:46,969
<i>What, love?</i>

923
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:50,005
I'm Fielding Mellish.

924
01:07:50,074 --> 01:07:52,640
Oh, my God.

925
01:07:52,709 --> 01:07:56,378
I knew something was missing.

926
01:07:56,446 --> 01:07:58,663
Good evening. I'm Roger Grimsby
with the news at 6:00.

927
01:07:58,732 --> 01:08:00,665
Today's top stories:

928
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:03,234
The United States government brings
charges against Fielding Mellish...

929
01:08:03,303 --> 01:08:05,336
As a subversive impostor,

930
01:08:05,405 --> 01:08:08,640
New York garbagemen are striking
for a better class of garbage,

931
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:12,043
and the national rifle association
declares death a good thing.

932
01:08:12,112 --> 01:08:15,113
Details on these and other stories in a moment.

933
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,226
<i>Fielding Mellish,
the president of San Marcos,</i>

934
01:08:28,295 --> 01:08:30,929
<i>goes on trial tomorrow for
fraud, inciting to riot,</i>

935
01:08:30,997 --> 01:08:33,064
<i>conspiracy to overthrow the government,</i>

936
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:36,335
<i>and using the word "thighs" in mixed company.</i>

937
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,553
Please rise. Court is now in session.

938
01:08:38,622 --> 01:08:40,722
<i>Judge Seymour Watson presiding.</i>

939
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:44,292
<i>The people versus Fielding Mellish.</i>

940
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:46,945
I object, your honor. This trial is a travesty.

941
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:49,147
It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham...

942
01:08:49,216 --> 01:08:52,083
Of a mockery of a travesty
of two mockeries of a sham.

943
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:54,085
I move for a mistrial.

944
01:08:54,154 --> 01:08:56,087
Do you realize there's not a
single homosexual on that jury?

945
01:08:56,156 --> 01:08:58,390
<i>Yes, there is.</i> Really? Which one?

946
01:08:58,459 --> 01:09:00,625
Is it the big guy at the end?

947
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:02,794
Call the first witness.

948
01:09:02,863 --> 01:09:05,029
And you remember Fielding Mellish.

949
01:09:05,098 --> 01:09:07,031
He's got a record.

950
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,268
He was always being picked up at
one demonstration or another.

951
01:09:10,337 --> 01:09:12,337
He's a bad apple. A commie.

952
01:09:12,406 --> 01:09:15,974
A New York Jewish intellectual,
communist crackpot.

953
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:19,277
I mean, I don't want to cast no aspersions.

954
01:09:20,347 --> 01:09:22,280
Your witness.

955
01:09:22,349 --> 01:09:25,817
Officer Dowd, have you ever
had sexual relations...

956
01:09:25,886 --> 01:09:28,487
With a girl with really big breasts?

957
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:30,489
Yes, sir. I did.

958
01:09:30,557 --> 01:09:32,491
Mm-hmm. How did you find it?

959
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:34,893
Very erotic.

960
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:37,696
I see. I was just checking.

961
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:42,383
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

962
01:09:42,452 --> 01:09:44,452
I do.

963
01:09:45,355 --> 01:09:47,822
Your name? J. Edgar hoover.

964
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:51,626
Occupation? Head of the federal
bureau of investigation.

965
01:09:51,695 --> 01:09:53,828
Will you tell the court why
you're dressed like this?

966
01:09:53,897 --> 01:09:55,814
I have many enemies,

967
01:09:55,883 --> 01:09:58,417
and I rarely go out unless I'm in disguise.

968
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:00,835
Mr. hoover, in your opinion,

969
01:10:00,904 --> 01:10:05,173
is Fielding Mellish a threat to the
security of the United States?

970
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:07,175
Enough to have his phone tapped.

971
01:10:11,247 --> 01:10:13,181
Hello.

972
01:10:15,285 --> 01:10:17,218
Hello. Who is this?

973
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:19,253
Who is this?

974
01:10:21,308 --> 01:10:23,608
<i>Hello. Who is this?</i>

975
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,927
<i>Can you hold on one second?</i>

976
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:28,563
Walter, it's for you!

977
01:10:28,631 --> 01:10:30,865
All right, I did it!

978
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:33,735
I did it! I'm guilty!

979
01:10:33,804 --> 01:10:36,071
But I couldn't take it anymore.

980
01:10:36,139 --> 01:10:38,707
She kept tormenting me.

981
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:40,942
Egging me on!

982
01:10:41,011 --> 01:10:43,111
Making a fool of me!

983
01:10:46,316 --> 01:10:48,482
Isn't this Epstein versus Epstein?

984
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,653
I'm sorry.

985
01:10:56,226 --> 01:10:59,310
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've
known Fielding Mellish for years,

986
01:10:59,379 --> 01:11:02,981
and he's a warm, wonderful human being.

987
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:05,009
Would the clerk read
that statement back, please?

988
01:11:05,102 --> 01:11:07,953
"I've know Fielding Mellish for years,

989
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:11,055
and he is a rotten, conniving,
dishonest, little rat."

990
01:11:11,525 --> 01:11:13,608
Okay. I just wanted to make
sure you were getting it.

991
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:15,576
You're out of order.

992
01:11:17,013 --> 01:11:19,314
Name? Sharon Craig.

993
01:11:19,382 --> 01:11:21,316
And you are?

994
01:11:21,618 --> 01:11:23,935
Miss America.

995
01:11:24,371 --> 01:11:26,738
♫♫

996
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:56,751
Tell the court why you think
he's a traitor to this country.

997
01:11:56,819 --> 01:12:00,021
I think Mr. Mellish is a
traitor to this country...

998
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:03,258
Because his views are different
from the views of the president...

999
01:12:03,326 --> 01:12:05,260
And others of his kind.

1000
01:12:05,695 --> 01:12:08,096
Differences of opinion should be tolerated,

1001
01:12:08,165 --> 01:12:10,364
but not when they're too different.

1002
01:12:10,433 --> 01:12:14,803
Then he becomes a subversive mother.

1003
01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:16,821
Call Fielding Mellish.

1004
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:21,293
Mr. Mellish, what is your nationality?

1005
01:12:24,031 --> 01:12:27,265
Well, you... you might say
I have two nationalities.

1006
01:12:29,736 --> 01:12:31,736
Are you being coy?

1007
01:12:33,506 --> 01:12:35,440
Well, I am an American citizen...

1008
01:12:35,508 --> 01:12:38,243
And also the president of San Marcos.

1009
01:12:39,879 --> 01:12:42,747
I would not joke with this court if I were you.

1010
01:12:44,952 --> 01:12:48,053
- Wouldn't you or couldn't you?
- That's enough.

1011
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:51,255
Does the code name "sapphire"
mean anything to you?

1012
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:55,627
It doesn't. I swear to God.

1013
01:12:55,696 --> 01:12:59,864
You swear to God, and yet, you have no
compunction about teaching evolution.

1014
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:07,739
<i>Where were you on the night of June 23?</i>

1015
01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:15,429
If you cannot resist disrupting the court,

1016
01:13:15,498 --> 01:13:18,266
I order the marshal to bind and gag you.

1017
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,535
<i>And so you
followed Fielding Mellish...</i>

1018
01:13:20,603 --> 01:13:23,404
<i>And overheard him make treasonous
remarks about this country.</i>

1019
01:13:23,473 --> 01:13:25,406
I did.

1020
01:13:25,475 --> 01:13:27,692
Your witness.

1021
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,353
Yes, I did.

1022
01:13:38,788 --> 01:13:41,555
No!

1023
01:13:41,624 --> 01:13:44,075
I don't remember.

1024
01:13:44,144 --> 01:13:48,046
No!

1025
01:13:50,984 --> 01:13:53,384
Don't put words in my mouth!

1026
01:13:53,453 --> 01:13:56,521
Yes!

1027
01:13:56,589 --> 01:14:01,292
- Yes, it's true! I lied!

1028
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:05,964
Ladies and gentlemen, you
will retire for your verdict.

1029
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,985
Good evening. I'm Roger Grimsby
with the news at 6:00.

1030
01:14:11,054 --> 01:14:13,288
A verdict has been reached
in the Fielding Mellish case.

1031
01:14:13,357 --> 01:14:15,724
I'll have details in one moment.

1034
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:40,348
What brand are you smoking? - These.

1035
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:42,284
Those are for sinners.

Oh?

1037
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,954
You should try new testament cigarettes.
New testament, huh?

1038
01:14:47,023 --> 01:14:49,090
They've got the revolutionary incense filter.

1039
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:51,092
I'll try one.

01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,969
Good flavor. Smooth too.

You stick to new testament
cigarettes and all is forgiven.

Thank you, father.

1044

New testament cigarettes.

<i>♫♫</i>

1048
01:15:24,945 --> 01:15:29,180
Fielding Mellish was found guilty
today on 12 counts of treason...

1049
01:15:29,248 --> 01:15:32,116
And was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

1050
01:15:32,185 --> 01:15:34,452
The judge suspended the sentence
in return for the promise...

1051
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,555
That Mellish will not
move into his neighborhood.

1052

Nancy, now that this whole thing is over,

do you think the two of us could get married?

Oh, I'd love to.

you're going to need somebody to support you.

Fielding, do you love me? Of course.

1058

No, but do you<i> love</i> me. You know what I mean?

Yes, I love you. I love you.

Can you, like, define the meaning of love?

What do you mean? It's to love. I love you.

and a room with grapefruit,

1067
01:16:15,629 --> 01:16:19,196
and love of a thing, of nature,
and a sense of not wanting...

1068
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:21,899
Or being jealous of the thing
that a person possesses.

Of the Fielding Mellish honeymoon night.

Mellish and his new bride
were married this morning...

1075
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:38,900
In a civil ceremony in downtown Manhattan.

1076
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,902
The bride wore the traditional virginal white,

1077
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,904
as did Mellish.

1078
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,889
Following that, they had dinner...

1079
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:47,825
And are both now ready for the
consummation of their marriage.

1080

She's got a lot of fans here.

They're tense, but they swell
to a tremendous cheer.

1087
01:17:13,336 --> 01:17:17,922
And as I think is apparent, she is
in very good physical condition.

1088
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:22,860
And here comes Mellish.

01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:37,942
<i>Nothing unique about that.</i>

1095
01:17:38,011 --> 01:17:42,263
<i>Now Mellish begins to make
his moves and so does Nancy.</i>

1096
01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:44,732
The two are working together closely.

1097
01:17:44,801 --> 01:17:46,901
<i>The action growing more rigorous.</i>

1098
01:17:47,337 --> 01:17:51,339
It is swift, rhythmic, coordinated.
What's that?

1099
01:17:51,408 --> 01:17:54,125
<i>A cut over Mellish's right eye.</i>

1100
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:56,154
The doctor comes in to examine the cut.

1101
01:17:56,212 --> 01:17:58,345
<i>No, it will not be stopped. It continues.</i>

1102
01:17:58,414 --> 01:18:00,347
<i>I tell you, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1103
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,333
<i>although you can see for yourselves,</i>

1104
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:04,819
I have never seen action like this.

1105
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:07,054
<i>That's it. It's over.</i>

1106
01:18:07,357 --> 01:18:10,708
It's all over. The marriage
has been consummated.

1107
01:18:10,777 --> 01:18:14,979
Nancy and Fielding Mellish in the
most real sense are now man and wife,

1108
01:18:15,048 --> 01:18:17,014
and if it's humanly possible,

1109
01:18:17,084 --> 01:18:20,118
I'm going to break through
these fans to talk to the two.

1110
01:18:20,187 --> 01:18:22,620
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1111
01:18:22,689 --> 01:18:25,290
Nancy, I know that this is very personal.

1112
01:18:25,358 --> 01:18:28,326
Hello, Howard. Was it everything you expected?

1113
01:18:28,395 --> 01:18:30,828
Well, Howard, it all went by so fast.

1114
01:18:30,897 --> 01:18:33,465
I had no idea that it would
be so quick, really.

1115
01:18:33,533 --> 01:18:35,766
I was expecting a longer bout.

1116
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:38,403
No difficulties of any kind.

1117
01:18:38,472 --> 01:18:42,807
Well, as you know, I'm
extraordinarily ticklish,

1118
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:44,842
so I had kind of a little rough time there.

1119
01:18:44,911 --> 01:18:46,844
I couldn't stop laughing.

1120
01:18:46,913 --> 01:18:48,846
I thought it would get in my way,

1121
01:18:48,915 --> 01:18:50,781
but I really trained well for this,

1122
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,783
and I think it sort of held me.

1123
01:18:52,852 --> 01:18:55,920
So there really wasn't any time that
I didn't feel in complete control.

1124
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:59,023
How about you, Fielding?
I was concerned about that cut.

1125
01:18:59,092 --> 01:19:02,627
I thought they might stop the action.
Did you have that feeling?

1126
01:19:02,695 --> 01:19:05,413
Yes, I was, Howard. I thought that
I'd have to finish it up quick...

1127
01:19:05,482 --> 01:19:08,015
'Cause I thought the referee
might come in and stop it.

1128
01:19:08,084 --> 01:19:10,017
I knew I was leading at that point.

1129
01:19:10,086 --> 01:19:14,288
I was just hoping that they'd let
me go all the way, and they did.

1130
01:19:14,357 --> 01:19:16,357
No disappointments at all.

1131
01:19:16,426 --> 01:19:19,226
Well, I had heard that he would
be in great, great shape,

1132
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:22,296
and I felt that, um, he wasn't...

1133
01:19:22,365 --> 01:19:25,199
That he could use a little
seasoning and, you know,

1134
01:19:25,268 --> 01:19:27,635
sort of timing... the timing was a little off.

1135
01:19:27,704 --> 01:19:29,837
He'll be fine. He's not the worst I've had.

1136
01:19:29,906 --> 01:19:32,607
Not best, but not the worst.

1137
01:19:32,675 --> 01:19:35,576
Are you offended by what
Nancy just said, Fielding?

1138
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,345
I'm not offended, but I don't agree with her.
I was in great shape.

1139
01:19:38,415 --> 01:19:40,381
I thought I had her in real trouble...

1140
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:43,017
With her right hand up early.

1141
01:19:43,085 --> 01:19:45,486
<i>I was in good form. My breathing was good.</i>

1142
01:19:45,922 --> 01:19:48,773
I've been training very hard
for this, and I gave 100%.

1143
01:19:48,842 --> 01:19:50,975
When do you anticipate your next bout?

1144
01:19:51,044 --> 01:19:54,211
I think we could probably do
this again in the late spring.

1145
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:58,382
Any comment? The late spring?

1146
01:19:58,451 --> 01:20:01,385
I think I'll be ready by the late spring.
I'd like...

1147
01:20:01,454 --> 01:20:03,454
As long as the late spring?

1148
01:20:03,523 --> 01:20:06,624
I think we should leave the
happy couple on that note.

1149
01:20:06,693 --> 01:20:08,960
It's hard to tell what may
happen in the future,

1150
01:20:09,029 --> 01:20:12,196
but they may live happily ever after.

1151
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:14,198
Again, they may not.

1152
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:16,200
Be assured of this, though.

1153
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:19,037
Wherever the action is, we will be there...

1154
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:22,073
With ABC's <i>Wide World of Sports</i> to cover it.

1155
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:24,976
Now, on behalf of Nancy and Fielding Mellish...

1156
01:20:25,045 --> 01:20:27,244
And all of the others who
have made this possible,

1157
01:20:27,313 --> 01:20:30,381
this is Howard Cosell thanking
you for joining us...

1158
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:33,217
And wishing you a most pleasant good day.
