1
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,049
Dick Laurent is dead.

2
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,972
You don't mind that
I'm not coming tonight?

3
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,571
What are you going to do?

4
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:45,691
Stay home, read.

5
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,012
Read?

6
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:01,812
Read?

7
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:05,533
Read what, Renee?

8
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:15,213
It's nice to know 
I can still make you laugh.

9
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:18,332
I like to laugh, Fred.

10
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:26,573
That's why I married you.

11
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:34,094
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

12
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:07,619
What is that?

13
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,819
A videotape.

14
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:21,019
I found it outside on the steps.

15
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,219
Who's it from?

16
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,620
I don't know.

17
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,779
There isn't anything on the envelope.

18
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,540
Does it say anything on the tape?

19
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,460
No. Nothing.

20
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,820
Well, see what's on it.

21
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:07,661
Come on.

22
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:48,382
Must be from a real estate agent.

23
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:51,582
Maybe.

24
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:14,628
It's OK.

25
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,308
It's OK.

26
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:19,948
It's OK.

27
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,829
I had a dream last night.

28
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,669
You were inside the house...

29
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,669
You were calling my name...

30
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,950
Fred!

31
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,030
Fred!

32
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,510
Where are you.

33
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,430
I couldn't find you.

34
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:09,671
Then there you were...

35
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:12,391
... Iying in bed.

36
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,230
It wasn't you.

37
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:19,671
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

38
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:44,552
Fred, are you all right?

39
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,754
You're up early.

40
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,674
That dog woke me.

41
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:06,754
Who the hell owns that dog?

42
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:19,114
What's that?

43
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,875
Another videotape.

44
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:27,715
Yes.

45
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,435
Don't you want to watch it?

46
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,235
I guess so.

47
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,356
Well, don't you want to watch it?

48
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:05,315
Yeah.

49
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,356
It's the same thing.

50
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:25,236
No, it isn't.

51
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:34,316
Fred?

52
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:49,717
What?

53
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:03,598
We have to call the police.

54
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:05,638
That's right. Yes.

55
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:16,677
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

56
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:21,197
7035 Hollis.

57
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:25,078
Near the observatory.

58
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:27,438
Yes.

59
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:30,838
We'll be here.

60
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,678
So?

61
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,038
They're sending 2 detectives out.

62
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,079
That's it.

63
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,318
What do you think.

64
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,999
I really don't know.

65
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,599
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

66
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,480
This is the bedroom?

67
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,800
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

68
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
This is our bedroom.

69
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,800
There's no other bedroom?

70
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:54,800
No.

71
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,160
I mean, I use it as a practice room.

72
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,441
It's soundproof.

73
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
You're a musician?

74
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:07,200
Yeah.

75
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,321
What's your axe?

76
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,961
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

77
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,161
- Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

78
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:19,161
Do you own a video camera?

79
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:20,001
No.

80
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,681
Fred hates them.

81
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:33,441
I like to remember things my own way.

82
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,041
What do you mean by that?

83
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:43,122
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

84
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,041
You have an alarm system?

85
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:51,802
Yes. Actually, we do.

86
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:55,082
But we haven't been using it lately.

87
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,162
Why not?

88
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,202
It kept going off...

89
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,722
For some reason. False alarms.

90
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,322
Might want to try and use it again.

91
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:12,282
Yeah.

92
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,123
OK?

93
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:22,922
We're going to check the windows and doors,
see if anybody tried to break in.

94
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:37,565
-We'll keep watch over the house.
-We'll do the best we can.

95
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:42,685
-If anything else happens, you'll call us.
-We will.

96
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:47,685
-Thanks, guys.
-It's what we do.

97
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,926
Hey, Andy! Welcome to my party.

98
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:28,086
-You look ravishing.
-Thank you.

99
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:42,887
Fred!

100
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:45,927
Please!

101
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:49,087
Please!

102
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:52,247
Hey!

103
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:11,087
-2 double scotches, neat.
-OK.

104
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:03,049
We've met before, haven't we?

105
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,008
I don't think so.

106
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:13,129
Where was it you think we met?

107
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,889
At your house. Don't you remember?

108
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:21,970
No. No, I don't.

109
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:24,649
Are you sure?

110
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:26,929
Of course.

111
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:32,490
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

112
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,570
What do you mean? You're where right now?

113
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:44,730
At your house.

114
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,570
That's fucking crazy, man!

115
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,570
Call me!

116
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,171
Dial your number!

117
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:13,251
Go ahead!

118
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:27,731
I told you I was here.

119
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:32,571
How'd you do that?

120
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:37,651
Ask me!

121
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:45,171
How'd you get inside my house?

122
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:50,972
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

123
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:53,091
Who are you?

124
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:55,172
Hm.

125
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:02,732
Give me back my phone.

126
00:30:13,732 --> 00:30:16,493
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

127
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:36,773
-I thought you were getting me a drink.
-Hang on just a minute.

128
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:42,293
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

129
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:46,733
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

130
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,094
Dick Laurent?

131
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,173
Yeah. I believe so.

132
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:04,253
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

133
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:08,054
He is?

134
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:13,294
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

135
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,014
I don't.

136
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:20,695
I don't know him.

137
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:23,295
Dick can't be dead.

138
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:25,974
Who told you he was dead?

139
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:29,895
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

140
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:33,934
Let's go home.

141
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:36,335
-But...
-Now. We're leaving now.

142
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:41,415
We never should have come here in the first place.

143
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,455
So, how'd you meet that asshole Andy anyway?

144
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,095
It was a long time ago.

145
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:01,775
We met at a place called Moke's.

146
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,175
We became friends.

147
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,775
He told me about a job.

148
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:09,896
What job?

149
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,616
I don't remember.

150
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:19,496
Anyway...Andy's OK.

151
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,376
Well, He's got some pretty fucked-up friends.

152
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:36,417
Hey!..
Hey!..

153
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:39,297
Stay in the car.

154
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,339
I told you to stay in the car.

155
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,739
Why? What is it?

156
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:13,179
Why did you make me stay out here?

157
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:19,219
I'll tell you why, because I thought someone was inside the house.

158
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,380
Was there?

159
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:28,060
No, of course not.

160
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:08,023
Fred?

161
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:18,024
Fred, where are you?

162
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:06,788
Renee!

163
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:09,829
Renee!

164
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:12,429
Sit down, Killer!

165
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,709
I didn't kill her.

166
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,669
Tell me I didn't kill her.

167
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:41,069
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

168
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,749
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

169
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,510
it is my order that you be put to death in the electric chair.

170
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,590
Make yourself to home, fella.

171
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,070
Stick your hand out, chief.

172
00:43:31,274 --> 00:43:32,394
Something wrong?

173
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:39,195
It's...my head.

174
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,555
You sleeping OK?

175
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:07,155
No.

176
00:44:08,956 --> 00:44:10,996
I can't sleep.

177
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:00,156
You'll sleep now.

178
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:03,917
Take him back to his cell.

179
00:45:05,517 --> 00:45:06,557
Let's go.

180
00:45:18,277 --> 00:45:18,918
Guard!

181
00:45:23,197 --> 00:45:23,838
Guard!

182
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:36,758
Guard!

183
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:43,078
Hey!

184
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:47,718
What do you want?

185
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:52,198
Aspirin.
My head.

186
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:56,478
Hey! Hey!

187
00:46:08,918 --> 00:46:12,839
Shit. That wife killer's looking pretty fucked up.

188
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,999
Which one?

189
00:47:57,681 --> 00:47:58,881
Pete!

190
00:47:59,762 --> 00:48:01,241
Please don't go!

191
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:03,362
No. Pete!

192
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:05,642
Pete!..Pete!..Pete!
Wait a minute!

193
00:49:30,964 --> 00:49:33,324
Fuck me!

194
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:44,124
All right. What's the situation?

195
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:47,284
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

196
00:50:02,725 --> 00:50:03,685
Right here.

197
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,686
That's not Fred Madison.

198
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:14,565
No, Sir. It's not.

199
00:50:18,805 --> 00:50:21,445
-Who is it?
-I couldn't say, Sir.

200
00:50:23,526 --> 00:50:24,725
Captain Luneau?

201
00:50:25,446 --> 00:50:26,485
Yeah, Mike?

202
00:50:27,445 --> 00:50:28,166
Captain...

203
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:31,285
This is some spooky shit we got here.

204
00:50:40,606 --> 00:50:43,486
Well, Gentlemen, we know who the stranger is.

205
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:47,967
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

206
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:51,886
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft

207
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:55,166
for which he was put on probation for 1 year.

208
00:50:56,207 --> 00:51:02,887
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

209
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:53,448
So...

210
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:35,689
-Here.
-Thanks, Lou.

211
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:25,612
Where the fuck have you been, man?

212
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:27,772
-Hey! -Hiya. -Hi.
-Hey, guy.

213
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:31,413
-Hey, man.
-What's up man?

214
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:34,573
Well, you look like shit.

215
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,213
Yeah. What happened?

216
00:54:37,892 --> 00:54:39,773
Just haven't been feeling so good.

217
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:41,853
You're not contagious, are you?

218
00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:43,573
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

219
00:54:43,773 --> 00:54:45,653
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.

220
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:48,493
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

221
00:54:49,093 --> 00:54:51,893
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.

222
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:54,894
But it's worth it when you know that...

223
00:54:55,174 --> 00:54:56,493
-Come on.
-Hoh.

224
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:58,213
Come on. I'll lead.

225
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:01,894
...and a glass of fresh, cold milk from grandmother's cow.

226
00:55:04,214 --> 00:55:05,014
See ya later.

227
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:09,453
-I'm gonna go out with these clowns for a while.
-That should do you some good.

228
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:15,054
-Good night. -See ya.
-Good night.

229
00:55:42,934 --> 00:55:44,574
What's happening to you?

230
00:55:46,254 --> 00:55:48,055
What happened to your face?

231
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:52,455
-I don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?

232
00:55:53,575 --> 00:55:55,855
You've been acting strange lately.

233
00:55:56,374 --> 00:55:57,695
Like the other night.

234
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:01,335
What night?

235
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:04,175
The last time I saw you.

236
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:06,455
I don't remember.

237
00:56:17,456 --> 00:56:19,096
You still care about me?

238
00:56:44,616 --> 00:56:45,256
Pete!

239
00:56:48,136 --> 00:56:49,936
-Arnie!
-Where you been?

240
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:52,616
-How you doing?
-It's good you're back...

241
00:56:52,857 --> 00:56:55,496
...Wonderful.
-Good to see you, man.

242
00:56:55,697 --> 00:56:56,336
Listen, man, a lot of people...

243
00:56:56,576 --> 00:56:59,776
...gonna be real happy that you're back, including me.

244
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,536
Well, it's good to be back.

245
00:57:01,737 --> 00:57:03,777
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

246
00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:05,257
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

247
00:57:05,457 --> 00:57:07,976
And Mr. Eddy called.

248
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:12,216
-Can I call him and tell him to come in?
-Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

249
00:57:12,857 --> 00:57:15,697
-And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
-You're ready to work?
-Yeah.

250
00:57:15,897 --> 00:57:18,177
-Well, let's go to work.
-All right, Buddy.

251
00:57:21,658 --> 00:57:23,177
Petey's back!

252
00:57:40,378 --> 00:57:41,898
There's 9 People down here.

253
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:47,418
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

254
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:50,418
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

255
00:57:59,578 --> 00:58:00,938
Hey, Pete!

256
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:05,098
Pete!

257
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:08,898
Where's Pete?

258
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:11,498
He's back there!

259
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:12,499
Mr. Eddy!

260
00:58:14,218 --> 00:58:15,259
Hey!

261
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:20,538
What happened?

262
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:22,858
-Somebody giving you trouble?
-No. No trouble.

263
00:58:23,059 --> 00:58:26,659
'Cause if somebody's giving you trouble, Pete,...

264
00:58:26,899 --> 00:58:29,539
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that!

265
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,939
-No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
-I mean it, Pete. Like...that!

266
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,459
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

267
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:40,339
...just a regular tune-up?
-I want you to take a ride with me.

268
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,059
I don't like the sound of something.

269
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,179
-OK. I got to check in with the boss.
-It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

270
00:59:20,981 --> 00:59:23,181
Pull it over, but keep it running.

271
00:59:43,741 --> 00:59:46,102
Best goddamn ears in town.

272
01:00:00,342 --> 01:00:01,982
Give that a try.

273
01:00:07,982 --> 01:00:12,902
Beautiful...Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.

274
01:00:15,582 --> 01:00:18,622
-Let's take a ride.
-Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

275
01:00:31,903 --> 01:00:33,862
It's a beautiful day.

276
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,782
-You did a great job, Pete.
-Yeah.

277
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:46,703
Well, you know I like working on this car, Mr. Eddy.

278
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:06,823
Shit. That cocksucker doing what I think he's doing?

279
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:38,504
This is where mechanical excellence...

280
01:01:38,705 --> 01:01:42,224
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

281
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,066
Ahh...Oh, oh, God!

282
01:02:23,065 --> 01:02:27,425
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!

283
01:02:27,906 --> 01:02:29,706
-Ever!
-Tell him you won't tailgate.

284
01:02:29,905 --> 01:02:30,705
Ever!

285
01:02:31,106 --> 01:02:34,226
-I won't ever...
-Do you know how many fucking car lengths it takes...

286
01:02:34,466 --> 01:02:37,506
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?!

287
01:02:37,705 --> 01:02:41,066
6 fucking car lengths!
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister!

288
01:02:41,986 --> 01:02:44,506
If I had to stop suddenly, you would've hit me!

289
01:02:44,706 --> 01:02:49,066
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual!
I want you to study that motherfucker!

290
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:51,506
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules!

291
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:55,466
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

292
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:58,466
Because of fucking assholes like you!

293
01:02:58,986 --> 01:03:04,827
-Tell me you're going to get a manual!
-I will ge-get a manual.

294
01:03:07,427 --> 01:03:09,067
Fucking ldiot!

295
01:03:09,307 --> 01:03:12,266
Oh!.Aah!.Oh, Gooood!

296
01:03:49,987 --> 01:03:51,788
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

297
01:03:52,588 --> 01:03:56,268
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.

298
01:03:57,748 --> 01:03:59,548
Yeah, I can see that.

299
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:10,829
Wait a minute!

300
01:04:16,068 --> 01:04:18,349
-Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
-No, thank you.

301
01:04:18,869 --> 01:04:20,829
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

302
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:24,469
You like pornos?

303
01:04:24,669 --> 01:04:27,028
-Pornos?
-Give you a boner?

304
01:04:28,149 --> 01:04:30,829
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

305
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:32,869
Suit yourself, champ.

306
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:37,909
-Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
-You will.

307
01:04:44,229 --> 01:04:45,670
Damn!

308
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,310
Lou, you recognize that guy?

309
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,870
Yeah...Laurent.

310
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:12,912
-What do you want?
-Want to go for a drive?

311
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:15,912
I don't know.

312
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:19,231
Get in, Baby!

313
01:06:40,473 --> 01:06:41,273
Come here!

314
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:26,154
-Why don't you like me?
-I do like you.

315
01:07:26,954 --> 01:07:28,074
How much?

316
01:08:34,635 --> 01:08:35,956
Oh, Pete!

317
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:42,796
Sheila!

318
01:08:45,316 --> 01:08:46,756
Sheila!

319
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:29,517
What'd you change it for?

320
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:31,637
I like that.

321
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:34,197
Well, I don't.

322
01:09:43,718 --> 01:09:45,117
I like that!

323
01:10:18,918 --> 01:10:21,679
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

324
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,559
-Think you'll get a chance to give her the once-over today?
-Sure.

325
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:28,039
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

326
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,999
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

327
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:35,799
-It'll be done.
-You're my man, Pete.

328
01:12:18,842 --> 01:12:22,522
Don't let that thing upset you.

329
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:50,883
Holy smokes!

330
01:13:16,523 --> 01:13:17,564
Hey!

331
01:13:19,803 --> 01:13:21,364
I'm Alice Wakefield.

332
01:13:22,163 --> 01:13:23,523
Pete Dayton.

333
01:13:25,604 --> 01:13:28,723
-I was here earlier.
-Yeah, I remember.

334
01:13:35,604 --> 01:13:37,804
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

335
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:41,404
I don't know.

336
01:13:47,124 --> 01:13:48,244
OK.

337
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:51,845
Why don't I take you to dinner?

338
01:13:54,484 --> 01:13:58,405
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.

339
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:07,165
Do you have a phone?

340
01:14:10,205 --> 01:14:11,165
Yeah.

341
01:14:12,165 --> 01:14:14,205
It's right...lt's right there.

342
01:14:15,045 --> 01:14:17,685
I have to call myself another taxi.

343
01:14:27,845 --> 01:14:29,726
Hello? Van Nuys?

344
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,845
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

345
01:14:46,885 --> 01:14:50,846
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

346
01:14:51,686 --> 01:14:55,046
Hello. Yeah, we're not going to need that cab.
Thanks.

347
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:13,967
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

348
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,568
Take my clothes off!

349
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:54,488
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

350
01:16:43,409 --> 01:16:46,289
-I want more.
-Me, too.

351
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:56,610
-Can I call you?
-Yeah. Call me at home. I'll give you the number.

352
01:17:02,809 --> 01:17:03,769
OK, Baby.

353
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:36,131
Hey! Up here.Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

354
01:18:09,491 --> 01:18:12,172
I'll get it.
Hello?

355
01:18:13,051 --> 01:18:16,091
Meow, meow.It's me.

356
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:17,772
Hey, Baby.

357
01:18:19,252 --> 01:18:21,852
I can't see you tonight.

358
01:18:25,172 --> 01:18:26,292
OK.

359
01:18:27,932 --> 01:18:30,132
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

360
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:32,612
Sure.

361
01:18:34,612 --> 01:18:39,532
I think he suspects something. We have to be careful.

362
01:18:42,493 --> 01:18:44,052
I miss you.

363
01:18:47,813 --> 01:18:48,693
Pete?

364
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:51,452
Me, too.

365
01:18:53,252 --> 01:18:55,213
I'll call you again.

366
01:20:29,735 --> 01:20:31,296
What a fucking job.

367
01:20:32,096 --> 01:20:33,736
His or ours, Lou?

368
01:20:35,695 --> 01:20:36,736
Ours, Hank.

369
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,696
-Hey.
-Sit down a minute!

370
01:21:04,617 --> 01:21:07,176
-What's up?
-Sit down!

371
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:11,376
You don't look so good.

372
01:21:11,977 --> 01:21:15,096
No, I just...just have a headache.

373
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:18,017
What's going on?

374
01:21:19,577 --> 01:21:21,376
The police called us.

375
01:21:23,537 --> 01:21:24,417
What'd they want?

376
01:21:24,657 --> 01:21:30,017
They want to know if we had a chance
to find out what happened to you the other night.

377
01:21:30,777 --> 01:21:33,737
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

378
01:21:37,577 --> 01:21:39,858
But I don't remember anything.

379
01:21:41,457 --> 01:21:43,657
What'd you tell them?

380
01:21:48,977 --> 01:21:51,177
We're not going to say anything...

381
01:21:51,697 --> 01:21:53,897
...about that night to the police.

382
01:21:56,738 --> 01:21:59,018
We saw you that night, Pete.

383
01:22:02,338 --> 01:22:04,618
You came home with your friend Sheila.

384
01:22:06,778 --> 01:22:07,498
Sheila?

385
01:22:10,778 --> 01:22:13,218
Yeah. There was a man with you.

386
01:22:14,218 --> 01:22:17,898
What is this? I mean, why didn't you tell me anything?

387
01:22:22,978 --> 01:22:24,419
Who's the man?

388
01:22:25,978 --> 01:22:29,178
I've never seen him before in my life.

389
01:22:34,419 --> 01:22:36,059
What happened to me?

390
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:42,059
Please, please, Dad, Tell me!

391
01:23:00,139 --> 01:23:01,259
Hey, Pete! Hey!

392
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:03,660
Hey!

393
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:15,620
Hey!

394
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:17,580
Mr. Eddy.

395
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:29,980
Hey, Pete!

396
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:32,820
-How you doing?
-I'm OK.

397
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:35,901
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

398
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:39,181
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

399
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:44,701
Her name is Alice.I swear,
I love that girl to death.

400
01:23:47,221 --> 01:23:51,341
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

401
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,461
I'd take this

402
01:23:55,701 --> 01:23:59,701
and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

403
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:03,181
-And then you know what I'd do?
-What?

404
01:24:04,022 --> 01:24:06,741
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

405
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:17,462
Hey. You're looking good.

406
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:20,261
What you been up to?

407
01:24:29,701 --> 01:24:30,742
I'll get it.

408
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:33,462
Hello?

409
01:24:35,622 --> 01:24:41,862
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

410
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:48,303
He'll kill us.

411
01:24:52,062 --> 01:24:53,423
Are you...

412
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:57,542
...positive that he knows?

413
01:24:57,743 --> 01:25:00,623
I'm not positive, but he knows.

414
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:08,703
So...What are we supposed to do?

415
01:25:11,623 --> 01:25:13,103
I don't know.

416
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:48,024
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

417
01:25:52,424 --> 01:25:54,064
I know a guy.

418
01:25:56,505 --> 01:25:59,625
He pays girls to party with him.

419
01:26:00,304 --> 01:26:02,024
He's always got a lot of cash.

420
01:26:03,544 --> 01:26:05,344
He'd be easy to rob.

421
01:26:06,824 --> 01:26:11,265
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

422
01:26:13,185 --> 01:26:15,385
We could be together.

423
01:26:23,585 --> 01:26:25,305
Have you partied with him?

424
01:26:31,585 --> 01:26:32,945
Did you like it?

425
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:36,025
No.

426
01:26:36,985 --> 01:26:38,346
It was part of the deal.

427
01:26:39,586 --> 01:26:40,626
What deal?

428
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:47,186
-He works for Mr. Eddy.
-Yeah?

429
01:26:47,946 --> 01:26:50,985
-And what's he do?
-He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

430
01:26:51,786 --> 01:26:54,986
-Pornos?
-Yeah.

431
01:26:56,066 --> 01:26:58,506
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

432
01:26:58,706 --> 01:27:02,386
-Pete...
-No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.

433
01:27:06,946 --> 01:27:08,986
It was a long time ago.

434
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:14,706
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

435
01:27:16,307 --> 01:27:18,267
He told me about a job.

436
01:27:23,427 --> 01:27:24,707
In pornos?

437
01:27:27,787 --> 01:27:32,787
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

438
01:27:35,707 --> 01:27:39,227
He made an appointment for me to see a man.

439
01:27:40,267 --> 01:27:41,787
I went to this place.

440
01:27:44,347 --> 01:27:46,147
They made me wait there forever.

441
01:27:48,548 --> 01:27:50,827
There was a guy guarding the door.

442
01:27:55,148 --> 01:27:57,908
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

443
01:28:04,828 --> 01:28:06,628
I started getting nervous.

444
01:28:08,948 --> 01:28:11,308
When it got dark...

445
01:28:12,428 --> 01:28:15,548
...they brought me into this other room.

446
01:30:33,752 --> 01:30:36,112
Why didn't you just leave?

447
01:30:44,032 --> 01:30:46,152
You liked it, huh?

448
01:30:49,633 --> 01:30:54,872
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

449
01:31:00,193 --> 01:31:02,313
I don't want you to go away.

450
01:31:03,112 --> 01:31:04,513
I don't want you to go away.

451
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,713
I love you, Alice.

452
01:31:20,754 --> 01:31:23,193
-Should I call Andy?
-Andy?

453
01:31:25,034 --> 01:31:27,914
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

454
01:31:28,874 --> 01:31:31,513
Yeah. Call him.

455
01:31:34,273 --> 01:31:36,394
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

456
01:31:37,034 --> 01:31:39,313
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

457
01:31:39,713 --> 01:31:44,314
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

458
01:31:44,994 --> 01:31:50,914
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

459
01:31:51,114 --> 01:31:53,994
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

460
01:31:54,235 --> 01:31:58,834
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

461
01:31:59,194 --> 01:32:02,794
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.

462
01:32:03,115 --> 01:32:07,235
At 11:15, I'll send Andy down to fix me a drink.

463
01:32:07,434 --> 01:32:11,034
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

464
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:15,514
OK.

465
01:32:44,436 --> 01:32:47,036
-You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
-Sheila!

466
01:32:47,235 --> 01:32:49,516
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila! Sheila, stop it!

467
01:32:49,716 --> 01:32:51,836
-You don't call. Who is she?
-Stop it!

468
01:32:52,036 --> 01:32:54,876
-What's the bitch's name?
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

469
01:32:55,076 --> 01:32:56,636
-Go home!
-You're sorry?
-Sheila, stop it!

470
01:32:56,876 --> 01:32:58,836
You're sorry, you piece of shit!

471
01:32:59,036 --> 01:33:00,436
-You're sorry?
-Go home!

472
01:33:00,636 --> 01:33:02,676
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila, stop, Sheila!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!

473
01:33:02,956 --> 01:33:05,396
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila...Sheila.

474
01:33:05,716 --> 01:33:09,756
Sheila! Let's both go in and talk about this quietly.

475
01:33:10,156 --> 01:33:11,676
Sheila, come on.

476
01:33:14,037 --> 01:33:16,237
-You are different.
-Sheila!

477
01:33:16,556 --> 01:33:18,756
Tell him!..Tell him!

478
01:33:18,957 --> 01:33:21,676
Sheila, don't. Don't.

479
01:33:23,077 --> 01:33:29,757
I don't care anymore anyway. I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

480
01:33:30,317 --> 01:33:36,157
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

481
01:33:50,237 --> 01:33:51,277
Pete?

482
01:33:54,197 --> 01:33:55,758
There's a man on the phone.

483
01:33:56,998 --> 01:33:59,438
He's called a couple of times tonight.

484
01:34:00,118 --> 01:34:01,157
Who is it?

485
01:34:03,197 --> 01:34:04,758
He won't give his name.

486
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,318
Hello?

487
01:34:25,038 --> 01:34:27,478
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

488
01:34:29,718 --> 01:34:33,839
-Who is this?
-You know who it is.

489
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:38,519
Mr. Eddy?

490
01:34:39,438 --> 01:34:42,319
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

491
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:46,839
-OK.
-You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.

492
01:34:48,759 --> 01:34:54,839
-Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
-I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

493
01:34:56,959 --> 01:35:02,719
-You're sure you're OK? Everything all right?
-Yeah.

494
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:07,959
I'm really glad to know you're doing good, Pete. Hey!

495
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:10,920
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.

496
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,800
We've met before, haven't we?

497
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,560
I don't think so.

498
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,640
Where is it you think we've met?

499
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,720
At your house. Don't you remember?

500
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:37,080
No. No, I don't.

501
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:41,160
In the East, the far East...

502
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:46,681
...when a person is sentenced to death,
they're sent to a place where they can't escape.

503
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:54,121
Never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them
and fire a bullet into the back of their head.

504
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,121
What's going on?

505
01:35:57,761 --> 01:36:00,281
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

506
01:36:01,201 --> 01:36:06,441
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and
tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.

507
01:39:14,206 --> 01:39:15,326
You got him.

508
01:39:16,486 --> 01:39:17,606
Alice!

509
01:40:12,568 --> 01:40:13,368
Wow!

510
01:40:17,008 --> 01:40:18,648
We killed him.

511
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:29,409
You killed him.

512
01:40:32,408 --> 01:40:33,048
Alice?

513
01:40:38,609 --> 01:40:39,809
Alice?

514
01:40:41,209 --> 01:40:42,689
What do we do?

515
01:40:44,049 --> 01:40:45,689
What do we do?

516
01:40:46,929 --> 01:40:48,569
We have to get the stuff.

517
01:40:51,049 --> 01:40:52,529
We have to get out of here.

518
01:41:07,609 --> 01:41:08,729
Ah, fuck!

519
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,650
Is that you?

520
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,731
Are both of them you?

521
01:41:57,011 --> 01:41:58,291
That's me.

522
01:42:00,931 --> 01:42:03,291
Honey, are you all right?

523
01:42:08,131 --> 01:42:09,651
Where's the bathroom?

524
01:42:11,051 --> 01:42:13,812
It's upstairs, down the hall.

525
01:43:09,013 --> 01:43:10,733
Did you want to talk to me?

526
01:43:13,573 --> 01:43:16,453
Did you want to ask me, why?

527
01:44:12,015 --> 01:44:13,135
What's the matter?

528
01:44:16,734 --> 01:44:18,175
Don't you trust me, Pete?

529
01:44:26,695 --> 01:44:28,735
Stick this in your pants.

530
01:44:35,775 --> 01:44:37,976
I know a fence.

531
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:45,135
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit

532
01:44:46,015 --> 01:44:47,215
and Andy's car...

533
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:51,256
And then we can go anywhere.

534
01:45:06,016 --> 01:45:07,296
Come on, Baby!

535
01:45:23,136 --> 01:45:24,337
Pete, you drive!

536
01:45:39,537 --> 01:45:41,977
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

537
01:45:44,497 --> 01:45:46,457
Where the fuck are we going?

538
01:45:49,178 --> 01:45:51,297
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

539
01:45:53,737 --> 01:45:56,097
The fence I told you about...

540
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:01,417
He's at his cabin.

541
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,660
Come on!

542
01:47:59,701 --> 01:48:01,501
We'll have to wait.

543
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:24,261
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

544
01:48:31,741 --> 01:48:33,862
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

545
01:48:37,542 --> 01:48:39,582
More than ever.

546
01:50:35,945 --> 01:50:37,065
I want you.

547
01:50:45,825 --> 01:50:47,106
I want you.

548
01:51:04,906 --> 01:51:06,026
I want you.

549
01:51:07,946 --> 01:51:09,066
I want you.

550
01:51:27,626 --> 01:51:31,627
You'll never have me.

551
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:34,749
Here I am.

552
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:30,430
-Where's Alice?
-Alice who? Her name is Renee.

553
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:34,270
If she told you her name is Alice, she's lying.

554
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:42,310
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?!

555
01:56:56,835 --> 01:56:57,475
Renee?

556
01:57:07,475 --> 01:57:09,476
You're coming with me.

557
01:59:07,279 --> 01:59:09,879
What do you guys want?

558
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:23,761
Now you can hand it back!

559
02:00:33,162 --> 02:00:35,281
You and me, Mister...

560
02:00:38,321 --> 02:00:42,202
We can really outugly them sumbitches...

561
02:00:43,121 --> 02:00:44,761
Can't we?

562
02:01:38,484 --> 02:01:40,843
Ed...Take a look at this!

563
02:01:47,524 --> 02:01:49,403
Yeah. That's her all right.

564
02:01:50,763 --> 02:01:54,124
That's Fred Madison's wife with Dick Laurent.

565
02:01:54,524 --> 02:01:56,404
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

566
02:01:57,964 --> 02:02:00,404
We got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.

567
02:02:01,324 --> 02:02:03,044
You know what I think, Ed?

568
02:02:04,804 --> 02:02:06,684
What is it, AI? What do you think?

569
02:02:08,044 --> 02:02:10,684
I think there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

570
02:03:11,606 --> 02:03:13,086
Dick Laurent is dead.
