1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,942
LET THE RIGHT ONE IN

2
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,694
Squeal like a pig.

3
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,356
Squeal!

4
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,649
Squeal!

5
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,507
Squeal like a pig!

6
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:19,184
The police have ways
to determine foul play.

7
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:23,912
You remember
that fire in Ängby, hm?

8
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,624
A house burned down.

9
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,461
A body was found inside.

10
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:33,266
We knew the fire had been set,
to conceal the fact...

11
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,966
the victim had been murdered
before hand.

12
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:41,722
So, how could they know that?
Well?

13
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:44,725
Go ahead.

14
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:48,688
There was no smoke in the lungs
of the person who died.

15
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:53,484
That's correct.
Did you figure that out, right now?

16
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,555
No... I read a lot.

17
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,822
What kind of books
would that be?

18
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,421
Just books.

19
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,923
Okay! I'm gonna talk to you
about drugs.

20
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,260
What do you figure the most
common types of drugs...

21
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:13,760
to be found in this town?

22
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:19,452
Hey, Oskar!

23
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:23,779
What are you staring at?
Huh?

24
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,377
Are you looking at me?

25
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,648
Well, fuck off.

26
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,631
Pig!...

27
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:39,931
What a good piggy you are.

28
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:51,931
- Come on, it's time for gym!
- Wait for me.

29
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,584
...the weather report...
(inaudible)

30
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:22,808
...be a little bid...
(inaudible)

31
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:29,177
...clearing up by tonight...
(inaudible)

32
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,977
...again be extreamly cautious...
(inaudible)

33
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:39,381
I can not emphasize enough...
(inaudible)

34
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:52,850
...will be extreamly dangerous...
(inaudible)

35
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:12,272
...search and rescue effort...
(inaudible)

36
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,272
- Excuse me... huh?
- Yes.

37
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,441
You have the time?

38
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,710
I don't have a watch.

39
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,279
What's that?

40
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,238
Oh, this?
Huh... it's called halothane.

40
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,679
Hm... 

41
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,638
- Huh, you are the first to find out.
- Get it off...

42
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,238
No!... Don't...

43
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,028
Ricky!

44
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:39,165
Ricky!

45
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,245
Beat it!

46
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,507
Ricky?

47
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:58,955
Ricky?!

48
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,628
Damn dog!

49
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,468
Ricky!

50
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,235
What're you staring at?

51
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,034
Well?

52
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,071
Are you looking at me?

53
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,174
Well, fuck off.

54
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:30,174
What's your problem?

55
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,315
Are you scared?

56
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,290
Squeal!

57
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,782
So, squeal!

58
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,939
What are you doing?

59
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,642
Huh... nothing.

60
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,839
- What're you doing?
- Nothing.

61
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,316
- Do you live here?
- Yeah...

62
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,752
I live back here in the jungle gym.

63
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,745
Seriously.
Where do you live?

64
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,889
Next door to you.

65
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,921
How do you know
where I live?

66
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,871
I can't be your friend.

67
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,340
Just so you know.

68
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,311
What do you mean?

69
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:38,545
Does there have to be a reason?
That's just the way it is.

70
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,955
What makes you think
I wanna be your friend?

71
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,314
You're supposed to help me!

72
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,803
Do I really have to
take care of myself?

73
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,951
Say something!

74
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,647
I'm sorry.

75
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,223
They don't know why
the young man was killed.

76
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,230
We realise some of you
may be scared scared.

77
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,033
The counselor
will be here all day.

78
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,570
So, go talk to her
if you feel you have the need.

79
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,438
Any questions?

80
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,203
Is it alright if we kill the killer,
if we meet him?

81
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:16,235
Conny, that's not nice.
You may go now.

82
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,946
O~S~k~A~R!

83
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,186
Oskar!

84
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,327
Oskar!

85
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:34,942
Where are you, piggy?!

86
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,942
Where are you, piggy?

87
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,242
Piggy!

88
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,418
Now go home
straight after school!

89
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,431
And don't leave the court-yard
until I come home.

90
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,933
It was way over there
in Vällingby.

91
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,836
A person who kills children.

92
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,139
Is certainly capable of taking
the subway to Stäsha

93
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,273
And walking a mile?

94
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,273
<i>No, that won't be possible.</i>

95
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:27,741
<i>Oskar will be staying
with his dad next week.</i>

96
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:34,741
<i>No... no...
I already told you.</i>

97
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:39,941
<i>No...
I really couldn't do that.</i>

98
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,730
Murder in Vällingby:
Murderer Drained Victim's Blood.

99
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,638
Senseless massacre in Beirut.

100
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,885
No survivors in Arab murders
manhunt for killer continues...

101
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,054
Eyewitness identifies murderer
prior to confession...

102
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,027
Murderer Drained Blood
From His Victim

103
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,852
Hey.

104
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:45,852
Hope, you didn't mind
that one, honey.

105
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:50,301
The death penalty
has no justification...

106
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:55,404
in a society
based on the rule of law.

107
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,243
Based on the rule of law.

108
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,113
The goverment wants us...
to believe...

109
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,481
in that crap
just like the Russians...

110
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:07,518
Are you saying
there aren't any Russians?

111
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,921
- Of course there are.
- Who's that guy?

112
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,447
- Huh?
- Never seen that guy before.

113
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:14,125
But take vipers...

114
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,995
does anyone actually...
get bitten?

115
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,926
That guy just moved into
my neighbourhood... with a kid.

116
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,826
He now lives up
in Janne's old place.

117
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,202
- He could join us? May I ask him?
- Sure!

118
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:31,802
- I don't think so.
- Yeah.

119
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,112
He might pay for a round and...

120
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,709
in that case he's welcome...
even if he's got cancer.

121
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,357
Bad news?

122
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,621
Yeah, life stinks.

123
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,598
Did you just move
into number 15?

124
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,269
You don't have to sit here all alone,
join us and have a laugh.

125
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,745
No thanks, I'm in a hurry.

126
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,491
Mom?

127
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,493
I'm going out.

128
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,997
Aren't you gonna watch
the show?

129
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,266
No, it's no good.

130
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,201
Stay in the court yard, okay?

131
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,674
I'll just watch it by my own.

132
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,522
So, you're back?

133
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,414
So, you're back?

134
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,528
I don't need your help.

135
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,396
Me neither.

136
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,565
Then go home!

137
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,297
You go home.
I lived here way longer than you.

138
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,908
What's that?

139
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,515
This?
It's a... Rubik's cube.

140
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,151
Is that some kind of puzzle?

141
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:56,643
Yeah.

142
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,843
Oh...

143
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,929
You want to try it?

144
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,032
You can give it back tomorrow.

145
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,401
I might not be here
tomorrow.

146
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,769
You can return it...
the day after tomorrow, try it?

147
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,422
How do you play that?

148
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,825
You want each side
to be a solid color.

149
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,658
Like this.

150
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,024
Hey, you smell funny.

151
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,867
Aren't you cold?

152
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,870
- No.
- Why not?

153
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,669
I guess...
I've forgotten how.

154
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,314
See you tomorrow.

155
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,680
Mh-hm.

156
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,998
Ohh...

157
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:09,224
<i>The legal issue
is really interesting, you know?</i>

158
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,524
<i>- I enjoy talking about it.
- Yeah...</i>

159
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,724
Joche...

160
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,694
Thanks for another night 
 of friendship and happiness.

161
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,329
Good night, old buddy.

162
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,001
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

163
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:24,399
You're the best, Jocke.

164
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,899
No, you are.

165
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,799
Help.

166
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,121
Help me.

167
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,921
Help me.

168
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,297
Hello?

169
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:02,435
Please, help me.

170
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,837
Is something wrong?

171
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,848
Are you hurt?

172
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,526
- Can you get up?
- No...

173
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:28,326
I...

174
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:29,826
can't...

175
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,603
Ahh... come here...

176
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,140
I'll carry you.
Take you to a phone.

177
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,842
Careful... careful.

178
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,508
You don't weigh
a thing...

179
00:26:38,276 --> 00:26:39,944
<i>...never again...</i>

180
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,544
- Gösta?
- Gösta!

181
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,981
- It's been ages.
- I haven't seen you all year.

182
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:00,051
- It's Jocke...
- What?

183
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,046
- Poor Jocke...
- Hey, what's happening?

184
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:07,291
I was out... out on the balcony...

185
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:12,956
- and I saw... I saw Jocke... and this kid.
- Calm down! Where was the kid?

186
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:15,936
It was around here somewhere.

187
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:18,736
<i>- Somewhere?
- Where? Somewhere?</i>

188
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,536
I don't see anything here.

189
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,768
- There's nothing here!
- Hey, move it!

190
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,848
Damn!
What the hell is this?

191
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:35,985
- Oh, my god.
- It's blood!

192
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,951
Who the hell did this?

193
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,204
Whew...

194
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,497
How did you do it?

195
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,034
I was turning it.

196
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,741
Do I smell better now?

197
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,625
Um... what is your name?

198
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,628
Eli.

199
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,263
What's yours?

200
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:10,367
- Eli?
- Yeah.

201
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,769
I'm... I'm Oskar.

202
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,273
How old are you?

203
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:20,232
Twelve... more or less.

204
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,513
And you?

205
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,283
12 years, eight months,
and nine days.

206
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,577
What'd you mean,
more or less?

207
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,624
When is your birthday?

208
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,916
I don't remember.

209
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:41,298
Don't... you...
ever celebrate your birthday?

210
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:45,166
Your parents...
they've got to know.

211
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,043
Don't you get any
birthday presents?

212
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,173
No.

213
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,689
You can have this if you want.

214
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,886
- Hm...
- It's yours.

215
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:15,866
- I don't get how you did this.
- Hm...

216
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,360
You want me to show you?

217
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,441
Here... go ahead.

218
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,977
You start at the corners...

219
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,743
and then this side...
has to go...

220
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:34,743
like this.

221
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,763
"...Dodging in and out of the shadows, 
 running rapidly and silently...

222
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,695
...and hiding from the sun...

223
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,238
...They returned quickly, between 

224
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,808
...moans and curses, to care for the portal..."

225
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:02,075
"Bilbo, had escaped".

226
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,653
Well...
that's all for today!

227
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,984
Has everyone handed in their slip,
for the field trip on Thursday?

228
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,153
It's not to late.

229
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,796
- Oskar, aren't you done?
- No, not quite, I got more things to do.

230
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:35,996
Hurry up, Conny.

231
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,513
Samuel Morse

232
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,771
What were you writing down?

233
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,044
What'd you mean?

234
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,743
Let me see it!

235
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,055
No.

236
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,047
What'd you mean, no?
I want it!

237
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:56,153
Who's gonna tell 
 your mommy now?

238
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,752
Wait for me!

239
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,687
Oskar!

240
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:06,087
Piggy!

241
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,029
I fell down during recess.

242
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,644
I tripped on a rock.

243
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,647
Oh, honey.

244
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:27,978
You've got to watch
your step, okay?

245
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,718
Hm'hm?

246
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,831
Short... long...
long... short, long.

247
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,468
Short... long...
long... short... long.

248
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:46,469
Short... long...
long... short... long.

249
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,961
Exactly.

250
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,998
Here.

251
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,878
What happened?

252
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,941
There.

253
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:09,087
Oh... some class mates.

254
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,898
Where do you go to school?

255
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,437
Oskar... listen.

256
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:23,006
- Hm?
- Hit back.

257
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,667
- Hmm...
- You've never hit back...

258
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,775
have you?

259
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:36,886
- Uh'uh.
- So, do it... hit back!

260
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,378
Hard.

261
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,626
There are three of them.

262
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,128
Hit back even harder!

263
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,164
Hit 'em with more force,
than you dare.

264
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,433
Then they'll stop.

265
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,434
- But if...
- Then I'll help you.

266
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,202
I can do that.

267
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:14,319
Come.

268
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,925
Come on.

269
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:34,125
<i>Move over.</i>

270
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:37,925
<i>- Move, I have to be here.
- Why?</i>

271
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:43,318
Go on.

272
00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:00,899
Let's see...
Short, long...

273
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,912
S~s...

274
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,848
O~o...

275
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,814
A~a...

276
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,623
V...
G...

277
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,859
Keep your distance!

278
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,028
Not too close, not too far.

279
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,656
Keep the right distance!

280
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,237
Nice and steady.

281
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:40,236
Yes?

282
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:49,908
Excuse me, Mr. Avila 
the school fitness program...

283
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,355
could I sign up for it?

284
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,491
You don't have to sign up,
just be there at seven.

285
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:58,961
Are you thinking of doing it?

286
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:01,231
- Yeah.
- Good!

287
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,929
if you practice you can get
at least 50 times stronger.

288
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,336
See you.

289
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,246
Wait a second...

290
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,080
Mixed.

291
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,517
Eli.

292
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,731
No.

293
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,465
Alright.

294
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:48,771
I can... try one.

295
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,850
Are you alright?

296
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,841
Oskar...

297
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,537
do you like me?

298
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,914
Yeah, a lot.

299
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,183
If I wasn't a girl...

300
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:04,211
would you like me?

301
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,619
I suppose so.

302
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,225
Why you asking?

303
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:49,925
Oskar!
Hello, poor son!

304
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:54,462
- You're early.
- Hi, Dad!

305
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:28,598
There are people
who know my face...

306
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,932
who know
that I live here with you.

307
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:38,305
- Maybe you shouldn't.
- Whatever else am I good for?

308
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,481
Could you do
one thing for me?

309
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:50,016
Would you not see that...
boy tonight, alright?

310
00:44:50,017 --> 00:44:52,916
- Please!
- Hmm...

311
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:30,953
What the...?

312
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,846
- Let's check if Matte is still around?
- Alright.

313
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,271
Hey! Matte?

314
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,764
You can jack off at home!

315
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:56,273
Matte, hurry up.

316
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,480
- What're you up too?
- Matte!

317
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,753
- Hey!
- Where am I?

318
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:10,953
<i>What'd he's doing
in there, man?</i>

319
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:14,388
Let me down!

320
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:15,988
Matte?

321
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:18,967
Help!

322
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:21,967
Hey, open the door, man.

323
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,940
Help!

324
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:31,440
Help!

325
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:34,850
Matte?

326
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,652
- Open the door!
- Help!

327
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,019
Open the stupid door.

328
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,087
Help!

329
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,458
- Open the goddam door! 
- Help!

330
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,694
Help!

331
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,901
- Help!
- Open the door Matte.

332
00:47:53,302 --> 00:47:55,964
Help me!

333
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,768
Help?

334
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,716
Help!

335
00:48:10,783 --> 00:48:12,455
- What the...?
- God...

336
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,715
- What happened?
- Cut me down.

337
00:48:14,716 --> 00:48:16,755
What're doing up there?

338
00:48:16,756 --> 00:48:18,516
Come on, let's get him down.

339
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,629
Eli.

340
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:02,766
<i>...police, is coming as party
chairman and plead diversion.</i>

341
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,006
<i>Now on the local news, an unidentified
man was arrested yesterday...</i>

342
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:08,840
<i>charged with murder
and attempted murder, in...</i>

343
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:12,809
<i>Vällingby, near Stockholm.
The mans self-inflicted facial wounds...</i>

344
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,179
<i>made it impossible 
 to identify him.</i>

345
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,749
<i>And now in sports:
Severy Vagstead to report.</i>

346
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,749
The Canadians
unfortunately lost in a heart-breaker...

347
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,717
Come on in.
Remote door.

348
00:50:46,242 --> 00:50:47,810
Hello.

349
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,112
Hello.

350
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,948
I'm looking for my pappa.

351
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,518
Is he here?

352
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,749
What's his name?

353
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,490
He is sick.

354
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,186
The police took him.

355
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,287
Do you know where he is?

356
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,333
He's on 7th floor, sweety.

357
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,203
But that's a restricted ward.

358
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,405
- I could call him...
- No.

359
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,500
That's alright.

360
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,841
Oh, you poor thing.

361
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,481
Invite me in?

362
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,679
What Kid?

363
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,892
Why would a kid kill, Jocke?

364
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,962
Jocke was the sweetest guy
there ever was.

365
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,064
Why? I don't know.

366
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:33,001
I'd like to tear
that damn kid apart.

367
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,671
A kid alone
couldn't have done it.

368
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,539
Oskar!

369
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,808
May I come in?

370
00:54:48,908 --> 00:54:50,208
Mm...

371
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,154
- Don't look at me.
- Mm...

372
00:54:56,124 --> 00:54:58,054
You have to say I can come in


373
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:02,026
You can come in.

374
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,832
Close your eyes.

375
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,853
How did you get in?

376
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,723
I flew.

377
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,459
Yeah, sure.

378
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,228
You're as cold
as ice.

379
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:37,026
Are you wearing anything?

380
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,593
Sorry.

381
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,834
Is that coarse?

382
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,772
No.

383
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,448
"Hickory, Dickory, Shock...

384
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:56,476
How many fingers
am I tapping you with?"

385
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,520
Eli...

386
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,060
What do you think of going steady?

387
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,704
What'd you mean?

388
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,673
Well...

389
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:22,642
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?

390
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,775
Oskar...
I'm not a girl.

391
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,812
Oh...

392
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,950
Well, do you wanna
go steady or not?

393
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,621
Can't we just keep on
the way we are?

394
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,002
I guess.

395
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:50,336
Do we do anything special
when we go steady?

396
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,832
No.

397
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:58,143
So, everything is the same?

398
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,317
Yeah.

399
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,657
- Then... we'll go steady.
- Yeah?

400
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,685
We'll never be alone.

401
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:17,257
- Really?
- Mh'hm.

402
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,538
Good.

403
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,148
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.

404
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,742
Your Eli.

405
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,061
Listen up!

406
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:30,866
The lower grades 
will skate with me.

407
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:36,896
Middle school... they get
to skate totaly free!

408
00:59:36,897 --> 00:59:38,106
Ahh...

409
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,709
Watch out for her holes!

410
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,912
Over there!

411
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:43,912
Understood?

412
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,514
Avila...

413
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:49,975
- I think you meant THE holes. 
- The holes.

414
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:53,575
I meant to say the holes!

415
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:55,685
You wanna go play?

416
00:59:55,686 --> 00:59:57,885
Beware of the hole in the ice!

417
01:00:02,195 --> 01:00:05,885
Hey, Conny...
Over here.

418
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,885
So, you wanna go swimming?

419
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:06,185
No.

420
01:01:07,995 --> 01:01:09,685
- Mr. Avila?
- Yeah.

421
01:01:09,686 --> 01:01:13,064
Mr. Avila...
I have to go pee.

422
01:01:13,065 --> 01:01:16,016
- Go behind a tree.
- On the ice?

423
01:01:16,017 --> 01:01:18,429
What does it matter?
You make a new ice.

424
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,829
Yellow ice.

425
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:24,331
What's that stick for?

426
01:01:25,032 --> 01:01:28,568
To hit you with...
If you try anything.

427
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:32,065
Are you a brave pig
all of a sudden?

428
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,965
Look little pig,
I'm gonna push you.

429
01:01:40,966 --> 01:01:43,034
And you aren't gonna do a thing.

430
01:01:43,035 --> 01:01:45,169
Isn't that so?

431
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,504
Little piggy...

432
01:01:47,505 --> 01:01:50,397
...watch out...
we're gonna get you...

433
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:52,997
...we're gonna get you now...

434
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,570
Look.

435
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,383
- Come on.
- Huh...

436
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:06,220
Mr. Avila... freak out,
I don't...

437
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:10,221
Are we suppose to...
just let 'em stand there?

438
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:26,921
Avila!

439
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:30,198
What's going on?

440
01:02:30,265 --> 01:02:32,343
Oskar!
What did you do?

441
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:03,028
Come on.

442
01:03:24,853 --> 01:03:28,584
POLICE

443
01:03:29,688 --> 01:03:32,926
<i>What do think I do all day?
Just sit around and...</i>

444
01:03:33,127 --> 01:03:35,187
<i>Not likely...</i>

445
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:38,726
<i>What?... No!
Oh, yes... he's a dreamer...</i>

446
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:41,867
<i>Am I suppose to tell them
my son doesn't have a father?</i>

447
01:03:41,868 --> 01:03:44,826
Yes, it is.
Here he comes.

448
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:47,939
They called from school.

449
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,708
You better talk to your father...

450
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:55,478
Hello?

451
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:58,047
I'm fine.

452
01:03:58,048 --> 01:04:01,013
- Oh...
- I don't know.

453
01:04:01,152 --> 01:04:03,921
Are you're back working?

454
01:04:04,922 --> 01:04:07,019
We'll see.

455
01:04:46,288 --> 01:04:48,582
Hello, Oskar.

456
01:04:49,158 --> 01:04:51,948
So, you did go swimming
after all.

457
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:55,125
I'm only kidding.

458
01:05:16,781 --> 01:05:19,005
We're not really allowed
to be here.

459
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:25,017
But some of the bigger kids 
 come here anyway.
460
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,861
Eli, you know what? Today...

461
01:05:29,862 --> 01:05:32,125
They tried to push me
on the ice...

462
01:05:32,126 --> 01:05:34,534
But I... I had this stick...

463
01:05:34,535 --> 01:05:37,303
- and I hit Conny so hard...
- Oskar...

464
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:39,571
that he had to go
to the E.R.

465
01:05:39,572 --> 01:05:44,371
His head was bleeding so much,
everyone saw it... huh...

466
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,203
Oskar?

467
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:52,001
Yeah?

468
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:53,971
Well done!

469
01:06:46,289 --> 01:06:49,055
What did you want us to do?

470
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:25,523
We're going to mix.

471
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:28,555
It doesn't hurt.

472
01:07:31,162 --> 01:07:33,925
All you need to do
is prick your finger.

473
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:57,072
Eli?

474
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,921
Get out!

475
01:08:06,225 --> 01:08:08,252
Leave!

476
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,594
<i>They had to use a chain-saw,
to get him out.</i>

477
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:56,532
- Go tell the cops your story!
- What's your problem, Gösta?

478
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:58,234
They'll ask me questions.

479
01:08:58,235 --> 01:08:59,803
What do you mean?

480
01:09:00,004 --> 01:09:02,295
They might shove me
into one of those rooms...

481
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:06,908
and shine bright lights
into my eyes...

482
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:10,712
- Jocke and I, we were this close...
- I'm sorry, but I can't...

483
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,247
like this!

484
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:18,117
Gösta, it's your duty,
you witnessed a crime.

485
01:09:18,118 --> 01:09:20,952
God...

486
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,848
We go on...
about what a good he was...

487
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:29,252
And now that he's gone
I have nothing.

488
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:34,834
- Nothing left...
- Poor, Lacke...

489
01:09:34,835 --> 01:09:36,667
Stop it! Fuck you!
Don't "Poor Lacke" me...

490
01:09:36,668 --> 01:09:39,906
You don't get it!
You're so damn cold.

491
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:42,808
No one get's it.

492
01:09:42,809 --> 01:09:46,912
Ginia,
you don't understand a thing!

493
01:09:47,307 --> 01:09:49,456
I'm feelin' so bad about this.

494
01:09:54,382 --> 01:09:56,441
- Ah...
- Ow!...

495
01:09:59,086 --> 01:10:01,985
- Very subtle, Lacke.
- Ah...

496
01:10:04,023 --> 01:10:07,949
Ginia!
Please... wait up!

497
01:10:15,066 --> 01:10:17,994
Can't we at least
talk about it?

498
01:10:25,211 --> 01:10:28,076
Come on...

499
01:10:52,764 --> 01:10:54,498
No...

500
01:10:54,499 --> 01:10:56,959
Get off of her!

501
01:10:57,499 --> 01:10:59,959
Now!
Hey!

502
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:03,471
Get off of her!

503
01:11:07,845 --> 01:11:11,371
Oh... Oh, come on, sweetheart...

504
01:11:11,372 --> 01:11:13,082
Okay then, Ginia.

505
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:15,082
- Hey, wait up!
- I love you.

506
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:18,174
- You took my lighter, huh?
- Ginia?

507
01:12:09,014 --> 01:12:10,951
What?...

508
01:12:21,814 --> 01:12:24,851
It's so hot...

509
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,932
Nah...

510
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:36,332
- I didn't see that coming.
- You never do.

511
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,905
Hm'hm.
Well, this time I'll get you.

512
01:13:39,906 --> 01:13:41,643
- Dream on.
- Hm'hm.

513
01:13:41,906 --> 01:13:43,843
- You go first.
- Sure.

514
01:13:44,906 --> 01:13:46,343
All right.

515
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:57,446
- Well, look who's here.
- Good evening to you all.

516
01:14:00,224 --> 01:14:02,226
Hmm...

517
01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:07,461
Looks like...
you're having a good time.

518
01:14:07,462 --> 01:14:08,957
That's right.

519
01:14:11,466 --> 01:14:13,633
Well, Oskar is here.

520
01:14:13,634 --> 01:14:14,933
Hm'hm.

521
01:14:24,234 --> 01:14:25,933
Be back.

522
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:31,073
Dad?

523
01:14:31,474 --> 01:14:33,173
It's your turn.

524
01:14:34,285 --> 01:14:36,378
Yes, yes..
we have a guest.

525
01:14:37,154 --> 01:14:39,454
Nice and cozy in here.

526
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:49,092
We have all something.

527
01:15:24,527 --> 01:15:28,363
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.

528
01:15:28,364 --> 01:15:32,764
Your Eli.

529
01:16:24,176 --> 01:16:25,311
It ended up all wrong.

530
01:16:25,312 --> 01:16:29,914
It was suppose to be great,
but their calculations were all wrong.

531
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:32,285
It was all wrong from the start.

532
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:34,085
It just got worse...

533
01:16:34,086 --> 01:16:36,254
when he cleared these buildings,
I... I was so confused...

534
01:16:36,255 --> 01:16:39,010
And I couldn't tell
what was going on...

535
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:42,892
It just got so much worse,
I don't know what to do now...

536
01:16:42,893 --> 01:16:44,993
Busy night.

537
01:16:44,994 --> 01:16:46,693


538
01:16:46,694 --> 01:16:48,657
Come on in!

539
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:08,976
Ginia?
Where the hell have you been?

540
01:17:09,318 --> 01:17:11,918
- What's going on?
- No!

541
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:14,753
I've been so damn worried!
What's wrong?

542
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:16,655
- What's wrong with you?
- No!

543
01:17:16,656 --> 01:17:18,957
- What's going on?
- Leave me alone!

544
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:20,057
- Hey...
- Stop!

545
01:17:20,058 --> 01:17:21,557
- Ginia!
- Stop right now!

546
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:24,485
Come on!
Tell me what happened?

547
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:26,930
- What is it?
- Let go of me!

548
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:30,960
What the hell is wrong
with these cat's?

549
01:17:34,136 --> 01:17:36,097
Gösta,
what the hell is going on?

550
01:17:40,136 --> 01:17:42,097
Get away!
Help!

551
01:17:45,836 --> 01:17:47,897
Come on!

552
01:18:14,536 --> 01:18:17,573
Oskar... is that you?

553
01:18:17,574 --> 01:18:20,870
Yeah.

554
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:24,055
Are you a vampire?

555
01:19:28,633 --> 01:19:31,034
I live off blood.

556
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:34,266
Yes.

557
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:37,529
Are you...

558
01:19:39,009 --> 01:19:41,599
dead?

559
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,046
No.

560
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:47,737
Can't you tell?

561
01:19:48,147 --> 01:19:49,937
Um...

562
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,587
but...

563
01:19:54,288 --> 01:19:56,678
how old are you?

564
01:19:58,424 --> 01:20:01,325
I'm twelve.

565
01:20:01,326 --> 01:20:05,057
But I've been twelve
for a long time.

566
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:33,476
Are you like... poor?

567
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:37,891
- You see that egg over there?
- Yeah.

568
01:20:37,892 --> 01:20:42,293
If you sold it you could buy
a whole nuclear power plant.

569
01:20:42,294 --> 01:20:44,029
For real.

570
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:48,260
Yeah... sure.

571
01:20:51,903 --> 01:20:55,201
Put your finger on it.

572
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:10,085
Huh...

573
01:21:10,986 --> 01:21:14,621
where did those rings
come from?

574
01:21:20,429 --> 01:21:23,095
I'm going home.

575
01:21:23,096 --> 01:21:26,496
I have fresh papers
to distribute tomorrow.

576
01:21:26,499 --> 01:21:30,301
- To earn money?
- Hm'hm.

577
01:21:32,438 --> 01:21:35,064
I can give you money.

578
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:43,613
Here.

579
01:21:43,614 --> 01:21:45,642
Take it.

580
01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:53,748
You stole this!

581
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:57,893
From the people
you killed, right?

582
01:21:57,894 --> 01:22:00,293
- It was given to me.
- By who?

583
01:22:00,294 --> 01:22:04,088
By different people.

584
01:22:07,034 --> 01:22:10,399
I want to go home now.

585
01:22:12,904 --> 01:22:15,002
If you let me.

586
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:32,010
The time has come to sell this. 
 Dad's stamp collection.

587
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:34,710
What a guy.

588
01:22:34,756 --> 01:22:37,250
One stamp...

589
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:42,931
80,000.

590
01:22:44,732 --> 01:22:47,067
80 grand!

591
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:51,569
When I find the right buyer
I won't except any less.

592
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,564
80 thousand...
That's it.

593
01:22:54,565 --> 01:22:56,911
Then we'll buy this pretty cabin.

594
01:22:56,912 --> 01:22:59,311
The country-side
is so beautiful.

595
01:22:59,317 --> 01:23:02,082
The two of us can live there.

596
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:04,082
Listen to the birds sing.

597
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,216
Grow our own vegetables.

598
01:23:06,217 --> 01:23:09,282
And taking long walks...
in the afternoon sun.

599
01:23:11,355 --> 01:23:14,923
Lacke, you gotta help me, please!

600
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:18,759
Yeah, sure.

601
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,129
- That kid.
- Yeah?

602
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,863
She must have infected me.

603
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:29,833
I don't wanna live.

604
01:24:26,951 --> 01:24:28,751
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

605
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:32,156
Things are looking up...
you can probably go home today.

606
01:24:33,157 --> 01:24:35,250
Won't that be nice?

607
01:24:35,993 --> 01:24:38,694
I'll just unlock this...

608
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:40,897
take a little blood sample.

609
01:24:41,998 --> 01:24:43,788
There.

610
01:24:46,834 --> 01:24:49,969
- Listen?
- Ah'ha?

611
01:24:49,971 --> 01:24:54,972
Could you open
the blinds for me?

612
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:57,909
Sure.
No problem.

613
01:25:10,388 --> 01:25:13,122
Hand over your cap.

614
01:25:13,123 --> 01:25:16,022
- Do it!
- What's your problem?

615
01:25:16,023 --> 01:25:17,322
Give it to me!

616
01:25:17,427 --> 01:25:20,055
What're you?
Some kinda clod?

617
01:25:20,056 --> 01:25:22,055
- Hey?
- Go for it, Conny.

618
01:25:22,056 --> 01:25:24,055
- Let me go!
- You can do it!

619
01:25:24,056 --> 01:25:25,955
- Get off me!
- Come on!

620
01:25:25,956 --> 01:25:27,955
You're a big guy.

621
01:25:28,637 --> 01:25:30,872
- Hey.
- Hi. What's up?

622
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:33,007
Hey, can I borrow your keys?

623
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:35,142
- What for?
- I wanna get home.

624
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:37,211
Alright...

625
01:25:37,412 --> 01:25:39,403
- Here.
- Thanks.

626
01:25:39,404 --> 01:25:41,003
- Hm'hm.
- See you later.

627
01:25:41,004 --> 01:25:44,103
Who sent you home? 
Well, well...

628
01:25:44,104 --> 01:25:47,303
- That's your stuff, Conny.
- What're you laughing at?

629
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:13,936
- Hey.
- Hi.

630
01:26:22,082 --> 01:26:25,379
You have to invite me in.

631
01:26:25,384 --> 01:26:28,545
What happens if I don't?

632
01:26:29,821 --> 01:26:31,981
What happens if you walk in anyway?

633
01:26:32,157 --> 01:26:35,123
Is there something
in the way?

634
01:26:39,129 --> 01:26:42,461
Tsk-tsk-tsk...

635
01:26:44,767 --> 01:26:48,463
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

636
01:27:40,682 --> 01:27:41,881
No!

637
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:44,375
You can come in!

638
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:59,524
Who are you?

639
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:03,866
I'm like you.

640
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:06,335
- What'd you mean?
- Well...

641
01:28:06,336 --> 01:28:10,139
What're you staring at?

642
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:13,108
Are you staring at me?

643
01:28:13,109 --> 01:28:18,204
So, squeal!
Squeal!

644
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:23,348
That was one of the first words
I heard you say.

645
01:28:26,888 --> 01:28:28,953
I don't kill people.

646
01:28:28,954 --> 01:28:30,355
No...

647
01:28:30,356 --> 01:28:33,324
But you'd like it...
648
01:28:33,325 --> 01:28:35,193
if you could.

649
01:28:35,194 --> 01:28:38,163
To get revenge.

650
01:28:38,164 --> 01:28:40,397
Right?

651
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:42,198
Yes.

652
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:45,827
Oskar, I do it
because I have to.

653
01:28:48,472 --> 01:28:52,065
Be me for a while.

654
01:29:14,727 --> 01:29:17,495
Oskar...

655
01:29:17,496 --> 01:29:21,431
please, be me.

656
01:30:12,943 --> 01:30:16,877
You can borrow one
of my mom's dresses.

657
01:30:51,142 --> 01:30:52,808
Oskar!

658
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:54,808
Let me in.

659
01:30:58,742 --> 01:31:01,998
What are you up to?
Let me in!

660
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:04,510
I'm in the bathroom.
I'm coming!

661
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:08,410
Let me in, Oskar!

662
01:32:37,732 --> 01:32:40,833
Hi! I'm in the bathroom.
Please don't come in.

663
01:32:40,834 --> 01:32:43,936
Would you like 
to meet me tonight?

664
01:32:43,937 --> 01:32:47,312
I like you very much.
Your Eli.

665
01:36:33,925 --> 01:36:37,395
Can't see a thing...

666
01:36:37,534 --> 01:36:38,701
No!

667
01:36:38,702 --> 01:36:40,362
Huh?

668
01:36:47,811 --> 01:36:49,010
Let go!

669
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:53,575
Let go of me!

670
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,844
Thank you.

671
01:37:46,959 --> 01:37:50,426
Oskar...

672
01:37:53,465 --> 01:37:57,332
I have to go away.

673
01:39:17,703 --> 01:39:23,002
Who Killed That Man
In The Ice?

674
01:41:26,378 --> 01:41:28,280
Hello.

675
01:41:29,281 --> 01:41:32,015
- Is that you, Oskar?
- Yes.

676
01:41:32,016 --> 01:41:33,949
It's me, Martin.

677
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:37,179
Mr. Avila wanted to know
if you're coming tonight.

678
01:41:39,055 --> 01:41:40,989
Why?

679
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:43,981
I guess...
He just wanted to know.

680
01:41:45,027 --> 01:41:47,762
Maybe he wants you
to be there.

681
01:41:48,763 --> 01:41:51,364
I'm... really not sure.

682
01:41:51,365 --> 01:41:53,200
It was good by the way...

683
01:41:53,201 --> 01:41:55,868
what you did to Conny.

684
01:41:56,169 --> 01:41:57,703
He had it coming.

685
01:41:58,704 --> 01:42:01,506
That's really good, man!

686
01:42:01,507 --> 01:42:03,875
- Do you think so?
- So...

687
01:42:03,976 --> 01:42:07,801
are you coming tonight
to practice?

688
01:42:07,879 --> 01:42:11,938
POOL

689
01:42:31,265 --> 01:42:34,527
Well, Oskar.

690
01:42:34,935 --> 01:42:37,232
Hi.

691
01:42:37,233 --> 01:42:39,232
Alright...

692
01:42:39,233 --> 01:42:43,136
-This is how some of you get hurt,
You can't leave this here, okay?
-Hey Oskar.

693
01:42:43,137 --> 01:42:46,936
when are they going to learn,
these kids just don't get it.

694
01:42:48,946 --> 01:42:51,615
Hey.

695
01:42:51,616 --> 01:42:54,810
Come, we start with
upper aerobics.

696
01:43:06,896 --> 01:43:09,459
Hurry up!

697
01:43:21,675 --> 01:43:23,409
Come on, Oskar!

698
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:26,912
Let's go!
One, two, one, two...

699
01:43:26,913 --> 01:43:29,003
Move your body!

700
01:43:38,856 --> 01:43:42,517
What? What?
You do that.

701
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:00,903
Call the fire department!
Fire! Fire!

702
01:44:00,904 --> 01:44:02,103
Fire!

703
01:44:23,594 --> 01:44:26,052
Beat it!

704
01:44:26,663 --> 01:44:29,053
Clear out!

705
01:45:05,563 --> 01:45:09,031
You know who I am?

706
01:45:09,499 --> 01:45:11,400
- Yeah.
- Good.

707
01:45:11,401 --> 01:45:13,335
Then you get it.

708
01:45:13,336 --> 01:45:16,166
We're going to have
a little contest.

709
01:45:16,971 --> 01:45:20,496
You stay under water...

710
01:45:21,143 --> 01:45:23,376
for three minutes.

711
01:45:23,377 --> 01:45:27,278
If you do it...
I'll just nick you.

712
01:45:27,514 --> 01:45:30,149
But if you can't...

713
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:33,151
I'll poke one of your eyes out.

714
01:45:33,152 --> 01:45:36,211
An eye for an ear, right?

715
01:45:37,523 --> 01:45:40,624
But... but... but,
that's impossible.

716
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:43,957
That's your problem.

717
01:45:55,937 --> 01:45:59,337
Three minutes.

718
01:45:59,341 --> 01:46:02,070
Better take a deep breath!

719
01:46:03,544 --> 01:46:05,779
Five...

720
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:07,581
four...

721
01:46:07,582 --> 01:46:08,747
three...

722
01:46:08,748 --> 01:46:10,016
two...

723
01:46:10,017 --> 01:46:12,216
one.

724
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:51,818
- Jimmy...
- Shut up!

725
01:46:51,819 --> 01:46:55,985
- Conny, let's go.
- I told you to shut up!


725
01:50:00,819 --> 01:51:55,985
