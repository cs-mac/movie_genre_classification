00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:04,048
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:14,968
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,268
I'm Best Global's Jang Taesu,

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,557
who recently won Businessman of the Year.

5
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:31,518
There are many senior entrepreneurs

6
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:33,347
and colleagues who deserve the award,

7
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:35,128
so I feel a very big responsibility

8
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:37,777
to win this accolade.

9
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:38,957
And it's

10
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:42,448
a great honor to have the position

11
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:45,268
to represent all entrepreneurs.

12
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:50,618
Sitting here brings back

13
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,388
old memories.

14
00:00:56,008 --> 00:01:01,048
I had a friend.

15
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:06,088
He trusted me when I had nothing,

16
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:10,027
and helped me get to where I am today.

17
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,457
He was the president of Taehu Industry,

18
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:16,358
where Best Global began.

19
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:22,027
Kim Sangjun.

20
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:27,668
That was my friend's name.

21
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:32,327
He was naively trusting

22
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:34,427
and honest

23
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,658
even to a fault.

24
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,188
I considered his company

25
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:46,388
as my own,

26
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:49,848
and worked hard.

27
00:01:57,608 --> 00:01:59,207
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

28
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:02,048
How dare you come here!

29
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:05,268
Jang Hyeondo?

30
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:08,228
You're that guy?

31
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,668
How dare you show your face here?

32
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,177
Get out.

33
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,528
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:30,957
That's all I can say.

35
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:47,217
But

36
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:52,527
I

37
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:55,807
stole...

38
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:10,397
All his money.

39
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:55,757
Hello?

40
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:00,328
He did?

41
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,257
Yes.

42
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:10,548
I tricked my trusting friend's family,

43
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,508
and bought their shares for pennies.

44
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:18,567
And I even kicked his family out

45
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,677
from their house.

46
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:28,277
And I used

47
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:31,448
the stolen money

48
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:38,677
and built my own company.

49
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:54,487
Best Global's Jang Taesu made a confession

50
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,577
during the chairman's acceptance speech,

51
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:59,287
at the Korean Businessmen's Association.

52
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:02,218
President Jang Taesu stated he embezzled

53
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,708
Taehu Industry's money on the day his friend

54
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,468
and president Kim Sangjun passed away...

55
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:10,968
Can you make a statement!

56
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:43,237
At the Korean Businessmen's Association's

57
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:45,187
chairman's acceptance speech, Best Global's (KBC NEWS, Breaking News, Best Global's Jang Taesu confesses to embezzlement)

58
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:47,987
Jang Taesu made a surprise announcement.

59
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:49,478
President Jang Taesu...

60
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:52,518
During his speech, he confessed to

61
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:55,017
embezzlement on the day his friend and

62
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:58,497
former president Kim Sangjun passed away.

63
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:02,408
The president of Best Global, Jang Taesu,

64
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:04,768
formerly known as Taehu Industry,

65
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:07,347
won Businessman of the Year Award last January.

66
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:08,858
Controversy over the selection

67
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:12,247
process seems inevitable.

68
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,228
Reporting from the KBA inauguration,

69
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,958
this is Kim Taehyeon of KBS.

70
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:31,077
(Best Global's Jang Taesu Confesses to Embezzlement)

71
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:44,887
What are you staring at?

72
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,148
Oh, my!

73
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,998
Look who it is!

74
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:52,437
The president of Jiwan's company and his son!

75
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:53,717
Right?

76
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,778
Yes, you're right.

77
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:58,798
Oh, my, what happened?

78
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:01,867
This is why you need to date with caution.

79
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,517
Wait, they broke up.

80
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:08,507
Oh, still, Jiwan...

81
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:12,277
It's over.

82
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:17,237
But aren't you relieved?

83
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,668
Maybe Eunsu had a hunch.

84
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,127
Maybe that's why they broke up.

85
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,517
Minja...

86
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:31,427
Right, I'm needed at the big room.

87
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:39,617
(Jang Taesu)

88
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,048
Have you been well?

89
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,427
(The late Kim Sangjun's Grave)

90
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:11,268
I'm sorry I haven't visited much.

91
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,328
Perhaps

92
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:05,118
Sangjun died because of me.

93
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,717
That day

94
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:16,038
I was supposed to meet Sangjun,

95
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,067
and I was late.

96
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:23,707
Sugyeong, why are you doing this?

97
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:26,668
Stay there. I'll be there by five!

98
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,807
Okay?

99
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,278
Everyone had gone home,

100
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:39,817
and when I got back to the office,

101
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:45,217
I saw a pill bottle on the hallway.

102
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:47,647
This is Sangjun's medicine.

103
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,627
Why is this...

104
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,778
Sangjun.

105
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,358
Sangjun!

106
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:06,337
Hey, Sangjun!

107
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:01,087
After that day,

108
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,517
I knew I would regret it

109
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,408
for the rest of my life.

110
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,867
Why didn't you stop then?

111
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:17,648
My mother and I would've forgiven you.

112
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,628
Jiwan and my mother

113
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:24,628
would've considered you

114
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:27,898
as a father and a son,

115
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:31,708
and we could've been a family.

116
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:53,777
Dad!

117
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:32,618
It was all because of my greed.

118
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:38,108
I tried to convince myself I did it for

119
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:43,247
Sugyeong and Hyeondo, but it was my greed.

120
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:50,007
I'm sorry, Seonhui.

121
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,457
If it were Sangjun,

122
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:03,418
he would've forgiven you already.

123
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:12,388
You should

124
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:18,317
free yourself from that guilt.

125
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:27,778
I'm sorry.

126
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,977
Once again, I'm sorry, Seonhui.

127
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,007
How have you been?

128
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:25,598
Lots of things have been bothering me,

129
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:27,057
but I've been alright.

130
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,658
Why? Are you worried?

131
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,068
Yes.

132
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:33,887
I am worried.

133
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:38,397
You have to be firm to run a company.

134
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,997
You said you wanted to be like me.

135
00:15:41,998 --> 00:15:44,018
A businessman like me.

136
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:46,478
Although I'm sure you've changed your mind.

137
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,748
You're soft, just like Sangjun,

138
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:54,208
but you can be firm, so you'll do well.

139
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,508
Sangjun gave me that company,

140
00:15:56,508 --> 00:16:00,038
so giving it to you is the right thing to do.

141
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,898
You developed the company.

142
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:07,627
I believe the only person who can

143
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:09,798
run it well, is you.

144
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,658
If I stay at the company,

145
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:13,457
it will suffer.

146
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,227
So I must resign.

147
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:23,378
Discuss with your elders at home and decide.

148
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:30,098
He's giving you what?

149
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:31,567
Stocks.

150
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,418
And he's resigning from his position.

151
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:37,057
So the stocks,

152
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:39,567
how much are they worth?

153
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:43,638
We didn't do this for the money, Haengsuk.

154
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:47,528
But if we can get it, why not?

155
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:51,767
Seonhui,

156
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:53,077
let's accept it, okay?

157
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:54,048
Just accept it.

158
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:55,398
We can buy a house.

159
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,798
The landlord will ask for extra deposit,

160
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,398
and I'm tired of moving.

161
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:04,018
Jiwan and Eunsu need money to get married.

162
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:06,548
I don't need anything.

163
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,397
I can take care of myself.

164
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:11,477
I can't believe you!

165
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:13,097
We need money for so many things!

166
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:15,817
You don't know how important money is!

167
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,258
We can't just accept it, Haengsuk.

168
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:20,087
Why not?

169
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:22,987
Mom.

170
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:26,357
Your opinion is more important than hers.

171
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:31,178
Seonhui,

172
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:34,148
you and Jiwan decide.

173
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:39,468
Why? When you're the elder of the family?

174
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,518
I wasn't expecting your call.

175
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:09,778
Jiwan told me

176
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:12,397
what you plan on doing.

177
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:16,307
I kept putting it off,

178
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,807
but I couldn't put it off any longer.

179
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:20,788
Right.

180
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:24,567
I was wondering why I haven't heard from you.

181
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:29,028
If you're hesitating,

182
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:30,758
there's no need for it.

183
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:34,607
I'm not saying I'm handing it over to Jiwan now...

184
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:37,367
I'm sorry for cutting you off.

185
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:42,738
No matter how much I think about it,

186
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:46,768
my family can't accept that money from you.

187
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:47,998
But Seonhui...

188
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:51,347
Sangjun gave you that company.

189
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:58,437
He did it because he believed in you.

190
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:05,057
Do you believe in Jiwan

191
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:07,137
as much as Sangjun believed in you?

192
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:11,468
He has the qualities of a good businessman.

193
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:13,908
You're saying he has the potential,

194
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:16,837
but you don't believe in him as much.

195
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:19,447
But I want to give him a chance.

196
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:23,618
I know you feel you owe my family

197
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:25,207
a lot.

198
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,048
But I don't want to take away

199
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:33,807
Jiwan's chance of making it on his own.

200
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:44,477
The moment Sangjun decided to give you

201
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:47,097
the company, it became yours.

202
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:49,398
I'm sure it was the best decision

203
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,757
he could've made for us and the company.

204
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:57,048
So now,

205
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:59,428
the decision is yours.

206
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:06,937
You're the one who love and cherish

207
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,738
Best Global the most.

208
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,088
Were you disappointed?

209
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,857
No.

210
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,508
Okay, Hanseok.

211
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:50,237
There is

212
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:53,807
one last thing you can help me with.

213
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:08,857
Since establishing this company in '93,

214
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:12,647
I was confident I worked harder than anyone.

215
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,177
But now that I look back,

216
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:19,478
I wasn't the only one who built this company.

217
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,768
I believe it was built by

218
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:26,398
everyone sitting here, and the love our

219
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:28,807
customers have shown Best Global.

220
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,378
So I am going to resign from my position,

221
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:39,457
and donate my shares to society.

222
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:47,987
I believe that is the only compensation

223
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:52,128
I can offer the people I hurt.

224
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:57,688
I appreciate all your hard work.

225
00:21:57,688 --> 00:21:59,408
Thank you.

226
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,798
(Best Global's Jang Taesu Donates His Fortune)

227
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:18,998
He could've bought me a few houses first.

228
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:26,397
Seonhui, what did you say?

229
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:27,317
Wait,

230
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:28,798
what are you doing with that money?

231
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,157
Oh, my!

232
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:32,048
Has poverty driven you mad?

233
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:34,387
Seonhui, why don't you

234
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,837
give it to me?

235
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:38,427
I can spend that money

236
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:41,178
in a really good way.

237
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:42,858
- So... / - Minja, you're funny.

238
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:44,048
Wait!

239
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:44,998
I mean...

240
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:46,688
Seonhui!

241
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,908
You know me, don't you?

242
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:52,218
The watermelon is really sweet.

243
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:53,858
That's so much money.

244
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:56,028
How could they give it all up?

245
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:59,278
How can people have no desire for money?

246
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:00,857
Do they like living like this? Like this?

247
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,738
Oh, be quiet.

248
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:05,388
They say they want to make it on their own,

249
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:06,677
so what can I do?

250
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,038
I've seen people who suddenly become rich,

251
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,248
and bad things happen to them.

252
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:15,158
I'm scared of money now.

253
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:16,837
Bad things, yeah right!

254
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:18,728
You never had that kind of money before.

255
00:24:18,728 --> 00:24:21,178
- What? / - If they gave me a bit of it,

256
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:23,788
I could have a decent...

257
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:26,628
Decent what?

258
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:28,538
You need money?

259
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:29,788
Of course I do!

260
00:24:29,788 --> 00:24:31,688
I have lots of things I want to buy!

261
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,868
I don't have any clothes to wear!

262
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:37,217
Oh, when will you ever grow up?

263
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:40,598
I'm sick of stealing Eunsu's clothes.

264
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,207
I'm never going to grow up!

265
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:54,178
Do you have any plans?

266
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,778
I'm just going to take time off.

267
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,208
Okay.

268
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,628
You should do that.

269
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:04,607
What about you?

270
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:07,137
You told me to learn to become a businessman.

271
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:08,607
I should do that now.

272
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:14,228
You established Best Global.

273
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:17,097
The records and journals in your study,

274
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,077
if I take from that,

275
00:25:19,077 --> 00:25:21,018
I'd become the most valuable employee.

276
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,738
I'll start training for real.

277
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,788
I'm going to start from the bottom,

278
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:27,317
and become the head executive director.

279
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:49,968
(Ms. Jeong Sugyeong)

280
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:56,347
Oh, boy.

281
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,028
My son finally grew up,

282
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:00,238
but I have no one to brag to.

283
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:18,587
You come here too often these days.

284
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:22,998
I came before I get too busy to visit.

285
00:26:23,938 --> 00:26:25,778
Do you like it here?

286
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:27,837
Of course I do.

287
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:31,107
Are you here to spy on me?

288
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,697
Are you going to let Father be?

289
00:26:34,248 --> 00:26:36,498
We're divorced, so we're strangers.

290
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:38,067
You don't want to get back together?

291
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,397
No.

292
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,897
I love being legally single and free!

293
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,127
What are you going to do?

294
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:45,538
What do you mean?

295
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:48,887
We'll live this way, seeing other people.

296
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,538
Have you met someone?

297
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:54,357
I am going to.

298
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:56,697
Do you want me to live alone forever?

299
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,388
I mean, I think Father's waiting for you.

300
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:04,307
But it's up to you two.

301
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,007
Who is it?

302
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:31,097
Oh, Ms. Lee!

303
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:32,478
Welcome.

304
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:33,597
Oh.

305
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:35,328
Have you been well?

306
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,298
Yes. What brings you here?

307
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:38,617
Have a seat over there.

308
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:44,897
Here.

309
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,357
What's all this?

310
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:49,298
I heard your husband likes this herb.

311
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:51,188
I had some at home, so I brought it over.

312
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:53,307
Oh, you brought so much.

313
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:56,347
Thank you very much.

314
00:27:56,857 --> 00:28:00,778
Did you have something to tell me?

315
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:10,197
Minja, let's not beat around the bush,

316
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:13,228
and be honest with each other.

317
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,087
What about?

318
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:20,437
Is there something to be honest about?

319
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:23,417
Hi, Mom.

320
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:26,718
I'm on my way home from school.

321
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:29,358
You want to see me now?

322
00:28:30,327 --> 00:28:31,548
Okay.

323
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:32,988
Hi, Grandma.

324
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:37,238
But I can't get off work until later.

325
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,978
I'll be there right after work, then.

326
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:42,128
Bye.

327
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:46,657
You said you wanted to see a movie.

328
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,357
Why all of a sudden?

329
00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:51,988
You're not feeling well?

330
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,488
But why...

331
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:56,618
Okay, Grandma.

332
00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:01,108
Okay. I'll call you later.

333
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:04,508
That's too bad.

334
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,288
I'll see you at home.

335
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,577
But why so suddenly...

336
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:16,647
My grandmother is sick, so she can't come.

337
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:20,217
My mom has to see someone.

338
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:26,407
What should I do with the movie tickets?

339
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:32,678
What time is the movie?

340
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:36,368
There's an hour left.

341
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:40,647
Then cancel them.

342
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,207
One hour is plenty of time.

343
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:47,508
Jiwan!

344
00:29:58,738 --> 00:29:59,888
See?

345
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:02,157
We have to get involved.

346
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:03,807
They are young, so if we give them

347
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:06,317
a nudge, I'm sure they'll get it.

348
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:10,498
Hey!

349
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:14,057
You...

350
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:17,258
Why aren't you on a date?

351
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:23,768
Why did you come here?

352
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,348
You said you were sick,

353
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:28,067
so I came here to get some porridge.

354
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:29,807
Grandma,

355
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,887
don't you have to see a doctor?

356
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:33,867
Let's go. I'll take you.

357
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:35,667
Oh, silly boy!

358
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,437
Taking me to a doctor isn't what I want!

359
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:40,848
Where's Yeongju?

360
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:44,447
So?

361
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:48,077
What do you mean, so?

362
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:50,587
We had shaved ice and said goodbye.

363
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:52,867
I have so much work to do,

364
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:55,307
so stop playing jokes on me.

365
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:56,708
Jokes?

366
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,288
You think I'm doing this

367
00:30:58,288 --> 00:30:59,798
because I have nothing better to do?

368
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:01,798
I can't understand you at all.

369
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,127
We provided you with the perfect chance,

370
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:08,607
so you should see a movie, have dinner...

371
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:11,357
What does he take my daughter for?

372
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:12,447
What's his problem?

373
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:14,018
You're such a pretty girl!

374
00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:16,837
What more does he want?

375
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:19,018
He doesn't want anything.

376
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:22,488
So please stay out of my business.

377
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:24,678
At this rate, you'll die single!

378
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:26,968
I'm really scared for you!

379
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,138
I would love to find out

380
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,007
what you're thinking.

381
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:34,367
It's not like that so stop!

382
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,678
Why are they so dense?

383
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:40,578
They should at least go on a few dates,

384
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:43,857
when I am helping them out.

385
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:44,998
You should give up.

386
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:47,168
Maybe they aren't meant to be together.

387
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,567
Oh, I think I've tried just about,

388
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,127
no, I've tried everything I could

389
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,107
possibly try, given the circumstances.

390
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:58,567
I thought Jiwan was the dense one,

391
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,407
but I think it's Yeongju is the problem.

392
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:02,697
What?

393
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:04,807
What's wrong with Yeongju?

394
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:07,917
She knows how Jiwan is,

395
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:11,307
so she should take charge, and...

396
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:13,107
Oh, my!

397
00:32:13,107 --> 00:32:15,298
That's nonsense, Ms. Lee!

398
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:17,778
Yeongju is a teacher!

399
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:20,688
She's a  lady, so she can't do that.

400
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,048
What if a rumor starts?

401
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:25,197
Well,

402
00:32:25,198 --> 00:32:26,807
to be honest,

403
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:28,798
Jiwan is the problem.

404
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:30,748
He's a man, but he's not bold.

405
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,367
He lacks passion and drive.

406
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,538
He's so lukewarm and bland.

407
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:35,918
What?

408
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,187
Lukewarm and bland?

409
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,438
That's because he's cautious.

410
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:42,647
If he's anymore cautious,

411
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:44,687
he'll be single forever.

412
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:45,838
Wait,

413
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:49,207
are you cursing my grandson?

414
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,827
You started it.

415
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:54,377
Oh, boy.

416
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,347
Why is this coffee so bland?

417
00:32:59,347 --> 00:33:01,028
You said it!

418
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:07,038
Yes.

419
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:08,268
I'm grateful for your offer,

420
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:12,908
but I don't want an honorary position.

421
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:18,707
Yes, tell them I said thanks, but no.

422
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:21,228
Yes. Thank you anyway. Goodbye.

423
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:45,097
Ma'am, get me a glass of water!

424
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:50,307
- With ice, hurry up. / - Ms. Jeong...

425
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:52,688
You're always so slow!

426
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:57,408
Wait,

427
00:33:57,407 --> 00:33:59,897
what are you doing in my house?

428
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:02,327
I was in Seoul, so I dropped by.

429
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:05,998
But you have no business here.

430
00:34:05,998 --> 00:34:11,038
So this house is all you have now?

431
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:12,318
Yes.

432
00:34:12,318 --> 00:34:14,818
I've no business with a poor man.

433
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,758
Good.

434
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:18,617
You have no business with me,

435
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:20,597
and you divorced me.

436
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:24,128
No money, and legally a stranger.

437
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:27,387
You can't hold on to me anymore.

438
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:30,197
I have no intention of holding on to you.

439
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:33,527
But I still came to see you,

440
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,557
I guess you're still attractive.

441
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:39,208
Ma'am!

442
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,838
I asked for ice water ages ago!

443
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:53,488
I'm going to get some rest,

444
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:55,057
so don't make any noise.

445
00:35:01,137 --> 00:35:02,777
What's this?

446
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:07,518
Jeong Sugyeong!

447
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:08,407
We're divorced,

448
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,538
so why is the credit card under my name!

449
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:12,777
Be quiet!

450
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,667
Don't be petty. It's not a lot.

451
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:16,568
I told you I'm taking a nap.

452
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:20,507
What is she trying to do?

453
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:23,237
How much is this?

454
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:25,877
Hundred, thousand,...

455
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:30,298
You went on a shopping spree?

456
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,097
Hi, it's me.

457
00:35:35,097 --> 00:35:35,907
Yes.

458
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:40,907
The advisor position you talked about?

459
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:42,587
I thought about it,

460
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:45,608
and I do kind of want to take it.

461
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:48,248
How much is the annual salary?

462
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,637
Yes, that sounds good.

463
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:53,637
That's a pretty good offer.

464
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:55,197
When should I start?

465
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,557
(1 year later)

466
00:38:13,878 --> 00:38:15,588
Sign there.

467
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,657
Thank you.

468
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:26,438
Thank you very much.

469
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,508
(Yeongju)

470
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:38,758
Hi, Yeongju.

471
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,757
Of course I got the contract.

472
00:38:41,757 --> 00:38:44,487
Tell Mr. Kang not to worry.

473
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:46,867
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

474
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:02,577
(To Kang Yeongju)

475
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:07,418
It's been a year already.

476
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:32,378
Jiwan must have gotten his, too.

477
00:40:00,188 --> 00:40:01,768
Yeongju,

478
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:07,677
you'll read this a year from now,

479
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:17,167
and I want to say I'm waiting for Jiwan.

480
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,728
I'm going to

481
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:23,188
tell Jiwan how I feel about him.

482
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:26,577
Yeongju.

483
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,487
You're writing?

484
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:34,038
You came to get coffee?

485
00:40:57,898 --> 00:41:01,208
My days of being his friend's sister,

486
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,788
perhaps...

487
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:08,677
Perhaps this will be the last time.

488
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:12,568
If he turns me down after I tell him,

489
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:15,498
your heart...

490
00:41:15,498 --> 00:41:18,407
The year you will spend waiting

491
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:21,248
might make Jiwan feel uncomfortable,

492
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:27,597
so you might try to avoid him.

493
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:29,447
Yeongju.

494
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:32,057
You got off work?

495
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:33,918
Yes.

496
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,468
Good. Go home and get some rest.

497
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:39,367
But Yeongju,

498
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:43,298
be brave and tell him.

499
00:42:44,297 --> 00:42:46,247
How desperate...

500
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:47,737
Jiwan!

501
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:49,737
You feel.

502
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:36,877
Enjoy your food.

503
00:43:38,507 --> 00:43:40,077
- All of it is good. / - You like it?

504
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:41,668
It's so delicious.

505
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:44,798
Being the owner suits you better!

506
00:43:44,797 --> 00:43:48,197
You look better now than in your uniform.

507
00:43:48,197 --> 00:43:49,277
You look so much better.

508
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:50,657
Thank you.

509
00:43:50,657 --> 00:43:52,237
Enjoy your food.

510
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:56,697
Oh, you're here! Eunsu, you're here, too?

511
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:58,708
Hello. Congratulations.

512
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:02,087
I heard the headquarters has high hopes

513
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:03,758
for this branch, and I can see why.

514
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:06,577
What high hopes?

515
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,378
But isn't this smaller than my branch?

516
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:10,698
What? You should go in there.

517
00:44:10,697 --> 00:44:12,547
It's much bigger.

518
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:15,407
All you need to do now is make money.

519
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:16,387
Right.

520
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,837
But where is your mother?

521
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,018
- She'll be here soon. / - Okay.

522
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:22,077
You should get something good.

523
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:22,878
Honey.

524
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:24,508
No, no need to escort us.

525
00:44:24,507 --> 00:44:27,347
Go inside and have a seat.

526
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:32,777
Oh, Ms. Lee!

527
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:35,588
- Congratulations. / - Congratulations.

528
00:44:35,588 --> 00:44:39,577
Jiwan didn't send you a plant?

529
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:43,447
He must be very busy with the wedding.

530
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:44,857
Where's Yeongju?

531
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:46,158
She'll be here soon.

532
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:47,847
She went to deliver rice cake upstairs

533
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:49,547
and the parking lot, but she hasn't returned.

534
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:52,758
You're getting more and more beautiful.

535
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,247
Thank you.

536
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,858
You should get something to eat.

537
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:57,597
Yes, please let us have some.

538
00:44:57,597 --> 00:44:59,248
Sure.

539
00:44:59,248 --> 00:45:01,498
Honey, can you take care of them?

540
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,298
Okay.

541
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:08,487
No, it's okay.

542
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:10,577
If there's work, I should go, even on a weekend.

543
00:45:10,577 --> 00:45:13,217
It'll take me a little over an hour.

544
00:45:13,217 --> 00:45:15,467
Honey!

545
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:16,467
Yes?

546
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:18,407
What about my meal?

547
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:21,538
I made side dishes. They're in the fridge.

548
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:23,947
You can just take them out and eat.

549
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:26,427
I can't eat alone.

550
00:45:26,427 --> 00:45:28,708
You won't even let me hire a housekeeper.

551
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,718
Just today. It's only for today.

552
00:45:30,717 --> 00:45:33,067
I'm busy. I'll see you later.

553
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:34,238
I told you to apologize,

554
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:36,607
not donate your entire fortune!

555
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,748
You even sold the house!

556
00:45:38,748 --> 00:45:40,168
I'll be back.

557
00:45:40,168 --> 00:45:42,208
Wait, honey!

558
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,958
Keep next weekend open.

559
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,518
We have to be somewhere.

560
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:48,017
Okay.

561
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:49,237
I'll see you later.

562
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:52,938
Have a nice day.

563
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:02,078
Oh, what's taking her so long?

564
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:03,588
Seonhui!

565
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,198
Yes, mother. I'm coming.

566
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:06,507
What took you so long?

567
00:46:06,507 --> 00:46:07,627
Where's Eunsu?

568
00:46:07,628 --> 00:46:09,548
She's already there.

569
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,037
- She is? / - Yes.

570
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:13,427
- Let's go. / - You look beautiful.

571
00:46:13,427 --> 00:46:15,487
- I do? / - Of course.

572
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:32,898
Is someone getting married today?

573
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:34,288
Yes.

574
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:35,637
Hyeondo, you come up, too.

575
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:36,567
You have to say hi.

576
00:46:36,568 --> 00:46:37,898
Me?

577
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:39,758
But it's hard to get a parking spot here!

578
00:46:39,757 --> 00:46:42,768
Go park and come up. It's the 3rd floor.

579
00:46:42,768 --> 00:46:43,878
Hurry up.

580
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:55,168
Oh, you're here. Thank you.

581
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:59,507
Are you not going to see them ever again?

582
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:01,527
You have to see them, sooner or later.

583
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:03,608
- Let's go. / - Honey.

584
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:04,968
Taesu!

585
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:14,247
Oh...

586
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,258
Welcome.

587
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:18,587
You made it all the way here, so stay.

588
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:20,807
You can't just leave.

589
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:24,207
How much longer do you think I have?

590
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,298
Don't cry at my grave after I'm gone,

591
00:47:27,297 --> 00:47:29,867
and show me your face from time to time.

592
00:47:29,867 --> 00:47:31,757
That's how you can be a good son.

593
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:36,077
We don't have a lot of guests,

594
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:37,978
so go in and have a seat.

595
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:39,217
Let's go.

596
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:45,757
I'm glad you came.

597
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:49,427
Had I left him be, he'd never come see you.

598
00:47:49,927 --> 00:47:53,708
You don't even know whose wedding this is?

599
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:29,088
Eunsu...

600
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:56,128
I'm Han Eunsu.

601
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:04,418
You're my brother's friend,

602
00:49:04,418 --> 00:49:06,478
Jang Hyeondo, right?

603
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:11,498
Kim Jiwan, you're dating now?

604
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,228
I'm Jang Hyeondo.

605
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:15,817
Hello, I'm Han Eunsu.

606
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:19,968
For a picky guy, you sure have

607
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:21,677
average taste in women.

608
00:49:25,077 --> 00:49:27,257
I'm sorry for being average.

609
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:34,867
Right.

610
00:49:35,748 --> 00:49:37,197
Kim Jiwan's friend.

611
00:50:03,117 --> 00:50:04,788
Hello.

612
00:50:04,788 --> 00:50:08,827
Excuse me, can I see the bride's face?

613
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:14,608
I never thought I could be so happy!

614
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:17,738
Where's my most handsome husband?

615
00:50:17,737 --> 00:50:18,987
I want to see him!

616
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:20,947
Darling!

617
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:45,998
Darling!

618
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:49,107
Oh, darling.

619
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:55,298
You become more beautiful every day.

620
00:50:55,297 --> 00:50:59,017
You look just like Won Bin.

621
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:02,697
If I'm Won Bin, you must be Lee Nayoung!

622
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:05,508
I don't know!

623
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:07,027
You must know!

624
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:08,838
Won Bin?

625
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,268
Nayoung, we'll see you later.

626
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,197
Good luck.

627
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:13,947
Everyone agrees!

628
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,478
- You're Won Bin? / - Aunt!

629
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:17,878
- You're Lee Nayoung. / - Aunt!

630
00:51:17,878 --> 00:51:19,117
- Eunha! / - You're here?

631
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,447
Haengsuk, congratulations.

632
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:22,578
Eunha, you look so pretty.

633
00:51:22,577 --> 00:51:23,677
Twirl for me.

634
00:51:23,677 --> 00:51:26,397
You're the prettiest.

635
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:28,688
You're the prettiest in the world today.

636
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:30,577
- Oh! / - She's not.

637
00:51:30,577 --> 00:51:32,117
She's old.

638
00:51:32,737 --> 00:51:34,677
If you're jealous, just say so.

639
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:35,958
Who, me?

640
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,988
I can get married today if I wanted to.

641
00:51:37,987 --> 00:51:39,197
Then go ahead.

642
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,827
She's getting married today.

643
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:57,278
Next is the bride's family photo.

644
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:58,557
Please gather around.

645
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:05,837
Oh, wait.

646
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:09,458
Mr. Photographer, just a second.

647
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,057
Taesu!

648
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:17,697
She wants us in the photo.

649
00:52:17,697 --> 00:52:19,437
Let's go.

650
00:52:19,438 --> 00:52:20,548
But honey,

651
00:52:20,547 --> 00:52:21,927
let's go.

652
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:23,748
It's embarrassing.

653
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,147
Please come.

654
00:52:29,148 --> 00:52:30,698
Everyone's waiting.

655
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:34,617
We'll just leave.

656
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:38,947
Can't you stand in Sangjun's place?

657
00:52:41,018 --> 00:52:46,108
My mother needs a son today.

658
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:50,028
To her and my children,

659
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:52,917
you are Sangjun's replacement.

660
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,387
That's what Sangjun

661
00:52:55,387 --> 00:52:58,607
wanted to ask you to do for us.

662
00:53:03,128 --> 00:53:04,748
- Come. / - Hey,

663
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:05,907
Taesu,

664
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:07,407
what can we do?

665
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,087
We don't have relatives,

666
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:11,968
so you have to fill in for them.

667
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,938
Mother, I...

668
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:19,517
Yes, I'm your mother.

669
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:22,657
I fed you and Sangjun for years and years.

670
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,487
I'm your mom.

671
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:28,857
What are you waiting for?

672
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:30,898
Come and stand with us.

673
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,358
Yeongju, bring your mom and dad.

674
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:34,698
Okay.

675
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,488
Eunha.

676
00:53:46,878 --> 00:53:48,358
Let's go.

677
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,148
Let's go.

678
00:53:52,487 --> 00:53:54,018
Please stand together.

679
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:56,168
Everyone, smile.

680
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,347
Smile.

681
00:54:58,427 --> 00:55:00,297
One, two, three!

682
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,467
