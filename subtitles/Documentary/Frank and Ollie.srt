<i>And just for security purposes,
what hotel were you visiting?</i>

310
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,272

Well, it was a little before your time.

315
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:36,171
I was a saucier there for five years
at the best restaurant, and...

316
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,375
Sometimes, after work, a rich woman
would take me up to her room, and...

317
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,130
The older ones,
they taught me how to fuck.

318
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,348
Oh yeah. So I like that hotel.

have fucked some very beautiful women.

Good ones.

That aren't worried their mommy
is gonna steal me away from 'em.

323

Two hours ago, I would have crawled
through glass for you,

324
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,778

You're only with me
because you can't be alone, right?

328
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,915
I was alone when I met you.

329

Of course not.

He's an old boyfriend of hers,

and we lived with him in Paris

Then he wrote a book about it.

I was sitting in the kitchen,

he had already tied

was that I fell in love with him.

that if I got an abortion...

he called me, and he was begging me
to let him apologize.
