1
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,890
You're dead, bitch!

2
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
What the hell you lookin' at?

3
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,250
Fuckin' hell.

4
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,570
Looks like you are
shit outta luck, beautiful.

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,670
Now I'm gonna give you
your C-section.

6
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,570
You son of a bi...

7
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,770
Eat your vegetables.

8
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,440
She's in here!

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,920
Come on!

10
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,520
Where is she?

11
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,750
There she is!

12
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,990
- get out of here!
- Over there!

13
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,100
Kill her on sight!

14
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,240
Who the fuck is that?

15
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,970
Where the hell is the girl?

16
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,110
get him!

17
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,380
Jesus!

18
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,460
Oh, god! Fuck!

19
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,350
Come on, push. Push!

20
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,650
My hand!

21
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,990
- Do you know what I hate?
- No.

22
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,560
I hate these 40-year-old jack-holes
wearing ponytails.

23
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,160
- That ponytail doesn't make you look hip...
- Come on.

24
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,100
...young, or cool.

25
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,000
OK, it's comin'. Come on.

26
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,100
give me one big push.

27
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,420
What the fuck?

28
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,900
I'm bleedin'. I'm bleedin' out.

29
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,090
Quit squirming,
you're ruining my shot.

30
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,870
What a piece of crap.

31
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,610
We're outta here.

32
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,340
Sorry about
the messy delivery, Mom.

33
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,230
We need quiet.

34
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,420
give Junior something to drink.

35
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,060
Bravo, Mr. Hero. Bravo.

36
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,680
Why you tryin' to kill this woman?

37
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,530
Something funny?

38
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,050
Oh, I was just remembering
a limerick.

39
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,590
Well, "There once was a woman
who was quite begat...

40
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,360
"She had three babies
named Nat, Pat and Tat...

41
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,870
"She said it was fun
at the breeding...

42
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,310
"But found it was hell
in the feeding...

43
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,900
"When she saw there was
no tit for Tat."

44
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,070
You have caused me
no end of trouble.

45
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,480
But now I shall return the favor.

46
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,280
Tit for tat, right?

47
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,650
Now, see, that's the latest thing.

48
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,490
The gun will only fire
when it recognizes...

49
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,120
the thumbprint of the owner.

50
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,530
It makes firearms safer
and it cuts down the crime too.

51
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,690
get him!

52
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,470
Who are you?

53
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,880
Lady, what's your name?

54
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,200
Nice knockers.

55
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,150
god damn it!

56
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,830
Fuck you, ya fuckin' fuckers.

57
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,130
Tit for tat, Mr. Hero.

58
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,790
Tit for tat.

59
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,840
grab his legs.

60
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,240
get him in there. Come on.

61
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,240
I was goin' back for her, boss.

62
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,400
No, I got it.

63
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,180
Hey, I'm not the head honcho
who sits on his hands...

64
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,770
warming them
with his own exhaust...

65
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,220
while everybody else
does the work.

66
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,050
Every second counts, right?

67
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,360
Now, how the heck
did this happen, huh?

68
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,030
Everything was goin' smooth
at the safe house...

69
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,900
...when the woman draws a gun.

70
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,930
I mean, who expects a pregnant
lady to pull a piece on ya, eh?

71
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,270
And who was this man
who was with her?

72
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,710
I don't know.

73
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,680
After the woman escaped,
we tracked her here.

74
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,200
This guy, he was hangin' around...

75
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,480
at the bus stop.

76
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,380
I mean, so we decided
that we'd deal with him later...

77
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,820
but we go after the woman...

78
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,910
he gets in on the action. You know?

79
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,250
He took a gun,
he started shootin' at us,

80
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,720
and that's...
that's when y...

81
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,090
- Oh. OK.
...you arrived.

82
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,090
Take it easy. Sit down.

83
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,290
All right.

84
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,560
Oh, you all right?

85
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,190
OK.

86
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,790
Are you tryin' to tell me...

87
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,290
that some bum
came to her rescue?

88
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,360
Well, well, well,
this is a fine mess, huh?

89
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,770
I won't make
this mistake again.

90
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,900
Well, I got a piece of lead
in my butt as a reminder.

91
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,970
OK.

92
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,680
I can appreciate that.

93
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,940
My ass!

94
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,410
And let that be a reminder
never to fail me again.

95
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,110
Damn.

96
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,950
Don't make me kill you
to get the baby.

97
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,520
Back off.

98
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,710
Sweetie, this deal is almost done.

99
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,180
Look, I've already booked
my flight home.

100
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,040
OK?

101
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,670
OK.

102
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,710
I love you too.

103
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,580
Yeah. Bye-bye.

104
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,350
You know why a gun
is better than a wife?

105
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,250
Don't know.

106
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,820
Well, you can put
a silencer on a gun.

107
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,270
Sir, we spotted the target...

108
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,270
at Third and Jefferson heading
toward the park.

109
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,330
Turn us around.

110
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,450
Come on! Dad!

111
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,080
- Come on.
- All right.

112
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,210
Who's Daddy's little girl?

113
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,340
Don't worry, kid.
Someone good'll find you.

114
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,020
Oh, my god, look at this.

115
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,920
Someone left a baby.

116
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,060
Oops.

117
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,690
Fuck me sideways.

118
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,490
Welcome back, Mr. Smith.

119
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,020
Where's Quintana?

120
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,090
Wait, Smith, Mistress Donna's
with a customer.

121
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,160
Wait, you can't go up there.

122
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,530
Oh, yeah, baby.

123
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,330
- Smith?
- You like that, huh?

124
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,400
Besides, I thought Mistress Mary
was more your type.

125
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,240
You can't go up there.

126
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,510
Come 'ere!

127
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,240
Sorry, pal, the bar's closed.

128
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,390
Wait your turn, Smith.

129
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,730
There's plenty to go around.

130
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,730
Not for me, thanks.
I'm lactose intolerant.

131
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,170
Just tell me
what you want, Smith.

132
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,170
Kinky.

133
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,010
I want you to take care of this
baby for a while.

134
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,310
Five grand.

135
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,410
That should keep you off your
back for a couple of weeks.

136
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,550
Are you clean?

137
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,430
You know
I'm a good girl Scout.

138
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,520
So you'll do it.

139
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,660
Vaffanculo.
Screw yourself, Smith.

140
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,170
For all I know,
you snatched the kid.

141
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,100
I don't want to be an accessory
for kidnapping.

142
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,870
I didn't steal the kid, trust me.

143
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,070
Trust you?

144
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,270
I don't even know your real name.

145
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,900
Who are you really, Smith?

146
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,870
I'm a British nanny...

147
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,210
and I'm dangerous.

148
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,120
Just keep the baby for one day
and you can keep the whole roll.

149
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,940
Forget it, Dad.

150
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,040
Fine.

151
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,490
Ciao.

152
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,030
Breast milk.

153
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,710
Let's go.

154
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,310
This lady's baby needs to be fed.

155
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,150
Find me every wet nurse,
lactating hooker...

156
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,620
and mammary on tap
in the city.

157
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,930
I already told you, Smith,
you're not welcome...

158
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,860
in the land of milk and honey.

159
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,440
I need a little cream for
my coffee and some answers.

160
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,080
I'm sorry.

161
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,710
Scram, fellas.

162
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,110
give me a moment alone
here with, uh...

163
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,310
Caffé La Mamma.

164
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,050
Relax. Relax.

165
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,530
Mia piccola troietta.

166
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,460
There was a man here
with a baby not too long ago.

167
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,560
Yes. A real jerk.

168
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,270
He wanted me
to take care of the kid.

169
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,110
And what is this man's name?

170
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,680
Smith.

171
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,650
Mr. Smith.

172
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,050
How the hell
do I know his real name?

173
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,220
He saw me a couple of times...

174
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,390
when I was pulling straight tricks.

175
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,860
He always used
the same name... Smith.

176
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,730
I don't believe you.

177
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,900
I think you know
more about this man.

178
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,280
He was a lousy tipper.

179
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,140
It gets hotter the more times it's fired.

180
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,460
If I had anything on him,
I'd tell you.

181
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,670
And it gets a lot more
painful the closer I get.

182
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,610
What's up, Doc?

183
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,170
Oh, you're a "wascally wabbit."

184
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,350
But you're not "wascally" enough.

185
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,480
Yeah?

186
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,460
That's a six-shooter.

187
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,290
I just counted six shots.

188
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,130
You've blown your load.

189
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,830
Yeah, well, what about you?

190
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,710
Your 9-millimeter is empty too.

191
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,940
Yeah, you fired 8 on the rooftop,
one in the men's room...

192
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,970
and your second cartridge
was expended at the playground.

193
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,710
And you won't be getting it up
with that gun you took off my man.

194
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,910
Oh, no. Well, you see,
like my weapon...

195
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,050
it also has the thumbprint
safety device.

196
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,890
Oh, really?

197
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,120
Wanna bet?

198
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,810
Nothin' like a good hand job.

199
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,990
get your things. We're goin'.

200
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,370
I don't understand a word
you're going on about...

201
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,380
but I know exactly what you're saying
and I refuse to apologize.

202
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,380
Damn you, Smith. I could have
been snuffed back there.

203
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,070
Yeah, you should be thanking me
for saving your sweet back door.

204
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,280
Why did you wait so goddamn long?

205
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,340
You're a bad girl,
you deserve to be punished.

206
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,350
Which car do you want?

207
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,580
- What?
- I'm tired of walking.

208
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,420
Look at this.

209
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,360
You wanna know the difference...

210
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,230
between this luxury car
and a porcupine?

211
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,330
I give up.

212
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,040
With the car,
the pricks are on the inside.

213
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,370
Tell me about it.

214
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,160
Hello, honey.

215
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,270
Oh, good, good, I'm glad...

216
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,530
I'm glad you liked the flowers.
good.

217
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,340
Listen, sweetie...

218
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,770
I've run into a small hitch.

219
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,440
I think I'm gonna have to be
out here for a while longer.

220
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,780
But don't worry.

221
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,110
I will be back in time
for Timmy's birthday party...

222
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,780
I swear to you.

223
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,550
Hugs and kisses.

224
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,250
Bye-bye.

225
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,120
So, what was I supposed to do?

226
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,250
These guys were stalking
this pregnant lady.

227
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,450
I couldn't just stand there.

228
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,560
Did you see that?
I fuckin' hate that.

229
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,330
- What?
- This guy, changin' lanes...

230
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,600
without signaling.

231
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,570
I mean, how hard is it
to use your signal?

232
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,810
So you started shooting at them?

233
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,170
No, I don't carry a piece.

234
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,150
I went to the woman. She had a gun.

235
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,310
They started firing, I shot back.

236
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,440
He's done it again.

237
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
I move my finger one inch...

238
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,990
to use my turn signal.

239
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,510
Why are these assholes so lazy...

240
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,490
they can't move their finger
one fucking measly inch...

241
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,890
to drive more safely?

242
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,950
- You wanna know why?
- Not particularly.

243
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,360
Because these rich bastards
have to...

244
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,990
be callous and inconsiderate
in the first place...

245
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,730
to make all that money,
so when they get on the road...

246
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,170
they can't help themselves.
They've gotta be...

247
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
callous and inconsiderate
drivers too.

248
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,460
It's in their nature.

249
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,240
Why don't you take the baby
to the police?

250
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,000
- I can't go to the police.
- Why not?

251
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,570
I'm the Unabomber.

252
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,550
They caught the Unabomber.

253
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,670
That's what they think.

254
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,750
Stupid...

255
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,410
Right. That's it.

256
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,030
You are the angriest man
in the world.

257
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,400
If I remember right,
you used to like it like that.

258
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,100
Well, how many freelancers
have you got?

259
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,640
Yeah? How many local boys?

260
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,410
I need men, you understand?

261
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,840
I need a lot more men.

262
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,300
I want four mags...

263
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,240
a box of 9-millimeter
147 hollow-points...

264
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,570
...and give me 50 FMJs.

265
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,840
You're a little short.

266
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,790
You lied. You said you had $5,000.

267
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,150
How about we make up the
difference with food stamps?

268
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,680
You wanna buy bullets
with food stamps?

269
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,750
It's as good as cash.

270
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,420
You're pathetic, Smith.

271
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,990
We'll wait for you outside.

272
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,970
Look, why don't I sign over this check
I got at the blood bank to you?

273
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,060
It'll more than cover it.

274
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,260
Throw in that check you got
from the sperm bank...

275
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,830
and got yourself a deal.

276
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,810
I don't get that check
till Wednesday.

277
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,640
Listen, why don't you take
a half-a box of shells...

278
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,870
and I'll give you the other half...

279
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,810
when you bring me the rest
of the money on Wednesday.

280
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,410
Deal.

281
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,430
Damn it, Smith!

282
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,140
Making some money.

284
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,700
- Making some money?
- Well, yeah.

285
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,770
To buy something for the baby.

286
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,510
Something for the baby?

287
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,290
A bulletproof vest is a better
investment than a crib.

288
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,960
Makes me think what you'd do
to get him in the right school.

289
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,460
So this is it.

290
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,060
It's not the Ritz but it's home.

291
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,240
Same old Smith.

292
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,500
Down and dirty.

293
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,700
glad you like it.

294
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,080
Say hello to Mickey.

295
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,430
Maybe I should take the baby
to the police.

296
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,060
No, you'd never make it.

297
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,590
They'll be watching
all the precincts...

298
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,930
probably got some of the boys in blue
on payola too.

299
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,010
I've rounded up 50 guys.

300
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,750
Well, I guess that's just
gonna have to do, huh?

301
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,400
Stop the car. He was here.

302
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,300
Come on, what makes
you think he was here?

303
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,100
Trust me. I know what people do
and I know what people think.

304
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,600
I always have.
Even as a kid, I had this gift.

305
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,910
Yeah, you shoulda seen
the playground hurt I laid down...

306
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,910
playin' rock, paper, scissors, buddy.

307
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,110
Now stop the car.

308
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,410
Who do you think
wants this baby dead?

309
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,750
I've no idea who's tryin' to kill it.

310
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,620
Don't call him an "it."

311
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,320
It's an "it" to me.

312
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,260
Tell me, Smith,
is there anything you like?

313
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,420
Yeah, my privacy.

314
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,830
Tell me something I don't know
per una volta...

315
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,270
brutto figlio di puttana bastardo.

316
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,830
I love it when you talk like that.

317
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,610
Can I offer you anything?

318
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,650
Carrot?

319
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,120
It's good for your eyesight.

320
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,460
Of all the squats in the city...

321
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,430
how does he know
Smith's in this one?

322
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,050
Another lucky guess?

323
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,860
Nah, he doesn't guess.

324
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,830
He sees things we don't.

325
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,860
He was once an FBI profiler.

326
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,770
Forensic behavior consultant.

327
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,780
My god, how many times
do I have to tell you guys?

328
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,280
Details...

329
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,370
...make all the difference
in this business.

330
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,940
Hey, but...

331
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,950
Don't... you think
you should hang back, sir?

332
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,920
The leader who stays in the rear,
takes it in the rear.

333
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,590
Besides...

334
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,700
violence is one of
the most fun things to watch.

335
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,040
No, no, no, baby, no.

336
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,730
We could call him Oliver.

337
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,340
- Oliver?
- Yeah, like Oliver Twist.

338
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,070
Because he's an orphan?

339
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,240
'Cause I like the book.

340
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,370
- You like the book.
- I didn't hate it.

341
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,110
That's a first.

342
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,990
Which birthday card do
you think I should go with here?

343
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,550
Cute and cuddly?

344
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,150
Or the one that says,
"You're becomin' a man now, son"?

345
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,530
So, Mr. Hertz?

346
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,970
How old is your son?

347
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,560
He's 8.

348
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,010
Then it had to be
large and powerful and...

349
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,540
Can you believe it?

350
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,670
There's nothing on the TV...

351
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,370
- about any of this.
...without a trace.

352
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,780
...roadside bomb wounded...

353
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,010
We have it in our...

354
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,120
Hey. Do you notice that?

355
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,590
Notice what?

356
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,390
Look.

357
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,890
Lame-ass politician rants about
gun control, he cries.

358
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,430
- So tonight...
- Switch to this channel...

359
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,630
with this heavy metal music...

360
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,200
...he shuts up.

361
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,840
That's so weird.

362
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,880
He must find it comforting.

363
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,380
- Sir?
- Yeah?

364
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,050
- Men are in place on the roof.
- That's good.

365
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,550
Anybody know what a
Jimmy Cagney love scene is?

366
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,790
It's where Cagney
lets the good guy live.

367
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,730
And if that happens in this show...

368
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,430
I'm gonna do a lot more
than ask for my money back.

369
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,530
All right? Let's kill this mother. go.

370
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:37,010
It doesn't surprise me that
Oliver's into death metal.

371
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,750
Look at his surrogate parents.

372
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,450
No, I'm telling ya, this means...

373
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,760
go. Back way.

374
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,240
My god, do we really suck...

375
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,500
or is this guy really that good?

376
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,140
Come on, boys!

377
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,080
He ain't out of the briar patch yet!

378
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,000
Shoot the dog, shoot the dog.

379
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,300
No.

380
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,760
- Why not?
- I like dogs.

381
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,990
Wait a minute.

382
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,800
Oh, that rat bastard.

383
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,240
What is it?

384
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,280
It's the baby's diaper.

385
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,690
This idea blows, Smith.

386
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,220
It's the only idea we got.

387
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,750
You actually think
that Oliver's mother...

388
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,890
lived near a heavy metal club...

389
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,370
...and that he could hear the music
while he was still inside the womb?

390
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,800
Yep. That's why he doesn't cry...

391
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,700
when he's listenin' to some
headbanger's bash.

392
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,040
Ridiculous.

393
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,070
Well, he isn't cryin' now.

394
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,380
So this is the only club near where
I encountered the baby's mother.

395
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,890
I still say this is a wild hunch.

396
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,250
Yeah? So how do you explain
all these boxes of diapers?

397
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,150
Somebody's been stocking up.

398
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,950
Let's find out who.

399
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,080
- You the owner of this place?
- Who's askin'?

400
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,670
I am.

401
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,320
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No.

402
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,120
Just as I suspected.

403
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,560
He really is into jewelry.

404
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,650
Who occupies the room upstairs?

405
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,100
go to hell.

406
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,620
Don't mess with me.

407
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,500
You ain't got the cojones.

408
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,800
Oh, god.

409
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,210
So who were these guys?

410
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,150
I rented the place to some suit
11 months ago.

411
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,710
He paid the whole year in cash.

412
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,220
I never saw him again.

413
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,620
I just figured they were
usin' the back way.

414
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,590
Beat it.

415
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,340
Oh, madonna.

416
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,840
Che orrore!

417
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,350
This is pretty fucked up.

418
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,480
Sir, it's your go-to guy.

419
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,050
All the mothers have been killed.

420
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,520
Only one escaped, temporarily.

421
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,990
We found her body and confirmed
that she did deliver a child.

422
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,920
The babies were supposed
to be delivered covertly.

423
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,660
I guess setting up this
maternity factory...

424
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,690
on top of a heavy metal club
wasn't particularly secret.

425
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,530
What a fine lot of
babysitters we turned out to be.

426
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,300
When Mr. go-To guy passes,
head to the left.

427
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,930
Yes, sir, I already made the call.

428
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,640
Backup should be
arriving any minute.

429
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,440
We'll clean this mess up
and try to piece together...

430
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,670
everything that happened.

431
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,940
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate your confidence.

432
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,610
gentlemen, let's find some answers.

433
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,120
Watch where you step.

434
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,360
- The ice cream is melting.
- What?

435
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,800
I thought donor sperm
was your department.

436
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,200
These freezers are full of samples.

437
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,730
This is weird.

438
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,570
There seems to be only one donor.

439
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,130
One donor?

440
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,540
Yeah. And a generous one at that.

441
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,120
This is bone marrow blood.

442
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,180
It must be for some kind of cure.

443
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,660
How do you know that, Smith?

444
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,590
You didn't hear about
my Nobel Prize?

445
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,100
See, what it is, it's hard to find marrow
that matches that of the recipient.

446
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,510
The odds are much better
if the donor marrow shares...

447
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,100
the same DNA with
the person receiving it.

448
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,410
You mean these people were
harvesting babies...

449
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,780
for some guy's
bone marrow transplant?

450
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,020
Exactly. And somebody
wanted to make sure he didn't get it.

451
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,790
That's why they want Oliver dead.

452
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,280
No, my baby, no.

453
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,250
So I called that guy I know at NBC.

454
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,880
That's good.

455
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,120
And then I got to thinking.

456
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,990
- You know what I hate?
- Here we go again.

457
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,690
I hate those lame action movies...

458
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,360
where the good guy calls
just one person who ends up betrayin' him.

459
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,730
Yeah. That's right up there
with killing baby seals.

460
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,640
I called ABC, CBS,
The Post, The Times...

461
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,140
the local news channel, and the FBI.

462
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,900
So, what do we do next?

463
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,940
I figure we hang here
and watch the news.

464
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,710
Once the story goes public,
maybe we'll be safe.

465
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,150
Look. He finally went to sleep.

466
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,820
Yeah, you just wait.

467
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,450
The moment you close
your eyes for a nap, he'll start screaming.

468
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,930
You can't take a little pleasure
in anything, can you?

469
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,990
You just hate everything.

470
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,660
I don't hate you.

471
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,990
Is that why you picked me?

472
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,200
You know why I picked you.

473
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,540
You have no idea
what you've done to me.

474
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,810
We're gonna get out of this, trust me.

475
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,780
- You just don't get it.
- What?

476
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:44,580
You bring me this child
so I can feed him, take care of him.

477
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,790
A baby that could be dead
at any moment.

478
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,090
And you never even think
to ask me...

479
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,030
what happened to my own child.

480
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,730
You're right.

481
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,540
It's unforgivable.

482
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,140
No. It's my fault.

483
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,940
It's like what my mamma
always said...

484
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,780
"Le uova non devono ballare
con le pietre."

485
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,880
If I say I'm sorry will
you tell me what that means?

486
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,430
Eggs have no business
dancing with stones.

487
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,650
You know, Smith...

488
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,990
I figured out what you hate most...

489
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,620
yourself.

490
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,460
What happened to your baby?

491
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,260
Forget about it.

492
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,890
Tell me.

493
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,330
My pimp hit me in the stomach.

494
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,440
My baby...

495
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,500
was delivered stillborn.

496
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,810
- get off of me!
- Hey.

497
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,460
You like this, do ya?

498
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,740
It's called a gun.

499
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:49,310
grip, slide, breech, barrel, trigger.

500
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,220
Now, this is the business end.

501
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,850
You should never point this
at anything you don't intend to kill.

502
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,350
Now, this is important.
This is called your safety.

503
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:05,330
You have to keep this on to make sure
the gun doesn't go off accidentally.

504
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,320
But really, this is
your number one safety.

505
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,640
Are you hungry?

506
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,700
Talk about shootin' your load.

507
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,300
Look at this.

508
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,300
This is a Hammerson Nite Tac.

509
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,570
These aren't supposed to
hit the streets for 6 months.

510
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:37,870
This is weird.

511
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,850
All these guys have got 'em.

512
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,380
Don't even tell me.

513
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,990
Do you know how many of our men
he's body-bagged now?

514
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,090
Why should I waste my beautiful mind
on something like that?

515
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,960
Doesn't it piss you off a little?

516
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,060
getting angry releases an enzyme...

517
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,540
tryptophan hydroxylase...

518
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,270
which can temporarily
reduce the I.Q.

519
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,540
That's something I can't
afford to do right now.

520
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,770
How do you know all that?

521
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,900
My boy's hooked
on the Discovery Channel.

522
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:10,440
Take me Westside.
I need to report in.

523
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,970
I got a bead
on who our Mr. Hero is.

524
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,020
No more arguments.

525
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,080
I have to do this alone,
and the only way I can do it...

526
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,250
is if I'm positive you two are OK.

527
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,030
This is the only place
I know you'll be safe.

528
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,060
- A tank?
- An M24 tank.

529
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,470
You'll be safe from gunfire
and most explosives.

530
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,300
- You're whacked.
- I am.

531
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,970
I'm also serious.

532
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,100
But nobody's allowed to get in it.

533
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,410
Don't worry. When I create
a diversion, you climb inside.

534
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,940
You should have
enough of that baby food...

535
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,850
to last you a couple of days.

536
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,380
The puréed carrots are the best.

537
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,320
Well, you know
how to use this, right?

538
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,290
Yes, but what if
you don't come back?

539
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,690
That's not gonna happen.

540
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,490
There is no way to be sure.

541
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,830
Yes, there is.

542
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,120
Tu sei una stella, la mia stella.

543
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,780
- But, Mom, I wanna go home!
- Stop whining!

544
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,320
If you don't behave,
I am going to spank you.

545
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,920
- But, Mom, I wanna go home!
- Stop whining.

546
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,230
Stop it!

547
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,390
I hate it when parents...

548
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,300
- hit their children.
- Let go of my arm!

549
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,000
Not until you stop hittin' your kid.

550
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,060
I will discipline
my child as I see fit.

551
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,270
How would you like it
if I spanked you?

552
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,300
What...?

553
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,800
- See?
- Help!

554
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,140
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

555
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,310
Help!

556
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,540
Help!

557
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,920
What the hell do you think you're doin'?

558
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,190
It's not funny.

559
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:18,370
So, what you got on this
all-star ground pounder?

560
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,110
Well, anybody this good
had to start out young.

561
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,510
And it's usually because
their pop was good at it too.

562
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,780
You know, like
MacArthur's dad was a general...

563
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,840
and Mickey Mantle's father
played pro ball.

564
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,380
My son is a video game whiz...

565
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,860
and I wasn't too bad at
Pong myself.

566
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,460
Just follow me,
if you will, Mr. Hammerson.

567
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,490
In '67, the limeys
got hard-ass on gun control.

568
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:44,230
So a lot of Brit gunsmiths
moved to the States.

569
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,500
Now, I've got an inside man
at lmmigration...

570
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,510
working on which of
these guys had sons...

571
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,600
and if any of the boys
were crack shots.

572
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,010
I think the pucker factor's
gettin' to you.

573
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,200
You got diddly!

574
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,980
Yes, Duchess, you a good girl. Sit.

575
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,820
Yes. Now's your treat.
Now you get your treat.

576
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,550
My man has been
running the name down...

577
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,530
and he recalled one of these
gunsmith kids, actually.

578
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,360
National sports pistol
champion at age 10...

579
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,300
Olympic hopeful,
recruited by the army.

580
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,590
- But after that, the kid is...
- Kisses, kisses, kisses.

581
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,610
...never heard from again.

582
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,510
Well, that sounds like Black Ops
got him, trained him.

583
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,740
- This leads me to a theory.
- A theory?

584
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,710
A theory is bull-noogies.

585
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:34,450
All you got is a man with no name...

586
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,280
ridin' into town on a pale horse...

587
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,950
dispensin' his own brand o' justice.

588
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,690
Hertz, you know why people
in this country love guns?

589
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,850
And it's got nothin' to do
with all that...

590
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,850
phallic mumbo jumbo,
like "cockin' your gun."

591
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,130
No, Hertz, people love guns...

592
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,200
because America
is a land of opportunity...

593
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,870
where a poor man can become rich...

594
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:34,340
...and a pussy can become
a tough guy...

595
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,140
if he's got a gun in his hand.

596
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,640
I'm hopin' you're not just
a pussy with a gun in your hand.

597
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,850
Oh, no, sir, no. No, I'm not.

598
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,620
I'm a tough guy with
a pussy in my hand.

599
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,070
I want you to give this guy...

600
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,070
and the kid a dirt nap.

601
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,630
Yes, sir.

602
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,840
Right away, sir.

603
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,540
Amore mio.

604
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,550
Don't worry.

605
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,450
Daddy will be back soon.

606
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,400
Hold it! Hold it!

607
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,580
Well, well, well, Mr. Bunny.

608
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:43,410
You just keep goin',
goin', goin', don't ya?

609
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,510
- So do you.
- I promise to, uh...

610
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,020
to spare your life
if you tell me where...

611
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,490
the woman and child are.

612
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,280
Forget it.

613
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,530
Oh, boy.

614
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,970
'Ey, who trained you?

615
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:11,030
N.S.A. Black Ops? CIA?
The army?

616
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,440
Well, whoever. It seems
you haven't lost your aim, champ.

617
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,810
You think that's good, you should
see me spell my name in the snow.

618
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,980
'Ey, you know, my boss here...

619
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,550
thinks that you're the Lone Ranger
or something.

620
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:30,080
Well, I believe I have a better idea
about who you are.

621
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,730
I found out how your
wife and son were killed.

622
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,060
My god, what a tragedy.

623
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,500
Some guy walks into a burger joint...

624
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,900
he starts shooting up the place.

625
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,810
Oh, my god, what a shame...

626
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,710
that your wife and son were there...

627
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,240
having their... chicken nuggets.

628
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,650
What's the matter,
ya don't like that story?

629
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,920
Well, then why don't
ya tell me one, hm?

630
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,330
Children's story, please.

631
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,260
Oh, I know. Tell me my favorite, yeah.

632
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,200
Tell me the one about the baby.

633
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,330
Maybe later...

634
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,840
when I put you to sleep.

635
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,370
go, go!

636
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,540
So, what do you think
of this second amendment now?

637
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,080
Fuck you!

638
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,110
OK, buddy, drop your weapon.

639
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,600
Think we got him?

640
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,160
god damn it, Smith!

641
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,290
So I found out
who's tryin' to kill our baby.

642
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,420
- Who?
- A man named Hammerson.

643
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,730
Born with a silver spoon up his ass.

644
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,740
Inherited the Hammer
Firearms Corporation...

645
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:30,640
from his old man and
makes millions manufacturing weapons.

646
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,770
Does this give you any new ideas...

647
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,080
about who needs
Oliver's bone marrow?

648
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,440
No.

649
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,240
It's OK, little Oliver.

650
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:45,620
Shit. It's him.

651
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,460
Senator Rutledge.

652
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,590
If he's elected president,
he'll put Hammerson out of business.

653
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,690
It makes sense,
but how can you be sure?

654
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,530
Mr. go-To guy called his men
a fine lot of babysitters.

655
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:00,870
The secret service calls their agents
who guard VIPs babysitters.

656
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,460
It's him, Senator Rutledge.

657
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,070
He's the guy that needs this baby.

658
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,040
So we contact this man
and then we're safe.

659
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,840
- It's over.
- Are you crazy?

660
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,180
This means that
we've got Hammerson...

661
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,480
and the whole of the U.S.
government after us.

662
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,140
I think you two have
gotta get out of town.

663
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,650
Until I get the answers,
you'll never be safe.

664
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,280
They'll be watchin' the trains,
the bus stations and the airports...

665
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,790
So I think this is the safest
way to get out of town.

666
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,320
I'm gonna check all of this out,
and if everything's OK...

667
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,200
I'll get you
before you board the bus.

668
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,630
But... What if you don't get
to us before we leave?

669
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:33,470
Where should I get off?

670
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,900
I think it's better if I don't know.

671
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,370
- What?
- Trust me.

672
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,370
I can't know.

673
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,820
Smith, do you really think
this is gonna work?

674
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:53,050
Just stick to the plan
and everything will be all right.

675
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,050
Run!

676
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,900
So much for wearin' your seat belt.

677
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,000
What in the hell is that?

678
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,600
Oh, my god, that is twisted.

679
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,610
That sick son of a bitch.

680
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,500
Oh, that sick son of a bitch
suckered us again!

681
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,020
It's time to go, little boy.

682
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,790
Put me through to whoever's
protecting Senator Rutledge.

683
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,590
Just tell him there's a man
with a baby calling.

684
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,300
Hello, is this Smith?

685
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,930
That was a nice job coverin' up
your baby hatchery downtown.

686
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,530
Not a word about it anywhere.

687
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,940
Only you guys in Washington
have that kind of pull.

688
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,780
I'm telling you,
we're on the same side.

689
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:40,220
Now, listen, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

690
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,740
I wanna see the senator.

691
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:46,590
All right. He wants to see you too.

692
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,750
He's leaving for North Carolina.
The primary's in three days.

693
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:53,700
You can fly with him.
Runway 7, two hours.

694
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:58,100
I see anythin' I don't like,
I'm blowin' this big time.

695
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:12,780
What were you doing in there?

696
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,520
- Cleaning my gun.
- Really?

697
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,950
You know, we were
never really trying to kill you.

698
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,150
We only wanted to scare you
into surrendering.

699
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,360
Well, that's one way to explain
why you can't shoot straight.

700
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,990
In the latest poll,
Senator Rutledge...

701
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,930
continues to be the
Democratic frontrunner...

702
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,160
heading into next week's
Super Tuesday primary.

703
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,640
He leads his rival by at least 10 points...

704
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,040
I owe you my life.

705
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,270
So this is where you get to do
all those hookers.

706
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,650
- I heard about you.
- You look worse than you do on TV.

707
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:51,780
Yes, it's amazing
what a little makeup can do.

708
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,520
And a lot of morphine.

709
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:00,390
So, you've pieced
the whole thing together.

710
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,370
Very clever, Mr. Smith.
Very clever.

711
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,130
Simple.

712
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,160
You're the Democratic
frontrunner for president...

713
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,470
and your sweeping
gun control proposals...

714
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,340
are pissing the wrong people off.

715
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,370
Yes, well, if they're pissed now,
wait until I'm elected president.

716
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,850
We got so many goddamn...

717
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,040
gun lobbies out there...

718
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,880
that we're gonna have to set up
just as many commissions.

719
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,290
Then maybe we'll get our bill
passed in the first year.

720
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,880
Unfortunately, you're sick
and the gun Nazis found out.

721
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,730
They discovered your baby hatchery
and, boom, problem solved.

722
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,130
- They kill you by killin' the babies.
- Correct.

723
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,990
So, where's my savior?

724
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,130
Oh, my god! gun!

725
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,110
Easy, easy.

726
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,900
You know what I hate most?

727
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,340
- Liars.
- What the hell you doin'?

728
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,810
You made a deal with Hammerson.

729
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,010
- No, you're crazy.
- Am I?

730
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,410
- Y...
- When you got into bed with him...

731
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:52,280
you also let his dog up on the mattress.

732
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,780
Lookin' at those dog hairs
on your trousers...

733
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,790
I'd say old Duchess took a likin' to you.

734
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,120
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

735
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,350
Save the line for when
you're in office, Rutledge.

736
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:00,720
If he ever makes it there.

737
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,390
Do you know what else I hate?

738
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,920
Hypocrites.

739
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,450
And you're the biggest one of all.

740
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,560
Can you blame him
for sellin' out?

741
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,860
His operation to find the baby...

742
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,200
had been tits up from the get-go.

743
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,500
You see, Rutledge called us
and he offered us...

744
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:18,070
a proposition that we had
never dreamed was possible.

745
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,140
In exchange for his life...

746
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:22,110
the senator promised
to protect our right...

747
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:23,880
To go deer hunting with an Uzi.

748
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,540
Oh, come on, Smith. Come on.

749
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,140
guns don't kill people.

750
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,650
But they sure help.

751
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,590
Back off!

752
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,990
Back off.

753
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:35,190
- Back off or I'll kill him!
- Oh, please.

754
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:37,060
Pl... I had to do it.

755
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:39,650
I want to live.
I am meant to be president.

756
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,630
Yeah? Well, you got what it takes.
You put yourself before the people.

757
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,970
I can still do good in other areas.

758
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,400
How you gonna square it
with the public?

759
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,170
It is a constitutional right.

760
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,670
Back off! get back!

761
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:52,400
I've come around
to their way of thinking.

762
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,670
Come around?
They had you at "hello."

763
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,810
Let me give you a piece of advice...

764
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:00,580
Never trust the people who stand
to profit, plain and simple.

765
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,280
- They're the bad guys.
- Come on, Smith, don't be a fool.

766
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,880
go-to guy: the game is over.
You rolled the dice, you lost.

767
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,980
Let him go, Smith!
There's no escape!

768
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,990
Maybe not for me, but there
is for the woman and baby.

769
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,120
If I kill Rutledge, no one
will need to find them.

770
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,890
They'll be saved.

771
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:49,920
Your assassination, Rutledge,
will create a public outrage...

772
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,830
and trigger immense support
for your proposals.

773
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:56,330
The sympathy vote in the congress
will give your anti-gun bills...

774
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:59,540
passage by a landslide.

775
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,510
Your legacy... will live on.

776
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,980
Don't do it!

777
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,640
Then do it.

778
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,480
Let me regain some honor
with my...

779
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:17,560
That son of a bitch.

780
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,990
Son of a bitch!

781
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:25,360
god damn it!

782
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,190
Don't move, Mr. Hero.

783
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,700
Can't talk right now, honey.

784
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,400
I'm right in the middle of somethin'.

785
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,070
Bye-bye.

786
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,760
Don't you worry, Duchess.

787
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,960
This isn't gonna happen to you.

788
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,160
Not for a few years, anyway.

789
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,570
Well, well,
well, well, well.

790
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:23,140
Somebody gets to be smart,
and somebody gets to be dumb.

791
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:27,340
Looks like you and I have
finally traded places, huh, sport?

792
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,540
Yes, indeed.

793
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,350
The circle of life.

794
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:36,520
The circle-a jerk of life.

795
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,620
Oh, you have
such a way with words.

796
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,720
Now...

797
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:48,570
I want you to tell me...

798
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:51,400
where the woman
and the child are.

799
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,040
Tell me, or I will be forced
to cause you...

800
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,880
considerable agony.

801
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:58,250
Believe me...

802
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,880
nothing could be more painful than
listenin' to you jabberin' on and on.

803
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,150
Again, I ask...

804
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,850
where are the woman and child?

805
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,730
That's the last time
you'll be doin' that.

806
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,530
Just tell me what I wanna hear.

807
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:22,940
It's your choice
when the pain stops.

808
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:25,340
Why are you doin' this?

809
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,440
- It's over.
- It shortly will be, yeah.

810
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,820
No, I really should thank you.

811
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:36,980
I just got a bigger contract
because of you.

812
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,320
I mean, I wasn't just on
Hammerson's payroll, you know.

813
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,050
What are you babbling
on about now?

814
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:46,030
Do you really think
the people that employ me...

815
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,500
were just gonna bend over
and take your little stunt...

816
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:49,790
killing the senator?

817
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:52,170
There's no way that you can
cover up this whole thing.

818
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,600
No? Haven't you heard
the news?

819
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,970
The senator's plane
crashed into the East River.

820
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:00,740
They haven't been able to find
the body of Senator Rutledge.

821
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,870
So, you see, once I silence you
and the woman...

822
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,810
the cover-up will be complete.

823
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:07,150
So, once again, I ask you...

824
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,950
where are the woman and child?

825
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,920
You know how I'd break
your finger?

826
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,590
My boy told me this one.

827
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,820
You'd punch me in the nose.

828
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,350
I'd kick you in the ass.

829
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,390
Very amusing.

830
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:22,520
I give that one the ol' thumbs up!

831
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,700
What if you don't
get to us before we leave?

832
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:29,260
Oh, I know your whole story.

833
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,330
That man who went
on the shooting spree in the restaurant.

834
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,440
He visited the little gun shop
that you inherited from your dad.

835
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,710
I found out how your wife
and son were killed.

836
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,980
You sold him
the pair of shotguns...

837
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,010
Shotguns.

838
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,920
...that killed your own wife and boy.

839
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,080
I'm not telling you...
a goddamn thing.

840
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,820
Where are you, Smith?

841
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,260
Well, well, well, well, well.

842
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:59,530
We're gonna need somethin'
a little more invasive.

843
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,250
That's it.

844
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,240
Aren't guns just fucking great,
Hammerson?

845
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,680
'Ey.

846
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,150
Who's a hotshot now, huh?

847
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:01,950
Oh, yes, sirree, Bob.

848
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,690
It certainly has been a pleasure.

849
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,590
But before we part ways...

850
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:07,460
tell me one thing.

851
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,630
I am dead on...

852
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,790
about who you are, right?

853
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,300
Say that again?

854
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,200
I said, I am dead...

855
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,640
Stop.

856
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,800
That part of it you got right.

857
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,000
It's the wife.

858
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,280
Hi, honey.

859
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:04,750
She's leaving me.

860
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,720
You know what I really hate?

861
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,610
What I really hate...

862
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,040
...is a pussy with a gun in his hand.

863
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:23,660
Investigators discovered
the body of Senator Rutledge today.

864
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:27,360
The FBI stated an anonymous
tip led them to the remains.

865
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,000
Don't worry, little boy.

866
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:58,970
Mama will be watching you
while she's working.

867
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,520
Oliver.

868
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:20,220
Hello.

869
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,650
What took you so long?

870
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,940
All right, this is a robbery!

871
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,040
Empty the drawer, all of it.

872
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,450
Everyone else, freeze!

873
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:54,890
Do it or I'll fucking blow your head off!

874
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,550
He said freeze.

875
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,690
That means don't even
pucker your butthole.

876
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:01,030
That's right.
No puckering, nobody dies.

877
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,190
So don't fuckin' move.

878
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:04,220
We're kinda
in a rush here, man! Come on!

879
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:07,360
- You know what I hate?
- Shut up and sit on this, asshole.

880
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,930
That's right! You heard him!
