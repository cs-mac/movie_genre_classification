1
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:01,419
"In order to affect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions

2
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,088
and to ensure the common good,

3
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,531
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,228
by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,

5
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,431
duly appointed representative
of His Majesty, the king.

6
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,575
By decree, according to martial law,

7
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,102
the following statutes
are temporarily amended:

8
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,877
Right to assembly, suspended.

9
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,813
Right to habeas corpus, suspended.

10
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,485
Right to legal counsel, suspended.

11
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,760
Right to verdict by a jury of peers,
suspended.

12
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:46,127
By decree, all persons
found guilty of piracy,

13
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,334
or aiding a person convicted of piracy,

14
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,345
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy...

15
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:58,145
...shall be sentenced to
hang by the neck until dead. "

16
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,790
Lord Beckett!

17
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,061
They've started to sing, sir.

18
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,905
<i>- Finally.</i>

19
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,379
A dangerous song to be singing...

20
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,316
...for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.

21
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,823
Particularly a woman.

22
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,759
Particularly a woman alone.

23
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,724
What makes you think
she's alone?

24
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,826
You protect her?

25
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,205
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

26
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,906
Your master's expecting us.

27
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:22,346
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.

28
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,383
Pick those feet up!

29
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,049
On the double!

30
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,287
Eyes front!

31
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,761
No, no, no. None.

32
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,593
It always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.

33
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,827
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.

34
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,240
Steady as she goes.

35
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,607
All right.

36
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,223
Have you heard anything from Will?

37
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,624
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts

38
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:45,130
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

39
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,724
Is he that terrifying?

40
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,737
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

41
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,347
We're through. Make ready.

42
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,057
Hurry now.

43
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,338
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

44
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,701
Well, when you put it that way...

45
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,176
Remove. Please.

46
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,052
Remove. Please.

47
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:12,573
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.

48
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,275
More steam.

49
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,829
None of that.

50
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,866
If things don't go the way we want,
then we're the only chance they've got.

51
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,747
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.

52
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,882
More of a proposal to put to ye.

53
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:05,696
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

54
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,532
Hmm. It's an odd coincidence.

55
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,697
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

56
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,173
No.

57
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,870
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

58
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,903
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

59
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,075
and tried to make off with these.

60
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,416
The navigational charts.

61
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,788
The route to the Farthest Gate.

62
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:41,756
Wouldn't it be amazing
if this venture of yours

63
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,235
took you to the world beyond this one?

64
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,171
It would strain credulity at that.

65
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,920
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?

66
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,165
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

67
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,488
No, no!

68
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:28,312
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

69
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,673
- I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

70
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,252
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

71
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,658
But I cannot help but wonder...

72
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,695
Why?

73
00:12:55,141 --> 00:13:00,875
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.

74
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,146
We must convene the Brethren Court.

75
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:11,178
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honor the call.

76
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,218
More steam.

77
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,724
More steam!

78
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,334
- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

79
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,312
It is true.

80
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,646
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

81
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,687
...is by betraying other pirates.

82
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,122
We must put
our differences aside.

83
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,250
Wait for the signal.

84
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,489
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

85
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:55,227
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

86
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,097
Against East India
Trading Company,

87
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,832
what value is the Brethren Court?

88
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,338
What can any of us do?

89
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,242
You can fight!
Get off me!

90
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,770
You are Sao Feng,
the pirate lord of Singapore.

91
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,548
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

92
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,490
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

93
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,821
and those who pass the test
become legend.

94
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,258
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

95
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,459
The most notorious pirates
from around the world

96
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,524
are uniting against our enemy,

97
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,696
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

98
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,043
Elizabeth Swann.

99
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,276
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

100
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,009
And the eye does not go wanting.

101
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,926
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

102
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,664
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

103
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,927
Jack Sparrow.

104
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,029
He's one of the pirate lords.

105
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,402
The only reason...

106
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,441
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

107
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,485
...is so I can send him back myself!

108
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,192
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

109
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,722
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

110
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,429
So we must go and get him back.

111
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,975
So you admit...

112
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,577
...you have deceived me.

113
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,047
Weapons!

114
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,447
Weapons.

115
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,114
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honorable.

116
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,133
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!

117
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,368
Kill him. He's not our man.

118
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,343
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...

119
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,912
...who's he with?

120
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,381
Charge!

121
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,226
Will!

122
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,144
Look out! Look behind you!

123
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,387
Ready!

124
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,950
Fire.

125
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,761
Chart!

126
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,456
Boo!

127
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:56,434
Company! Make ready. Set. Fire!

128
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,404
Company!

129
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,576
Make ready. Set.

130
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,716
Fire!

131
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,973
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

132
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,979
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

133
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,480
It is coincidence only.

134
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:44,087
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

135
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:49,818
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

136
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,924
Why should I expect any better?

137
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,865
<i>I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.</i>

138
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,765
You're helping me to get it.

139
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,348
Uh-oh.

140
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,155
Fire in the hole.

141
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,702
Thank you, Jack.

142
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,745
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

143
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,148
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

144
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,053
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

145
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,954
This way. Be quick.

146
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,994
Haul the snotters with a will!

147
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,762
Keep it taut.

148
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,828
Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.

149
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,739
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

150
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,709
Do you think he will honor the call?

151
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,247
I cannot say.

152
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,379
There's an evil on these seas

153
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:24,787
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

154
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,357
A piece of eight.

155
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,821
Nine of them, you say.

156
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,988
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

157
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,656
Nine pieces of eight.

158
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,292
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

159
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,700
Nothing can hold against the armada.

160
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,001
<i>Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.</i>

161
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,597
Nothing we know of.

162
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,309
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

163
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,109
He was mum on that, sir.

164
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,649
Hmm.

165
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,151
Then he knows the value of information.

166
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,017
Better keep this between ourselves.

167
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,388
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

168
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:13,994
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

169
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,796
Yes. Something for you there.

170
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,235
Your new station deserves an old friend.

171
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,352
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

172
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,980
Execution.

173
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,058
The Brethren know they face extinction.

174
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:52,435
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

175
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,426
No one said anything about cold.

176
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,265
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

177
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,205
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

178
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,801
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

179
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:38,378
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

180
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,615
to a place not of death, but punishment.

181
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,522
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

182
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,189
...stretching on forever.

183
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:54,121
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

184
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,670
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.

185
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,915
Nothing here is set.

186
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,282
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

187
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:23,020
No. But it leads to more places.

188
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,624
"Over the edge.

189
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,136
Over again. "

190
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,669
"Sunrise sets.

191
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,734
Flash of green. "

192
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,606
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

193
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:51,287
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

194
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:55,918
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

195
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,794
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

196
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,190
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

197
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,101
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

198
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,335
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

199
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,508
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

200
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,916
It's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

201
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,918
It's getting back.

202
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,161
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

203
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,464
Aye, aye, sir!

204
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,733
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

205
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,176
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

206
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,614
Fetch the chest.

207
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,477
And the governor?

208
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,018
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

209
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,421
Does he know?

210
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,658
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

211
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,917
Step lively, men.

212
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,919
Step lively!

213
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,192
Stand fast!

214
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,601
Steady, men.

215
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,250
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

216
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,288
I will not have it on my ship!

217
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,883
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...
because I will.

218
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,860
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

219
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,330
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

220
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,972
We need prisoners to interrogate,

221
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,237
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

222
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,212
<i>The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.</i>

223
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,183
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

224
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:46,883
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

225
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,556
This is no longer your world, Jones.

226
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,764
The immaterial has become...

227
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,630
...immaterial.

228
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,831
Charge your bayonets.

229
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,212
How long do we continue not talking?

230
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,743
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

231
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,290
Then we rescue Jack.

232
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,781
For what we want most...

233
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:28,088
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

234
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:44,307
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

235
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,838
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

236
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,903
to find a place as can't be found.

237
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,347
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

238
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,085
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

239
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,679
To stations!

240
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,189
All hands to stations!

241
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,022
Huh?

242
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,995
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

243
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:10,899
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

244
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,032
Blimey.

245
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,419
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

246
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:34,151
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

247
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,059
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

248
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,062
Tie her off.

249
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,436
Hard aport.

250
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,209
Hold on!

251
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:38,782
<i>Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.</i>

252
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:44,385
<i>Dead men tell no tales.</i>

253
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,010
My peanut.

254
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,672
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

255
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,047
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

256
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,245
Step lively with a will.

257
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,912
- Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.

258
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,683
I want a fire down below!

259
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,524
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

260
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,308
Haul! Haul!

261
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,245
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

262
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,111
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

263
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,098
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

264
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,596
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

265
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,739
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

266
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,675
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

267
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,178
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

268
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,773
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

269
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,118
Shall I?

270
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,150
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

271
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,762
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

272
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:05,064
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

273
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,933
Do you understand?

274
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:10,132
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

275
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,872
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

276
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,413
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

277
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,973
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

278
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,020
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

279
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,988
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

280
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,786
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

281
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,740
No wind.

282
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,211
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

283
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,314
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

284
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:56,217
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

285
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,491
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

286
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,264
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

287
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,034
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

288
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,721
Shoo.

289
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,003
A rock.

290
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,864
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

291
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,163
Oh.

292
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,201
A rope.

293
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,012
This truly is a godforsaken place.

294
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,849
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

295
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,820
He's here.

296
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,194
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

297
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,698
And does it matter?

298
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,827
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

299
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:14,171
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

300
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,343
Impossible.

301
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:02,981
Boat.

302
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,268
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

303
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,109
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

304
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,274
Hide the rum.

305
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,284
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

306
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,717
I thought so.

307
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,756
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

308
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,812
Sir?

309
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,918
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

310
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,327
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

311
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,963
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

312
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,970
I know that.
I know where I am.

313
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:55,273
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

314
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,845
Oh, Hector.

315
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,849
It's been too long. Hasn't it?

316
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:04,718
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

317
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,988
No, I didn't.

318
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,151
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

319
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:14,129
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

320
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,366
He thinks we're a hallucination.

321
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,930
William, tell me something:

322
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:24,031
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

323
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,669
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

324
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,201
No.

325
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,714
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

326
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:35,775
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

327
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,218
Jack.

328
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,324
This is real. We're here.

329
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,965
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

330
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,704
We've come to rescue you.

331
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,837
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

332
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,246
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

333
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:10,479
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

334
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,849
I see my ship. Right there.

335
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,886
Can't spot it.

336
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,297
<i>Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.</i>

337
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,165
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

338
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,603
<i>- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.</i>

339
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,540
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

340
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,410
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

341
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,142
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

342
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,013
And you need a crew.

343
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,315
Why should I sail with any of you?

344
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,881
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

345
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,066
Oh, she's not told you.

346
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,966
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

347
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,804
As for you...

348
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,910
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

349
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,939
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

350
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,950
Don't need you. You scare me.

351
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,886
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

352
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,616
Cotton.

353
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,218
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

354
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,693
Who are you?

355
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,062
Tai Huang. These are my men.

356
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,567
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

357
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,667
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

358
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,768
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

359
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,039
Weigh anchor.

360
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,209
Jack...

361
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:53,148
Which way are you going, Jack?

362
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,591
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

363
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,222
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

364
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,731
What are you doing?

365
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,233
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

366
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,796
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

367
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,035
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

368
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,602
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

369
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,171
That makes you "chartman. "

370
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:24,152
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

371
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,190
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

372
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,198
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

373
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,528
Sorry.

374
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,570
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

375
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,842
You left Jack to the Kraken.

376
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,040
He's rescued now. It's done with.

377
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,186
Will, I had no choice.

378
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,286
You chose not to tell me.

379
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,953
I couldn't.

380
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,886
It wasn't your burden to bear.

381
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,762
But I did bear it, didn't I?

382
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,332
I just didn't know what it was.

383
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,763
I thought...

384
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,930
You thought I loved him.

385
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,283
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

386
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,587
You can't.

387
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,313
Eerie.

388
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,250
That's downright macabre.

389
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:50,460
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

390
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,572
Be disrespectful, it would.

391
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:06,412
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

392
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,214
That was the duty
him was charged with...

393
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,217
...by the goddess, Calypso.

394
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,893
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

395
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,168
And every ten years...

396
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,096
...him could come ashore...

397
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,439
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

398
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,375
But the man has become a monster.

399
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:45,011
So he wasn't always... tentacley?

400
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,284
No.

401
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,894
Him was a man...

402
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,954
...once.

403
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,297
Now there's boats coming.

404
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,746
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

405
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,946
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

406
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,285
It's best just let them be.

407
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,239
It's my father. We've made it back.

408
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,867
Father! Father, here, look here!

409
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:42,770
Elizabeth.

410
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,239
We're not back.

411
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,381
Father!

412
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,153
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

413
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,730
No. No.

414
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,430
I think I am.

415
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,494
No, you can't be.

416
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,506
There was this chest, you see.

417
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:16,939
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

418
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:18,842
Come aboard.

419
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,678
And a heart.

420
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:26,018
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

421
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,616
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

422
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,685
<i>The Dutchman must have a captain.</i>

423
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,755
Silly thing to die for.

424
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,364
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

425
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,296
Come on.

426
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:47,605
A touch... of destiny.

427
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,777
Take the line.

428
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,479
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

429
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,282
Father, the line! Take the line!

430
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,424
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

431
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:08,760
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

432
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,390
I'll give your love to your mother.

433
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,335
- Please, I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.

434
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,463
Elizabeth.

435
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,841
Is there a way?

436
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,347
Him at peace.

437
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,319
No water.

438
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,557
Why is all but the rum gone?

439
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,634
Rum's gone too.

440
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,440
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

441
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:02,417
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

442
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:05,717
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

443
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:07,615
Forever.

444
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:11,650
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

445
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,958
Why doesn't he do something?

446
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:17,231
- Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

447
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,634
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

448
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:26,669
"Over the edge. " Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

449
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,278
Sunrises don't set.

450
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,683
"Up is down. "

451
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,243
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

452
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,289
Why are these things never clear?

453
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:43,190
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

454
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,354
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

455
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:52,595
<i>- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.</i>

456
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,194
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.

457
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:58,036
Sail the seas for eternity.

458
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,043
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

459
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,102
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

460
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:08,174
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

461
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:12,180
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

462
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:15,713
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

463
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,124
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

464
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,459
But eternity is longer still.

465
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,224
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

466
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,300
Or not?

467
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,237
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

468
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,872
Come sunset, it won't matter.

469
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,374
Not sunset.

470
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,844
Sundown.

471
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,344
And rise. Up.

472
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,817
What's that?

473
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,755
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

474
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,525
- Where?
- There.

475
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,651
What is it?

476
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,531
He's rocking the ship.

477
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,496
We're rocking the ship.

478
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,475
Aye. He's onto it.

479
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,509
He's rocking the ship.

480
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,982
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

481
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,713
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

482
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,345
Time it with the swell.

483
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,688
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

484
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,059
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

485
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,397
Now up...

486
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,299
...is down.

487
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,290
This was your idea.

488
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,360
Blessed sweet westerlies!

489
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:57,495
We're back!

490
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,608
It's the sunrise.

491
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,749
Parley?

492
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,295
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

493
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,144
All right, then!

494
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:40,341
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

495
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:44,113
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

496
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,586
I is arguing the point.

497
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:49,284
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

498
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,795
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

499
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,160
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

500
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:58,257
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

501
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,961
till there be none left but you.

502
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:06,331
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

503
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,433
Aye.

504
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:12,313
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

505
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,373
I'm still working on that.

506
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,944
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

507
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:25,958
Wet powder.

508
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:32,225
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

509
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,762
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.

510
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,899
There's fresh water on this island.

511
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:43,605
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

512
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,711
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

513
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,617
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

514
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:53,315
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

515
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,888
Temporarily.

516
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,268
Mind the boat.

517
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,223
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

518
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,235
Careful! Careful!

519
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,681
You stupid fish!

520
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,784
Actually it's a cephalopod.

521
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,446
Serves you right.

522
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,579
Pin, I bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.

523
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,820
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

524
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,919
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

525
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,829
We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.

526
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,493
Still thinking of running, Jack?

527
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,760
Think you can outrun the world?

528
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:25,278
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

529
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,044
...by and by, there be none left at all.

530
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:34,446
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

531
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,652
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

532
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,023
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

533
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,193
But passing on, that's dead certain.

534
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,562
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

535
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,369
It's our only hope, lad.

536
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:56,768
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

537
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,076
The world used to be a bigger place.

538
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,653
The world's still the same.

539
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,354
There's just... less in it.

540
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,980
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

541
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:41,587
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

542
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,648
- Singapore.
- Captain!

543
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,588
Hoy!

544
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,461
We got company!

545
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,639
He's the captain.

546
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,387
Sao Feng...

547
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:19,952
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

548
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,392
Jack Sparrow.

549
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,462
You paid me great insult once.

550
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,028
That doesn't sound like me.

551
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,105
Shall we just call it square, then?

552
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,807
Release her.

553
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:43,449
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

554
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,311
You heard Captain Turner.

555
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,451
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner"?

556
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,290
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

557
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,922
<i>I need the Pearl to free my father.</i>

558
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,489
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

559
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,868
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

560
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,133
It was my burden to bear.

561
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,675
<i>He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.</i>

562
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:14,807
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

563
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,787
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

564
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,464
I'm standing with them.

565
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:37,300
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

566
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:41,002
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

567
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,642
Here is your chance to find out.

568
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,718
Curious.

569
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:59,955
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

570
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:04,557
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

571
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,602
<i>can defeat the Flying Dutchman.</i>

572
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:10,772
And so despair leads to betrayal.

573
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:15,166
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

574
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,437
It's not here, Jack.

575
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,249
What? What isn't?

576
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,812
<i>The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,</i>

577
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,915
and so unavailable for use as leverage

578
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:32,654
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

579
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:35,993
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

580
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,191
By your death?

581
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,326
And yet here you are.

582
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,498
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

583
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,005
That's how I get by.

584
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:49,537
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

585
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:53,239
Ship oars.

586
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,141
Be on your guard, men.

587
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,652
My men are crew enough.

588
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,883
Company ship, company crew.

589
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,860
<i>You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.</i>

590
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,161
And so it was.

591
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,293
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

592
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:19,603
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

593
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:30,747
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

594
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,880
Square my debt with Jones...

595
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,789
...guarantee my freedom?

596
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,486
Of course.

597
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,495
It's just good business.

598
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:46,365
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

599
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,630
Everything.

600
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,402
Where are they meeting?

601
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,198
Who are the pirate lords?

602
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,373
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

603
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,142
Prepare the brig.

604
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:08,722
<i>Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.</i>

605
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:12,454
<i>He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?</i>

606
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:23,971
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

607
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,271
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

608
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:31,140
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

609
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,741
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

610
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:39,686
<i>- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.</i>

611
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,245
<i>Now the Pearl!</i>

612
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,192
And what do the Brethren have?

613
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,954
We have Calypso.

614
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,104
Calypso.

615
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,167
An old legend.

616
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:08,249
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

617
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:13,951
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

618
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:19,325
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

619
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,289
All the Court.

620
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,862
You can keep Barbossa.

621
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,997
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

622
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,598
And Turner. Especially Turner.

623
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,134
<i>The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,</i>

624
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:41,547
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

625
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:46,145
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

626
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,018
What interest is she to you?

627
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,928
What are you proposing, captain?

628
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,990
What be accepting, cap'n?

629
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,835
- The girl.
- What?

630
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,463
Jack.

631
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,938
I've just recalled.

632
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:12,003
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

633
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:14,812
So for what do I need you?

634
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,909
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

635
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,051
Out of the question.

636
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,918
It was not a question.

637
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,753
Points to the thing you want most.

638
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,020
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

639
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:28,325
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

640
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:31,426
- Dead.
- Done.

641
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,162
What? Not done.

642
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:36,796
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

643
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:37,964
Damn.

644
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,944
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

645
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:50,509
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

646
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,219
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

647
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,018
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

648
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:58,582
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

649
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,561
Then we have an accord?

650
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:05,992
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

651
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:09,265
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

652
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:12,273
...able to withstand blockade for years.

653
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:16,903
Then you'd be wishing, "If only there
was someone I had not killed inside

654
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,482
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside. "

655
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,250
And you can accomplish all this?

656
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,613
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

657
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,015
Who am I?

658
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,022
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

659
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:38,025
Done!

660
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,460
Man overboard!

661
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:27,742
You're mad.

662
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,281
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

663
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,134
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

664
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:04,415
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

665
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,316
Which ship do we follow?

666
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:13,054
<i>Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.</i>

667
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,554
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

668
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,732
She's going down!

669
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,327
Stand clear!

670
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:31,345
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

671
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,204
Sir.

672
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:22,621
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

673
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,566
Calypso.

674
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:29,136
Excuse me?

675
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:34,268
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

676
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:36,470
...but it is what we call you.

677
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,574
We being who?

678
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,116
You confirm it.

679
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:48,888
Confirm what?

680
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,755
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

681
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:59,426
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

682
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,436
They bound you to human form

683
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,962
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

684
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,804
To me.

685
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:15,248
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

686
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,911
Pretty speech from a captor.

687
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:21,979
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

688
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:25,316
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

689
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,562
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

690
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:35,433
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

691
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,997
I offer simply my desire.

692
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,966
And in return?

693
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:47,014
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

694
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:55,079
And if I should choose not?

695
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,560
Then I will take...

696
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:00,919
...your fury.

697
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,019
Sao Feng?

698
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:30,717
Here.

699
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,593
Please.

700
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,994
With all nine pieces of eight...

701
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,532
...you will be free.

702
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:49,503
Take it!

703
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:53,177
You are captain now.

704
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:55,373
Me?

705
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,616
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

706
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:07,287
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

707
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:12,291
Forgive me... Calypso.

708
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:22,635
Sao.

709
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,444
What did he tell you?

710
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,388
He made me captain.

711
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,890
Set! Fire!

712
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,360
You are not my captain.

713
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,968
Elizabeth.

714
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,397
James. James.

715
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,113
Thank God, you're alive.

716
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,373
Your father'll be overjoyed

717
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,283
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

718
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,483
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

719
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,424
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

720
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:14,491
Who among you
do you name as captain?

721
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:16,053
Captain. Her.

722
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,792
Her.

723
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:21,761
Captain?

724
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:25,500
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

725
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,776
The captain shall have my quarters.

726
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:31,812
Thank you, sir.

727
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,611
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

728
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,174
I swear.

729
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,178
I did not know.

730
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:43,384
Know what?
Which side you chose?

731
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,163
Well, now you do.

732
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:02,832
Bootstrap?

733
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:12,750
Bootstrap.

734
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,483
Bill Turner?

735
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:16,750
Bootstrap.

736
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:27,834
You know my name.

737
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:32,704
Yes, I know your son.

738
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,300
Will Turner.

739
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:38,838
William.

740
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,211
He made it. He's alive.

741
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:51,521
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

742
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,861
God's wounds. He's on his way.

743
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,296
Yes, Will is alive.

744
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,292
And he wants to help you.

745
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:09,403
He can't help me. He won't come.

746
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,736
But you're his father.

747
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,344
I know you.

748
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,741
He spoke of you.

749
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,883
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

750
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,282
Me?

751
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,556
You're Elizabeth.

752
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,397
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

753
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:37,160
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

754
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,606
Captain... Forever.

755
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,447
<i>The Dutchman
must always have a captain.</i>

756
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,242
And if he saves me...

757
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,317
...he loses you.

758
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,382
I see.

759
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,225
He won't pick me.

760
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,324
I wouldn't pick me.

761
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:09,927
Tell him not to come.

762
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,267
Tell him to stay away.

763
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,602
Tell him it's too late.

764
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,445
I'm already a part of the ship...

765
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,145
...and the crew.

766
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,311
Bootstrap.

767
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:33,293
You know my name.

768
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,289
You know my name.

769
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,363
Yes, I know your son.

770
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:42,063
William.

771
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,641
He's coming for me.

772
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,832
Wait and see.

773
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,276
You'll see.

774
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,444
He promised.

775
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,800
Swing her over.

776
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:15,765
Ready those lines.

777
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:28,675
Sir.

778
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,918
A breadcrumb trail.

779
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:38,323
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

780
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:43,558
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

781
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:48,859
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

782
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:52,969
We can only hope
to reach our destination

783
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,066
before they run out of bodies.

784
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,783
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

785
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:16,128
William, do you notice anything?

786
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:19,027
Rather...

787
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,961
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

788
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:26,730
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

789
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:28,275
Not as odd as this.

790
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:32,146
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

791
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:35,239
I said to myself, "Think like Jack. "

792
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,812
This is what you've arrived at?

793
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:41,219
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

794
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,120
...accomplish your own ends?

795
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:44,988
It's like you don't know me at all.

796
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:51,390
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

797
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:54,098
Ah.

798
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,228
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

799
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:02,166
I'm losing her, Jack.

800
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:06,847
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

801
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:11,012
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

802
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,750
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

803
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:17,892
...avoid the choice altogether.

804
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,194
Change the facts.

805
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:24,254
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

806
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:26,364
Who?

807
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:31,627
You?

808
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:37,376
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

809
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:40,972
<i>I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,</i>

810
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:42,812
your father's free from his debt,

811
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:45,614
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

812
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:49,521
<i>You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...</i>

813
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:53,550
- ... forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

814
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:57,655
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

815
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,058
You have to do the job though, Jack.

816
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:03,195
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

817
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:06,432
Or end up just like Jones.

818
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:10,501
I don't have the face for tentacles.

819
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,907
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

820
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,080
What's this for?

821
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:22,851
Think like me. It'll come to you.

822
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:38,504
My regards to Davy Jones.

823
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:45,245
I hate him.

824
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:50,944
Come with me.

825
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:55,750
Quickly.

826
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,061
What are you doing?

827
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:09,760
Choosing a side.

828
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:38,254
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

829
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,665
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

830
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,130
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

831
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:48,171
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

832
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:53,370
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

833
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:57,976
Come with us.

834
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,751
James, come with me.

835
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,859
Who goes there?

836
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,565
Go. I will follow.

837
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,829
You're lying.

838
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:20,473
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

839
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,368
...but never joined.

840
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:32,580
Go, now.

841
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,721
Back to your station, sailor.

842
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:47,831
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

843
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,597
That's an order.

844
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:53,334
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

845
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:56,172
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

846
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:59,145
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

847
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,614
All hands, prisoner escape!

848
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:04,180
- Belay that!
- James!

849
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:18,023
Prisoner escape!

850
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,129
James! No!

851
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:34,010
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

852
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,107
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

853
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,880
- To the captain's cabin!
- Aye!

854
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:43,947
Back to the ship.

855
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:49,863
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

856
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,266
I take that as a "no. "

857
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,304
Nice sword.

858
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:33,297
<i>The Dutchman is under my command.</i>

859
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,108
For now.

860
01:28:53,886 --> 01:28:55,945
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

861
01:28:56,022 --> 01:28:58,422
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

862
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:01,927
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

863
01:29:01,994 --> 01:29:04,428
You heard him. Step lively.

864
01:29:04,497 --> 01:29:06,829
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

865
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:09,732
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

866
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,030
Aye.

867
01:29:11,104 --> 01:29:15,234
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

868
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,900
What'd you call him?

869
01:29:18,077 --> 01:29:19,305
Larry.

870
01:29:23,015 --> 01:29:25,984
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

871
01:29:26,052 --> 01:29:28,043
But we agreed on ends only.

872
01:29:28,121 --> 01:29:31,090
The means are mine to decide.

873
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:33,648
Caution, Barbossa.

874
01:29:33,726 --> 01:29:37,958
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

875
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:41,864
Or what it mean if you fail me.

876
01:29:45,138 --> 01:29:48,005
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

877
01:29:48,074 --> 01:29:51,805
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

878
01:29:52,712 --> 01:29:55,237
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

879
01:29:55,782 --> 01:29:59,081
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

880
01:29:59,152 --> 01:30:01,347
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

881
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:06,283
Take this fishwife to the brig.

882
01:30:08,127 --> 01:30:10,254
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

883
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:42,083
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

884
01:30:42,161 --> 01:30:44,095
Apparently, you can.

885
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:46,291
I believe you know each other.

886
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:55,033
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

887
01:30:55,107 --> 01:30:56,472
Not yours.

888
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:58,103
His.

889
01:30:59,011 --> 01:31:01,138
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

890
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,079
Sparrow?

891
01:31:05,518 --> 01:31:07,110
You didn't tell him.

892
01:31:07,186 --> 01:31:10,417
<i>We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.</i>

893
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:14,091
What else have you not told me?

894
01:31:14,861 --> 01:31:18,854
There is an issue far more troublesome.

895
01:31:20,199 --> 01:31:23,794
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

896
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,134
Not a person.

897
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:29,933
A heathen god.

898
01:31:30,009 --> 01:31:33,536
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

899
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:36,946
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

900
01:31:37,016 --> 01:31:40,144
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

901
01:31:41,053 --> 01:31:43,647
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

902
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:46,254
No! They cannot!

903
01:31:46,325 --> 01:31:49,294
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

904
01:31:49,362 --> 01:31:52,331
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

905
01:31:54,867 --> 01:31:58,860
I showed them how to bind her.

906
01:31:58,938 --> 01:32:00,906
She could not be trusted.

907
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:02,804
I... She gave me no choice.

908
01:32:03,376 --> 01:32:06,311
We must act before they release her.

909
01:32:06,379 --> 01:32:08,142
You loved her.

910
01:32:09,382 --> 01:32:11,350
She's the one.

911
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,408
And then you betrayed her.

912
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:17,286
She pretended to love me.

913
01:32:17,356 --> 01:32:21,122
She betrayed me.

914
01:32:23,963 --> 01:32:27,490
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

915
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:33,466
Do not test me.

916
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:35,268
I hadn't finished that.

917
01:32:37,276 --> 01:32:39,403
You will free my father.

918
01:32:40,112 --> 01:32:42,580
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

919
01:32:42,648 --> 01:32:44,240
Along with my own.

920
01:32:44,317 --> 01:32:46,877
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

921
01:32:46,953 --> 01:32:49,717
We will expect fair value in return.

922
01:32:50,156 --> 01:32:54,092
There is only one price I will accept:

923
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,220
Calypso murdered.

924
01:32:59,131 --> 01:33:01,463
<i>Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.</i>

925
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:06,903
<i>Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.</i>

926
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:13,173
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

927
01:33:25,024 --> 01:33:27,584
What is it you want most?

928
01:33:59,525 --> 01:34:01,083
Look at them all.

929
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:05,256
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

930
01:34:06,065 --> 01:34:08,056
And I owe them all money.

931
01:34:13,472 --> 01:34:15,940
As he who issued summons,

932
01:34:16,008 --> 01:34:20,570
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

933
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:28,108
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

934
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:32,953
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

935
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:44,297
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

936
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:48,101
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

937
01:34:48,174 --> 01:34:52,508
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

938
01:34:53,212 --> 01:34:54,270
So change the name.

939
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:59,679
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

940
01:34:59,752 --> 01:35:02,084
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

941
01:35:05,725 --> 01:35:08,216
Master Ragetti, if you will.

942
01:35:09,028 --> 01:35:12,020
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

943
01:35:12,098 --> 01:35:15,192
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

944
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,162
Sparrow.

945
01:35:25,277 --> 01:35:28,906
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

946
01:35:28,981 --> 01:35:32,940
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

947
01:35:33,018 --> 01:35:34,610
Sao Feng is dead.

948
01:35:36,756 --> 01:35:38,849
<i>He fell to the Flying Dutchman.</i>

949
01:35:39,091 --> 01:35:40,217
The plagued ship.

950
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:44,861
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

951
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:47,899
<i>- Qu lo manden al diablo!
- Listen. Listen to me.</i>

952
01:35:47,967 --> 01:35:50,197
Our location has been betrayed.

953
01:35:50,269 --> 01:35:53,898
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

954
01:35:53,973 --> 01:35:57,670
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

955
01:35:58,043 --> 01:36:00,068
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

956
01:36:00,146 --> 01:36:02,876
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,

957
01:36:02,948 --> 01:36:05,439
what will we do now that they have?

958
01:36:05,518 --> 01:36:07,008
We fight.

959
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:14,526
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

960
01:36:14,593 --> 01:36:17,391
A well-supplied fortress.

961
01:36:17,997 --> 01:36:21,797
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

962
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:25,935
There be a third course.

963
01:36:27,173 --> 01:36:29,607
In another age, at this very spot,

964
01:36:29,675 --> 01:36:35,170
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

965
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,350
That was a mistake.

966
01:36:40,352 --> 01:36:43,116
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

967
01:36:44,089 --> 01:36:47,183
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

968
01:36:49,195 --> 01:36:51,629
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

969
01:36:51,697 --> 01:36:55,531
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

970
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:59,970
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

971
01:37:00,039 --> 01:37:01,870
You all know this to be true.

972
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,073
Gentlemen.

973
01:37:05,177 --> 01:37:06,337
Ladies.

974
01:37:10,983 --> 01:37:13,975
We must free Calypso.

975
01:37:22,995 --> 01:37:25,429
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

976
01:37:25,497 --> 01:37:29,399
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

977
01:37:29,468 --> 01:37:31,993
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

978
01:37:32,071 --> 01:37:34,972
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

979
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,974
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

980
01:37:37,042 --> 01:37:40,876
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

981
01:37:40,946 --> 01:37:43,881
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

982
01:37:56,128 --> 01:37:59,291
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

983
01:37:59,365 --> 01:38:01,959
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

984
01:38:02,034 --> 01:38:04,559
If they not be here already.

985
01:38:40,773 --> 01:38:43,139
My sweet.

986
01:38:43,442 --> 01:38:45,569
You come for me.

987
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:51,505
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

988
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:55,815
Trapped in this single form.

989
01:38:56,355 --> 01:38:58,721
Cut off from the sea.

990
01:38:59,191 --> 01:39:01,785
From all that I love.

991
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,461
From you.

992
01:39:05,164 --> 01:39:09,692
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

993
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:16,474
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

994
01:39:17,142 --> 01:39:21,704
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

995
01:39:23,482 --> 01:39:27,282
...you weren't there.

996
01:39:27,686 --> 01:39:30,280
Why weren't you there?

997
01:39:33,692 --> 01:39:35,319
It's my nature.

998
01:39:36,528 --> 01:39:41,124
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

999
01:39:42,301 --> 01:39:46,101
I do not love you.

1000
01:39:48,607 --> 01:39:52,304
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

1001
01:39:53,379 --> 01:39:55,506
But never cruel.

1002
01:39:56,348 --> 01:39:59,317
You have corrupted your purpose...

1003
01:40:00,686 --> 01:40:03,280
...and so your self.

1004
01:40:04,356 --> 01:40:09,225
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

1005
01:40:29,114 --> 01:40:32,174
Calypso.

1006
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,085
I will be free.

1007
01:40:39,024 --> 01:40:42,721
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

1008
01:40:43,495 --> 01:40:46,487
And we would be together always.

1009
01:40:47,132 --> 01:40:50,499
If only you had a heart to give.

1010
01:40:55,274 --> 01:40:57,333
Why did you come?

1011
01:41:14,626 --> 01:41:19,791
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

1012
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:22,190
The Brethren Court?

1013
01:41:24,169 --> 01:41:28,970
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

1014
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,737
...is how cruel I can be.

1015
01:41:36,315 --> 01:41:40,775
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

1016
01:41:42,254 --> 01:41:45,746
My heart will always belong to you.

1017
01:41:59,138 --> 01:42:02,938
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1018
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,306
We should be the ones to set her free.

1019
01:42:05,377 --> 01:42:09,711
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

1020
01:42:09,781 --> 01:42:12,249
Whose boons? Your boons?

1021
01:42:12,317 --> 01:42:15,309
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

1022
01:42:15,387 --> 01:42:19,790
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

1023
01:42:21,059 --> 01:42:22,083
Cuttlefish.

1024
01:42:23,295 --> 01:42:25,354
Aye.

1025
01:42:26,331 --> 01:42:28,959
Let us not, dear friends,

1026
01:42:29,034 --> 01:42:32,026
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

1027
01:42:32,571 --> 01:42:34,766
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1028
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,799
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

1029
01:42:38,877 --> 01:42:40,139
Human nature, isn't it?

1030
01:42:40,212 --> 01:42:42,237
Or... Or fish nature.

1031
01:42:42,314 --> 01:42:46,045
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.

1032
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:48,279
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

1033
01:42:48,353 --> 01:42:52,289
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

1034
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,490
Uh...

1035
01:42:57,229 --> 01:43:02,997
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

1036
01:43:03,068 --> 01:43:07,061
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

1037
01:43:08,574 --> 01:43:09,836
I rather doubt it.

1038
01:43:10,642 --> 01:43:14,635
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

1039
01:43:14,713 --> 01:43:17,580
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

1040
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:22,015
<i>Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.</i>

1041
01:43:22,087 --> 01:43:24,851
We are left with but one option.

1042
01:43:24,923 --> 01:43:28,791
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

1043
01:43:31,096 --> 01:43:34,031
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

1044
01:43:34,099 --> 01:43:37,330
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1045
01:43:37,402 --> 01:43:38,460
- Have so.
- Have not.

1046
01:43:38,604 --> 01:43:39,662
- Have so.
- Have not!

1047
01:43:39,805 --> 01:43:42,968
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

1048
01:43:43,041 --> 01:43:47,341
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1049
01:43:47,412 --> 01:43:51,610
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

1050
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:53,082
We must fight...

1051
01:43:53,852 --> 01:43:55,342
...to run away.

1052
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,752
- Aye!
- Aye!

1053
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:03,961
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1054
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:06,930
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1055
01:44:06,999 --> 01:44:09,559
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

1056
01:44:09,635 --> 01:44:14,163
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.

1057
01:44:15,173 --> 01:44:18,609
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

1058
01:44:20,245 --> 01:44:22,736
Hang the code. Who cares a...?

1059
01:44:30,756 --> 01:44:32,587
Code is the law.

1060
01:44:44,603 --> 01:44:46,594
You're in my way, boy.

1061
01:44:55,814 --> 01:44:58,442
- The code.
- The code.

1062
01:44:58,517 --> 01:45:00,781
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1063
01:45:18,804 --> 01:45:22,763
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

1064
01:45:25,644 --> 01:45:27,134
Sea turtles.

1065
01:45:41,927 --> 01:45:44,623
Ah. Barbossa is right.

1066
01:45:44,696 --> 01:45:46,186
Hang on a minute.

1067
01:45:47,666 --> 01:45:49,634
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

1068
01:45:49,701 --> 01:45:53,159
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries... "

1069
01:45:53,238 --> 01:45:54,227
Fancy that.

1070
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:56,774
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

1071
01:45:56,842 --> 01:45:58,503
And that's not likely to change.

1072
01:45:58,577 --> 01:46:00,602
- Not likely.
- Why not?

1073
01:46:00,746 --> 01:46:03,374
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

1074
01:46:03,448 --> 01:46:06,940
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1075
01:46:07,018 --> 01:46:08,110
I call for a vote.

1076
01:46:12,924 --> 01:46:15,290
I vote for Ammand the corsair.

1077
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,920
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1078
01:46:18,296 --> 01:46:20,958
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

1079
01:46:21,867 --> 01:46:23,801
Mistress Ching.

1080
01:46:23,869 --> 01:46:25,268
Gentleman Jocard.

1081
01:46:25,971 --> 01:46:28,531
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

1082
01:46:28,607 --> 01:46:30,370
Vallenueva!

1083
01:46:31,209 --> 01:46:32,540
Elizabeth Swann.

1084
01:46:33,578 --> 01:46:35,512
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1085
01:46:38,049 --> 01:46:39,676
Vote for me. Vote for me.

1086
01:46:42,154 --> 01:46:43,553
What you talking about?

1087
01:46:43,622 --> 01:46:44,714
No!

1088
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:48,419
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

1089
01:46:57,302 --> 01:46:58,496
Very well.

1090
01:47:01,873 --> 01:47:06,867
What say you, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?

1091
01:47:08,847 --> 01:47:11,179
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1092
01:47:12,017 --> 01:47:13,177
At dawn...

1093
01:47:14,753 --> 01:47:15,947
...we're at war.

1094
01:47:19,758 --> 01:47:23,353
And so we shall go to war.

1095
01:47:37,042 --> 01:47:38,031
What?

1096
01:47:39,010 --> 01:47:41,808
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

1097
01:47:42,347 --> 01:47:45,180
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

1098
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:49,208
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

1099
01:47:53,158 --> 01:47:57,254
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

1100
01:48:01,299 --> 01:48:02,459
How's Mum?

1101
01:48:09,407 --> 01:48:10,931
She looks great.

1102
01:48:32,364 --> 01:48:35,959
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

1103
01:48:59,324 --> 01:49:01,815
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

1104
01:49:10,769 --> 01:49:11,929
Parley?

1105
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:12,356
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

1106
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:16,628
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

1107
01:50:16,701 --> 01:50:21,229
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

1108
01:50:24,643 --> 01:50:26,338
My hands are clean in this.

1109
01:50:27,379 --> 01:50:28,539
Figuratively.

1110
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,548
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1111
01:50:31,616 --> 01:50:35,052
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1112
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:37,088
<i>Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.</i>

1113
01:50:38,023 --> 01:50:41,356
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1114
01:50:42,193 --> 01:50:46,061
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

1115
01:50:48,299 --> 01:50:53,202
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1116
01:50:54,406 --> 01:50:59,366
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

1117
01:51:00,145 --> 01:51:03,512
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

1118
01:51:03,581 --> 01:51:07,483
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

1119
01:51:07,552 --> 01:51:12,512
<i>One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.</i>

1120
01:51:13,191 --> 01:51:16,422
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1121
01:51:16,494 --> 01:51:18,894
- You escaped.
- Technically.

1122
01:51:18,963 --> 01:51:21,022
I propose an exchange.

1123
01:51:23,101 --> 01:51:24,966
Will leaves with us...

1124
01:51:25,704 --> 01:51:27,467
...and you can take Jack.

1125
01:51:29,574 --> 01:51:30,563
Done.

1126
01:51:31,242 --> 01:51:32,937
- Undone.
- Done.

1127
01:51:33,011 --> 01:51:36,538
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1128
01:51:36,614 --> 01:51:38,081
King.

1129
01:51:40,585 --> 01:51:44,646
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

1130
01:51:49,861 --> 01:51:53,558
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1131
01:51:56,234 --> 01:51:58,259
First to the finish, then?

1132
01:52:19,557 --> 01:52:22,117
Do you fear death?

1133
01:52:23,661 --> 01:52:25,424
You've no idea.

1134
01:52:28,366 --> 01:52:30,231
Advise your Brethren,

1135
01:52:30,301 --> 01:52:33,395
you can fight, and all of you will die.

1136
01:52:33,471 --> 01:52:37,999
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

1137
01:52:38,576 --> 01:52:40,669
You murdered my father.

1138
01:52:42,046 --> 01:52:44,037
He chose his own fate.

1139
01:52:44,682 --> 01:52:47,412
And you have chosen yours.

1140
01:52:47,485 --> 01:52:49,544
We will fight.

1141
01:52:50,155 --> 01:52:51,952
And you will die.

1142
01:52:56,761 --> 01:52:58,388
So be it.

1143
01:53:04,402 --> 01:53:05,767
King?

1144
01:53:05,837 --> 01:53:08,670
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

1145
01:53:09,174 --> 01:53:11,506
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

1146
01:53:17,949 --> 01:53:18,938
Bravo!

1147
01:53:19,984 --> 01:53:24,182
<i>You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.</i>

1148
01:53:24,255 --> 01:53:25,984
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1149
01:53:26,057 --> 01:53:29,117
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1150
01:53:30,395 --> 01:53:31,555
Go away.

1151
01:53:31,629 --> 01:53:34,792
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1152
01:53:35,633 --> 01:53:36,725
Stab the heart.

1153
01:53:42,607 --> 01:53:47,738
<i>Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.</i>

1154
01:53:51,549 --> 01:53:53,141
Then again...

1155
01:53:53,985 --> 01:53:55,680
...if you're in the brig...

1156
01:53:57,188 --> 01:53:59,179
...who's to stab the heart?

1157
01:54:01,693 --> 01:54:04,560
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1158
01:54:06,297 --> 01:54:07,995
Peanut.

1159
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:11,295
<i>We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.</i>

1160
01:54:11,366 --> 01:54:15,530
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

1161
01:54:16,138 --> 01:54:19,574
Barbossa, you can't release her.

1162
01:54:19,641 --> 01:54:21,541
We need to give Jack a chance.

1163
01:54:22,144 --> 01:54:27,081
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

1164
01:54:29,951 --> 01:54:31,248
No longer.

1165
01:54:33,255 --> 01:54:34,950
The enemy...

1166
01:54:36,124 --> 01:54:38,456
...has opted for oblivion.

1167
01:54:41,596 --> 01:54:43,223
Ready the fleet.

1168
01:54:43,465 --> 01:54:46,195
- To your stations.
- To your stations.

1169
01:54:52,674 --> 01:54:55,837
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

1170
01:54:55,911 --> 01:54:57,173
Aye.

1171
01:54:57,612 --> 01:55:00,877
The items brought together, done.

1172
01:55:00,949 --> 01:55:03,349
Items to be burned...

1173
01:55:04,019 --> 01:55:06,180
...and someone must speak the words:

1174
01:55:06,254 --> 01:55:09,746
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds. "

1175
01:55:09,825 --> 01:55:10,814
Is that it?

1176
01:55:11,393 --> 01:55:15,454
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1177
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:17,225
Ooh!

1178
01:55:21,303 --> 01:55:26,605
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

1179
01:55:36,184 --> 01:55:40,245
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

1180
01:55:45,193 --> 01:55:46,217
He didn't...

1181
01:55:46,695 --> 01:55:48,560
You have to say it right.

1182
01:55:57,172 --> 01:55:58,161
Calypso...

1183
01:56:03,545 --> 01:56:05,979
...I release you from your human bonds.

1184
01:56:24,566 --> 01:56:26,261
Tia Dalma.

1185
01:56:28,703 --> 01:56:30,034
Calypso.

1186
01:56:32,507 --> 01:56:36,671
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

1187
01:56:39,114 --> 01:56:43,016
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

1188
01:56:44,286 --> 01:56:46,049
Davy Jones.

1189
01:57:00,068 --> 01:57:03,902
This is it! This is it!

1190
01:57:46,514 --> 01:57:48,277
Calypso!

1191
01:57:50,485 --> 01:57:55,616
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

1192
01:57:57,525 --> 01:58:02,394
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favor.

1193
01:58:05,433 --> 01:58:08,425
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

1194
01:58:08,837 --> 01:58:13,297
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

1195
01:58:13,808 --> 01:58:14,968
...or mine.

1196
01:59:12,901 --> 01:59:14,163
Is that it?

1197
01:59:16,905 --> 01:59:18,896
Why, she's no help at all.

1198
01:59:22,610 --> 01:59:23,907
What now?

1199
01:59:24,813 --> 01:59:26,075
Nothing.

1200
01:59:26,881 --> 01:59:29,816
Our final hope has failed us.

1201
01:59:57,278 --> 02:00:00,270
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

1202
02:00:00,348 --> 02:00:04,284
<i>We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.</i>

1203
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:06,650
There's only a fool's chance.

1204
02:00:06,721 --> 02:00:09,485
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1205
02:00:09,557 --> 02:00:12,822
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1206
02:00:17,799 --> 02:00:19,289
You're right.

1207
02:00:24,672 --> 02:00:26,640
Then what shall we die for?

1208
02:00:30,345 --> 02:00:31,744
You will listen to me.

1209
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,742
Listen!

1210
02:00:36,684 --> 02:00:41,747
<i>The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.</i>

1211
02:00:42,323 --> 02:00:43,756
And what will they see?

1212
02:00:44,259 --> 02:00:47,592
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1213
02:00:47,662 --> 02:00:51,894
No, they will see free men and freedom!

1214
02:00:51,966 --> 02:00:55,402
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1215
02:00:55,470 --> 02:01:00,703
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

1216
02:01:03,411 --> 02:01:05,709
By the sweat of our brows,

1217
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:08,112
and the strength of our backs...

1218
02:01:08,516 --> 02:01:11,508
...and the courage of our hearts.

1219
02:01:14,222 --> 02:01:15,712
Gentlemen...

1220
02:01:18,426 --> 02:01:19,893
...hoist the colors.

1221
02:01:21,930 --> 02:01:23,363
Hoist the colors.

1222
02:01:23,431 --> 02:01:25,729
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!

1223
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,859
Aye.

1224
02:01:27,936 --> 02:01:31,599
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

1225
02:01:33,575 --> 02:01:35,668
Hoist the colors!

1226
02:02:26,728 --> 02:02:28,923
We have a favorable wind, sir.

1227
02:02:29,664 --> 02:02:30,858
Oh, so we do.

1228
02:02:31,499 --> 02:02:34,468
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1229
02:02:35,503 --> 02:02:37,562
That should brighten his day.

1230
02:02:41,509 --> 02:02:45,445
To arms! We give no quarter!

1231
02:02:54,689 --> 02:02:56,486
Calypso.

1232
02:03:23,117 --> 02:03:26,052
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

1233
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:27,178
That's a bad sign.

1234
02:03:27,255 --> 02:03:32,192
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

1235
02:03:46,808 --> 02:03:48,639
Maelstrom!

1236
02:03:51,846 --> 02:03:53,871
Captain Barbossa!

1237
02:03:54,816 --> 02:03:56,841
We need you at the helm.

1238
02:03:59,354 --> 02:04:01,720
Aye, that be true.

1239
02:04:04,025 --> 02:04:08,985
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.

1240
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:13,132
Dying is the day worth living for.

1241
02:04:23,444 --> 02:04:25,071
Veer off!

1242
02:04:25,146 --> 02:04:27,410
She'll not harm us.

1243
02:04:27,915 --> 02:04:30,247
Full-bore and into the abyss.

1244
02:04:30,952 --> 02:04:32,283
Are you mad?

1245
02:04:32,353 --> 02:04:35,322
Ha! You afraid to get wet?

1246
02:04:44,866 --> 02:04:47,232
She's on our stern and gaining.

1247
02:04:47,301 --> 02:04:52,864
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1248
02:04:59,847 --> 02:05:02,247
Bow cannons!

1249
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:05,218
Blow the cannons!

1250
02:05:16,097 --> 02:05:18,998
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

1251
02:05:19,067 --> 02:05:23,970
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1252
02:05:25,173 --> 02:05:27,266
Prepare to broadside.

1253
02:05:37,719 --> 02:05:39,983
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

1254
02:05:40,054 --> 02:05:43,888
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

1255
02:05:51,065 --> 02:05:54,660
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

1256
02:05:54,736 --> 02:05:56,931
Hinges. Hinges.

1257
02:05:57,004 --> 02:05:58,301
Think like the whelp.

1258
02:05:58,372 --> 02:05:59,805
Half-barrel hinges.

1259
02:05:59,907 --> 02:06:01,204
Leverage.

1260
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:08,410
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1261
02:06:09,884 --> 02:06:12,717
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1262
02:06:12,787 --> 02:06:14,345
Nobody move.

1263
02:06:15,423 --> 02:06:17,186
I dropped me brain.

1264
02:06:27,068 --> 02:06:29,832
Batten down the hatches!

1265
02:06:31,139 --> 02:06:33,164
Stand to your guns.

1266
02:06:33,741 --> 02:06:36,232
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts.

1267
02:06:40,481 --> 02:06:42,915
Main battery at the ready!

1268
02:06:47,488 --> 02:06:51,754
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.

1269
02:06:56,330 --> 02:06:58,059
Fire!

1270
02:06:58,432 --> 02:07:02,766
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

1271
02:07:03,704 --> 02:07:04,864
Fire!

1272
02:07:08,743 --> 02:07:10,301
Fire!

1273
02:07:19,887 --> 02:07:21,354
Come on, men.

1274
02:07:31,365 --> 02:07:35,995
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1275
02:07:40,374 --> 02:07:42,604
Halt there or we'll shoot.

1276
02:07:44,111 --> 02:07:45,237
Good one.

1277
02:07:47,715 --> 02:07:49,740
I just come to get me effects.

1278
02:07:51,352 --> 02:07:55,550
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

1279
02:07:55,623 --> 02:07:57,887
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1280
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:03,922
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

1281
02:08:03,998 --> 02:08:05,659
I blame the fish people.

1282
02:08:05,733 --> 02:08:10,102
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

1283
02:08:10,171 --> 02:08:13,402
automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?

1284
02:08:13,474 --> 02:08:15,840
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

1285
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:20,813
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1286
02:08:20,882 --> 02:08:24,318
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

1287
02:08:31,859 --> 02:08:33,884
Prepare to board!

1288
02:08:35,529 --> 02:08:36,723
Cover!

1289
02:08:53,381 --> 02:08:55,110
No!

1290
02:09:21,042 --> 02:09:26,002
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

1291
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:29,982
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1292
02:09:31,285 --> 02:09:33,048
To my great regret.

1293
02:09:34,355 --> 02:09:35,481
But...

1294
02:09:38,225 --> 02:09:40,216
...never too late to learn, eh?

1295
02:09:48,402 --> 02:09:49,869
Whoa!

1296
02:09:56,510 --> 02:09:59,843
The chest, hand it over.

1297
02:09:59,914 --> 02:10:01,745
I can set you free, mate.

1298
02:10:01,816 --> 02:10:04,842
My freedom was forfeit long ago.

1299
02:10:51,899 --> 02:10:53,230
Elizabeth.

1300
02:10:57,004 --> 02:10:58,232
Elizabeth.

1301
02:10:59,273 --> 02:11:00,638
Will you marry me?

1302
02:11:02,443 --> 02:11:04,274
I don't think now's the best time.

1303
02:11:08,082 --> 02:11:10,141
Now may be the only time.

1304
02:11:15,356 --> 02:11:16,550
I love you.

1305
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:25,021
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1306
02:11:25,866 --> 02:11:27,163
Barbossa.

1307
02:11:28,636 --> 02:11:30,069
Marry us.

1308
02:11:31,172 --> 02:11:33,834
I'm a little busy at the moment.

1309
02:11:40,047 --> 02:11:42,038
Barbossa, now.

1310
02:11:43,717 --> 02:11:45,048
Fine, then.

1311
02:11:55,930 --> 02:11:59,058
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

1312
02:11:59,767 --> 02:12:03,294
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

1313
02:12:08,175 --> 02:12:11,201
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1314
02:12:11,278 --> 02:12:13,246
- I do.
- Great.

1315
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:21,984
Will Turner, do you take me...

1316
02:12:23,257 --> 02:12:24,986
...to be your wife...

1317
02:12:29,396 --> 02:12:31,364
...in sickness and in health...

1318
02:12:32,266 --> 02:12:34,496
...with health being the less likely?

1319
02:12:41,709 --> 02:12:42,937
I do.

1320
02:12:45,212 --> 02:12:48,113
As captain, I now pronounce you...

1321
02:12:51,085 --> 02:12:52,916
You may kiss...

1322
02:13:01,795 --> 02:13:03,228
You may kiss...

1323
02:13:08,202 --> 02:13:09,863
Just kiss.

1324
02:13:48,576 --> 02:13:50,237
Leave it.

1325
02:14:02,489 --> 02:14:05,151
You can do nothing without the key.

1326
02:14:05,226 --> 02:14:06,693
I already have the key.

1327
02:14:07,962 --> 02:14:09,395
No, you don't.

1328
02:14:10,898 --> 02:14:12,195
Oh, that key.

1329
02:14:48,269 --> 02:14:49,258
No!

1330
02:15:16,330 --> 02:15:18,821
Oi. My pistol.

1331
02:15:46,527 --> 02:15:47,926
Turner.

1332
02:15:52,933 --> 02:15:53,922
Fire!

1333
02:15:59,873 --> 02:16:01,431
Thank you, Jack.

1334
02:16:31,271 --> 02:16:32,795
Stop! It's me.

1335
02:16:35,309 --> 02:16:38,210
It's Will. Your son.

1336
02:17:07,007 --> 02:17:08,372
Ha!

1337
02:17:39,339 --> 02:17:40,806
Go!

1338
02:17:59,226 --> 02:18:03,287
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

1339
02:18:03,363 --> 02:18:05,695
That's why I brought this.

1340
02:18:25,118 --> 02:18:28,349
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1341
02:18:36,964 --> 02:18:38,295
Missed.

1342
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:44,369
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

1343
02:19:00,921 --> 02:19:04,220
Ah. Love.

1344
02:19:04,591 --> 02:19:08,083
A dreadful bond.

1345
02:19:08,862 --> 02:19:13,856
And yet, so easily severed.

1346
02:19:13,934 --> 02:19:19,133
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

1347
02:19:19,206 --> 02:19:20,639
Do you?

1348
02:19:31,385 --> 02:19:35,082
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

1349
02:19:35,689 --> 02:19:40,092
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1350
02:19:40,961 --> 02:19:43,395
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1351
02:19:43,964 --> 02:19:45,522
Is it?

1352
02:20:11,291 --> 02:20:12,417
Will?

1353
02:20:14,027 --> 02:20:16,621
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

1354
02:20:22,502 --> 02:20:24,163
William?

1355
02:20:24,605 --> 02:20:26,300
My son.

1356
02:20:38,185 --> 02:20:41,677
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

1357
02:20:45,392 --> 02:20:49,294
You will not forestall my judgment.

1358
02:21:05,078 --> 02:21:06,739
Calypso.

1359
02:21:12,586 --> 02:21:18,047
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

1360
02:21:49,022 --> 02:21:50,080
No.

1361
02:21:54,194 --> 02:21:55,684
No, no.

1362
02:21:55,762 --> 02:21:57,491
No!

1363
02:21:58,765 --> 02:22:03,065
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1364
02:22:03,136 --> 02:22:06,628
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1365
02:22:06,707 --> 02:22:08,732
Don't leave me.

1366
02:22:10,043 --> 02:22:11,738
Don't. No!

1367
02:22:11,812 --> 02:22:13,677
I won't leave you.

1368
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:25,985
<i>The Dutchman must have a captain.</i>

1369
02:22:29,329 --> 02:22:31,320
Hold on.

1370
02:23:25,051 --> 02:23:26,712
Thank goodness, Jack.

1371
02:23:26,787 --> 02:23:30,746
<i>The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,</i>

1372
02:23:30,824 --> 02:23:34,920
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1373
02:23:34,995 --> 02:23:37,623
Never actually been one for tradition.

1374
02:23:42,602 --> 02:23:45,628
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

1375
02:23:45,705 --> 02:23:47,969
Belay that,
or we'll be a sitting duck.

1376
02:23:48,041 --> 02:23:49,372
Belay that "belay that. "

1377
02:23:49,442 --> 02:23:51,205
- But the arma...
- Belay.

1378
02:23:51,311 --> 02:23:53,575
<i>- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.</i>

1379
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:08,685
What are they waiting for?

1380
02:24:09,663 --> 02:24:12,632
He expects us to honor our agreement.

1381
02:24:14,801 --> 02:24:17,634
Ready guns and gun ports.

1382
02:24:21,374 --> 02:24:26,277
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1383
02:24:53,139 --> 02:24:55,630
Ah, she survived.

1384
02:25:20,767 --> 02:25:24,134
- Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.

1385
02:25:24,771 --> 02:25:26,932
Full canvas.

1386
02:25:27,007 --> 02:25:29,373
Aye, full canvas.

1387
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:55,197
Orders, sir.

1388
02:25:58,672 --> 02:25:59,798
Sir!

1389
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:01,429
Cap'n.

1390
02:26:01,875 --> 02:26:04,503
- Fire.
- Fire!

1391
02:26:04,577 --> 02:26:06,636
- Fire!
- Fire!

1392
02:26:06,713 --> 02:26:08,681
Fire, all!

1393
02:26:19,259 --> 02:26:22,160
Orders? Orders, sir?

1394
02:26:34,541 --> 02:26:36,008
Sir, what do you command?

1395
02:26:36,643 --> 02:26:37,974
It's just...

1396
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:41,775
...good business.

1397
02:26:43,483 --> 02:26:44,814
Abandon ship!

1398
02:26:44,884 --> 02:26:48,911
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

1399
02:28:14,674 --> 02:28:16,403
They're turning away!

1400
02:28:28,755 --> 02:28:30,620
Wind in your sails.

1401
02:28:35,862 --> 02:28:37,921
Shiver me timbers.

1402
02:28:58,918 --> 02:29:00,977
Captain Turner!

1403
02:29:15,635 --> 02:29:17,728
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

1404
02:29:18,938 --> 02:29:21,930
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

1405
02:29:22,008 --> 02:29:23,703
Hooray!

1406
02:29:25,945 --> 02:29:27,708
Now go and get it.

1407
02:29:46,132 --> 02:29:47,724
Orders, sir?

1408
02:29:52,005 --> 02:29:56,032
<i>You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.</i>

1409
02:29:56,109 --> 02:29:58,100
Aye.

1410
02:29:58,178 --> 02:30:00,578
That's a fine thing, but...

1411
02:30:02,182 --> 02:30:06,881
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

1412
02:30:06,953 --> 02:30:08,545
If you'll have me.

1413
02:30:12,592 --> 02:30:14,457
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.

1414
02:30:15,828 --> 02:30:17,819
Aye, Captain Turner.

1415
02:30:32,779 --> 02:30:35,441
This ship
has a purpose again.

1416
02:30:35,515 --> 02:30:37,540
And where we are bound...

1417
02:30:38,218 --> 02:30:40,686
...she cannot come.

1418
02:30:40,753 --> 02:30:42,721
One day ashore.

1419
02:30:42,789 --> 02:30:44,882
Ten years at sea.

1420
02:30:45,858 --> 02:30:48,691
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

1421
02:30:50,863 --> 02:30:52,854
Depends on the one day.

1422
02:30:55,635 --> 02:30:58,195
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

1423
02:31:02,008 --> 02:31:03,999
The oars are inside.

1424
02:31:15,622 --> 02:31:17,590
Mrs. Turner.

1425
02:31:22,495 --> 02:31:24,053
Goodbye, poppet.

1426
02:31:29,869 --> 02:31:31,166
Jack.

1427
02:31:32,405 --> 02:31:34,930
It would never
have worked out between us.

1428
02:31:38,278 --> 02:31:40,746
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1429
02:31:44,183 --> 02:31:46,048
Once was quite enough.

1430
02:31:48,454 --> 02:31:50,445
Thank you.

1431
02:32:09,776 --> 02:32:11,767
I'm going to need the other one.

1432
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:45,767
It's nearly sunset.

1433
02:33:04,931 --> 02:33:06,626
It's always belonged to you.

1434
02:33:12,405 --> 02:33:13,963
Will you keep it safe?

1435
02:33:15,775 --> 02:33:16,935
Yes.

1436
02:33:20,947 --> 02:33:22,039
Yes.

1437
02:33:41,968 --> 02:33:42,957
Will!

1438
02:33:58,551 --> 02:34:00,712
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1439
02:34:29,582 --> 02:34:32,881
Granted it tends to list to port,
and has been, on occasion,

1440
02:34:32,952 --> 02:34:35,182
known to frighten young women.

1441
02:34:35,254 --> 02:34:39,623
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

1442
02:34:40,326 --> 02:34:41,452
Is that it?

1443
02:34:42,061 --> 02:34:43,585
<i>The Black Pearl?</i>

1444
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:46,323
It's not very big.

1445
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:48,799
Love, that is a dinghy.

1446
02:34:48,868 --> 02:34:54,238
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish and...

1447
02:34:54,707 --> 02:34:57,835
...gone. Why is it gone?

1448
02:34:58,778 --> 02:35:00,370
Is that it there?

1449
02:35:01,581 --> 02:35:02,707
Yes, there it is.

1450
02:35:03,716 --> 02:35:04,944
Why is it there?

1451
02:35:06,319 --> 02:35:07,877
It's much larger up close.

1452
02:35:07,954 --> 02:35:10,320
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

1453
02:35:10,389 --> 02:35:14,325
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

1454
02:35:14,393 --> 02:35:16,987
- Not what he said.
- I never!

1455
02:35:18,798 --> 02:35:22,928
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1456
02:35:23,002 --> 02:35:25,835
The ship? We're on the ship.

1457
02:35:28,474 --> 02:35:31,341
Jack! The ship's gone!

1458
02:35:31,410 --> 02:35:32,468
Really?

1459
02:35:34,514 --> 02:35:37,779
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1460
02:35:37,850 --> 02:35:41,217
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

1461
02:35:41,287 --> 02:35:42,777
No, I don't love you.

1462
02:35:42,855 --> 02:35:45,949
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1463
02:35:46,025 --> 02:35:48,755
It is pronounced "egregious. "

1464
02:35:48,828 --> 02:35:52,855
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1465
02:35:52,932 --> 02:35:55,628
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

1466
02:35:55,701 --> 02:35:59,432
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Sawy?

1467
02:36:11,984 --> 02:36:14,919
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1468
02:36:18,824 --> 02:36:22,851
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

1469
02:36:22,929 --> 02:36:24,021
Sea turtles?

1470
02:36:24,297 --> 02:36:26,527
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

1471
02:36:26,599 --> 02:36:29,261
All men up the ratlines.

1472
02:36:29,669 --> 02:36:32,467
All men up the ratlines!

1473
02:36:37,610 --> 02:36:39,840
Oh, you want a taste of this?

1474
02:36:41,347 --> 02:36:44,544
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

1475
02:36:44,617 --> 02:36:47,245
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

1476
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:48,309
Sir?

1477
02:36:49,689 --> 02:36:52,214
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

1478
02:36:52,291 --> 02:36:54,782
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

1479
02:36:54,927 --> 02:36:57,828
- Again.
- Is that so?

1480
02:36:58,097 --> 02:37:01,760
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

1481
02:37:01,834 --> 02:37:04,530
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1482
02:37:04,604 --> 02:37:06,765
- On the charts.
- Aye.

1483
02:37:06,872 --> 02:37:08,271
With our own eyes.

1484
02:37:08,341 --> 02:37:11,936
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

1485
02:37:12,378 --> 02:37:14,209
Ah.

1486
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:16,510
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1487
02:37:16,916 --> 02:37:19,441
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1488
02:37:19,518 --> 02:37:23,249
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

1489
02:37:34,033 --> 02:37:35,898
Sparrow.
