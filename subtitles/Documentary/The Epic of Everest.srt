Hi there.

323
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,380
-Sorry.
-That's fine.

324
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,506
Um...

325
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,967
So Rob and Harold and Mike will tell you

326
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,094
all sorts of stuff about mountaineering,

327
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,179
but from a medical standpoint

328
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,766
getting you to the top of Everest
is really about oxygen.

329
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,518
And the lack of it.

330
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,436
To give you the best chance of summiting

331
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,188
you need to prepare your bodies

332
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,856
for the thin air up there.

333
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,567
So, over the next month,
before the final ascent

334
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,570
you're gonna make
three partial acclimatizing ascents

335
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,864
returning here to Base Camp after each one.

336
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,534
ROB: <i>The bad news is that each ascen</i>t

337
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,411
<i>begins and ends with the Icefall</i>.

338
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,123
<i>I'm sorry, but there is no way around it</i>.

339
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,166
<i>There are millions of tons of glacial ic</i>e

<i>continually moving day and night</i>.

341
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,546
<i>You got seracs the size of tower blocks</i>,

342
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,216
you got crevasses so deep
they probably don't even have a bottom.

343
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,719
It is not a place that
you wanna get caught hanging out in,

344
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,512
especially when the sun hits it.

345
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,763
So we're gonna be up nice and early

346
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,057
and through that as soon as possible.

347
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,392
Now the Sherpas have gone ahead

348
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,893
<i>and fixed the ladders across the crevasse</i>s

349
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,271
<i>and we've made it as safe as we possibly can</i>.

350
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,565
<i>But that is not to say
that it is completely safe</i>.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

642
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:36,683
Okay?

00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:41,938
We're all professionals here.

645
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,273
We'll work together
and we'll get the job done. Yes?

646
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,400
-SCOTT: All right.
-Yeah.

647
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:48,236
We're planning on stashing,
what, eight bottles of O

648
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,612
up at the South Summit.

649
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,739
ANATOLI: Well, I'm not using O.
ROB: What do you mean?

650
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:53,074
You're not using oxygen at all?

651
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,283
Come on, man. You know you want to.

652
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,785
English air. Don't need it.

653
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,079
ROB: Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

654
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,748
You have people's lives in your hands.
It's a job.

655
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,418
Never used it. Never will.

656
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,753
Bigger problems if you run out.

657
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,880
Okay.

658
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,966
I'll put some more bottles of O up there.

659
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,551
-ROB: All right, that'll be good.
-All right.

660
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,594
Just so long as you guys are clear.

661
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:15,013
If you work for me, you use oxygen,

662
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,472
otherwise you don't work for me.

663
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:18,016
You don't have to ask, mate.

664
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,600
I've been up there before without O's, Rob.

665
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:21,185
I don't need to do it with clients.

666
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,479
ROB: All right, next we have to fix ropes.

667
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,024
-SCOTT: Yeah.
-Particularly above the Lhotse Face.

668
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,984
Hillary Step need new fixed rope.

669

And South-East Ridge as well.

670
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:30,778
ROB: Yes, it does. Well...

671
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,196
My idea is that we work together

672
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,281
and we fix ropes together.

673
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,490
We share the duties.

674
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:35,700
-Okay?
-SCOTT: Sounds good.

675
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,452
ROB: All right,
you and Lopsang maybe get together.

676
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:40,330
Talk about who wants
to fix what and where, okay?

677
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,541
Only essentials. I'm not
gonna tell you what to pack,

678
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,460
but be brutal. Okay?

679
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,795
One pound down here is like 10 up there.

No, no.

"If you climb one more mountain,
I will divorce you."

is that I kind of forgot to tell her.

to tell her you're climbing Everest!

Yeah, I have kids, but, I thought I told you,

750
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,787
there's an elementary school, back home.

751
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,498
And I've been going
and talking to the kids there

752
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:32,085
and they actually helped me
raise some of the money to come

753
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:35,380
and gave me a flag
to plant on the summit, and...

They see a regular guy can,

you know, follow impossible dreams,

757
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,474

Rob's still up there right now.

1760
01:46:26,386 --> 01:46:28,429
And Doug? What's he up to?

1761
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:35,436
Doug's gone, Beck.

1762
01:46:51,411 --> 01:46:52,620
I don't know, no one's ever tried

1763
01:46:52,662 --> 01:46:54,122
to fly higher than Base Camp before,

1764
01:46:54,163 --> 01:46:55,957
they're gonna give it a go.

1765
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,626
You find an LZ,
just mark it out with whatever you can.

1766
01:46:58,668 --> 01:47:01,170
Okay, worth a try. Thanks, Guy.

1767
01:47:01,254 --> 01:47:02,672
-Yeah?
-Grab a Gatorade.

1768
01:47:02,755 --> 01:47:05,091
Got a chopper coming in,
we need to make an LZ.

1769
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:07,302
We got a chopper coming in!

1770
01:47:08,636 --> 01:47:10,471
Clear everyone back to the tents!

1771
01:47:11,264 --> 01:47:12,265
Thanks.

1772
01:47:12,307 --> 01:47:14,142
Keep it clear, keep this whole area clear.

1773
01:47:14,225 --> 01:47:15,268
MAN: Back away.

1774
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:17,270
DAVID: Come on, come on.

1775
01:47:22,025 --> 01:47:23,484
MAN: (ON RADIO) <i>Army 45, keep updating</i>.

1776
01:47:24,152 --> 01:47:26,362
MADAN: <i>Lukla Tower, we're doing fine</i>.

1777
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:34,037
-It's not possible!
-(INSTRUMENTS BLARING)

1778
01:47:34,329 --> 01:47:36,372
You land here, we'll never get back up.

1779
01:47:41,669 --> 01:47:43,171
Gonna kill us!

1780
01:47:43,212 --> 01:47:45,006
Okay, Major, let's go back.

1781
01:48:03,816 --> 01:48:04,817
CO-PILOT: That's it!

1782
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:07,487
We can't get any more out.
It's as light as we're gonna get it!

1783
01:48:07,528 --> 01:48:09,238
MADAN: Time to go then, Major.

1784
01:48:09,322 --> 01:48:11,616
(BOTH SPEAKING NEPALI)

1785
01:48:23,252 --> 01:48:25,213
DAVID: Right here, right here!

1786
01:48:27,548 --> 01:48:29,425
Come on! You can do it!

1787
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:01,082
ED: Come on, buddy. You're nearly there.

1788
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,004
Okay, come on.

1789
01:49:07,005 --> 01:49:08,047
(GROANING)

1790
01:49:09,007 --> 01:49:10,633
MADAN: One person. Only one person.

1791
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:13,594
DAVID: Yeah, it's just him, just one! There.

1792
01:49:13,636 --> 01:49:15,096
ED: There you go.

1793
01:49:18,308 --> 01:49:19,726
You're good!

1794
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:23,563
I'm going to lift the tail up,
to fly us over the edge.

1795
01:49:23,604 --> 01:49:25,815
Fall a bit, until the blades catch on the air.

1796
01:49:25,898 --> 01:49:27,108
Is that okay with you?

1797
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:29,152
BECK: I'm with you.
MADAN: Good man.

1798
01:50:48,690 --> 01:50:51,651
Get yourself inside, go on.

1799
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:56,030
Oh, Anatoli.

1800
01:51:02,412 --> 01:51:05,248
(SOBBING) I'm so sorry, Helen.

1801
01:51:05,331 --> 01:51:07,542
Come on, let's get you inside.

-(GASPS)
-(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

1803
01:51:29,397 --> 01:51:30,732
Hi, Peachy.

1804
01:51:35,737 --> 01:51:36,904
Hey.

1805
01:51:39,449 --> 01:51:40,825

1806
01:51:49,876 --> 01:51:52,420
Thank you so much, darling.
