1
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:44,180
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:48,060
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:50,420
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:02,260
My son...

5
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:47,101
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:54,941
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,782
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:00,942
... because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:05,542
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:07,942
He never speaks.

11
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:10,302
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:15,262
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:18,862
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:22,782
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:33,222
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,942
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,743
He's all I have left.

18
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:46,943
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:57,943
Move and I'll kill him!

20
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,303
Run, Vito!

21
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:07,983
Kill him!

22
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:21,304
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

23
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:24,744
You understand?

24
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:38,424
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

25
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:05,384
Vito, we're praying for you!

26
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,385
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

27
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:17,185
... turn him over to us.

28
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:20,545
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

29
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:24,665
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

30
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:40,706
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

31
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,811
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

32
00:27:18,532 --> 00:27:19,972
I know, I know.

33
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,734
Your family's still called Corleone.

34
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:11,814
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

35
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:15,734
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

36
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:17,814
... and doesn't eat in Miami...

37
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:19,894
... with Hyman Roth!

38
00:30:57,297 --> 00:31:02,417
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

39
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:13,536
Cicci, the door...

40
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:39,871
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

41
00:42:59,513 --> 00:43:03,711
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

42
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:16,431
I left Naples. I left Mama.

43
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:19,472
For a no-good tramp!

44
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:25,552
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

45
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:30,792
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

46
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:34,793
Without news from home.

47
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:45,353
Finally, a letter from Naples!

48
00:43:48,273 --> 00:43:50,992
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

49
00:43:51,914 --> 00:43:53,752
She's very beautiful.

50
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:59,033
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

51
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:01,513
Our dear mother -

52
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:05,672
... is dead!

53
00:44:59,995 --> 00:45:02,794
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

54
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:08,954
Sit down, you bum!

55
00:45:15,436 --> 00:45:17,355
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

56
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:27,115
We'll go see her backstage.

57
00:45:29,915 --> 00:45:31,475
Who was that?

58
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,915
The Black Hand.

59
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,475
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

60
00:46:07,957 --> 00:46:09,835
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

61
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:13,876
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

62
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:16,436
You'll pay me today!

63
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:27,916
Let's go.

64
00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:33,116
Not my daughter! Let her go!

65
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:36,556
Here, take all my money!

66
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:56,117
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

67
00:46:56,717 --> 00:46:59,957
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

68
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:02,316
Even my father, in the grocery store.

69
00:47:02,638 --> 00:47:03,757
If he's Italian...

70
00:47:05,718 --> 00:47:08,076
... why does he bother other Italians?

71
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,477
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

72
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,637
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

73
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:14,516
If you're happy, I'm happy.

74
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:02,558
Don't you feel well?

75
00:48:06,479 --> 00:48:08,198
Is your boss treating you all right?

76
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:11,798
Forget it.

77
00:48:32,439 --> 00:48:33,879
Hide this for me!

78
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,439
Next week I'll come and get it!

79
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:16,719
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

80
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,439
How's business?

81
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:31,320
It's good, it's good.

82
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,960
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

83
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:44,961
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

84
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:47,281
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

85
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,081
So Fanucci's changing?

86
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:57,841
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

87
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:00,880
Even from my father.

88
00:50:01,402 --> 00:50:04,801
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

89
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:37,762
I've got some bad news.

90
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:44,241
I feel rotten about telling you this...

91
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:50,801
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

92
00:50:58,242 --> 00:51:00,042
And you have to give him my job.

93
00:51:00,962 --> 00:51:04,122
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

94
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:07,322
You looked after me like a father.

95
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:09,122
I thank you.

96
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:12,562
And I won't forget it.

97
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:36,283
Take this to your family.

98
00:51:38,484 --> 00:51:40,803
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

99
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,443
What a nice pear!

100
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:41,404
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

101
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:46,324
Did you look inside?

102
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:50,524
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

103
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:05,524
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

104
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:15,644
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

105
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:20,965
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

106
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:32,725
My wife would like it.

107
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,565
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

108
00:54:02,126 --> 00:54:04,205
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

109
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:10,686
Well, he won't mind.

110
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:49,846
This is your friend's place?

111
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:54,327
This is a real palace.

112
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:56,446
One of the best.

113
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:04,727
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

114
00:56:56,531 --> 00:56:59,329
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

115
01:02:59,778 --> 01:03:01,697
Michael Corleone is here.

116
01:03:05,058 --> 01:03:06,817
He's in your den. You better hurry.

117
01:03:07,578 --> 01:03:09,458
He's been waiting a half hour.

118
01:03:16,378 --> 01:03:18,458
Is something wrong?

119
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:35,196
It's nothing.

120
01:17:35,956 --> 01:17:38,516
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

121
01:38:08,303 --> 01:38:11,502
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

122
01:40:18,665 --> 01:40:23,024
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

123
01:40:23,906 --> 01:40:26,145
... my position in Cuba is untenable.

124
01:40:28,426 --> 01:40:32,425
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

125
01:40:33,106 --> 01:40:36,145
And I shall leave the city immediately.

126
01:40:40,226 --> 01:40:43,105
I wish all of you good luck.

127
01:45:34,713 --> 01:45:37,592
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

128
01:46:21,113 --> 01:46:24,672
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

129
01:46:24,993 --> 01:46:28,633
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

130
01:46:29,194 --> 01:46:31,152
You know I've got three daughters.

131
01:46:31,634 --> 01:46:33,192
This is my neighborhood.

132
01:46:34,033 --> 01:46:37,273
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

133
01:46:38,354 --> 01:46:41,913
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

134
01:46:44,153 --> 01:46:47,673
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

135
01:46:48,314 --> 01:46:52,633
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

136
01:46:52,994 --> 01:46:57,873
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

137
01:47:00,074 --> 01:47:02,393
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

138
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,273
And your family will be ruined.

139
01:47:06,394 --> 01:47:11,514
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

140
01:47:12,154 --> 01:47:15,993
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

141
01:47:16,315 --> 01:47:18,073
Now don't refuse me.

142
01:47:19,954 --> 01:47:21,593
Understand, paisan?

143
01:47:27,835 --> 01:47:29,234
I understand.

144
01:47:31,555 --> 01:47:36,034
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

145
01:47:37,395 --> 01:47:41,554
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

146
01:47:45,595 --> 01:47:47,794
Don't be afraid to tell them!

147
01:47:50,075 --> 01:47:51,794
600 bucks...

148
01:47:52,075 --> 01:47:54,234
Suppose we don't pay?

149
01:47:55,355 --> 01:47:58,674
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

150
01:47:59,396 --> 01:48:02,675
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

151
01:48:03,516 --> 01:48:06,874
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.

152
01:48:07,555 --> 01:48:09,435
$200 each... everybody agreed?

153
01:48:13,756 --> 01:48:15,195
Why do we have to pay him?

154
01:48:15,796 --> 01:48:17,995
Vito, leave this to us.

155
01:48:19,516 --> 01:48:21,915
He's one person, we're three.

156
01:48:22,196 --> 01:48:24,755
He's got guns, we've got guns.

157
01:48:25,276 --> 01:48:28,475
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

158
01:48:28,716 --> 01:48:30,836
This is his neighborhood!

159
01:48:32,477 --> 01:48:36,795
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

160
01:48:43,037 --> 01:48:44,475
They don't pay Fanucci.

161
01:48:46,197 --> 01:48:50,875
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

162
01:48:51,996 --> 01:48:55,835
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

163
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:13,436
Now what I say stays in this room.

164
01:49:13,637 --> 01:49:18,276
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

165
01:49:21,317 --> 01:49:24,516
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

166
01:49:27,038 --> 01:49:29,276
If Fanucci says $200...

167
01:49:29,357 --> 01:49:30,716
... he means it, Vito!

168
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:34,037
I'll reason with him.

169
01:49:36,078 --> 01:49:37,997
Leave everything to me.

170
01:49:42,197 --> 01:49:44,636
I never lie to my friends.

171
01:49:45,438 --> 01:49:48,237
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

172
01:49:49,238 --> 01:49:50,997
He'll ask for the money.

173
01:49:51,878 --> 01:49:56,317
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

174
01:49:57,438 --> 01:49:59,997
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

175
01:50:02,118 --> 01:50:04,797
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

176
01:50:05,558 --> 01:50:07,997
How can you get him to take less?

177
01:50:08,718 --> 01:50:10,757
That's my business.

178
01:50:11,079 --> 01:50:14,317
Just remember that I did you a favor.

179
01:50:18,558 --> 01:50:20,077
Is it a deal?

180
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,279
His family's out of the house.

181
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,838
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

182
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,199
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

183
01:52:13,281 --> 01:52:17,800
It looks like there's -
$100 under my hat.

184
01:52:29,161 --> 01:52:31,280
I was right.

185
01:52:32,641 --> 01:52:34,360
Only $100...

186
01:52:37,601 --> 01:52:39,761
I'm short of money right now.

187
01:52:41,561 --> 01:52:45,960
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

188
01:52:46,801 --> 01:52:48,921
You understand, don't you?

189
01:52:56,801 --> 01:52:59,321
You've got balls, young man!

190
01:53:01,242 --> 01:53:04,161
How come I never heard
of you before?

191
01:53:10,402 --> 01:53:12,721
You've got a lot of guts.

192
01:53:16,522 --> 01:53:19,361
I'll find you some work
for good money.

193
01:53:30,282 --> 01:53:34,361
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

194
01:53:37,043 --> 01:53:39,362
You've done well for yourself.

195
01:53:43,123 --> 01:53:45,122
Enjoy the festa!

196
01:55:49,126 --> 01:55:51,364
Oh, this is too violent for me!

197
01:58:07,568 --> 01:58:08,967
What've you got there?

198
02:00:41,132 --> 02:00:44,931
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

199
02:05:52,178 --> 02:05:54,258
Tell me something, Ma.

200
02:05:58,219 --> 02:06:01,737
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

201
02:06:08,059 --> 02:06:09,858
He was being strong...

202
02:06:16,059 --> 02:06:17,618
Strong for his family.

203
02:06:27,019 --> 02:06:29,578
But by being strong for his family...

204
02:06:31,019 --> 02:06:32,778
... could he...

205
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:35,859
... lose it?

206
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:42,898
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

207
02:06:44,659 --> 02:06:47,818
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

208
02:06:49,459 --> 02:06:51,219
No, I meant... lose his family.

209
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:58,739
But you can never lose your family.

210
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:09,619
Times are changing.

211
02:07:31,221 --> 02:07:33,580
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

212
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:35,980
Take it as a gift.

213
02:07:58,741 --> 02:08:01,500
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

214
02:08:04,341 --> 02:08:07,700
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

215
02:08:10,261 --> 02:08:12,180
She's in bad trouble.

216
02:08:12,822 --> 02:08:16,661
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

217
02:08:18,061 --> 02:08:20,221
He told her to get rid of the animal.

218
02:08:21,781 --> 02:08:25,781
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

219
02:08:26,382 --> 02:08:30,021
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

220
02:08:32,782 --> 02:08:35,501
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

221
02:08:36,142 --> 02:08:37,741
I'm so ashamed!

222
02:08:38,102 --> 02:08:42,381
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

223
02:08:45,102 --> 02:08:46,621
I'm sorry, but...

224
02:08:48,542 --> 02:08:51,861
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

225
02:08:52,662 --> 02:08:54,062
I can't move!

226
02:08:55,382 --> 02:08:57,222
I want you to talk to him!

227
02:08:57,783 --> 02:09:00,341
Tell him I want to stay here!

228
02:09:07,823 --> 02:09:09,341
What's your landlord's name?

229
02:09:09,782 --> 02:09:11,742
His name is Signor Roberto.

230
02:09:12,303 --> 02:09:14,622
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

231
02:09:15,223 --> 02:09:18,022
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

232
02:09:19,063 --> 02:09:20,542
A real pig-sty, eh?

233
02:09:38,863 --> 02:09:42,663
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

234
02:09:43,543 --> 02:09:46,702
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

235
02:09:47,223 --> 02:09:51,303
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

236
02:09:51,544 --> 02:09:55,422
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

237
02:09:55,784 --> 02:09:59,262
I already rented the place
to another family.

238
02:10:04,584 --> 02:10:09,023
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

239
02:10:10,224 --> 02:10:13,943
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

240
02:10:14,464 --> 02:10:16,343
So let her stay.

241
02:10:18,784 --> 02:10:20,063
Are you Sicilian?

242
02:10:20,464 --> 02:10:22,063
No, I'm Calabrese.

243
02:10:22,705 --> 02:10:25,864
We're practically paisan,
do me this favor.

244
02:10:26,424 --> 02:10:28,984
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

245
02:10:29,945 --> 02:10:32,144
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

246
02:10:32,665 --> 02:10:34,984
How much more a month?

247
02:10:36,064 --> 02:10:37,104
Five bucks.

248
02:10:41,784 --> 02:10:44,704
Here's six months increase in advance.

249
02:10:45,545 --> 02:10:48,503
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

250
02:10:48,945 --> 02:10:51,424
Come see me in another six months.

251
02:10:52,825 --> 02:10:55,704
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

252
02:10:56,465 --> 02:10:57,544
The dog stays.

253
02:11:01,945 --> 02:11:05,144
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

254
02:11:05,505 --> 02:11:09,384
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

255
02:11:11,745 --> 02:11:13,425
Do me this favor.

256
02:11:14,266 --> 02:11:16,264
I won't forget it.

257
02:11:17,065 --> 02:11:20,224
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

258
02:11:21,305 --> 02:11:23,865
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

259
02:11:30,426 --> 02:11:32,264
What a character!

260
02:11:39,866 --> 02:11:44,585
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

261
02:11:51,866 --> 02:11:55,065
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

262
02:12:02,746 --> 02:12:05,426
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

263
02:12:06,507 --> 02:12:08,666
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

264
02:12:10,507 --> 02:12:12,465
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

265
02:12:13,747 --> 02:12:16,545
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

266
02:12:22,507 --> 02:12:25,306
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

267
02:12:33,307 --> 02:12:37,866
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

268
02:12:46,107 --> 02:12:47,787
Can I sit down?

269
02:12:50,707 --> 02:12:53,586
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

270
02:13:06,668 --> 02:13:08,067
I'll even lower it.

271
02:13:10,788 --> 02:13:12,027
I'll lower it $5.

272
02:13:16,188 --> 02:13:17,667
I'll lower it $10!

273
02:13:23,868 --> 02:13:25,867
Can I offer you some coffee?

274
02:13:28,148 --> 02:13:32,587
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

275
02:13:37,788 --> 02:13:40,148
You'll have to excuse me for now.

276
02:13:45,308 --> 02:13:47,347
I wish I could stay longer!

277
02:13:53,069 --> 02:13:55,388
Just call me and I'll be here!

278
02:14:05,949 --> 02:14:08,668
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

279
02:40:33,823 --> 02:40:35,742
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

280
02:40:39,503 --> 02:40:42,422
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

281
02:40:42,743 --> 02:40:45,462
My partner in America, in New York.

282
02:40:46,103 --> 02:40:47,862
His name is Vito Corleone.

283
02:40:48,543 --> 02:40:50,983
We'll send him olive oil from here.

284
02:40:51,743 --> 02:40:53,142
To his company in America.

285
02:40:57,743 --> 02:41:00,902
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

286
02:41:10,223 --> 02:41:15,582
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

287
02:41:16,663 --> 02:41:19,423
Where is this young man
from New York?

288
02:41:22,624 --> 02:41:25,663
Have him come closer.

289
02:41:26,624 --> 02:41:29,343
I can't see him so good.

290
02:41:36,064 --> 02:41:39,583
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

291
02:41:41,984 --> 02:41:43,623
Bless you!

292
02:41:45,425 --> 02:41:46,944
What's your name?

293
02:41:52,145 --> 02:41:55,184
You took the name of this town!

294
02:41:55,705 --> 02:41:57,383
And what's your father's name?

295
02:41:57,505 --> 02:42:01,024
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

296
02:42:01,384 --> 02:42:04,864
Louder, I don't hear so good.

297
02:42:08,185 --> 02:42:11,264
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

298
02:42:11,585 --> 02:42:14,184
... and this is for you!

299
02:52:37,598 --> 02:52:39,198
So... you're staying?

300
02:52:41,158 --> 02:52:43,397
Yes, I'm staying.
