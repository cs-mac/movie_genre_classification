1
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,346
Good. Yeah.
Beautiful colour...

2
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,222
Let's go...

3
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,099
We know, but I think
it's worth our trying to remember,

4
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,979
that the Middle Ages were religious,
profoundly religious,

5
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,739
in a way that we can't really conceive
nowadays.

6
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,544
I want you now to imagine, if you can,
that you are inside that church,

7
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,547
which you see as a model, and into which
this altarpiece was once placed.

8
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,659
So no big windows,
obviously no electric light,

9
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,984
but a space like this
with very narrow windows.

10
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,142
The light would be filtering in.

11
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,419
You're not in the National Gallery,
you're inside that church.

12
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,899
Low light, maybe the sound of chanting,

13
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,699
maybe the sound of prayers
being spoken slowly.

14
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,179
The smell of incense used
to carry up the prayers of the faithful

15
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,019
to the heavenly realm.

16
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,020
And, if you will, now, just imagine
that you are looking at this painting

17
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,179
by the light of candles.

18
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,180
Candles which flicker. Candles
which would shine against the gold.

19
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,579
And you might think - because, remember,
you can't read, you can't write,

20
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,904
the year is 1377, your houses are
too hot in summer, too cold in winter,

21
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,739
death is part of the threnody of everyday life,
people are dying all the time -

22
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,742
you might think to yourself,

23
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,820
"if I'm good, I can perhaps get up
to the kingdom everlasting,

24
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,899
"where all is good, great and golden

25
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,221
And I think another thing
might also happen.

26
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,383
By the flickering candlelight,

27
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,779
you might think that
these figures were moving.

28
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,306
If they were moving, they were real,

29
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,546
and could hear your prayer and intercede
for you with Christ and the Virgin in Heaven.

30
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,620
So the painting would be acting as a
sacramental channel from earth to Heaven.

31
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,386
And in a sense,
that's how this painting worked.

32
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,819
I don't mean to make this sound as crude,
perhaps, as I am,

33
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,108
but if you will, for a moment, just imagine
that I've brought from my pocket

34
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,265
a picture of a sweet grey, fluffy kitten,
and I've pinned it here,

35
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,629
and I've said, "Here are the darts,
aim for the eyes of the grey, fluffy kitten."

36
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,625
It's just a bit of paper, but in some way,
you feel that you might,

37
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,619
in a peculiar way you can't quite explain,

38
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,059
be hurting some fluffy kitten,
somehow, somewhere.

39
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,939
So I'm not suggesting to you that,
in the year 1377, or any time onwards,

40
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,819
people felt, "Oh! They're moving!
They're real! They can hear me!"

41
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,426
But with a same kind
of grey, fluffy kitten analogy,

42
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,788
I am suggesting to you that
there is a very strong attachment

43
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,627
between representation
and the thing itself.

44
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,139
So we're now in the National Gallery,
having a look quite quietly,

45
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,668
thinking about aesthetics and gold and
colours made from ground pigment.

46
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:54,270
But what we must remember is how
this was originally intended to be seen.

47
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,619
So, I've tried to sort of pull together
my first thoughts,

48
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,539
and I don't mean this to be a criticism...

49
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,747
I don't... I'm quite keen on criticism.

50
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,539
No, I'm just trying to be very open here.

51
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,271
I think what comes out of it
is that, as an organisation -

52
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,659
I suppose that's probably
a bit why I'm here -

53
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,539
our public voice is quite
weakly represented

54
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,147
when we have forums together
and we're talking about things.

55
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,150
And I kind of tried to chunk
that up this morning, of,

56
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,786
"How does that manifest itself?"

57
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,750
One is that just, quite simply,
I still find it quite amazing

58
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,347
that we don't kind of really talk much
about the public and the visitors.

59
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,108
But actually, I don't think that, when
it comes to a lot of what we talk about,

60
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,739
in some of our meetings

61
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,267
that actually are talking about
communications out to the public,

62
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,140
we're not necessarily focusing on those
52 million people and their needs

63
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,422
as much as I think we could be
and should be.

64
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,504
It would be good to think
that we could foster a culture

65
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,628
where we focus a little bit more on,

66
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,619
you know, "What are our public needs
and how are we meeting them?"

67
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,021
- Yeah.
- I was thinking... My next little diagram -

68
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,229
this was all three o'clock in the morning,
son of stuff -

69
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,339
I was thinking, if we are, you know,
the National Gallery,

70
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,019
and we were talking about, you know,
Old Masters at our heart,

71
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,308
and we are a number of things,
we're conservation, research,

72
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,430
preservation, heritage, all around
the collection and education of it,

73
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,064
we are also a visitor attraction, and I know
that word's horrid, but we are also that,

74
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,671
and if our mission is to make our Old
Masters more central lo modern cultural life,

75
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,220
then I think there needs
to be more of that dialogue

76
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,139
around the audience as the centre as well.

77
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,779
Still having art at the centre, but it's like
having another bubble that comes off,

78
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,779
where we're looking
at those audience needs,

79
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,862
and the conversations will talk about,
you know,

80
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,859
how are people reacting to us emotionally,
in terms of their pleasure,

81
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,511
in terms of intellectualism,
in terms of the academic side,

82
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,628
in terms of self-development, spiritually?

83
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,864
And those kind of conversations can help
inform the son of decision-making

84
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,859
that we're doing in meetings
like that titian meeting yesterday.

85
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,067
I thought that meeting yesterday
was fantastic,

86
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,666
and I think the outcome
was absolutely right.

87
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,870
But I think, going forward, it would be good
if we could have more conversation

88
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,899
about the audience that are gonna...
what their needs are,

89
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,621
and what our communications
need to reflect going forward.

90
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,779
Alongside, you know,
what we want to say about the art,

91
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,779
we also need to be thinking the end person
that's gonna see our communications.

92
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,669
- Yeah.
- What are their needs?

93
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,779
And I found some of the meetings
that we have,

94
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,750
particularly the sort of, you know,
very large meetings,

95
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,779
where perhaps a curator's standing up
and talking about a subject, is fantastic,

96
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,579
but there needs to be the other dialogue
that goes on that then carries it on

97
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,219
so we're not just seeing it
from "What's our perspective?"

98
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,222
but "What's the perspective of the people

99
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,871
"that are actually gonna see
what we're trying to show them

100
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,347
"through our exhibitions
and marketing and stuff?"

101
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,499
So my hope - and this is, you know,
if there's this opportunity

102
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,709
to talk about one's vision going forward
with the trustees in June -

103
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,785
my hope is that we can make that dialogue
more central to what we're doing

104
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,019
at exec, and in some
of our exhibition meetings.

105
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,150
And on my side, I'm trying to imbue,
you know, the marketing and PR side

106
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,739
with more of that stepping back

107
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,499
and actually looking at things
from the audience point of view.

108
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,947
So it's a question of balance. I'm trying
to get, perhaps, a more balanced view,

109
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,863
where our processes enable us to look
at the end user's needs, sort of thing...

110
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,948
- Yes.
- ...alongside the curatorial needs.

111
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,059
I understand all this. I would like to have
some examples of where you've felt...

112
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,224
we've failed, or because we hadn't...

113
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,499
done this...

114
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,539
A lot of what we do is absolutely beautiful
in terms of exhibitions,

115
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,271
lovely when it comes to the marketing,
beautiful imagery,

116
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,502
absolutely gorgeous, high quality...

117
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,899
But I think, because we're sometimes
not going through that process

118
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,699
of thinking of it
from the audience perspective,

119
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,067
we sometimes don't do that,

120
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,019
what's - ugh - crudely called in marketing
a sort of call to action.

121
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,739
We don't say, "This is the reason
why you must come and see it."

122
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,107
Now, with something like Leonardo,
it does it itself.

123
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,979
- Everybody wants to see it.
- Yeah.

124
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,709
You could argue we should
have done less.

125
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,499
No, no. So Leo isn't a good example.

126
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,859
You've just got to put up that beautiful
picture and everybody wants to see it.

127
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,059
But other things, we need to actually make
them come alive in a different way,

128
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,819
because people don't get it immediately.

129
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,266
They don't understand,
you know, what we offer.

130
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,019
And it's part of that conversation
we had a few days ago about,

131
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,863
"What's the National Gallery represent?"

132
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,379
When you look at the research
we've done recently,

133
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,147
people love the National Gallery when
they get here and they understand it,

134
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,299
but to the average, sort of,
person on the street, as it were,

135
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,739
they don't quite understand
what we are and what we've got.

136
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,391
The fact we've got these amazing paintings,
they don't get it,

137
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,542
cos we're quite discreet
in how we tell them that.

138
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,750
You know, I do have
some prejudices to overcome.

139
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,661
What I don't want is to end up
with the gallery...

140
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,779
producing things to the kind of lowest
common denominator of public taste.

141
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,099
But I don't even want the kind of av...

142
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,468
I mean, I'd rather have
spectacular success followed by...

143
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,979
sort of, really interesting failure,

144
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,301
- than have kind of average, you know'?
- No...

145
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,145
In fact, I'm quite in favour
of those things going up and down.

146
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,500
OK, thanks.

147
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:11,699
I'm going to try something
a little bit new today,

148
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,019
I'm going to try something
a little bit new today,

149
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,910
which is because the painting is slight...

150
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,304
is sort of rather more abstract
than most of the ones we talk about.

151
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:28,501
So we're going to have a bit of a go
with some touch drawings.

152
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,699
I... I son of made a very, sort of,

153
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,783
simple sketch of the main structures
of the picture

154
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,860
and then put it through this very exciting
machine that heats it up and it all goes furry.

155
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,065
I don't know whether it's going to work
for you, but I just thought it was worth a try

156
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,739
and that it might help some people
get the overall structure of the picture,

157
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,381
which is not a narrative painting
or a painting with great detail.

158
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,068
So the sort of abstract shapes
within it are quite useful,

159
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,899
to, sort of, get a sense of.

160
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,269
And then we'll move on to
a normal reproduction as well.

161
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,979
- If you could possibly...
- I'll pass those around.

162
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,701
Thank you.

163
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,830
Professor Whitestick,
I'll be back in a minute.

164
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,226
Raised image here.

165
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,940
So, today we're talking about Camille
Pissarro's Boulevard Montmartre at Night.

166
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,540
It was made in 1897,
so just over a hundred years ago.

167
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,059
Certainly, the viewpoint he takes,
which is a viewpoint from a hotel window,

168
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,819
high above, an aerial viewpoint
of these streets,

169
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,019
adds to the sense of someone
who's a little bit distant.

170
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,388
Whereas his colleagues
would have a viewpoint like that

171
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,827
but include, somehow,
a sense of themselves,

172
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,739
even if it was just
a bit of balcony or whatever,

173
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,819
he... you just get no sense
of the window frame,

174
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,059
no sense of his presence,

175
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,587
and the whole thing is viewed,
you know, at a distance.

176
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,739
And the particular painting
we're looking at,

177
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,348
though it was one of a whole series
of 14 of the Boulevard Montmartre...

178
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,028
He went for these big campaigns,
painting a lot of pictures at once,

179
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,899
trying to capture the changing light effects,

180
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,899
so he might have several paintings
on the go.

181
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,979
But this is an exceptional one,
because it's the only night-time one.

182
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,019
His work's always a little bit dappled,
you might say,

183
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,500
and full of little brushstrokes,

184
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,179
but in this one, nothing is very clear
because it's dark and it's been raining,

185
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,180
and all the sort of things that can be seen
are sort of merged together

186
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,022
in this great sort of watery pool
of colour, light and shape.

187
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,379
What we're thinking about
is the general structure of the picture,

188
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,659
and we're thinking about it a bit like a flag.

189
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,507
So you're seeing an aerial view
of a street scene.

190
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,147
At the front of the picture is the...

191
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,739
is an upside-down V
going in towards the middle.

192
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,347
So it's a flag divided into four triangles.

193
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,139
The bottom, upside-down V triangle
is the street.

194
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,939
So it's basically a great whoosh of space,

195
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,739
leading towards the point
where all the triangles converge,

196
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,505
which is exactly halfway down the picture.

197
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,580
And then, the right-hand side is a V with
its apex meeting the disappearing point,

198
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,147
and then, the left-hand side
is a triangle on its left-hand side,

199
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,831
and then, the top is a real V,

200
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,739
and that, of course, represents the sky.

201
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,621
Take both your hands and put them
son of at the top of the picture,

202
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,065
and then come down a bit.

203
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,739
If you go from the top corners,
and then down a little bit,

204
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,622
and then you move your hands
inwards and downwards,

205
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,590
following the diagonals...

206
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,779
Can you feel the tops of the buildings?

207
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,306
I've only put the main sort of forms in.

208
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,699
And above that is an empty space,

209
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,343
which is a beautiful, deep, soft, smoky,
dark bluey-mauve

210
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,699
that dominates the painting.

211
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,539
So that's the sky.

212
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:37,150
Take that line of the tops of the buildings
and go to the... where the two lines meet.

213
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,499
Do you see that they meet
at a sort of bubble,

214
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,299
where the lines converge?

215
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,862
Yes? So that's
the sort of disappearing point.

216
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,947
And he punctuates that
with a tiny little dot of light.

217
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,739
So, overall, it's a really dark picture.

218
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,740
It's almost like a sort of semi-transparent
curtain's been drawn over the whole scene,

219
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,508
and it's very much nighttime.

220
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,139
And yet, it's punctuated all over the place
by these flares of light.

221
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,030
And they sort of emphasize the structure

222
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,539
and give a sense of excitement
of this son of city scene,

223
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,059
which is a great characteristic
of this picture.

224
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,060
So, not surprisingly, the furthest light
of a great line of streetlights,

225
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,507
the furthest light is at the point
where all these triangles converge.

226
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,580
It's almost like a sort of great symphony
to light in darkness, there.

227
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,539
And there are all these people,
out there on the street.

228
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,305
I've read people son of trying
to make something

229
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,139
of this being something
to do with his anarchism as well.

230
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,019
Certainly, in the paintings
where you can see more clearly,

231
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,342
the daylight pictures, he does make...

232
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,790
he does ensure that he defines the different
people and their different social class.

233
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,502
So you see people with top hats,
you see people who are selling things,

234
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,389
you know, you see all sorts.

235
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,819
In this picture, you don't get that,
because it's all so ill-defined.

236
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:17,829
But he is unlike many of his colleagues
in that he does show all strata of society.

237
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,548
<i></i>

238
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,459
Remember to keep
looking around you.

239
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,110
Always look around. Be careful, though.

240
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,379
Let's go nice and slowly, don't run.

241
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,986
I don't want you to fall over.

242
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,310
It doesn't have a magic carpet next to it,
but it is the painting.

243
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,348
Please, have a seat.

244
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,910
So this is the story of Moses.

245
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,343
It's the story about how a little baby boy
is sent down the river

246
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,310
and then picked up again,
given to the princess,

247
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,419
who gives it back to the mother,

248
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,499
and he grows up to be an amazing
and fantastic person.

249
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Now, if you like the story of Moses, you
might like to see more stories about Moses.

250
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,741
And there are lots of other storm
about Moses in the National Gallery.

251
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,699
But if you think to yourself,
"I've had it up to here with Moses,

252
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,859
"I'm sick of Moses,
I want to see somebody else,"

253
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,459
there's lots of other stories you might wanna
learn about in the National Gallery.

254
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,499
There are people writing.

255
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,107
There are people eating
and being surprised.

256
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,699
There are people -
you might not believe this -

257
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,499
there's an old man over there
who's being fed by ravens.

258
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,939
There's a raven, a little black bird,
that's giving him his food.

259
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,821
All these amazing stories
in National Gallery paintings for you to see.

260
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,699
This is a portrait
which was commissioned by Henry

261
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,939
lo fulfill another one
of his demands, really,

262
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,151
to, as I say, to son of almost
meet Christina by proxy

263
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,019
through the medium of the portrait,

264
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,579
so that he could decide
whether he wanted to marry her.

265
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,622
So Holbein is dispatched to Brussels
in March 1538.

266
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,150
This is following the death of Henry VIII's
third wife, Jane Seymour.

267
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,260
And Henry is sort of desperately trying
to identify a suitable fourth wife.

268
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,750
Holbein arrives, Hans Holbein,

269
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,619
sent by the King of England,
to paint a portrait

270
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,059
on the understanding
that if it satisfies the King,

271
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,579
she's then going to go over to London
and become the Queen of England.

272
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,311
Henry is said to have fallen in love with it,

273
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,380
and to have been very, very keen
to arrange the marriage.

274
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,584
But that doesn't happen.

275
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,499
There's an anecdotal statement-
we don't know whether this is true -

276
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,221
that Christina herself
said to the English envoy,

277
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,591
"if I had two heads, one should be
at the disposal of the King of England."

278
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,699
So it seems that she herself had a sense

279
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,068
that this wouldn't necessarily
be a good match for her.

280
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,059
And, ultimately, Henry gave up.

281
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,621
This is a very sort of simple picture
in its composition.

282
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,699
The sort of frontal pose
is very deliberate here,

283
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,379
so that Henry could actually sort of see
exactly what she looked like,

284
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,590
no sort of profile view that's hiding
any blemishes or imperfections.

285
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,339
But the use of light
across the features, again,

286
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,340
is very, very subtle
and carefully modulated

287
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,111
so that there's a hint of an expression,

288
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,459
there's a hint of animation in her features.

289
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,261
She seems to be ever so subtly
sort of wryly observing the artist

290
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,499
as she observes him.

291
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,539
And I always feel, looking at this painting,
this portrait,

292
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,750
that this really is a young woman
fully in possession of her faculties.

293
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,459
Very intelligent, squarely facing the world,

294
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,019
and ready for anything
that the world might throw at her.

295
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,149
So I'll stop there and say
thank you very much and goodbye.

296
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,379
How did Leonardo da Vinci start off
with a blank panel and a palette of oil paints

297
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,380
How did Leonardo da Vinci start off
with a blank panel and a palette of oil paints

298
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,865
and create a painting
of such sublime beauty'?

299
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,062
If you just look
at that flower in the comer there,

300
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,939
how did that happen?

301
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,901
It's this wonderful mixture
of observation and imagination.

302
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,379
What was in the artist's...

303
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,179
What was Velazquez’s intention
on painting Venus with her back to us,

304
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,911
but with that bewitching look in the mirror?

305
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,699
And how did Stubbs achieve

306
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,619
such an anatomically accurate
representation of a horse?

307
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,619
This painting is huge, so physically,

308
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,739
there must have been great challenges
in painting it.

309
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,739
But artistically, look at the detail,

310
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,426
look at the observation
that the artist was able to represent.

311
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,140
And what was in Van Gogh's mind when
he painted this glorious vase of sunflowers,

312
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,339
with its brilliant use of colour
to convey mood?

313
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,061
Just look at the number of colours
that are in this painting.

314
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,859
It's really yellow and green,

315
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,739
but with this amazing blue stripe through it,

316
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,979
and a blue frame to the vase.

317
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,226
And how does that use of blue, juxtaposed
against that great splurge of yellow,

318
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,780
represent something in the artist's mind?

319
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,099
All of it, really, is about looking,
and about reflecting,

320
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,539
and about learning ways
to decode paintings

321
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,589
and understand what
the artist's intention was.

322
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,779
And however you look at a painting,

323
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,099
whether it's through a very
art historical perspective,

324
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,788
or whether it's through looking at its history
and how it came to be at the gallery,

325
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,419
or whether it's through looking
at colour or form or composition,

326
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,583
this gallery provides you
with wonderful opportunities

327
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,099
to explore the human condition.

328
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,100
And we hope, with Take One Picture, that
it's not just about knowledge and learning.

329
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,264
That's one half of it.

330
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,340
The other half of it is finding your own
creative response to the paintings,

331
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,067
finding ways in which these paintings
have a relevance to you today.

332
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,019
And I think many of you
will go back into your schools

333
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,751
and find a whole myriad of ways

334
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,820
to give your pupils the chance
to do this very same exploration.

335
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,102
<i></i>

336
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,579
No, it's nice to see it up here.

337
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,345
I think that you should make a proposal.

338
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,579
- That it be cleaned.
- Do you?

339
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,230
- Yeah, yeah.
- For... Well, that's...

340
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,699
So just state that it would benefit
from a good cleaning and restoration.

341
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,579
I'm bothered by all the retouching up here.

342
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,099
I'm bothered by all the retouching,
evident retouching,

343
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,309
- in the mantle of the Madonna, of the blue.
- Yeah, yeah. But it...

344
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,539
Which is not nearly so...

345
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,459
- But I do see that.
- Her mouth...

346
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,064
- And also...
- Yeah.

347
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,539
Is this retouching?
Or is ii crazed varnish?

348
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,269
- Crazed varnish.
- Just crazed varnish.

349
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,939
- Similarly, round her mouth.
- Yeah.

350
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,227
Actually, look, that's ground.
That honey colour.

351
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,539
He's dragged the lighter colour
across the shadow.

352
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,619
- Yeah.
- Then there's that little orangey bit.

353
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,748
- That's ground. Absolutely.
- Yes. Yes.

354
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,629
- Yeah.
- Ya.

355
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,708
- Not retouching.
- No.

356
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,579
This is the story
of Samson and Delilah,

357
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,982
Old Testament story, in which we are told

358
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,309
how the Philistines want
to bring down the power of the Israelites.

359
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,179
And, in particular, to break Samson.

360
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,071
So they're going to advance
their secret weapon, Delilah,

361
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,140
and have her seduce Samson
so that they can destroy the Israelites.

362
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,339
So, in a sense, you've got a spy story.

363
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,340
You've got the beautiful spy
going off to sleep with the enemy.

364
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,939
And in the Biblical account,
we're told how, time after time,

365
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,706
she goes to his campaign lent,
all decked up and looking gorgeous,

366
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,581
trying to find out where his strength lies.

367
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,499
Time after time after time, he lies,

368
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,979
but his desire for her becomes so great

369
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,499
that, bit by bit, visit after visit,

370
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,027
he finally tells her.

371
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:11,102
I want all of you to imagine
that you are a spy,

372
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:16,180
and that you have been sent
by your people, your tribe, your nation,

373
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,780
to be very nice
and get secrets out of the enemy.

374
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,539
So, first of all, the enemy is the enemy.

375
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,540
But after you've had a drink or two,
a meal, chat with the enemy,

376
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,459
and pretended to love the enemy,

377
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,590
you are beginning to feel differently
towards the enemy.

378
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,660
And what has been pretended...
might become real.

379
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,379
It messes with your mind.

380
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,379
And I think Rubens, who's this painter
of great psychological import,

381
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,466
has realized what's going on
in the mind of Delilah.

382
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,140
She has pretended to,
and perhaps eventually come to feel, love.

383
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,542
And she has finally slept with Samson.

384
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,466
He has fallen asleep. This can happen.

385
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,779
- <i></i>
- <i>And...</i>

386
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,780
she knows that this consummation
of his desire

387
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,871
is going to lead directly to his death.

388
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,059
The Philistines are emerging
through the open door there,

389
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,348
flames shining, reflecting on their armour.

390
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,823
We've got this kind
of hermetic sealant of curtain,

391
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,744
purple, rich purple curtain, hanging,

392
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,779
the rich scarlet of her dress,

393
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,739
the gold of her cloak,
making this hot and rich.

394
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,587
Various light sources are adding to this,
plus the covert haircut.

395
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,619
The candle is being held
by this old woman,

396
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,579
and very carefully, the barber
is making his first incision.

397
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,301
We're not looking at a Delilah triumphant,

398
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,779
she's not going, "Yes! Gotcha!" is she?

399
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,059
She's looking ambiguous.

400
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,060
She is bending tenderly over him,
with, perhaps, a look of dismay.

401
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,939
I'm not going to tell you what you think
she's feeling, we'll all read it differently,

402
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,102
but her body is leaning away.

403
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,499
On the one hand,
literally on the left hand,

404
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,071
there's a tender gesture of hand on back.

405
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,579
But the other hand is away from him.

406
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,019
It really is on the one hand,
and on the other.

407
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,020
She has, over the time that
she has been trying to seduce Samson,

408
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,500
as any human being would, gone through
a series of mental transformations.

409
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,146
It must be very distressing, now,

410
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,260
to realize that the man
that she has just had these relations with

411
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,860
is now going to die,
directly as a consequence of her actions.

412
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,066
She has,
and I'm hesitating to use this word,

413
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,939
she has betrayed him.

414
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,342
But then she must think to herself,
"But, no.

415
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,742
"I was working for my country.

416
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,019
"To have done otherwise
would have been to betray my country."

417
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,939
It's about betrayal, it's about notions
of one's tribe or people,

418
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,939
and about what, perhaps,
might be happening in the mind

419
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,979
of anyone put into this kind of position.

420
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,939
But imagine, if you 'will, now, going
into the house of the bÃ¼rgermeister,

421
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,579
and seeing this above his fireplace.

422
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,301
And there you would be,
with, you know, the bÃ¼rgermeister,

423
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,944
with a rather large painting behind you
of Delilah with her breasts uncovered.

424
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,100
What would you say?

425
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,699
You have to view paintings,
or narrative paintings, as early films,

426
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,699
and as forms of entertainment.

427
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,739
So the artist to decide at what point
in the story are they going...

428
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,939
is he or she going to focus on?

429
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,147
So again, when you come to your work,

430
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,499
when you've had all your different ideas,
you have to sift through.

431
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,346
Which moment? What point?
What's the climax?

432
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,744
What, to you, is the most important thing
that you can communicate?

433
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,059
And how can you interpret
that form of encounters, experiences,

434
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,459
or chance meetings the best?

435
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,622
Paintings are very, very ambiguous.

436
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,739
You can look at them in one way,
you can interpret them in another.

437
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,099
And as your experiences change - and
I know, because I come in here every day -

438
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,583
paintings change,
and how you look at them changes as well.

439
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,539
Can we get straight on
to the proposed Sport Relief?

440
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,669
I don't see that the use of the portico
for various purposes

441
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,419
is much different from the idea of projecting
things onto the front of the gallery,

442
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,663
which we've always,
you know, resolutely objected to,

443
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,859
on the grounds that, you know,
it's a tremendous opportunity for us

444
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,459
if we're doing something for the gallery.

445
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,699
I mean, there are various ways
of looking at it.

446
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,379
But I think the right decision was that we
should not have people projecting things,

447
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,499
using our façade as a billboard, if you like.

448
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,659
When... because it diminishes the impact
of any occasion when we wish to do it.

449
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,140
But it also just looks
as if we're up for sale, you know?

450
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,699
I mean, frankly... I mean, I know there's
an alternative way of looking at it,

451
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,700
which is that everyone, you know...
it gains publicity for the... for the gallery,

452
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,148
but does it, actually...
get the right type of publicity'?

453
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,819
The right type of recognition?
I mean, this is the interesting question.

454
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,381
I'm inclined to say no, because,
obviously, a very worthy charity,

455
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,979
but is it more worthy
than a hundred other charities?

456
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,819
One of the things
that we need to balance it, again,

457
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,347
is the profile aspect of it,
is that it's an opportunity for us, potentially,

458
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,659
to take a little bit more involvement,
if you like,

459
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,267
in something that has the potential
to be broadcast to 18 million viewers.

460
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,379
And I think that's the balance, isn't it'?

461
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,579
You know, is... are we...

462
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,346
are we either happy not to align ourselves
with these chosen charities

463
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,979
or do we think,
"It's going to happen anyway.

464
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,382
"Should we perhaps try and take
a bit more ownership of it and..."

465
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,299
- What's going to happen anyway?
- Well, the event is.

466
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,739
We weren't consulted about
whether we wanted something

467
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,859
to obstruct the access
to the National Gallery.

468
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,939
We'd never have said,
'We want a marathon to end

469
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,465
"in front of the National Gallery."

470
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,699
Because a marathon, the end of a marathon
involves people on either side,

471
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,739
so you can't get into the National Gallery.

472
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,344
So someone else has made the decision

473
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,151
we're a great place
for the end of a marathon.

474
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,099
That's... And now, it's got so we're told
it's going to happen anyway.

475
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,699
Well, I want to be involved in the decision

476
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,988
as to whether the National Gallery
is the right place for ending a marathon.

477
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,739
And I'm not, instead, someone else
is making that decision,

478
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,619
'We're going to end a marathon
in front of the National Gallery."

479
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,271
Then we're being told, 'Well,
since it'll happen anyway,

480
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,339
"no one'll be able to get
into the gallery,

481
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,339
"can we have a marvelous
photo opportunity

482
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,699
"to show that in fact, the National Gallery
is all about Sports Relief?"

483
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,579
I mean... And also, you say, you know,
"chosen charities".

484
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,231
Who's going to choose them?
I mean, it's going to be a...

485
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,739
I do have a hell of a lot of requests
to use the gallery for charitable purposes.

486
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,619
I mean, one problem with this, of course,
is also that, you know,

487
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,581
the whole question of a charity...
which we are,

488
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,619
assist... you know, using its facilities
and everything for another charity,

489
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,226
which trustees are, you know,
very concerned about.

490
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,939
It's always a worry of ours that...

491
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,659
You know, when people have asked

492
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,425
if they can have charitable events
within the National Gallery,

493
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,459
- we've always...
- We don't do that.

494
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,339
But we appear in the backdrop,
with our banners, like it or not.

495
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,699
And that's just part of the London...
that's part of that landmark.

496
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:48,742
So this race, I imagine,
will end in Trafalgar Square,

497
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,859
and I...

498
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,388
You know, you can imagine the footage,
the filming of an individual,

499
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,699
running up towards Trafalgar Square,
to the north terrace.

500
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,111
We'll be in the backdrop.

501
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,699
I just feel that the National Gallery
is a whole...

502
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,739
- It closes the whole end of this square.
- Mm.

503
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,779
And all these events are going on,
all these things are being planned

504
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,659
- without us being properly involved.
- Consulted.

505
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,231
And that all we say is at the last minute,
you know,

506
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,939
"Well, it's gonna happen anyway,
so can we just use it?"

507
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,342
- Jill, you're...
- Yeah, and I think we should use this.

508
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,579
And Greg and I go back to Westminster
and just use this as an example

509
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,859
of things that they have to talk to us about,

510
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,779
so that we're
much more joined up with them,

511
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,350
because we need more notice on this,

512
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,579
so I think we should pick that up
as an action point if you support that.

513
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,389
- I totally do, yes.
- Yeah!

514
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,940
And it would be a good example
to be able to quote.

515
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,419
I supported Julie when
we first heard about this,

516
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,059
cos I thought the exposure is fantastic,

517
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,099
and it is very populist and it actually
gets us to 18 million people,

518
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,699
and it's therefore a good association,

519
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,067
and my only concern in this

520
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,139
is that obviously, it is setting a precedent
in terms of charities, so it does...

521
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,659
you know, in associating
with charities to a degree.

522
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,739
And that was the only struggle
I've had with it,

523
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,739
of how to then actually say no
to other organizations.

524
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,267
Whereas before, we can be very cut...
you know, cut and dry on it.

525
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,179
But outside of that,
if you're able to get round that,

526
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,819
or felt that we could associate with it
and it's a one-off,

527
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,779
and that we're not going
to do this as a habit,

528
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,619
I think it actually could be quite doable.

529
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,385
I mean, I would have thought
that at this relatively early stage,

530
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,459
we'd be at a point where,
if we wanted to do it,

531
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,859
we could work with them
so we actually make it possible.

532
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,261
So it's only a half-hour shot
of an interview,

533
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,699
and maybe one can keep
the portico open

534
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,979
by having people directed
through a different way.

535
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,819
I mean, I think if we believed in it,
we could make it happen.

536
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,659
- And could you...
- But it's... Sony.

537
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,426
Could you articulate what you think
the National Gallery gets out of it?

538
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,739
I think it's an associa... I think it's actually...

539
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,347
Cos we do appear rather on our pedestal,
physically, literally.

540
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,739
It's actually a way to be there
and seen to be part of common culture.

541
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:54,739
Sport Relief has a massive following,
and is very much for the nation, as it were.

542
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,699
So it's associating with something
that gives a lot of pleasure to a lot of people.

543
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,225
It's how I'd sort of rationalize it,

544
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,659
but I do accept it is quite difficult
in setting precedents with charities,

545
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,579
and we do get many, many requests.

546
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,819
I think what they're looking for
is either a no or a yes in principle.

547
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,391
If the answer is yes in principle,
then we can -

548
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,139
Jill and I, or whomever -
can work to shape that,

549
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,139
so that if we think, then, that we need
to sort of get more out of it, if you like,

550
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,299
we can be doing that,

551
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,579
whether that's in terms of profile
or actually financially as well.

552
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,423
OK, what about Chinese New Year?

553
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,459
Why shouldn't we be involved in that?

554
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,419
I mean, would you say yes
to Chinese New Year?

555
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,139
- Well, you don't have quite the same...
- We don't want...

556
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,819
...rationale in terms of profile, do you?
- You know, it's a profile-raising thing.

557
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,619
Whereas it's different from
other events that are happening,

558
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,739
simply because of the breadth
of the reach you'd get.

559
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,266
<i></i> The example...
Well, one criterion would be

560
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,739
how many millions are going
to be actually watching it?

561
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,739
<i></i> I think it would be dangerous
to suggest that we'll be able

562
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,310
to get a lot of coverage per se,

563
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,299
but on the other hand, if we feel that,
you know, as per our corporate objectives,

564
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,299
we want to be seen as more approachable
in the very positive sense,

565
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,779
it is one way of doing it
for half an hour once a year.

566
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,699
- So, you know... And if we said...
- That's interesting.

567
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,859
- ...this is not something we'll do...
- That's an interesting one, Jill.

568
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,779
Half an hour every year,
there'll be our...

569
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,260
- that's going to be one of our fences.
- Well, no...

570
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,150
- No, no, seriously...
- We might say we'll consider

571
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,419
one thing a year that supports
something that is...

572
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,099
- loved by the nation...
- Compatible.

573
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,739
...and compatible and for everyone.

574
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,424
I mean, one could rationalize that.

575
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,059
We'd decide, if there wasn't an opportunity
on certain years, we wouldn't do it.

576
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,179
- Perhaps...
- We wouldn't do it if... Sorry.

577
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,659
If it causes a lot of disruption to our public.

578
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,659
But if there's something
that's not going to,

579
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,107
and we can work with Sports Relief to make
it minimum disruption to our visitors...

580
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,579
Let's talk about that for a bit,
the disruption.

581
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,062
Because we sat round this table,
and we were all sure

582
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,939
that we were going to work
with Harry Potter to make it work.

583
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,988
What actually happened was that, in fact,

584
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,139
the National Gallery
was completely blocked,

585
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,979
and inasmuch as it wasn't blocked,

586
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:59,020
people were just using the Sainsbury Wing
as a spectator point to look out the gallery.

587
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,499
I think the gallery did probably make
the right decision about Harry Potter.

588
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,179
It was most unsatisfactory.

589
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,902
But in fact, none of the sort of guarantee
that we were talking about

590
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,140
actually could be effectively
implemented at the time.

591
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,659
We're talking about a certain type
of advertising.

592
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,859
And when you see a football match
on television,

593
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,979
and you see these huge signs,
they're all about running shoes and things.

594
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,460
I mean, they're...
there's some sort of relationship.

595
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,225
They're not about Goya and Picasso, even.

596
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,459
So it seems to me
the more disparity there is

597
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,459
between the different types of public
which are for one thing and the other,

598
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,099
the more it actually looks
as if one's just short of cash.

599
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,099
I mean, in other words,
or is in desperate need of publicity.

600
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,179
I mean, I just don't know.
I just don't see how it's seriously going to..

601
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,579
The name National Gallery
can be announced a lot,

602
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,659
but what, in this context,
would that do for us'?

603
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,231
What does that tell people
about what the gallery really is'?

604
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,667
You have to continue
with these negotiations, anyway.

605
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,499
One of the highlights
of the gallery,

606
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,659
a painting that many people
come along and see.

607
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,268
At some point, in 1533,
these two men, meeting as they did,

608
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,779
did what we might do, were we to meet
a fellow countryman in a foreign place.

609
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,226
They had their picture taken.

610
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,579
Clearly, there's no handing a camera
to a passer-by or a waiter.

611
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,426
The only way, until the advent
of photography, to have an image,

612
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,939
is to have a painter paint you.

613
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,699
They had money. They were wealthy.

614
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,700
They could pay for the bat painter
living in England to capture their image.

615
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,104
And the top painter living and working
in London in 1533

616
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,459
was the German painter Hans Holbein.

617
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,779
And at some point, the three men,

618
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,943
Hans Holbein, Jean de Dinteville,
Georges de Selve,

619
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,342
would have got together
and discussed this composition.

620
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,383
They're the ones telling
the painter what to do.

621
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,464
Probably, Jean de Dinteville
having the greater say,

622
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,941
because it was his painting, he paid,

623
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,579
it went back to his château in Polisy,

624
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,948
and it could well be
that Hans Holbein had no idea

625
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,739
of the whole significance of everything
he was being asked to make.

626
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,579
I have a colleague who thinks
this is all about a murder that took place.

627
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,106
And I look at it and I see,
"But where? What?"

628
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,739
And he says, "I'm not telling you.
You'll steal my idea and publish it."

629
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,028
So none of us knows what it is,
but all we have is what we can go on.

630
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,499
And there is the lute case,
the box, the empty box,

631
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,419
which perhaps reminds us
of the coffin, of death,

632
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,420
which is also alluded to here
by this distorted skull.

633
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,062
It's an example of anamorphosis.

634
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,859
You look at it full on,
from where you are, it's unreadable,

635
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,546
but from where you are, it reads as a skull.

636
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,859
And we don't know whose idea it was.

637
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:24,106
Did Holbein say, "Your Excellencies,
why not have an anamorphic skull?

638
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,539
"See, I've made one here,"
and they thought, "Oh, that's good, yeah.

639
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,111
"That'll look really good back
in the château at Polisy."

640
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,139
Or had one of these two men
heard about it and said,

641
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,819
"Master Holbein, can you fashion
for us a cunning perspective?"

642
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,391
We don't know.

643
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:44,944
But all of you know that to put a skull,
which is a symbol of death, into a portrait

644
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,990
is a strange and unusual thing, perhaps.

645
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,979
Certain symbols,
certain objects are multivalent,

646
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,579
they carry manifold symbols.

647
00:44:54,580 --> 00:45:00,303
But not the skull. The skull is always,
is it not, a symbol of death?

648
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,380
So perhaps the reading of this
might be that death is ever present.

649
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,859
Hiding, but ever present.
You never know when it might occur.

650
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,306
And in fact, he didn't make old bones at all.

651
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,499
But perhaps, carried within this,

652
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,579
was a message
which Jean de Dinteville could talk about

653
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,949
when he showed anyone this painting
in his house at Polisy.

654
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,619
Maybe the message was
something like this.

655
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,102
No matter how rich, young -

656
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:35,949
he was 29, or in his 29th year,
he in his 25th year-

657
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:41,020
handsome, interested in
and worried about the world you are,

658
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,301
in the end, it all comes down
to the grim invincible,

659
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,699
and the only thing to be considered
in this world is salvation,

660
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,501
represented by
the almost hidden crucifix, top left.

661
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,939
It's a brilliant thing about art,

662
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,227
it encompasses everything.

663
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,300
It's not just about either drawing
or painting, it's about life.

664
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,030
It's about music, it's about film,
it's about philosophy,

665
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,179
it's about mathematics, it's about science,
it's about literature.

666
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,549
Anything you are interested in...
goes into art.

667
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:47,739
And that's why I became an artist,
and that's what fascinates me.

668
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,506
It doesn't matter what you're interested in,
it can all feed in.

669
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,779
And I want to also talk about how we can
use these paintings in the collection.

670
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,987
Because it might seem to you,
"Hang on a minute.

671
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:04,060
'We're looking at 17th century,
16th century, 19th century.

672
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,147
'What on earth use is that for us today
in the 21st century?"

673
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,739
Now, I don't make paintings.

674
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,779
I do a lot of drawing.
But I make installations.

675
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,979
So I make things that take over a room
that people can interact with.

676
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,779
And yet, these paintings here give me
a huge amount of inspiration.

677
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,779
And I come in here almost every day.

678
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,942
So I want them to do that for you.

679
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,659
Now, I'm going to be
sort of blunt about this,

680
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,739
because it's important that you know this.

681
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,939
The collection is founded on slavery.

682
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,023
John Julius Angerstein,
who had the nucleus of the collection,

683
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,100
worked for Lloyd's,
who were insurers against slave-boats.

684
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:49,180
And it's very important that people
absolutely understand

685
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,948
that a lot of the institutions,
whether you're talking Tate,

686
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,830
whether you're talking British Museum,

687
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,227
a lot of these big institutions
are founded from money,

688
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,099
and it's something, obviously,
that should never be forgotten,

689
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,944
and should always be understood.

690
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:12,699
And also, Britain's
very, very shameful part in that

691
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,146
shouldn't, obviously, be forgotten either.

692
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,819
Let's start first with Stubbs,
the great horse painter.

693
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,029
You look at this portrait of a horse,

694
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,739
and it's hard to imagine that this is painted

695
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:29,064
by someone that didn't really
particularly train as an artist.

696
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,859
He was largely self-taught.

697
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,859
He established a career first
as a portrait painter,

698
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:40,230
and as an anatomist,
he studied anatomy at York Hospital,

699
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:46,467
and ended up actually drawing illustrations
for a new book on midwifery.

700
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:52,262
So he's already established himself
as an artist in one way,

701
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:57,340
but then he set himself down
for 18 months in a farmhouse -

702
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,230
this was in 1756-
and devoted that time, a year and a half,

703
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,859
to studying the anatomy of horses.

704
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,468
He was close to a tannery
that took the hides off of them,

705
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,307
and they gave him
the corpses of these horses.

706
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,979
And he rigged up, in this farmhouse,
a great iron bar,

707
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,028
and pulley systems,

708
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,139
and he put planks of wood
underneath the horses' legs,

709
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,739
so that he would suspend them,

710
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,739
literally, from hooks, on the ceiling,
like a piece of meal,

711
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,311
and then would start to go about drawing

712
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,499
all of the muscles that he could see,
and the tendons,

713
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,579
and then he would scalpel away,
and lift away another layer of muscles,

714
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,659
and draw what was underneath,
until he eventually got to the skeleton.

715
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,699
And then he would animate that,
he would draw and write notes.

716
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,828
So this was big news,
what Stubbs was doing.

717
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,782
'Scuse me.
No photos, please. 'Scuse me.

718
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,019
I'm very bad at maths.

719
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,939
I'm very bad at maths.

720
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,979
I was bad at maths at your age,
I'm bad at maths at my age,

721
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,659
and I will always be bad at maths,
I think - I'd like to change.

722
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,659
The reason why I like an
rather than maths -

723
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,619
although they are connected somehow -

724
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,067
is that in art, you can be right
in lots of different ways,

725
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,379
but in maths, you can only really be
right once, otherwise you're wrong.

726
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,579
I do really like that about an.

727
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,939
One of the reasons I wanted to show you
this painting is to talk about saints,

728
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,739
but is also to talk about storytelling.

729
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,107
I think that's really, really important.

730
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,659
Think about the way that a painting,

731
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,107
whether it's this painting -
this is by an artist called Bellini -

732
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,899
or it's Diana and Actaeon, or it's Death
of Actaeon, which we're gonna be seeing,

733
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,699
<i>or it's Bacchus and Ariadne,</i>

734
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,103
a painting has got to tell its whole story
in a single image.

735
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,179
A book or a poem has time.

736
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,299
The one thing that paintings don't have
is time - do you know what I mean?

737
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,419
So a film unfolds over two hours.

738
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,419
You've got time to introduce characters.

739
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,059
You've got time to show
the plot going in and out.

740
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:47,819
A book, a huge book, can take you
six months to read or longer, can't it?

741
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,390
Can do. Can do.

742
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,379
It means you're living
with the story for six months,

743
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,339
and it goes in and out, it weaves around,

744
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,099
new characters are introduced,
different things happen.

745
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,779
That's got time, too.

746
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,422
But a painting doesn't have time. A painting
has the speed of light to tell you the story.

747
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,779
It has the time it takes to see the painting.

748
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,262
So telling a story in a painting
is incredible skilful.

749
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,059
So I wanna think a little bit more, before we
move on to 'Titian, which we will do soon,

750
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,419
about how this artist tells the story.

751
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,739
What else is in the painting?

752
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,740
Can you think of a reason... Cos in
the actual story, there's no woodcutters.

753
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,106
In the story, there's just St Peter Martyr

754
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,859
and his assistant,
who you can see there escaping,

755
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,699
walking along, alongside a wood,
near Milan in northern Italy,

756
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,899
when they were set upon by assassins.

757
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,819
One assassin killed St Peter Martyr,

758
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,739
and as St Peter Martyr was dying,

759
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,619
he wrote "I believe" in blood on the ground.

760
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,031
Now, he's not doing it in this one,

761
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,459
but there's another version of this scene
in another gallery in London,

762
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,099
a place called the Courtauld Gallery,

763
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,459
where he is writing "I believe" in blood.

764
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,539
It's quite... It's quite gruesome, isn't it'?

765
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,739
Quite a gruesome story.
But quite moving, as well.

766
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,664
The other guy escapes.
No mention of woodcutters.

767
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,102
Totally irrelevant.
Why do you think he put them in?

768
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,148
And they take up so much space.

769
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,459
The woodcutters and what they're involved
with, in other words, the wood,

770
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,379
take up most of the painting.

771
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,179
Why did he do that? Yeah?

772
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,939
Maybe because it gives the painting
a little more character?

773
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,939
Definitely gives the painting
more character. It totally does.

774
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,229
Think about this. A tragic event,
perhaps made more tragic

775
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,779
if there are people around
who don't recognize what's going on.

776
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,384
Who don't see it as a tragedy.

777
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,059
I'm trying to think of an example. I wonder
if you might know an example, I don't know.

778
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,579
But there's something... It happens a lot
in plays by Shakespeare, for example.

779
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,779
There are people who don't know
what's happening,

780
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,021
and they go, "What's happening
over there?"

781
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,944
There's a lovely painting,
which is not actually in this gallery,

782
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,459
but it's a painting of the fall of Icarus.

783
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,859
Icarus was the one who made the 'wings...
Do you know it?

784
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,859
He made wings of wax,
flew too close to the sun.

785
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,619
Fantastic painting,
where almost all of the painting

786
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,619
is people not noticing what's going on,

787
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,226
people ploughing the fields
and doing lots of other things,

788
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,699
while in the background,
he plunks into the ocean and dies.

789
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,988
There's a famous poem about that
by Auden, which is a really good poem

790
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,179
about how people don't really notice
these things happening.

791
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,299
I think these woodcutters are partly there
to make it even more tragic,

792
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,701
because they just keep going
on and on and on.

793
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,899
It's amazing, isn't it,
how it adds a sense of narrative

794
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,899
as soon as there's an object,
and this is what this pole...

795
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,985
I'm seeing all sorts of paintings
in the gallery where there's sort of...

796
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:37,624
Suddenly, there might be some sort
of story... woven into this pose.

797
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:44,584
We can't help ourselves but add narrative
when we're dealing with the human body.

798
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,383
And if you want to include
any elements from the room,

799
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,859
thinking about vertical lines behind,
or horizontal lines,

800
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,227
finding lines of connection.

801
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,579
So try and constantly look
at the relationship

802
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,311
between the head and the shoulder girdle,

803
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,339
between the shoulder girdle
and the pelvis.

804
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:09,871
Be brave and add that vertical line
to contrast the curves of the body.

805
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,979
Now that we're slowing down,
and really looking,

806
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,699
so start to move more quickly
around the body,

807
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,987
making marks in sort
of continuous movement

808
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,143
as you... as you work around it
with your eyes.

809
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,946
Leave a leg, move back to a shoulder.
Go up to the top of the head.

810
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,979
Move very freely around, so you get
a sense of how this pose is working.

811
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,142
This hand should be big.

812
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,339
- Cos it's going to hide that forearm.
- It should be... Yes.

813
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,339
Yeah, cos it's... the gap between it...

814
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,339
The gap between the son of nipple
and first knuckle of the hand,

815
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,419
- if you can sort of draw that gap...
- Mm.

816
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,619
- Then you'll be seeing... As you move...
- That's that line there, right?

817
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,739
- Ah.
- That's that line.

818
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,947
- That's the line of the crease in her elbow.
- Yeah.

819
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:01,020
But I'm thinking about the actual bit of air
between breast and... and fist.

820
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,619
- Mm. Yeah. That space is... that gap.
- Yeah. Yeah.

821
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,659
So trying to sort of measure
that space, really,

822
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,899
- and place the hand so that it...
- Mm.

823
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,063
It's like bookending, isn't it,
the space in the middle?

824
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,779
- Mm.
- If that makes sense.

825
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,863
- Easier said than done.
- Yeah! Get her hand in!

826
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,859
- I think... I'm not sure...
- If you're wrestling with it,

827
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,067
just draw it a few times
on another piece of paper,

828
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,824
and then come back.

829
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,939
Think about how you want
to use your pencil.

830
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,859
You can work in cross-hatching
to build up tone,

831
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:53,345
you can start to smudge chalk
if you want to think about light and dark.

832
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,739
If you're using the chalks,
you might want to switch.

833
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,428
If you've been using the black chalk,
maybe explore the red chalk as well,

834
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,539
so you get the much softer mark
with the red chalk.

835
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,510
Black chalk's slightly more
sort of bound together.

836
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,747
See if that changes the way that you draw.

837
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,099
Just have another 30 seconds
on this drawing.

838
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,939
So if you're working your way
around the figure,

839
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:29,266
just see if you want to, in very brief strokes,
complete this pose.

840
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,308

845
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,059
Reception. Does that mean...
No. He's just gone to check.

846
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,506
See how many we have left.

847
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,268
Very beautiful.

848
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,868
What a blessing.

849
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,699
Maybe a kind gesture.
More awakening.

850
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,668
Awakening gesture.

851
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:18,659
Even while the exhibition's been open,

852
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,739
Even while the exhibition's been open,

853
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:23,983
have there been insights that you've been
getting into the work of Leonardo?

854
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:27,099
One of the things that you do
as you start working on an exhibition

855
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,139
is to think about what
the whole narrative will be.

856
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,939
But you're also cataloguing
each work individually,

857
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,069
so at a certain point,
it becomes a mosaic, perhaps,

858
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,339
rather than a seamless narrative.

859
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,779
And, obviously, that remains the case
to some degree.

860
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,779
But at the same time, you are beginning
to see these works together,

861
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,779
you're beginning to be able to appreciate
what makes them very special

862
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,942
as a kind of viewing experience.

863
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,419
And I suppose
what I've been struck about...

864
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,739
Well, I suppose what I've been struck by,
over and over again,

865
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,939
is this quality within these works,

866
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,940
whereby the paintings show figures
that are incredibly present,

867
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:09,104
incredibly vital, and yet extraordinarily
remote and other, as if they...

868
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:12,699
And that's something that, for me,
is very much a unifying factor.

869
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,068
So I suppose what I've been doing
is seeing the works together,

870
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:21,140
thinking about what makes them
a complete oeuvre by a single artist,

871
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,579
what makes them Leonardo.

872
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,346
And it's really, I suppose,
I've been struck, over and over again,

873
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:32,499
by the quality of thought allied
with a kind of pitch of emotion

874
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,739
and an intensity of craft,

875
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:39,109
and it's that, really, that seeing the pictures
together has made me understand

876
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,099
about this extraordinary artist.

877
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:45,150
And have there been any insights,
anything you've learned that surprised you,

878
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,939
particularly since the work
has been gathered here?

879
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:53,265
What I've been amazed by
is how profound and layered and endless

880
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,699
the viewing experience is with Leonardo.

881
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:00,700
How you always feel that this is an artist
who goes on giving with each of the works.

882
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,899
And in fact, one of the ways I think
you can distinguish a Leonardo painting

883
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,426
from one by a member of his workshop

884
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,339
is that... is this process
of endless revelation,

885
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:15,939
whereby it's almost as if sort of
onion layers are being peeled away,

886
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,386
and yet you never, ever
quite get to the core.

887
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:23,460
Leonardo's capacity to paint the invisible,
just out of reach, is really extraordinary,

888
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,579
and that's been the revelation,

889
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,060
but it's not about, you know,
who painted what,

890
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,099
or... or anything of that kind,

891
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,699
it's really about the personality of the artist.

892
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:37,386
I think, for what it's worth, that it's
this spiritual quality in Leonardo's work

893
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,379
that has raised this exhibition
to the event it's been,

894
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,145
in the sense that it's not
just about the name,

895
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,339
it's about something to do
with the way in which

896
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:48,939
these pictures speak
to people across time.

897
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,420
Leonardo created
a kind of archive of drawings,

898
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,139
and they're about invention
and they're about observation,

899
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,699
and they're about looking
and thinking and so on.

900
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,987
And they're... and he kept some of those,

901
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:04,941
and they go on being an extraordinary
point of reference for each new stage.

902
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:10,020
He's an artist who constantly refines and
revisits certain themes over and over again.

903
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,299
And really, as I say, in doing that,

904
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,779
each of these works
becomes ever more considered,

905
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,899
ever more felt, as well.

906
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,471
And that's the difference
between him and his pupils.

907
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,941
It's really in his... it's really in his...

908
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,339
That's the difference
between him and his pupils.

909
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,899
It's really in his pupils' work
that you just don't see that.

910
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,819
You can see motifs being repeated,
you can see beautiful craft,

911
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,302
but you don't see
that exquisiteness of thought.

912
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,979
- OK, great, thanks.
- OK.

913
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,579
Great, thanks very much.

914
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,265
So, I've already taken
some samples.

915
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,459
I took a couple to look at the varnish,

916
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,460
cos, as you can probably see,
with a bit of an angle,

917
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,779
there's a varnish layer
which shows up clearly.

918
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,987
- It doesn't come all the way to the edge.
- OK.

919
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,739
There's a sort of drip
of it that's running down here.

920
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,739
Stops there, does it?
Yeah.

921
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,699
So I've taken some to look at the varnish,

922
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,068
and then my other samples mainly
concentrate on this brown layer,

923
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,899
which is the layer that seems
to have contracted and pulled

924
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,221
and reticulated across the surface.

925
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,739
What's interesting, I suppose,
from my point of view,

926
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,311
is how that layer relates
to the paint below,

927
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,139
and how... how it sits on the surface,

928
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,939
whether it's separated from the paint
by anything in between.

929
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,899
And if we can see a bit more
about the layer in cross-section,

930
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,471
whether it's got pigment in it.

931
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,987
So those types of things will be
very interesting about a sample, so...

932
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,819
a cross-section sample.

933
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:32,302
So, given this varnish layer
goes to the border,

934
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,859
- it would be perfectly all right...
- Mm, we could lake...

935
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,739
- ...to look at that border...
- Exactly.

936
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,107
...In a place where there's
a damage, really.

937
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,619
I'm sort of looking up there, in a way,

938
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,739
because, although
there's this large loss here,

939
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,141
that may not actually have that layer...

940
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,859
- Yeah.
- ...reaching that point.

941
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,699
But up there, I think it probably does.

942
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,146
- Do you think? Perhaps...
- That might be worth looking at.

943
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,059
- And I think the comers all have damage...
- Yeah.

944
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:59,739
...where, in the past,
from framing problems...

945
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,779
- so it might be worth looking up there.
- Mm.

946
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:06,780
But for the complete sequence of layers,
probably, one's best confined to that...

947
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,347
- that pan, because, as you say...
- I think so. Yeah.

948
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,379
So, really, let's have
a little look up at the top.

949
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,860
OK. Get the microscope on.

950
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,350
Cos there are these damages here.

951
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:21,982
You could probably be quite safe
taking some here.

952
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,741
As a preliminary, that's the thing
we ought to look at, really.

953
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,144
I think that should do it, actually.

954
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,139
So... that's a very tiny bit,
just from the edge,

955
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,179
of the sort of inner side of the damage.

956
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,139
I don't know, can you even see it, actually'?

957
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,539
- So... So, OK.
- A bit easier for me to do my analysis.

958
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,783
Right, OK, good!
Fantastic. Thanks very much.

959
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:36,341
So, I'd better just note down
where this comes from, I think.

960
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,583
Oh, I'll put it on this one.

961
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,390
Great, thanks.

962
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,231
Yeah, would we...
Would it be worth it?

963
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,064
I think that's a real...

964
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:56,340
Actually, we made a reservation
for dinner for six pm. And we're...

965
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,819
<i></i> It could work out.
It could work out perfectly.

966
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,139

967
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,459
Is it possible to buy the tickets?

968
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,339
All advance sales
are completely sold out.

969
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,339
The only way to get in...

970
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,308
<i></i>

971
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,339
- I think that's OK.
- That's OK?

972
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,466
- Yeah, don't worry.
- OK.

973
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,981

974

978
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:09,299
The main challenge that we're
dealing with is that our income,

979
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,939
and what's available to us to spend,

980
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,899
is 3.2 million less next year
than it was this year.

981
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,659
So it's a... it's a significant reduction

982
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,059
in what we have got available
to us to spend.

983
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,699
Now, of course, some of the income we had
this year was exceptional, from Leonardo,

984
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:31,099
and our costs will go down
as well next year,

985
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:34,821
so we're spending less on exhibitions
than we were this year.

986
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:39,379
We're also spending less
on our capital programme next year,

987
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:42,019
so we're one and a half million down,

988
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:44,619
because we're spending a million less
on the capital,

989
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:47,819
and we're spending half a million less
on exhibitions.

990
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:51,539
Also, this year, we've been able
to afford the compensation payments

991
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:55,619
to a range of staff who have left,
which was in the region of 700,000.

992
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:59,179
So all of those costs
won't appear again next year.

993
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,819
But that still leaves us
about a million short.

994
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:06,019
And the way that we have managed
to break even for next year

995
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,979
is because of the savings
we've made in staff costs.

996
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:13,979
So that has enabled us to present
a balanced budget.

997
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:17,701
So the work that we've done this year,
in changes to invigilation arrangements

998
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,182
and in the posts that have been reduced,

999
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,499
has enabled us to balance this budget.

1000
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,579
And there's a little bit more detail
about that

1001
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,899
later on in the paper,
which I'll come lo.

1002
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,619
One of the big risks that we face
over the coming years

1003
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,939
is the likelihood of further cuts,

1004
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:37,940
which, although I'm hopeful
that won't be the case during 2012-13,

1005
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,859
it's not impossible that there will be
another spending review in 2012-13,

1006
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:47,059
which will reduce our grant in aid
still further

1007
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,499
in the following two years,

1008
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,499
which can be by as much
as five per cent each year.

1009
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,779
And that's just what
they've told us about, so...

1010
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,939
- Yeah.
- And things have worsened considerably

1011
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:01,019
since the spending review 18 months ago.

1012
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,751
Are we being too cautious
on that front?

1013
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:08,659
It's so... you know, only at 1.7 million
of new income,

1014
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:11,499
when, you know, last couple of years,
they've gone way over that,

1015
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,179
and way over our budget figures.

1016
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:15,499
Are we... are we being too careful
with that figure?

1017
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:20,179
It's best to be cautious, because
there are things that we don't know about.

1018
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:25,186
For example, I've only budgeted in here
for one per cent increase in staff costs,

1019
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,379
on the basis of the autumn statement.

1020
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,099
Now, we don't know what
the payrolls will actually be.

1021
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,979
And, in recent years, they've actually been...
provided flexibility

1022
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,499
that puts us under pressure
to actually pay more, so there are...

1023
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,139
And then there are uncertainties
over energy costs,

1024
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,699
which can be very volatile,

1025
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,499
and there's the possibility of further cuts.

1026
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,899
So I would prefer to budget cautiously

1027
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:53,099
and know that we may well
come in in a better position,

1028
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,979
which will provide us with the opportunity
to cover such eventualities if we need to.

1029
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:01,379
Last year, this current year,
we've budgeted for 2.8 million.

1030
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:06,099
And as of December, you were 4.9 million,
not including 1.1 of campaign income.

1031
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,019
So you were at six altogether.

1032
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,182
Now we're budgeting for 1.7 million.

1033
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,459
No one's gonna really
look that closely at this,

1034
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:16,579
but, I mean, it looks like we're spending
53p for every pound we raise.

1035
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,939
And what we have in our budget,
is our budget really realistic, then?

1036
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:21,779
It's cautious, but is it realistic,

1037
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,739
when we're raising twice
what we put in here, historically?

1038
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:30,740
This is reflecting what we would expect
to bring in. You're right, it's very cautious.

1039
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:36,780
But it... it enables us to balance a budget
that has accommodated the costs

1040
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,699
that we consider to be reasonable
to do what we want to do next year.

1041
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:46,700
And it provides us with some flexibility
to cover eventualities that we can't predict,

1042
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:51,619
and also, new projects that might
come up during the course of the year.

1043
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:55,579
So we could include more income,

1044
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,699
but then we'd be including
a much bigger contingency,

1045
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,180
- which I'm not sure is a brilliant message.
- Yeah.

1046
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:07,539
Here is the decline
of the empire.

1047
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,146
Here, something terrible has occurred,

1048
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:14,231
it's the end of Carthage,
their overthrow by Rome.

1049
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:19,419
The men are all being taken off,
prisoners, to Rome.

1050
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,779
The women are weeping for them.

1051
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:26,780
Here, the sun is descending,
I think, in the sky.

1052
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:31,940
It's a very dramatic sunset,
with quite a lot of red in it.

1053
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:37,899
Turner himself referred to it
as an ensanguined sunset,

1054
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,299
an ensanguined sky,

1055
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,300
and here, these rough brush...

1056
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,539
marks of the brush, in a dark red,

1057
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:52,779
I think, if you go into the exhibition,
you'll see it is a dark, browny red,

1058
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:56,499
almost, perhaps, like encrusted blood.

1059
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:01,379
So this is a very dramatic view of empire.

1060
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:06,380
So, here, I think Turner really starts to
detach himself from Claude in many ways,

1061
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:12,379
because these are not tranquil
depictions of classical subjects,

1062
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:15,019
these are reflections on history.

1063
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:20,020
And Turner was immensely interested in
and influenced by history.

1064
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:25,187
He also wrote poetry on this subject.

1065
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,779
And he can't have avoided, of course,

1066
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:35,779
the events around the painting
of these compositions in 1815,

1067
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,748
and this one in 1817.

1068
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,903
It was, of course, the very end
of the Napoleonic Wars,

1069
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,139
the end of the Napoleonic Empire,

1070
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:47,579
and, by contrast,
the rise of the British Empire.

1071
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,265
But Turner took a very long view
of these things.

1072
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:53,819
He was interested
in the rise and fall of empires

1073
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,949
over hundreds and thousands of years.

1074
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,624
Do come in.

1075
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:10,019
So, welcome. Now, you're looking
at a picture of Frederick Rihel,

1076
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,859
painted in 1663.

1077
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:15,179
It came into the National Gallery in 1960.

1078
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:19,499
It had been quite obscured
by lots of accumulated yellow varnishes.

1079
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,707
The picture was restored
not that long ago,

1080
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,699
but the varnish that was used
was very, very degraded.

1081
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:29,619
And what you are seeing now is a picture
where I've done quite a lot of cleaning.

1082
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,499
That means using solvents

1083
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,859
to reduce or remove
discoloured varnishes from the paint

1084
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,299
over most of the surface area.

1085
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:42,300
There's an area roughly corresponding
to here where I haven't cleaned, so...

1086
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:47,419
Not yet. It's a little hard to see
the differences, I suppose, now.

1087
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,419
I can tell you, it looked much worse.

1088
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,939
No, I think the interesting thing
about a yellow varnish,

1089
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:54,859
everyone understands
that a yellow varnish makes...

1090
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,619
shifts all the colours
toward the warmer end of the spectrum.

1091
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,939
You know, blue becomes green,
and I would say a yellow filter...

1092
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:04,299
film over a yellow colour
doesn't change it much at all.

1093
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,739
And so you might wonder about a picture
like this, which is mostly warm colours,

1094
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:10,819
you know, white, red, brown, yellow,
about the distortion.

1095
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:14,379
I mean, there are two things I would point
out that have changed quite a lot,

1096
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:17,419
and you can distinguish
some quite important things

1097
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,539
that are going on in the picture.

1098
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:23,859
The differences between the yellow and
white impasto, very typical of Rembrandt,

1099
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,059
was completely impossible to see.

1100
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:29,139
I mean, the sleeve and the sash
were more or less the same colour.

1101
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:30,619
But the other thing I think...

1102
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,499
the other important thing
to think about while we clean pictures

1103
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,710
that people often underestimate is the fact
that varnishes not only change colour,

1104
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,659
they often go a little bit foggy.

1105
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:42,939
They develop a fine craquelure
and they scatter light.

1106
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:47,339
And it's really, on a microscopic level, like
looking at a shattered windscreen on a car.

1107
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,099
There's still a film there,
but you can't really see through it.

1108
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,939
And that really changes
the way you see the darker colours.

1109
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:58,940
So they become much lighter,
and so you can't see the distinctions

1110
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,299
that are in the painting between, say,
quite dark, very dark and extremely dark.

1111
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,701
And that's really important
with a picture like this,

1112
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:09,499
where there's so much going on that's
about distinctions between brown and black.

1113
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:14,459
And really, the illusion of depth and volume
and spatial recession

1114
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,739
is the key gain, I think, from this picture.

1115
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,019
I think the kind of investigation

1116
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:23,339
I was saying before that we do
as pan of any restoration,

1117
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,379
even preliminary to any restoration,

1118
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:28,299
has shown some other interesting things
about this painting.

1119
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,383
And I'm gonna take
my one visual aid here.

1120
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:36,379
We... Oops. Sorry about that.

1121
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,619
We... Sorry. We normally take...

1122
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:41,899
do X-radiographs of pictures like this
before we start restoration,

1123
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:46,900
so here is a typical X-ray,
where you can see the denser pigments,

1124
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,819
the ones with the heavier atomic weights,
show up white,

1125
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:54,711
and luckily, it just so happens
that lead white, white pigment,

1126
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,939
is actually one of the heaviest pigments,

1127
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,419
so you can see the distribution
of some of these things.

1128
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,699
And it tells you very important information
about how a picture is planned.

1129
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,659
For example, you know, the sky
is sort of painted around the head.

1130
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:08,579
The head isn't on top of it,
because we don't see that going through.

1131
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,419
You learn all kinds of interesting things

1132
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,939
that are often very revealing about
a particular painter's way of working,

1133
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:15,059
that are often very revealing about
a particular painter's way of working,

1134
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,139
certain mannerisms of how he might
handle impasto, and all the rest.

1135
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,179
But the fascinating thing about this picture,

1136
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,179
which many of you
may have already worked out,

1137
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:25,459
is that if you turn it sideways,
there's another picture.

1138
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,979
And this is very, very unusual
for this kind of picture.

1139
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,744
Rembrandt did this a great deal,

1140
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,579
something like a quarter of his self-portraits
are recycled and reused,

1141
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:34,579
something like a quarter of his self-portraits
are recycled and reused,

1142
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:39,099
but it's very unusual in the context
of an important commission.

1143
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,419
This is not a painting for the marketplace.

1144
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,939
This picture was
for a rather important client.

1145
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:48,779
So we can't be absolutely certain
about this underlying painting.

1146
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:50,619
It... I think it's fair to say

1147
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,219
it's the same sort of body type and
general characteristics as Frederick Rihel,

1148
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:54,779
it's the same sort of body type and
general characteristics as Frederick Rihel,

1149
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:59,779
so you might say that he may have changed
it in response to this event that happened,

1150
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,539
is one theory.

1151
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:05,579
This in itself is quite a bold
and very unusual composition.

1152
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,979
There are more or less
no full-length portraits

1153
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:12,379
after his experiences
with the reception of The <i>Night</i> Watch.

1154
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,859
So that in itself is unusual,

1155
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,499
So that in itself is unusual,

1156
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,059
and to have this great empty space

1157
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,099
with what look like trees
and the rest coming through

1158
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,139
is quite fascinating.

1159
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,899
But, for whatever reason,
of which we can't be certain,

1160
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:29,748
this picture, which is probably not entirely
finished, but very far along, was changed.

1161
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,459
And then we get into
some interesting things

1162
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,339
about what happened when it was changed.

1163
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:34,499
Because he, amazingly enough,
just turned it sideways and started again.

1164
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:39,500
Because he, amazingly enough,
just turned it sideways and started again.

1165
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:44,139
There's no priming
in between the two paintings.

1166
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:48,139
There's a brown quartz, son of sandy
ground, very typical of late Rembrandt,

1167
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,059
underneath the first composition,

1168
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:54,859
but he just turned it and started right
on the other canvas, as best we can tell.

1169
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:55,139
And away he went.
And it's interesting to think about that,

1170
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,619
And away he went.
And it's interesting to think about that,

1171
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:02,620
because oil paint becomes more
transparent naturally over the centuries,

1172
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:07,739
slightly more transparent, and so that's
why you can often see pentimenti,

1173
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:10,979
changes that were not intended to be seen.

1174
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:13,745
Everyone thinks about, you know,
the horse's legs in Velázquez,

1175
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,779
when you see three or four of them,
as he's adjusting it,

1176
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:16,179
when you see three or four of them,
as he's adjusting it,

1177
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,739
and you can see them coming through.

1178
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,664
And there's a fair bit of that
happening in this picture.

1179
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:23,019
I know the light's a little low in the evening,

1180
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,779
but here, for example,
is the hat of the standing man.

1181
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:30,539
And his face is here, so you can see
a little bit of the pink showing through.

1182
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,939
And then some odd kind of shapes
coming through the horse's belly.

1183
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:36,419
And they have to do
with the underlying composition.

1184
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:36,899
And they have to do
with the underlying composition.

1185
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,579
Now... now we're getting into interesting
problems of restoration history,

1186
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:44,899
because, as I said, what you're seeing now
is a picture that's largely cleaned,

1187
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,339
at least in the first sense
of the varnish coming off,

1188
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:50,859
so you can see the kind of damages
that are very typical of a picture...

1189
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:54,103
Actually, this picture's in a pretty good state
for its size and its age.

1190
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:57,059
There are certain losses that, who knows
what the reasons are?

1191
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:57,819
There are certain losses that, who knows
what the reasons are?

1192
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:00,059
But there are other problems
with this picture

1193
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:05,100
that I think result from previous restorers'
confusion about what was going on.

1194
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,939
It's important to remember that
before the mid 19th century,

1195
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:13,459
the kind of materials available to restorers
to thin or remove varnishes

1196
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:17,139
was fairly limited,
they were fairly blunt instruments,

1197
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:17,699
you couldn't really have
the distillation of organic solvents

1198
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,899
you couldn't really have
the distillation of organic solvents

1199
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,779
that you could know their reactions,

1200
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,899
and really predict and understand
the chemistry of what was going on.

1201
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,259
So there was often issues
with over-cleaning.

1202
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:30,699
And I think what may have happened here
is that, if you think about Rembrandt

1203
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,670
and his characteristic accents
of very thick impasto,

1204
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,699
that create this wonderful relief,

1205
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:38,819
there was a bit of that going on
from the underlying composition.

1206
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,099
There was a bit of that going on
from the underlying composition.

1207
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:43,099
And I imagine if you're cleaning
brown varnish off a brown painting,

1208
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,661
and you suddenly start to see
some very exciting impasto,

1209
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:50,299
that you know is Rembrandt,
it was quite exciting.

1210
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:56,660
And we can't be absolutely certain, but,
for example, this ornament on the boot...

1211
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:59,459
I think I've asked you about this
before, haven't I'?

1212
01:27:59,460 --> 01:27:59,739
I think I've asked you about this
before, haven't I'?

1213
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:04,740
It's... it's unlike any... He's basically wearing
a kind of fancy dress hunting outfit,

1214
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:10,499
you know, a typical militia kind of party gear,
with a vaguely martial idea.

1215
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,899
And so this boot is along those lines too,

1216
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,939
and has this odd ornament of a type
that I've never seen anywhere else.

1217
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:20,099
And if you then refer back to this X-ray...

1218
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:20,699
And if you then refer back to this X-ray...

1219
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,304
Er, let's see.

1220
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,819
The... Let's see, where am I?

1221
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:31,427
Hello... There we are.
So it's this...

1222
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:36,739
This thing on his boot
is actually the top of this kind of...

1223
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,739
He's wearing a kind of tabard, jerkin,
kind of hunting, riding...

1224
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:41,179
He's wearing a kind of tabard, jerkin,
kind of hunting, riding...

1225
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:45,099
Funnily enough, he seems to be
in riding gear, the standing figure as well.

1226
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,499
Maybe it's just
a son of country squire look.

1227
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,139
But that's a detail
of his underlying costume.

1228
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:54,099
Now, it could be that Rembrandt
just fortuitously thought,

1229
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,059
"That's rather good, I'll use that."

1230
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,499
But it does seem a little odd to me...

1231
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,379
...because it's this perfect triangle,
it doesn't really curve,

1232
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:01,979
...because it's this perfect triangle,
it doesn't really curve,

1233
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,819
and the whole idea about this picture
is, with a very limited palette, he's...

1234
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:10,711
Thank you. He's created this amazing thing
of the horse coming out on the diagonal.

1235
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,899
Even the boot is Misting out
and coming up,

1236
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:16,019
and if you think, the thing should be
probably a metre and a half higher,

1237
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:19,379
you know, it's really coming down,
looking down in the way that the kind of...

1238
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,144
Well, equestrian portraits of this type

1239
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:22,019
are supposed to sort of create this
kind of grandeur and authority, if not power.

1240
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:25,899
Are supposed to sort of create this
kind of grandeur and authority, if not power.

1241
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:28,419
Think of the Velázquez Olivares
or something like that.

1242
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:31,939
So this doesn't seem
to square with that to me.

1243
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:34,059
But we'll be looking at that very closely.

1244
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:37,339
I mean, we'll take a look with a microscope
and take some samples and see.

1245
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:41,939
It looks to me like you can see traces of this
kind of mouse-coloured brown-grey paint,

1246
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,659
within the impasto of the...
of the boot ornament,

1247
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:46,142
within the impasto of the...
of the boot ornament,

1248
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,151
which suggests to me
that this is an earlier, misguided cleaning.

1249
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:55,260
You know, something quite different than,
say, the natural increase in transparency.

1250
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:59,459
There's other evidence of very harsh
cleaning of this picture, anyway.

1251
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,699
This kind of broken-up islands
that look a bit like sort of...

1252
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:03,299
I don't know, fractals
or sort of steamy looking thing.

1253
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,539
I don't know, fractals
or sort of steamy looking thing.

1254
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,979
That's very typical kind of result

1255
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:11,499
of undercutting
with harsh solvents or reagents.

1256
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,099
So this picture has suffered a bit,

1257
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,819
and I think there was much more
confusion in the lower areas,

1258
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:18,579
where there is sort of
brown on brown on brown.

1259
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:22,426
It's a little confusing if you're not
really aware of what's happening.

1260
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:23,939
<i></i>

1261
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,101
<i></i>

1262
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:07,428
Easy...

1263
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:13,419
In what sense does the work
that you do feed into the exhibition,

1264
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:17,619
In what sense does the work
that you do feed into the exhibition,

1265
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,019
beyond the fact that it made
the restoration possible?

1266
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,379
In order
to conserve a picture,

1267
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,979
you have to understand
the materials of which it's made,

1268
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,899
how it's painted, what its condition is,

1269
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:28,219
and, most of all,
how it's going to behave

1270
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:30,539
and, most of all,
how it's going to behave

1271
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:33,749
towards any proposed
conservation treatment.

1272
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:38,820
What that means is that we can only
touch a picture if we can do it safely.

1273
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:44,460
And one of the reasons why pictures
are investigated so carefully

1274
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,619
for their physical and chemical state

1275
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,859
is for the scientists at the gallery
to be able to advise restorers

1276
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:52,619
is for the scientists at the gallery
to be able to advise restorers

1277
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:57,620
on the kind of conservation treatment
they intend to use on the picture.

1278
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:01,699
And, most of all,
so that we can guarantee

1279
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:06,700
that what is done to a National Gallery
picture is absolutely safe for it.

1280
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:09,499
How has our understanding
of Leonardo changed now,

1281
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,019
How has our understanding
of Leonardo changed now,

1282
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:13,539
having got to the end of this exhibition?

1283
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:18,540
Well, there are in fact very few paintings
by Leonardo extant,

1284
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,699
that have come down to us.

1285
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,779
And so the study,
the intense study of one of them,

1286
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:25,779
the National Gallery's
Virgin of the Rocks,

1287
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:30,139
provided the most complete information
about Leonardo's painting technique.

1288
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:31,744
Provided the most complete information
about Leonardo's painting technique.

1289
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:35,499
We know quite a lot
about the way he drew on paper,

1290
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:40,219
but, before this exhibition, and
before these studies were undertaken,

1291
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:45,219
quite little was known about the actual way
in which Leonardo painted.

1292
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,179
And now, we know a great deal more.

1293
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,979
<i> And</i> what <i>is</i> it <i>that we know'?</i>

1294
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,739
- Well, that's...
- Some of it.

1295
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:51,259
Well, we know every detail of this picture.

1296
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:54,379
Well, we know every detail of this picture.

1297
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:59,059
It's one of the most intensively studied
pictures in the National Gallery collection.

1298
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:02,179
So we know how Leonardo
prepared his panel,

1299
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,059
what kind of ground he used.

1300
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:08,579
We know that there were two phases
of drawing on this picture.

1301
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:11,899
In fact, it went through a radical
transformation from an earlier design

1302
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:12,459
In fact, it went through a radical
transformation from an earlier design

1303
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:16,379
to the design that you now see
expressed in paint on the surface.

1304
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:21,380
And what that means, in fact,
because of that transformation of design,

1305
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:25,659
it means this picture's actually very
complicated in its manner of painting.

1306
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:30,099
So we've been able to analyze what we'd
call the layer structure of the picture,

1307
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:32,539
all the different layers of paint
that Leonardo applied

1308
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,779
all the different layers of paint
that Leonardo applied

1309
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:36,179
in working toward the first composition,

1310
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:39,179
and then, his second,
finished, composition.

1311
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:43,579
And we also know, in doing that,
a great deal about the materials.

1312
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:48,179
For example, the pigments he used,
the binding media he used, and so on.

1313
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:51,859
So we can provide
a very complete description

1314
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:53,179
of how this work of an was created.

1315
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,750
Of how this work of an was created.

1316
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:58,699
Right, that's perfect.
I'm gonna work it down from there, OK?

1317
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,509
<i>All right.</i>

1318
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,539
What did we not know before?

1319
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,619
When you plan the exhibitions,
you think about the different works

1320
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,419
that you want to bring together,

1321
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:13,819
you go and look at them, of course,

1322
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:15,819
you go and look at them, of course,

1323
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:18,379
and you're very familiar
with every individual work,

1324
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,659
but you never actually see them together,

1325
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:24,299
and that is the magic of any exhibition,
if ii works,

1326
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,304
that there is a magic
that all of a sudden happens,

1327
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:29,866
when works start talking to each other.

1328
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:34,139
Sometimes, it doesn't happen, and then
you know that you've failed as a curator.

1329
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:34,459
But when you see that it does happen,

1330
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,508
But when you see that it does happen,

1331
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:41,829
there are relationships that, all of a sudden,
start to become more evident,

1332
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:46,707
there are new themes that you discover,
even during the exhibition.

1333
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:50,419
You spend so much time preparing
for an exhibition, writing a catalogue,

1334
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:53,151
thinking about
each individual work in detail,

1335
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,099
but it is only when you see them
together in the same room

1336
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:55,703
but it is only when you see them
together in the same room

1337
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:57,708
that things start to become apparent.

1338
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:02,707
So for us, over the last three months, living
with these works together in one space,

1339
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:07,780
we have learned a great deal about how
Leonardo really developed as a painter,

1340
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,819
how his students were responding
to him in Milan,

1341
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:13,459
how others did not really respond to him

1342
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,739
and just continued
to do what they were doing before,

1343
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:15,899
and just continued
to do what they were doing before,

1344
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:19,899
how he was working with his workshop,
how he collaborated with his students.

1345
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,939
There are still very many open questions.

1346
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:24,059
And I think we have also learned
a great deal

1347
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,699
about the two versions of
The Virgin of the Rocks.

1348
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,099
And still, it is a bit of a puzzle.

1349
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:32,859
An historians have thought about it for,
I believe, over a hundred years

1350
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:35,499
and they've tried to work out
the chronology

1351
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:36,379
and the relationship
between these two paintings,

1352
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,019
and the relationship
between these two paintings,

1353
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,099
a commission
that is very well documented,

1354
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,939
but yet, we don't quite know
why there are two pictures

1355
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,510
and who painted them and when.

1356
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:03,579
Originally, it was only men
who were allowed to model.

1357
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:06,979
Early Renaissance artists
were drawing from men only,

1358
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:11,030
and then having to sort of adapt those
drawings for the women in their paintings.

1359
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:13,059
It was definitely a male profession,

1360
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:16,269
because women would be seen as...
Prostitutes.

1361
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:18,139
Ya. It wasn't the sort of thing
women could be seen to be doing.

1362
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,710
Ya. It wasn't the sort of thing
women could be seen to be doing.

1363
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:22,459
But it is always a decision,
when you're making a drawing,

1364
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,979
you have to go for it,
because if you skirt around it,

1365
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:27,019
- you get a very strange figure.
- It's there.

1366
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,179
It's there. It's just part of everything else.

1367
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:33,499
But you're right, you don't see... in the
gallery, you can't think of any examples.

1368
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,468
- Yeah.
- I think it's a very...

1369
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,779
- healthy thing to have life drawing.
- Mm.

1370
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,019
- Healthy thing to have life drawing.
- Mm.

1371
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:42,339
- Yeah, it's liberating, isn't it?
- I'm 51, it's the first time I've done it.

1372
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,059
- If I did it when I was younger...
- Yeah.

1373
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:47,179
- ...It might have changed my outlook.
- It just reminds you that...

1374
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:49,059
- It's a very free experience.
- Exactly.

1375
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:51,699
- To see a body as it is.
- Stripped of everything.

1376
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:54,339
- And it's the safe environment as well.
- Yeah.

1377
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:57,059
- It's a sort of encoded environment.
- No one starts giggling.

1378
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,339
Yeah. And that it's just celebrating how...

1379
01:37:59,340 --> 01:37:59,419
- just how beautiful it is.
- How we are.

1380
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,139
- Just how beautiful it is.
- How we are.

1381
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:04,701
How beautiful we are, yeah.
It's a really good thing to just focus on.

1382
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,589
And then it, as you say, it changes your...

1383
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,059
Oh, it's blowing up!

1384
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:20,743
Oh, it's blowing up!

1385
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,819
Go... No, stay there!

1386
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,471
Put the light...
put the lights carefully, yeah?

1387
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:39,309
Why don't you fuck off home and
leave fucking London alone, yeah?

1388
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:40,699
You fucking idiots. Yeah?

It's this question of
what's the water doing?

1396
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:54,699
If you could just nail
what the role of the water is.

1397

We're saying here how he's doing
the thing that we've already talked about.

And that'll be about endings and...

- Erm...
- OK, just help me with one thing...

- The passing and everything...
- Right, help me with one thing.

- Erm... Cuyp... let's say...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1403
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:19,429
- ...has cows, tree, grass, light.
- Yeah.

1404
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:23,899
If Cuyp's work...
Is Cuyp's work a... a metaphor?

1405
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:25,299
If Cuyp's work...
Is Cuyp's work a... a metaphor?

1406
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:27,899
Or just a cute picture of a cow
and grass?

1407
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,019
- No.
- OK. What...

1408
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,099
- Nor's this. We're just saying it is.
- Right.

1409
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:34,099
What I'm getting at is, basically,
if that weren't water...

1410
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:36,099
- Mm.
- If that was afield...

1411
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:38,299
How is the water metaphorical,
you're saying?

1412
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,299
Yeah, how does it help him
generate metaphor?

1413
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,711
- OK...
- Do you see what I mean?

1414
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:43,299
Yeah, but let me do it, then.

1415
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:45,019
I can see what you mean,
I'm now gonna do it.

1416
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:45,350
I can see what you mean,
I'm now gonna do it.

1417
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,419
- Are these your glasses? No.
- No.

1418
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:51,583
No, they're mine. They're mine.
They're mine. Thanks.

1419
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:57,504
- OK. Got it.
- OK.

1420
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:07,739
Action.

1421
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:11,699
The Fighting Temeraire.
How different the mood would be

1422
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:15,546
- if it weren't for the accent of...
- That's just coming off...

1423
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:19,031
Still set.

1424
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:22,099
Action.

1425
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:25,739
The Fighting Temeraire.
How different the mood would be

1426
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,299
if it weren't for the accent
of that black buoy.

1427
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:29,819
If it weren't for the accent
of that black buoy.

1428
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:34,099
But how exactly Turner gets
the balance between the two blacks,

1429
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:39,100
the buoy and the tug, with that
precise sense of space between them,

1430
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:44,660
the massive, heavy treatment of the sunset,
and then the subtle glow beneath,

1431
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,939
it's very hard to say where light
meets darkness,

1432
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:48,739
it's very hard to say where light
meets darkness,

1433
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:51,141
so subtle is the grade.

1434
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:55,899
How he gets all those things is
the essence of the success of the picture.

1435
01:41:55,900 --> 01:42:00,579
Water becomes a metaphor for feeling,

1436
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:02,939
for yearning, the sense of loss,

1437
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:07,707
the depth of emotion
that his subject is about.

1438
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:11,299
A metaphor is a literary thing,
that comes from the mind.

1439
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,299
But the painting is made powerful
by what's actually in it.

1440
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:18,819
The precise shapes of those sails,

1441
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,902
with the light shining on them.

1442
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:27,379
And then, their repeat
in the sliver of light by the black buoy.

1443
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:31,899
And then, the wonderful,
lively fullness of that sunset,

1444
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:37,066
and the placid shimmer
of the blue cityscape on the horizon.

1445
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:43,020
It's through the doing and the redoing
of all those calling and answering elements

1446
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:49,786
that Turner makes light on the Thames
into such a tremendous metaphor.

1447
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:03,987
OK. That will work.

01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:30,619
But the other fittings that were in the room
previously will have dropped, possibly.

1468
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:33,146
Maybe what we should do
is close the blinds again,

1469
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:37,549
and set everything back
to the full output level.

1470
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:44,143
- But these should be at a hundred.
- Exactly. Yes.

1471
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:46,099
- Darren!
- Yep'?

1472
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:49,946
Come back to the...
the light on the centre panel.

1473
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:54,579
Can you see enough from up there
to see what's happening'?

1474
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:57,579
- Yep.
- We've got a huge frame shadow.

1475
01:45:57,580 --> 01:46:00,619
I don't think there's going to be anything
we can do about that.

1476
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:05,579
It's because the frames are causing it
to sit behind the glass so far back.

1477
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:08,139
- Right.
- But...

1478
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:10,499
Do you have your card handy?

1479
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,499
Put your card over the first fixture.

1480
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,619
Take it away.

1481
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:18,099
Again.

1482
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,068
Take it away.

1483
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,819
Take it away.

1484
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:29,630
Tweak that one up a wee bit too.

1485
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:34,819
There you go.

1486
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:36,982
OK, move along to the next.

1487
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,828
Take it away.

1488
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:47,031
Again. Take it away.

1489
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:51,547
Let me let my eyes adjust a moment.

1490
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:58,025
I forgot my sunglasses this morning.
I always bring my sunglasses up.

1491
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:01,140
- <i> Good.</i>
- <i>Kevin.</i>

1492
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:05,866
So that's 150 at the top.

1493
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:11,739
All right, there, we're getting
more in line now. Good.

1494
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:14,619
Good. Let's check the centre panel again,

1495
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:17,271
because we've added this light.

1496
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,108
140.

1497
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:24,742
And now the left... left wing.

1498
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,899
- 140.
- That's a shame about the shadow,

1499
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:32,859
- but I'm afraid there's just nothing...
- We've got to live with it.

1500
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:36,342
Not without... backing it uncomfortably.

1501
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:40,739
- Well, there's no more room, is there?
- There really isn't.

1502
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:44,139
Wheelchairs... Let's go and use that...

1503
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:47,781
You've been heroic.
With the exception of the shadow...

1504
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:52,819
it's a lot better
than I thought it was gonna be.

1505
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:55,019
So thank you guys very much.

1506
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,988
No problem.

1507
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:06,781
<i> Go ahead, 0-1, over.</i>

1508
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:11,179
I'll take you to an extreme example.
We were discussing natural light,

1509
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:14,299
and how now, no one notices
where the lighting is in the painting.

1510
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,745
Like, where's this one lit from?

1511
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:19,739
I think from this side...
<i></i> Top left. Yeah.

1512
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:23,659
And it's the fact that in the 17th century,
we know people were much more aware.

1513
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:26,299
But when van der Doort
wrote the inventory for Charles I,

1514
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:30,339
he recorded every painting and said
whether it was lit from the left or the right.

1515
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:32,539
Which you just don't even do now.

1516
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:36,099
Cos we're so used to electric light
coming down and doing it all for us,

1517
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,939
- we don't realize...
- Right.

1518
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:40,420
...It's important to record how it was.

1519
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:44,579
I assume he did it
cos he was gonna hang the paintings

1520
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:46,739
- according to which way they were lit.
- Yeah.

1521
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:48,659
This was in a big church,

1522
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:51,619
and you could probably find,
actually, which chapel it was in,

1523
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,619
and see where the light was
during the day,

1524
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:57,909
how it worked, what was
the optimum time for it to be viewed.

1525
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:02,419
So he probably never imagined that
it would be shown in this kind of context,

1526
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:04,149
with electric lighting and...

1527
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:07,939
No, and that's something
that you have got to address, in a sense.

1528
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:10,699
We don't address it, we say
everything's gonna be designed

1529
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:13,619
- to be seen dead front on, evenly lit.
- Yeah.

1530
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,659
I can give you one... Cos we're nearby...

1531
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:20,029
Let's go to the Rubens gallery first.
I'll show you an extreme example of that.

1532
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:29,819
OK, this is exceptional,
cos we know where this painting was.

1533
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:34,579
And it still exists, the actual venue,
it was in Rockox's own house

1534
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:36,459
and it was above his chimney piece.

1535
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:41,019
And chimneys in the 17th century weren't
like these little miserable things we get now.

1536
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:43,459
The height of a chimney
was always about here.

1537
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:47,019
That's the top ledge of it.
So it would have been at least that high.

1538
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,979
You've got to imagine...
You're gonna have to look down on the...

1539
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:52,699
You know, the painting's way above you
and you're looking up.

1540
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:55,299
You could actually walk into chimneys
in the 17th century.

1541
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,419
And you can gum, the lighting's on the left.

1542
01:49:57,420 --> 01:50:00,499
OK? That's where the windows were.
The windows were quite high too.

1543
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:04,939
Now, it has one immediate effect,
which you don't get now,

1544
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:06,739
when you light it evenly,

1545
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:09,059
is the lighting is stronger on the left,

1546
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:11,819
because that's the source
of the natural light.

1547
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:15,859
And therefore,
it picks up her very strongly,

1548
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:18,739
and the five figures
in the doorway look very faint.

1549
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:21,739
And that's worth noticing,
because you wouldn't expect that.

1550
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:25,779
And now, in this light, they look almost
as if they're competing spatially,

1551
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:28,899
and they're very bright, you know,
the guys coming in to arrest him.

1552
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:31,028
But when you actually
put it in its original place,

1553
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:32,939
and we did this a couple of years ago,

1554
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:36,786
switch off all the electric lights, which
always takes a bit of persuading to do,

1555
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,147
you'll find the painting clicks and pops,

1556
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:42,579
because those guys
fade back into the distance

1557
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:45,099
and this stuff, it almost looks too harsh.

1558
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:48,379
Because the light's stronger,
it becomes much smoother.

1559
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:51,179
He must have known he was doing that,
cos he's made the contrast.

1560
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:53,819
See, the ground's sneaking
through between the white.

1561
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:55,339
You can see the warm ground.

1562
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:59,299
So he's made it to catch the light
and so this is the focal point.

1563
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:02,459
Would he have painted it in the same light
as it would have been displayed?

1564
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,659
- Yes, he probably painted it in situ.
- Mm.

1565
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:08,499
I mean, there's quite a lot of evidence that
artists did go and place paintings in situ.

1566
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,459
Rockox was a friend of his.

1567
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:12,144
And if not, he would have touched it up.

1568
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:14,339
And that brings you to a different problem.

1569
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,579
What happens... He used tinted varnishes,

1570
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:19,859
which we know existed
from Pliny's time in antiquity.

1571
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:22,699
Cos he would have thought,
"Oh, that bit's now too bright."

1572
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,659
- Yes.
- And if we clean them all off,

1573
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:27,539
we think we're very scientific,
we strip all the varnish off,

1574
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:30,139
and so we destroy any of that evidence.

1575
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:35,140
Even when we find original varnish, we tend
to get very excited and take them off.

1576
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:39,459
And so that's something we'll never know,
how much the artist toned it back.

1577
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,299
But you can see in this painting...

1578
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:43,699
I think the painting's much finer over here.

1579
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:46,619
If you come here, see,
he's just done zigzags.

1580
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:48,019
- Hasn't bothered...
- Yeah.

1581
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:49,899
To do any real modeling at all.

1582
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:52,019
Cos he knows this is the dark corner.

1583
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:54,705
And he also knows it's above your eyeline.

1584
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,828
And so you see these differences...

1585
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:01,707
And he also knows the window
lets in the breeze,

1586
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:04,899
so he's made the candle blow from the left.

1587
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:07,499
Yeah, that's quite...
So you lose all that.

1588
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,141
I mean, context is almost kind of crucial
for a painting like this.

1589
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:15,299
And you read a lot of rubbish because
people say it's above a fireplace,

1590
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,379
oh, it's the flickering firelight.

1591
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:20,579
If you actually look at a firelight,
it doesn't reflect back.

1592
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,979
The thing that light reflects off is floor.

1593
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,859
And so, I mean, if this was a palace,
for instance,

1594
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:30,659
and we can try it when we go to a
banqueting hall and switch off all the lights.

1595
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:33,859
You know, how much light do you get
from the windows bouncing off the floor,

1596
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:35,191
and illuminating the ceiling.

1597
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:39,739
And you can test it... The only place I know
it really works well is Palazzo Barberini.

1598
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:42,059
- Anyway, thank you very much.
- Yes.

1599
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:43,585
See you.
See you.

1600
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:14,419
Do you want the light?
Please.

1601
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:16,388
Yeah, it's not doing...

1602
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:06,863
<i></i>

1603
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:38,103
Aaah. Not that square. Not that square.

1604
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,666
<i></i>

1605
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:44,785
<i></i>

1606
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:51,749
<i></i>

1607
01:54:55,940 --> 01:55:00,219
<i>- The Titian cuts across here.
- OK.</i>

1608
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:03,139
- So this would... This would be one wall.
- Yeah. Right, I get it.

1609
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,779
So it's... it's 'within that... within that space.

1610
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,623
So it's not a very big...

1611
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:10,469
How far do you have
to be from the paintings? What...

1612
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:12,739
- The barrier there.
- Oh, that's just the barrier.

1613
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:14,230
- Yeah.
- And what is the barrier?

1614
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,779
- It's...
- It's just a little...

1615
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:19,619
It can be up for grabs, but it would be like...
probably like a rope...

1616
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,701
- Yeah.
- Thing.

1617
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:23,139
- OK. I think it's fine, space-wise.
- Yeah?

1618
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:25,541
I don't think it's a problem.
What's the floor like?

1619
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:29,147
Erm... it is concrete,
with wood over the top.

1620
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:32,549
But maybe you could put
some vinyl or something'?

1621
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:34,579
- Well...
- Actually, this is the floor.

1622
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:37,539
- Shall we have a look at the floor?
- Yeah. It's concrete underneath.

1623
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:39,819
It's oak, I think, over concrete.

1624
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:41,499
I mean, I think we just have to look

1625
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:44,579
at the visual aesthetic of the thing
to be in front of the Titians.

1626
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,939
I just think, if you put
a floor intervention on there,

1627
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,420
it might look a little bit... artificial.

1628
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:50,871
- And actually...
- Yeah.

1629
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:53,379
If it was Ed, you could
ask him if you would dance on that.

1630
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,979
- As a question. So...
- Yes. OK.

1631
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:57,379
Or Carlos. It's a question.
Would you mind...

1632
01:55:57,380 --> 01:55:59,939
- Dancing on that?
- Yeah, and they would have a point of view,

1633
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:01,459
- and we'd respect it.
- Yeah. OK.

1634
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:03,539
But I think the question
would have to be asked.

1635
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,299
I don't think it'd be a problem.
They won't be doing massive...

1636
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:08,099
- They're not...
- ...jumps and leaps...

1637
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,059
- Even Carlos.
- Well, not in here, no.

1638
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:12,139
- Yeah, even Carlos! Yeah...
- OK.

1639
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:14,539
But I think, you know,
putting just dance floor...

1640
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:16,139
- Like, a lino's no use.
- It's no use.

1641
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:18,899
You'd have to build a sprung floor.
Then you get a whole other...

1642
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,419
- That would be...
- ...dynamic.

1643
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:22,741
If you come to a gallery
to dance in front of the Titians,

1644
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:24,424
- that's the nature of the event.
- OK.

1645
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:27,339
So one has to find what would
be the most appropriate thing.

1646
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:29,308
<i>Woman) OK.</i>

1647
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:50,939
So, good morning, everybody.

1648
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:53,307
And thank you so much
for coming this morning.

1649
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:56,859
'Titian called these works
something special.

1650
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:59,659
He called them poems, "poesie".

1651
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:04,499
And that was the first time
that an artist had referred to his works

1652
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:07,151
in a way comparing himself

1653
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:12,260
to the intellectual capacity of poets,

1654
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:15,939
of poets of the ancient times.

1655
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:20,940
And, of course, Titian's favourite poet,
who he was very familiar with,

1656
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:27,701
and was able to read in the many
wonderful vernacular translations

1657
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,739
that were circulating at that time,

1658
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:34,740
was Ovid, who, of course,
was a Roman poet,

1659
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:39,619
and who wrote the wonderful
Metamorphoses.

1660
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:44,620
Ovid told these tales of the gods
from the Greek pantheon

1661
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:50,220
with such a mixture of humour and levity,

1662
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:54,703
and, at the same time,

1663
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:58,619
acknowledging
the tragic elements of the...

1664
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:03,620
of human beings son of tangled up
in the loves and affairs of the gods.

1665
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:10,100
And it was these subjects that
Titian chose to send to Philip.

1666
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:16,420
And I now just want to look at the picture
and see all the different tools

1667
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:21,739
that 'Tahitian has used
to bring the story to life

1668
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:24,823
and to make us really feel

1669
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:29,459
all sons of different, conflicting emotions,

1670
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:31,539
just as Ovid did.

1671
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:34,819
And I think the reason
that Tahitian loved Ovid so much

1672
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:38,427
was that he was tragicomic, yes,

1673
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:42,699
but he was also a poet
that really used words

1674
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:44,350
in a very, very visual way,

1675
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:48,059
<i>whereas Wan was a gainer</i>

1676
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:53,060
who could conjure up poetry visually.

1677
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:56,739
And that's why,
in this famous letter to Philip,

1678
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:59,141
he called these works poems.

1679
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:04,260
And I think that as we sit there
and feel that lyrical quality emanating forth,

1680
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:10,339
that we can understand why that was

1681
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:12,741
and why they're still called
"poesie" to this day.

1682
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:29,619
Today's ten-minute talk
is on Michelangelo's Entombment,

1683
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:32,699
this large painting behind me.

1684
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:36,659
This is quite an extraordinary example
of the National Gallery's collection.

1685
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:41,059
I don't know if any of you were looking at it
and thought that it looked a bit odd.

1686
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:46,059
There are some
really quite unusual features in this painting.

1687
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:50,899
It's perhaps not the most typical way,
for example to represent the subject.

1688
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:57,749
And also, well, I suppose what I most notice
about it is its unfinished stale.

1689
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:01,739
That's quite a curious aspect
of what's going on.

1690
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,339
I don't know what you think, but for me,

1691
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:06,939
it's really great to have
mysteries and questions

1692
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:09,779
hanging over paintings
that are 500 years old,

1693
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:11,748
because sometimes,
we tend to look at them

1694
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:14,744
and think because they're 500 years old,

1695
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:17,187
we know everything
there is to know about them.

1696
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:18,745
And, of course, that's not the case,

1697
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:20,899
and every single one of us,
as an individual,

1698
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:23,579
brings a different story
to a painting like this,

1699
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:25,099
and sees something different.

1700
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:28,939
I absolutely do see someone texting
on a mobile phone.

1701
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:31,939
Of course, that's probably not
what everyone else sees at all.

1702
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:36,339
But that's actually what can help
keep these paintings alive for us,

1703
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:38,979
the mystery around
what the artist had intended,

1704
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:41,711
because it's not always
completely obvious.

1705
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:45,102
I'm going to stop there. If you do want
to ask questions, please do.

1706
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:15,743
Something all artists are interested in

1707
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:19,219
is how painting can kind of freeze reality.

1708
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:23,939
So someone who died a long time ago
is still here, looking at us.

1709
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:26,979
This lobster, which existed a long time ago,

1710
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:30,419
which now doesn't exist at all,
of course, is here, preserved.

1711
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:33,788
The amazing preservation, and here it is.

1712
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:35,862
The drinking horn still exists.

1713
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:39,739
It's probably the only thing in the painting,
I imagine, that does still exist.

1714
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:41,788
But it's that idea of something
being ephemeral,

1715
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:44,139
something like a lemon.

1716
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:47,110
And artists were really intrigued
by the idea that they could do that,

1717
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:49,706
preserve something forever, really.

1718
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:53,539
Well, it won't last forever,
but it'll last longer than us,

1719
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:55,699
barring some disaster.

1720
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:57,668
And that's an interesting idea.

1721
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:01,739
I'll tell you a joke about Moses.

1722
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:04,539
He goes up... This is not true.

1723
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:08,539
He goes up onto the mountain,
comes down with the Ten Commandments.

1724
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:11,459
And he gathers the Israelites around him,

1725
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:15,179
and he says, "OK, guys. I've been up there,
I've had a word with Him.

1726
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:17,819
"Do you want the good news
or the bad news?"

1727
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:22,419
And they say, "Good news." He says, "The
good news is, I've got Him down to ten.

1728
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:25,230
"The bad news is
that adultery's still on the list."

1729
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:33,940
Anyway, this painting got vandalized
a couple of months ago.

1730
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:37,701
Some crazy guy came in
with a red aerosol.

1731
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:41,059
Luckily, they got the restoration team
in straightaway,

1732
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:43,711
took it down, took it away,
worked all night.

1733
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:45,819
And I came in the next morning,
and it was...

1734
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:47,179
- Oh, it was already up?
- Yeah.

1735
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:49,579
It was back up there, cleaned up, perfect.

1736
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:52,059
Sadly, these things happen
from time to time.

1737
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:54,619
But you just have to learn to live with it.

1738
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:57,059
Now, let me show you the last Claude,

1739
02:02:57,060 --> 02:02:59,745
because there's a nice little story
attached to this one.

1740
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:06,819
To come back to that research
on Watteau was fundamental.

1741
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:10,579
Bringing the works together
was also an important element.

1742
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,019
Now we will see from
what will come out of the...

1743
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:16,859
- The copy...
- Of the study of the partition.

1744
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:20,299
I have ordered a big electronic copy
of the partition,

1745
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:22,699
and we have sent it to William Christie,
who believes -

1746
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:25,019
and I think all the scholars believe -

1747
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:29,819
that Watteau represented very accurately
every movement, musical movement,

1748
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,379
- so it's not...
- Well, we've consulted...

1749
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:37,059
- Yeah.
- ...a number of musicologists ourselves.

1750
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:39,419
- Yeah.
- And the consensus now is

1751
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:42,059
- that that is not a real...
- A real partition.

1752
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:44,179
- It's not a real piece of music.
- OK.

1753
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:47,150
Probably an energetic restorer put it in!

1754
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:49,539
Well, yeah, whatever.

1755
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:52,779
I mean, I haven't compared
the music in the painting

1756
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:55,670
- with the music in the print line by line.
- I was going to ask.

1757
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:59,099
That is something I must do.
But I am told that it's not a guitar piece,

1758
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:01,739
because you would expect
a number of chords.

1759
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:03,151
- OK.
- It's not a singing piece,

1760
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:08,710
cos there are no words, other than there's
what appear to be the remains of a title.

1761
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:11,419
- Yes.
- We can't actually make out what that is.

1762
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:14,419
It's impossible to read,
and we've looked at that quite carefully.

1763
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:17,185
- Yeah.
- Er... So if it's not a guitar piece,

1764
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:20,099
and it's not a singing pan,
I mean, what is it?

1765
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:23,379
We conclude that it might be...

1766
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:28,339
the only possibility
is that it is music for the guitar

1767
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:33,299
and that she is rather awkwardly
holding it like this,

1768
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:35,979
so he can actually see what he's playing,

1769
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:38,019
but, in fact, he's not playing, so...

1770
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:40,579
- At that particular...
- So that was another...

1771
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:42,708
So he's just "according" his guitar,
do you think?

1772
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:44,459
- Because we...
- Tuning, yeah.

1773
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:46,144
- Tuning, sorry.
- You mean tuning, yeah.

1774
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:48,299
- Or is he playing, because...
- Yeah, but...

1775
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:52,339
He could be... I don't know,
he could be about to, you know, tap it, or...

1776
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:54,099
- Yeah.
- And on this,

1777
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:58,459
there is some written documents, now,
from the different musicologist who did...

1778
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:01,419
- I've got... I've got letters or emails.
- Correspondence.

1779
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:03,459
- That could be... Can we...
- Yes, yes.

1780
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:06,459
That's incorporated
into a draft catalogue entry

1781
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:08,619
- which I wrote last year.
- OK.

1782
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:11,579
OK. That we can...
We could use this information?

1783
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:14,539
- You could use this information.
- Because it would be interesting

1784
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:19,419
to see who are these musicologists,
and seeing with Bill...

1785
02:05:19,420 --> 02:05:22,139
as I would say he's more a musician
than a musicologist,

1786
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:23,739
- I would say.
- Yeah.

1787
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:26,859
The drawings I saw in Berlin,

1788
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:29,139
there, we discovered that we...

1789
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:33,339
with Bill, that we know which music
is performed at a place,

1790
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:37,659
and it's so complex
in the positions on the instrument

1791
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:39,659
that he must have known music.

1792
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:42,419
Because that's still also an element
that was not clear.

1793
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:44,619
- Yes.
- In these drawings,

1794
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:48,219
it cannot be otherwise
than he knows how to play,

1795
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:49,699
and knowing music.

1796
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:52,539
- And that's also an element.
- That's an important thing to prove.

1797
02:05:52,540 --> 02:05:54,939
Yes. Yes. That's also the element
of the drawings

1798
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:59,707
which are in the Kupferstichkabinett
by Dr Altcappenberg, in Berlin.

1799
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:02,059
The... the...

1800
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:04,619
The drawings we... I saw there last week.

1801
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:07,299
And so, from the work
that was done by Bill,

1802
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:10,819
he knows now that in the... in the...

1803
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:13,979
in the different drawings,
there's one of an oboe,

1804
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:15,982
then another one of a viola da gamba,

1805
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:19,139
and there's no scores there.

1806
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:21,142
There's only drawings of positions.

1807
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:23,379
- So you have the...
- They're convincing, yeah.

1808
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:26,419
Yes. And also how the... the complexity of...

1809
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:31,420
We've several musicians, also, from the
Berliner Philharmoniker who came to see,

1810
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:36,299
and everyone is convinced
you cannot draw if you don't know music.

1811
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,951
- Yeah.
- It's like we would say...

1812
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:45,500
In photography, it's like the... in film,
to make just that moment.

1813
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:50,419
Yes. Mm. No, I think everybody accepts
that Watteau knew musicians,

1814
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:52,499
and he knew his musical instruments.

1815
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:54,339
I mean, that represents the type...

1816
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:57,459
But it's clear that he was knowing music?
That's not clear for me.

1817
02:06:57,460 --> 02:07:00,099
Well, it's not clear that he actually
plays music himself.

1818
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:01,859
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- No.

1819
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:03,703
Which is a different thing.

1820
02:07:03,780 --> 02:07:07,099
But that represents a guitar

1821
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:12,100
of a type that was being made
in Paris around 1700.

1822
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:16,299
- Yeah.
- I mean, you know, that's pretty accurate.

1823
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,939
Did I say the black's
been strengthened or not?

1824
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:21,147
- Cos black's the most soluble paint.
- I don't know.

1825
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:23,149
She's missing a few fingernails,

1826
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:25,979
which makes you wonder,
did they also take off a few notes?

1827
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:29,339
You've got to be very careful interpreting
what is now there

1828
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:30,979
- as musical notes.
- OK.

1829
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:34,899
- Yeah.
- Anyway... it's good to hear the case.

1830
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:37,099
- Yeah.
- You were a surprise...

1831
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:39,899
And good luck with your exhibition,
whatever happens.

1832
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:41,504
- Danke, danke.
- Thank you.

1833
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:47,699
She's just looking too...

1834
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:49,539
Well, I think - I know I'm biased -

1835
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:51,739
I think it’s the most beautiful room
in the gallery.

1836
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:54,659
- What are you going to say?
- Look at that, the Subleyras.

1837
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:57,819
- Yeah.
- I mean, that's...

1838
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:59,948
Have a look.

1839
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:04,579
- That touch, that very delicate...
- Yeah, delicate touch.

1840
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:08,979
...touch, you know, she can't believe...

1841
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:11,939
She's totally in love
with this shepherd boy.

1842
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:15,149
You know, she just can't believe
how beautiful he is.

1843
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:16,859
And she's got to just touch him

1844
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:19,739
- to make sure that he's real.
- That he's real.

1845
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:22,823
And the dogs! That dog is amazing.

1846
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:26,179
- Anyway.
- Yeah. Well, I'm glad...

1847
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:29,019
- I mustn't keep you.
- That's...

1848
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:31,339
It's lovely to be back.

1849
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:33,627
Well, you must come
and see us more often.

1850
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:37,379
And in the middle
of the 16th century,

1851
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:40,939
we have something called the
Counter-Reformation taking place

1852
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:45,699
in Italy, in response
to the challenge of Luther,

1853
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:49,699
as he challenges the Catholic Church.

1854
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:54,419
And what he... one of the things that comes
into question is the value of images.

1855
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:59,420
Are images dangerous, because they are
likely to be understood as replicants of God

1856
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:02,579
or replicants of figures from the Bible?

1857
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:04,379
Or are they important

1858
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:09,380
as a way into understanding
the word of God as it was written?

1859
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:12,099
So this is a debate that's taking place,

1860
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:15,707
and what happens in Italy
is there is a proliferation of images.

1861
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:18,339
In other words, the response
is to make more images,

1862
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:21,059
and to make them
as emotional as possible,

1863
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:25,619
so that you feel a sense within yourself
of what is... what is happening.

1864
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:29,059
And the message is one of fraternal love.
It's a universal message,

1865
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:31,499
and it's something
that we can all relate to.

1866
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:34,739
And the idea is that you go away
from the experience of viewing

1867
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:37,061
feeling more love
towards your fellow man.

1868
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:47,499
I gum
all I would like to point out here

1869
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:50,709
is that, having seen that issue
with the blanched ground downstairs,

1870
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:52,659
and how that disrupted that space,

1871
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:56,739
I think you might have your eye in enough
to start to recognize it here.

1872
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:59,859
I mean, the more dramatic examples
are something like this,

1873
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:02,139
where you've got the parts of the table.

1874
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:04,179
Again, this isn't him correcting something,

1875
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:08,019
but the actual paint he's subsequently
applied on top of the ground

1876
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:10,459
is very close in colour
to what that would have been.

1877
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:12,699
He certainly didn't intend
a great blotchy space.

1878
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:15,619
And again, we have more and more
empirical evidence about that,

1879
02:10:15,620 --> 02:10:18,739
beyond just looking at the material itself.

1880
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:23,740
This rather pale thing is absolutely...
it's a strong shadow cast from her arm.

1881
02:10:24,180 --> 02:10:27,499
You see it, the way it goes up the side
of the table and makes a sharp angle.

1882
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:29,739
It's the cast shadow of the arm falling.

1883
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:33,819
And so, obviously,
that must be a darker value than this.

1884
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:36,539
And, see, that gets to the core
of what I was saying downstairs

1885
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:39,539
about when the pigment change
is so localized

1886
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:42,819
that it's really quite disruptive
to understanding what the thing is.

1887
02:10:42,820 --> 02:10:47,339
That is a different kind of argument
about what you might do as a restorer

1888
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:52,139
to correct that, or at least to reduce
the effects of... problematic effects.

1889
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:54,099
One of the most fundamental issues...

1890
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:55,659
Well, I wouldn't say problematic,

1891
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:58,739
but it's certainly an open question
where this picture is concerned,

1892
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:01,939
and it has to do with the basic construction
of the space, where the wall is,

1893
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:03,179
is that a window'?

1894
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:05,579
<i>Is</i> it a picture of a picture?
All those kinds of issues.

1895
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:09,659
Anyway, the evidence provided
by the ground and the shadows

1896
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:12,499
suggests that this table
is right up against the wall.

1897
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:15,899
You have a painted shadow
here in black paint

1898
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:19,139
of the fish's head against the wall,
which tells you that it's quite close,

1899
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:21,179
and the fact that that's cast there,

1900
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:26,180
I think is also pretty important in...
in fixing where that thing sits in space.

1901
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:29,619
Again, this kind of ground colour here,

1902
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:33,419
and then mixed with a bit of white,
an applied shadow,

1903
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:35,419
it all kind of starts to make sense.

1904
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:39,739
This has still got quite a bit of retouching
that needs to be done.

1905
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:41,539
And you can see the brush wipings here

1906
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:44,499
that are partially covered in
ground-coloured paint by Velázquez,

1907
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:46,659
and have been exposed by old cleanings,

1908
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:50,379
and you have the basic ground colour,
a darker shadow,

1909
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:53,419
and what would have probably been
an even darker one into the table.

1910
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:56,902
It all starts to make sense
if you start to substitute this colour.

1911
02:11:57,940 --> 02:12:00,419
But I think you... I hope you might agree

1912
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:04,859
that this, then, is pretty fundamental
to understanding what's going on.

1913
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:08,019
Similarly, this area of the old woman's chin,

1914
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:11,459
it sort of comes forward, now,
in a sort of Cubist way,

1915
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:13,739
and that's, again,
because of blanched ground.

1916
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:14,819
It should be much darker.

1917
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:18,539
So if you start to, wherever you see this,
substitute a darker value,

1918
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:21,699
I think all kinds of things
start falling into place

1919
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:24,059
about the way the elements are modeled,

1920
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:26,819
and where they are
in relation to one another.

1921
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:31,019
And it's such a limited palette
and such an austere kind of image,

1922
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:35,179
I think these issues
are really pretty fundamental

1923
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:37,979
to your reading
and understanding of the picture.

1924
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:40,019
And what he's trying to do.

1925
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:44,179
So that's why we might take
a slightly different view

1926
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:46,387
about how to approach its retouching.

1927
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:51,703
Everything that Larry is now doing
in terms of retouching

1928
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:54,819
is on top of a layer of varnish.

1929
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:57,819
That, once it's cleaned, it's varnished,

1930
02:12:57,820 --> 02:13:00,059
and then Larry works on top of the varnish,

1931
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:02,419
so that all the work that he does,

1932
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:07,019
the tens, if not hundreds of hours
that goes into restoring a picture,

1933
02:13:07,020 --> 02:13:09,979
the next time it's cleaned, it comes right off.

1934
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:14,699
The whole... the basic principle
of modern conservation

1935
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:17,819
is that anything that we do
should be reversible.

1936
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:21,819
That the next generation
can reverse it very easily.

1937
02:13:21,820 --> 02:13:25,459
Months or years of work
is gone in 15 minutes.

1938
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:27,739
That's... that's OK.

1939
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:32,299
It... it gets to the core of how you feel
about whether this is a document

1940
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:35,859
or a kind of... an archaeological thing,

1941
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:38,939
or whether you want to restore it
as an image you read.

1942
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:41,739
And how confident you are
in what you're doing.

1943
02:13:41,740 --> 02:13:45,299
It's not just because I... Dawson
and I scratch our heads and think,

1944
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:47,419
'Wouldn't it be lovely
if that was this or that?"

1945
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:52,379
It's based on an understanding
of the material, historical sources,

1946
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:56,659
and comparative images, and evidence,
as I showed you downstairs,

1947
02:13:56,660 --> 02:14:01,619
of Velázquez himself mixing colours
to match the ground that he used.

1948
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:03,739
So it's important to remember that, too.

1949
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:07,979
There are really good reasons
for the decisions we take

1950
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:10,299
in matters like this.

1951
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:14,779
I just wanna also make sure that you
understand what Larry has been saying

1952
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:18,023
about him using the ground colour
in the modeling.

1953
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:23,189
That... that it was the original ground colour,
that he trusted,

1954
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:27,099
and he thought, "Oh, that looks
just right in that shadow."

1955
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:30,059
He doesn't cover it.
And this isn't just Velázquez.

1956
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:34,099
There are lots of painters
who use ground colour in modeling

1957
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:35,779
as a kind of mid-tone sometimes.

1958
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:37,779
Caravaggio does it, for instance.

1959
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:39,219
It's not at all uncommon.

1960
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:43,659
The intent is to restore the thing
as a work of art that you read.

1961
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:47,059
At the end of the process, that wall
should more or less carry on across,

1962
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:51,099
going from light to dark in a way
that I hope you won't be able to see.

1963
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:53,939
I don't want to leave the impression
that we believe

1964
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:57,059
that our retouchings and restorations
make the picture look as it did.

1965
02:14:57,060 --> 02:15:00,379
You know, we're just trying to help you
understand what it is.

1966
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:02,179
And maybe what it was, but not...

1967
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:04,706
It's... it's a balancing act, but it's...

1968
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:07,699
A restoration is not a... not a renewal.

1969
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:11,379
No. Of course, they're physical objects
made of organic materials.

1970
02:15:11,380 --> 02:15:13,979
And the second that they're finished,
they start to age.

1971
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:16,179
And that's... that's just that.

1972
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:19,707
We haven't really talked
about the meaning of this.

1973
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:23,459
It naturally invites some consideration

1974
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:27,299
of the relationship of religion
to contemporary life.

1975
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:31,539
The two women in the foreground are
clearly figures from contemporary life.

1976
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:34,942
And one has to... has to wonder.

1977
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:39,819
What's this really about?
Are they simply sewing people,

1978
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:42,859
and the meal is going
to go through the hatch

1979
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:45,459
and be sewed in the other room?

1980
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:50,460
Or do they, in some way, represent
a modern-day Mary and Martha?

1981
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:52,459
Do you remember the story?

1982
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:55,299
Christ comes to visit Mary and Martha,

1983
02:15:55,300 --> 02:16:00,300
and Mary sits attentively at Christ's feet,
and listens to his teaching,

1984
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:04,499
while Martha makes herself very busy
going about all the chem,

1985
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:08,739
and then comes to complain
that she's been left to do everything

1986
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:10,859
and Mary isn't helping.

1987
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:13,979
And Christ chides her and says...

1988
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:17,099
says, "Martha, Martha, you're
concerned about so many things.

1989
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:20,179
"But Mary's really taken the better path in...

1990
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:22,979
"in allowing time
for her spiritual development."

1991
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:25,539
And so we have to ask ourselves,
is this...

1992
02:16:25,540 --> 02:16:28,739
is this Martha and Mary in the foreground,
in contemporary guise?

1993
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:34,031
With the old woman chiding,
that gesture, saying, "Hurry up."

1994
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:39,100
Or is it maybe the worker preparing
the garlic mayonnaise,

1995
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:41,502
so busy at work,

1996
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:46,580
and the older, wiser woman reminding
her to allow time for her spiritual life?

1997
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:54,740
There are the great words used often
in relation to this painting

1998
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:57,819
of St Teresa of Avila.

1999
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:00,710
"The Lord walks
even among the kitchen pots,

2000
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:03,511
"helping you in matters
spiritual and material."

2001
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:08,989
We have to go over
to conservation studio number two.

What a treat to be here,

02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:32,029
without lots and lots of people,

2013

which I suppose it's going to attract.

2014
02:22:34,060 --> 02:22:36,139
Yes, it must be a great attraction.

2015
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:38,302
No, I'll take this.

2016
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:44,989
Good to see you.

2017
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:48,062
What, don't we get any wine?
We're guests.

2018
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:55,419
It is very fun. I'm in London now.

2019
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:57,548
John is around for a couple of weeks.

2020
02:22:57,620 --> 02:22:59,145
Well, I'm here for...

2021
02:22:59,260 --> 02:23:02,389
Lovely. Very good.
I can't believe we've never been here before.

2022
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:04,059
Or I haven't.

2023
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:06,108
I think my friend...

2024
02:23:08,740 --> 02:23:10,819
Ebony frames are,
of course, interesting.

2025
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:14,461
World first. I want to explain where
I think the ripple moulding comes from.

2026
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:17,942
These mouldings are called ripple
mouldings. This wave... wave pattern.

2027
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:23,020
They're very interesting. They're really
the only ornament, frame ornament

2028
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:27,499
that does not ultimately
come from antiquity.

2029
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:30,788
It is sort of a non-classical ornament.

2030
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:35,860
And I think it came about
because of the way the ebony is...

2031
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:39,819
is... is... worked with.

2032
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:42,739
Because, when you work with ebony,

2033
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:47,740
it... it is not carved or planed
like other woods.

2034
02:23:48,140 --> 02:23:52,059
It is scraped with a scraper
at right angles to the wood.

2035
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:54,028
Like...

2036
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:57,229
Something like this, a metal...
a metal scraper that is...

2037
02:23:58,420 --> 02:24:02,027
scraped across the piece of wood
and lowered incrementally.

2038
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:04,785
But the process of scraping is very...

2039
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:09,101
the force is quite... is quite...

2040
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:15,143
It is... the wood is very hard, and it's...

2041
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:17,739
it is... it's quite difficult.

2042
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:19,822
You only scrape a tiny bit off each time.

2043
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:23,141
And in the process, there...

2044
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:27,231
The whole apparatus
that you use tends to vibrate

2045
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:31,339
and what you have is...
is a ripple effect on the straight moulding.

2046
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:33,308
This was just done straight, and...

2047
02:24:33,380 --> 02:24:35,499
I'm not sure whether
you can see it in the light,

2048
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:37,339
but you can certainly feel it.

2049
02:24:37,340 --> 02:24:41,739
There is a... a ripple that is voluntary.

2050
02:24:41,740 --> 02:24:44,739
That's a ripple that just happens
when you try to scrape it straight,

2051
02:24:44,740 --> 02:24:47,739
and then you have to sand it out
and straighten it out.

2052
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:51,819
But I think that this type of ripple,
out of this accidental ripple...

2053
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:55,142
And then this is done...
run over a track that goes up and down.

2054
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:58,707
The knife goes up and down or the wood
goes up and down as it's scraped along.

2055
02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:03,659
And normally, I'm against illuminating
the way frames are made,

2056
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:06,339
because it somehow
doesn't seem important.

2057
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:08,388
If... if you go to a Rembrandt exhibition,

2058
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:11,059
nobody's going to tell you
how the canvas is prepared

2059
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:13,950
and the paints are... are made,

2060
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:16,339
and all this technical bits.

2061
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:18,866
But I find it interesting
with the ebony frame,

2062
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:21,739
that I think it is... it is an accidental...

2063
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:25,904
and a... and a discovery
from the making of the frame.

2064
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:31,182
Yes, lovely.

2065
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:33,830
Oh, it's 8:45 already.

2066
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:37,746
There's plenty of room for you all now.
And it's time for me to begin.

2067
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:42,109
I'm talking about the strangely named
<i>Triumph</i> of Pan.

2068
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:48,301
Poussin has reconstructed these really
recondite elements of ancient art.

2069
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:54,302
That... that is one explanation for his...
his way of painting.

2070
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:58,499
He may have thought
that painting in antiquity

2071
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:00,548
was closer to sculpture,

2072
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:03,703
precisely because
so much more sculpture had survived,

2073
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:09,469
and he... he could only reconstruct
ancient painting in that way.

2074
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:11,659
But it's curious...

2075
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:15,059
So many of the things that attract him
about the ancient world

2076
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:18,899
which he puts into this
strange, strange painting

2077
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:20,390
are actually unnaturalistic.

2078
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:25,139
So, he knows, for example,
that ancient statues of Pan,

2079
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:28,781
as indeed is the case of figures in worship,

2080
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:32,739
their faces were actually coated
with special substances

2081
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:36,108
to make them seem more animated,
or just as a type of offering.

2082
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:39,219
So the red colour,
it's very, very extraordinary.

2083
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:41,219
But what makes it extraordinary, of course,

2084
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:45,544
is actually that the rest of the sculpture
appears to be made of polished brass.

2085
02:26:45,620 --> 02:26:48,624
It means that Poussin's actually thought,
"Maybe, in antiquity,

2086
02:26:48,700 --> 02:26:50,702
"they did not patinate their sculptures."

2087
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:52,499
And he was very, very learned

2088
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:57,028
and in touch with all the most erudite
students of antiquity in his day.

2089
02:26:57,100 --> 02:27:00,659
Some of these things that I've been
mentioning aren't actually mentioned, even,

2090
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:03,106
by modem art historical commentators
on this painting,

2091
02:27:03,180 --> 02:27:05,579
but they would be of great interest to...

2092
02:27:05,580 --> 02:27:09,299
and these subjects are of great interest,
the colouring of fem and so on,

2093
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:11,029
to archaeologists today.

2094
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:14,979
But I don't think it's quite adequate
as an explanation of this picture,

2095
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:19,542
that Poussin has just become
that much more obsessed by the antique.

2096
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:23,390
I think the clue
to the stylistic character of this work

2097
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:29,786
lies in the fact that Poussin must have
known that he was painting pictures

2098
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:34,149
which would hang beside
old paintings by Mantegna.

2099
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:37,622
Mantegna and Poussin
are the two European artists

2100
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:41,579
who are most interested in trying
to put something sculptural into painting.

2101
02:27:41,580 --> 02:27:44,106
And this becomes particularly interesting

2102
02:27:44,180 --> 02:27:48,629
in the context of this so-called "paregone",
the contest between the arts.

2103
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:53,419
Tedious to us to try and work out whether
painting or sculpture is the greatest art.

2104
02:27:53,420 --> 02:27:56,469
But within that,
the structure of that argument,

2105
02:27:56,540 --> 02:28:00,899
people fought very intelligently about what
could painting do that sculpture couldn't do.

2106
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:04,621
And you could always say of sculpture
that movement is frozen,

2107
02:28:04,700 --> 02:28:06,543
that space can't really be represented.

2108
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:10,899
How odd, to find a painter
who's actually deliberately imitating

2109
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:13,710
those precise qualities in sculpture
in their painting.

2110
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:16,419
It's a kind of reversal of what
everyone else was doing.

2111
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:18,499
And I think it's a reversal which he's done

2112
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:22,141
for people who think about art
in a very, very sophisticated way,

2113
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:27,260
people who like turning on its head
the priorities and values of other people,

2114
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:31,339
as well as the people
who are not only learned,

2115
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:33,547
but like to exhibit their learning.

2116
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:36,899
In short, this picture is very, very elitist.

2117
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:40,819
Making it accessible is quite hard work.
It's worth doing, of course.

2118
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:44,222
But it's really hard work,
cos it was painted, I think,

2119
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:49,466
not just as a subject which was
for very, very learned people,

2120
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:52,659
who liked to be more learned
than other people, and show it,

2121
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:57,951
but also, its style is painted
for an extremely sophisticated

2122
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:00,659
and very... probably very small public.

2123
02:29:00,660 --> 02:29:03,059
I'm really thrilled we have it
in the National Gallery.

2124
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:05,659
I personally don't know
whether I like it or not.

2125
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:10,139
But I certainly think it's one of the most
fascinating paintings in the National Gallery.

2126
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:12,427
It's very, very extraordinary.
Thank you very much.

2127
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:20,461
Part of the appeal
of Vermeers paintings,

2128
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:24,101
and other paintings
like them in the 17th century,

2129
02:29:24,180 --> 02:29:27,899
is that they create an ideal world,

2130
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:33,543
an ideal image that is seductive,

2131
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:38,467
and absolutely pleasant to look at.

2132
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:41,942
You're drawn into the beauty of it.

2133
02:29:42,020 --> 02:29:46,059
I think it's not just us in the 21st century

2134
02:29:46,060 --> 02:29:48,739
that the painting has that impact on.

2135
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:52,739
I think it was exactly the same
in the 17th century.

2136
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:58,031
Pan of that, of course,
is in the way in which Vermeer paints.

2137
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:01,339
He has an absolutely unique style

2138
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:06,340
that somehow finds a balance
between realism and abstraction.

2139
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:10,029
From a distance, even a short distance,

2140
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:12,546
you're struck by how realistic this is.

2141
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:14,899
You think, "Oh, wow" you know,

2142
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:17,739
"That woman, I wanna step closer
and get to know her."

2143
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:22,739
But as you get closer,
just like Impressionist paintings,

2144
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:26,870
that sense of realism
dissolves into abstraction,

2145
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:30,023
and it remains forever elusive,

2146
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:34,788
again, creating a barrier
between our world

2147
02:30:34,860 --> 02:30:38,579
and this ideal world
represented in the paintings.

2148
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:42,579
I think that is intentional
on Vermeer's part,

2149
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:46,710
to emphasize and to maintain

2150
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:51,339
the perfection
of the world that he's created.

2151
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:54,549
It's also,
as so many of Vermeer's paintings,

2152
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:58,466
a very ambiguous painting.

2153
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:00,781
Because of the woman's restraint,

2154
02:31:00,860 --> 02:31:06,344
because of the absolute regularity
and almost austerity of the composition,

2155
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:10,708
it's hard to tell exactly
what the painting is about,

2156
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:13,021
what might be going on in this painting.

2157
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:16,104
Art historians can go on endlessly

2158
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:19,899
about the symbolism
of the painting in the background,

2159
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:23,666
and, you know, the angle of this
and the juxtaposition of that.

2160
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:30,104
But how do we know that that's entirely
what Vermeer had in mind'?

2161
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:33,339
And, of course, you know,
as any other an historian,

2162
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:36,899
I've written, you know,
"This means this, this means that,"

2163
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:41,819
but there's always an element of ambiguity,
a question there

2164
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:49,147
that I firmly believe is absolutely intentional
on the part of the best artists,

2165
02:31:50,060 --> 02:31:54,499
because it's designed to keep you intrigued,
to keep you coming back,

2166
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:57,139
to keep your attention on this painting,

2167
02:31:57,140 --> 02:32:01,304
and each time you come to the painting,
depending on your mood,

2168
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:05,059
who else is in the room,
what you had for lunch,

2169
02:32:05,060 --> 02:32:07,339
it's going to look slightly different,

2170
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:09,547
it's going to appeal to you,

2171
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:13,227
you're going to engage with it
in an entirely different way.

2172
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:21,706
It's a very, very interesting
relationship between his painting technique

2173
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:25,339
and the things that we value and prize
about Caravaggio.

2174
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:30,139
The immediacy of the effect of the models,
the dramatic lighting,

2175
02:32:30,140 --> 02:32:33,339
a lot of the things
he does in his working practice

2176
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:34,865
as well as the application of paint,

2177
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:38,706
are all kind of inextricably bound
with what we treasure in them.

2178
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:42,227
So I'll start off with
Boy Bitten by a Lizard.

2179
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:44,780
The main thing I'd like
to convey about this picture

2180
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:49,860
is to get you to understand a little bit about
how he's using his priming, his ground,

2181
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:54,700
that's the layer he puts on the canvas
before he starts painting the figure.

2182
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:59,308
In this case, it's a kind of rich
kind of bricky red-brown colour.

2183
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:01,779
This is something that he's exploiting, then,

2184
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:04,019
in the subsequent build-up of the paint.

2185
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:07,388
The brown colour is left exposed,
quite deliberately,

2186
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:11,909
to help him evolve
the modeling of the flesh tones.

2187
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:14,939
Bellori, an important critic writing
in the 1670s,

2188
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:18,342
was already writing about this,
how he leaves the ground exposed

2189
02:33:18,420 --> 02:33:20,502
to give the middle colours
of the flesh painting.

2190
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:24,187
And you can see that in the shadow
and sort of around the breast,

2191
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:27,349
in the shadowed part of the cheek,
the shadowed part of the hands,

2192
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:30,779
and quite a lot of the drapery painting
is essentially the ground colour.

2193
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:32,779
And it's a very economical
way of proceeding,

2194
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:35,539
because once you establish the figure,
you use the ground,

2195
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:40,019
you can put a very thin, translucent
brown colour to push the shadows back,

2196
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:42,182
and then,
when you build the lighter colours up,

2197
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:45,907
when you're mixing the light coloured paint
and putting it on top of a darker ground,

2198
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:48,062
it gets very opaque very quickly.

2199
02:33:48,140 --> 02:33:50,063
And so it's extremely economical.

2200
02:33:50,140 --> 02:33:52,711
I mean, the dark grounds are things
that were evolved

2201
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:55,899
and used more and more frequently in Italy
throughout the 16th century,

2202
02:33:55,900 --> 02:33:58,659
particularly in north Italy,
where he was formed.

2203
02:33:58,660 --> 02:34:02,790
And I think, however, that he managed
to exploit this technique

2204
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:05,704
and kind of make it his own
and bend it toward his purposes

2205
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:08,101
in a very characteristic way.

2206
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:12,979
We, with Renaissance paintings,
have the ability, generally,

2207
02:34:12,980 --> 02:34:17,739
to look with infrared reflectography
and see evidence of initial drawing.

2208
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:21,222
And that's based on, say,
a carbon-containing charcoal or something,

2209
02:34:21,300 --> 02:34:23,499
drawn on top of a light ground,

2210
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:26,819
and so you... the contrast is something
we can pick up with infrared.

2211
02:34:26,820 --> 02:34:29,790
Now, with these pictures, traditionally,
with the dark ground,

2212
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:33,339
and whatever kind of paint
that might have been used to draw,

2213
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:35,659
you really don't see anything
with that technique.

2214
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:38,339
So it's always been a great mystery
about Caravaggio.

2215
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:41,549
Did he draw'? And in what sense
did he do preparatory drawing?

2216
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:44,021
Because we don't have, really,
drawings on paper.

2217
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:48,947
He's playing a bit of a game with you about,
you know, what skill is and what craft is

2218
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:51,864
and how speedy and confident he was.

2219
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:55,739
There's a kind of... seemingly,
a taste or a desire to look,

2220
02:34:55,740 --> 02:34:59,419
to have that kind of sprezzatura,
the brio, the ability to do something,

2221
02:34:59,420 --> 02:35:01,419
to knock it off very confidently.

2222
02:35:01,420 --> 02:35:04,469
But, like many things in Caravaggio,
what may seem...

2223
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:06,739
what is indeed revolutionary

2224
02:35:06,740 --> 02:35:12,144
is still grounded in a very careful
and considered use of his materials,

2225
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:16,899
and somebody who always, whatever
the sordid details of his personal life,

2226
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:21,499
somebody who always was in really
fantastic control of his materials

2227
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,579
and understanding
of how the paint worked.

2228
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:25,821
So I think that's the thing
I'd like to leave with you.

2229
02:35:34,460 --> 02:35:38,739
What's going on, here?
What's happened in my absence?

2230
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:40,788
In your absence.

2231
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:43,339
Well, we've done a bit of a rehang,
as you can tell.

2232
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:45,899
Yeah, definitely.
It's changed a lot, actually.

2233
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:50,303
I think there's only two or three pictures
that haven't actually moved.

2234
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:51,819
Yeah, but I mean, the...

2235
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:53,390
- Yeah.
- We basically had to do it

2236
02:35:53,460 --> 02:35:56,499
<i>to find</i> a <i>spot
for The Virgin of the Rocks.</i>

2237
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:57,865
- Yeah.
- And here it is, now.

2238
02:35:57,940 --> 02:35:58,987
And what do you think?

2239
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:03,026
I was thinking
that it looks strange, actually.

2240
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:05,307
That's changed a lot from before.

2241
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:10,339
First reaction is something that...

2242
02:36:10,340 --> 02:36:13,739
I think it's visual. No? Isn't it? It is, er...

2243
02:36:13,740 --> 02:36:16,391
- Well, it's interest...
- It's another...

2244
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:19,779
another world of colour,
you know what I mean?

2245
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:23,421
It's a completely different world.
We saw it downstairs in the exhibition,

2246
02:36:23,500 --> 02:36:27,539
how nicely it worked with the other,
later Milanese pictures,

2247
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:30,191
and that the composition
may be Florentine,

2248
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:33,019
but the whole painting is Milanese.

2249
02:36:33,020 --> 02:36:35,779
Ah... Ya,
there is a theoretical issue,

2250
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:38,431
that, as you said, it's a Milanese painting,

2251
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:43,459
but also visually, I think that is
something a little bit puzzling, isn't it?

2252
02:36:43,460 --> 02:36:47,749
You know, also, because, even
if the drawing probably is Florentine...

2253
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:49,902
Well, the idea, the composition
is Florentine.

2254
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:52,426
And, of course, you know...
and now you have...

2255
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:55,504
It... it's a difficult picture
to find a place for, actually...

2256
02:36:55,580 --> 02:36:56,820
- Yeah.
- ...In the gallery,

2257
02:36:56,900 --> 02:36:58,902
- And there is an argument to be made...
- Yeah.

2258
02:36:58,980 --> 02:37:02,427
And I think, you know, in a way it works,
and you show him, you know,

2259
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:06,107
together with Verrocchio, with his teacher,
and, you know, side by side...

2260
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:07,904
But, yeah...

2261
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:10,019
- Yeah.
- It doesn't sing as nicely.

2262
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:11,431
- No.
- It did sing downstairs.

2263
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:13,379
The only things...

2264
02:37:13,380 --> 02:37:17,829
Well, the constructive thing, how...
how Leonardo... evolution...

2265
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:19,902
- Yeah, how...
- ...is completely different.

2266
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:21,779
How it moves into a different direction.

2267
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:25,102
If you put in relation
with his old Florentine friends...

2268
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:27,666
- Yeah. Yeah.
- ...that is quite a struggle, but actually,

2269
02:37:27,740 --> 02:37:34,225
is a contrast, the way of seeing the hang,
the display of our own, that is...

2270
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:37,059
I think it's quite strange.

2271
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:40,223
But there's something quite nice
about this being situated in the comer,

2272
02:37:40,300 --> 02:37:42,109
because you enter the Sainsbury Wing,

2273
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:44,419
and you kind of meander
throughout the rooms,

2274
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:46,899
and you discover the Leonardo
in the comer,

2275
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:50,739
almost as if you discovered
a little kind of grouping in the cave...

2276
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:52,469
- Which I think is quite nice.
- <i></i> Mm.

2277
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:53,701
<i> Yeah.
Mm-hm.</i>

2278
02:37:57,140 --> 02:37:58,790
<i> One receiving, over.</i>

2279
02:38:04,300 --> 02:38:07,224
In 'Titian's letter, he says,
"I am painting...

2280
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:11,225
<i>"Diana Surprised by Actaeon,</i>

2281
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:14,110
"and... and Actaeon..."

2282
02:38:14,180 --> 02:38:17,866
The word he um is "lacerated",
by his own hounds.

2283
02:38:17,940 --> 02:38:21,339
So originally, these two pictures
would have been the pair

2284
02:38:21,340 --> 02:38:22,944
that he wanted to send to King Philip.

2285
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:26,899
This painting remains in Titian's studio,
it was never finished by Tahitian,

2286
02:38:26,900 --> 02:38:29,380
and is bought from his studio
after his death.

2287
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:32,464
So he decides not to do this,
and instead, he produces...

2288
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:34,739
- This one.
- <i>Diana</i> and Callisto as the pair.

2289
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:36,819
- So he has two...
- Completely different.

2290
02:38:36,820 --> 02:38:41,303
Yes, different, but they both show Diana
as taking vengeance on... on a mortal,

2291
02:38:41,380 --> 02:38:42,950
on a...

2292
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:46,101
And the mom... and also, the moment of...

2293
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:49,139
Interestingly,
they're kind of opposite pictures,

2294
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:54,140
because here, the pregnant nymph
Callisto is being exposed,

2295
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:57,739
and Diana realizes she's pregnant.

2296
02:38:57,740 --> 02:39:01,739
Here, it's Diana who's being exposed
and who is... by Actaeon.

2297
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:04,949
Here, there is a female victim of Diana,
and here, a male victim.

2298
02:39:05,020 --> 02:39:08,308
Erm...
They probably hung opposite each other,

2299
02:39:08,380 --> 02:39:11,111
so we've tried to suggest that
by putting them a bit differently.

2300
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:13,419
But we also want people
to see this with that.

2301
02:39:13,420 --> 02:39:16,947
- This picture we acquired 25 years ago.
- From?

2302
02:39:17,020 --> 02:39:20,103
From Lord Harewood.
It was in England?

2303
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:23,980
In England. Earl Harewood
had the painting from Lord Darnley,

2304
02:39:24,940 --> 02:39:31,550
who... whose great-great-great-grandfather
purchased it at the Orleans sale.

2305
02:39:31,620 --> 02:39:32,781
Mm.

2306
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:34,942
How it got to the Orleans collection,

2307
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:37,227
it got to the Orleans collection because...

2308
02:39:38,100 --> 02:39:41,024
it was one of the pictures that...

2309
02:39:43,660 --> 02:39:44,819
from...

2310
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:49,820
The Queen of Sweden acquired it
on her way to Rome...

2311
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:51,630
I think. Yes.

2312
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:54,544
That's... that's the best explanation.

2313
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:57,739
And then, these pictures
were actually presented from...

2314
02:39:57,740 --> 02:40:02,621
by the Spanish crown to,
I think, a French ambassador,

2315
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:08,150
who... who was acquiring them
for the Regent of France,

2316
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:10,739
who was, of course,
a very, very great art collector.

2317
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:12,788
Painted in the 1550s,

2318
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:15,339
sent to Spain, stay in Spain until...

2319
02:40:15,340 --> 02:40:18,708
A couple of hundred years.
And then go to France,

2320
02:40:18,740 --> 02:40:21,579
into a semi-royal collection
of the Duc d'Orleans.

2321
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:25,380
And then to England.
I'm very fond of the Duc d ‘Orleans, and...

2322
02:40:25,460 --> 02:40:27,659
- Well, he was a good guy.
- Yeah.

2323
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:30,391
He was also, you know, a...
he was an amateur cook.

2324
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:31,791
- Yeah?
- You know, he loved...

2325
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:36,866
he was one of the first
very, very princely or noble people

2326
02:40:36,940 --> 02:40:39,059
who is known to have
liked to do his own cooking

2327
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:41,540
- and experiment with cooking.
- I didn't know that.

2328
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:45,139
What he did after dinner
is a different matter.

2329
02:40:45,140 --> 02:40:46,499
<i></i>

2330
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:50,059
- Yes, a common habit.
- But I think it's nice he was a cook.

2331
02:40:50,060 --> 02:40:53,951
Yeah. Anyway. But he loved... Also, we know
he liked arranging his own paintings.

2332
02:40:54,020 --> 02:40:56,307
- OK.
- But what amazes me about him

2333
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:59,899
is that when he got the great collection
of the Queen of Sweden, from Rome,

2334
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:03,143
he took ten or 15 years to negotiate.

2335
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:05,706
He then hung...

2336
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:07,942
He... he wanted to see the paintings...

2337
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:12,268
Obviously, he would have new,
French frames made for them.

2338
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:15,309
Of course, cos everyone would do that.

2339
02:41:15,380 --> 02:41:17,339
But before he had the frames made,

2340
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:21,868
he wanted to see them in the frames
which that...

2341
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:27,231
"cette grande Princesse",
the Queen of Sweden, had seen them in.

2342
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:28,904
And I think that's fantastic.

2343
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:54,062
Right, OK.

2344
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:59,301
I'm going to read a poem
called Callisto's Song.

2345
02:42:59,380 --> 02:43:03,979
Callisto was the nymph
who was then turned into a bear,

2346
02:43:03,980 --> 02:43:08,702
who ended her life flung up
into the heavens as a constellation.

2347
02:43:08,780 --> 02:43:10,979
She became the Great Bear.

2348
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:15,030
So, in order to write her poem in her voice,

2349
02:43:15,100 --> 02:43:19,981
I had to imagine
how a constellation might sound.

2350
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:26,059
So on the page, visually,
I've translated her noise,

2351
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:28,222
her song as a star,

2352
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:32,942
into every word being
divided by an asterisk.

2353
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:35,059
So it looks like a constellation.

2354
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:38,659
In my head,
I feel if I could read it as I hear her,

2355
02:43:38,660 --> 02:43:41,630
there would be kind of white noise,

2356
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:46,339
star... crunching, crackling noises
between every word.

2357
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:51,267
But I can't really do that, so probably
the most you'll hear is a little syncopation.

2373
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:49,899
<i>*</i> looking * a * lot *
* especially * the <i>*</i> goddess *

2374
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:54,110
* her <i>*</i> arrow-arm * pointing <i>*

2375
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:59,059

2376
02:44:59,060 --> 02:45:04,060

* what <i>*</i> gods <i>*</i> do * upstairs *

2377
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:06,947
* and * the * artist's * finger * loaded *

2378
02:45:07,020 --> 02:45:11,708
* and <i>*</i> the * paint * alive *
* alive <i>*</i> with * stars *

2379
02:45:11,780 --> 02:45:16,149
* stars * stars * stars * stars *

2380
02:45:17,060 --> 02:45:22,544
So can we start off by talking about the...
the painting?

2381
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:25,624
Diana's such a powerful... figure.

2382
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:30,700
Oh, she's female...
but full of fire and strength.

2383
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:35,139
She's very intriguing.

2384
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:37,461
Her reaction to Callisto is fascinating,

2385
02:45:37,540 --> 02:45:41,059
because... because Diana is, of course,
the goddess of chastity.

2386
02:45:41,060 --> 02:45:44,659
She's actually faced with another female

2387
02:45:44,660 --> 02:45:47,819
at the kind of maximum
moment of fecundity.

2388
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:52,542
So there's a tension
and a kind of fury in Diana

2389
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:56,499
that you feel goes beyond
anything that Callisto's done.

2390
02:45:56,500 --> 02:46:00,221
Because, after all, in... in a sense,
Callisto's been raped.

2391
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:04,146
And now, in this revelation,
she's raped again,

2392
02:46:04,260 --> 02:46:06,659
by the pointing finger.

2393
02:46:06,660 --> 02:46:09,139
So... it's...

2394
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:14,140
I think it's the dynamic of these different
sides of femaleness, of womanhood,

2395
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:17,739
that come through in the story
as Titian tells it.

2396
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:23,304
If you like, every poem is a kind of...
crude translation of something else.

2397
02:46:23,380 --> 02:46:28,380
Our poems... our poems never,
never reach what we want them to.

2398
02:46:28,740 --> 02:46:33,507
You know, we're always, in a way,
hampered by language.

2399
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:36,499
And that's what's wonderful.

2400
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:39,139
Yeats talks about
the fascination of what's difficult.

2401
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:41,579
And the fact that language isn't perfect,

2402
02:46:41,580 --> 02:46:45,499
the fact that when I say the word "hand",
it is not my hand,

2403
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:47,819
is really beautiful and poignant to me,

2404
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:52,820
so in a... in a way, all of my poems
are efforts to translate something else.

2405
02:46:52,980 --> 02:46:54,979
And they never quite do.

2406
02:46:54,980 --> 02:46:58,143
But... but the gap is...
the meaning is all in the gaps.

2407
02:46:58,260 --> 02:47:01,150
And I... I felt that with Callisto's Song,

2408
02:47:01,260 --> 02:47:05,139
that I'd set myself, you know,
not just a gap,

2409
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:07,620
but, you know, several light years
to straddle

2410
02:47:07,700 --> 02:47:11,899
between what she might sing
and how I might transcribe it.
