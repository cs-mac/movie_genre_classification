{2130}{2189}Say, buddy, will you stake a fellow...
{2580}{2664}Hey, mister, will you stake|a fellow American to a meal?
{3161}{3249}- State lottery, señor?|- Beat it. I ain't buying no lottery tickets.
{3249}{3290}4,000 pesos is the big prize.
{3292}{3350}Get away from me, you little beggar.
{3369}{3441}The whole ticket is only 4 pesos.|It's a sure winner.
{3444}{3487}I ain't got 4 pesos.
{3489}{3549}Buy a quarter of a ticket for 1 peso silver.
{3551}{3655}If you don't get away from me,|I'll throw this water right in your face.
{3700}{3760}Then one tenth of a ticket, señor, for 40...
{3839}{3942}Señor, buy one twentieth.|One twentieth costs you only 20 centavos.
{3949}{4019}Look, señor, add the figures up.|You get 13.
{4021}{4093}What better number could you buy?|It's a sure winner.
{4117}{4189}- Yeah, how soon's the drawing?|- Only three weeks off.
{4206}{4276}Give me a twentieth|so I don't have to look at your ugly face.
{4348}{4379}Come again next time.
{4379}{4465}I always have the winners,|all the lucky numbers. Good luck.
{4470}{4501}Thirteen.
{4829}{4858}Excuse me.
{5067}{5096}Cigarette?
{5163}{5187}Thanks.
{5230}{5268}- It's hot.|- Yeah.
{5450}{5522}What a town, Tampico.
{5578}{5606}You said it, brother.
{5609}{5671}If I could get a job|that'd bring enough to buy passage...
{5673}{5743}I'd shake its dust off my feet|soon enough, you bet.
{5767}{5827}If I was a native,|I'd get a can of shoe polish...
{5827}{5894}and I'd be in business.|They'd never let a gringo.
{5928}{5992}You can sit on a bench|till you're three-quarters starved.
{5992}{6062}You can beg from another gringo,|or even commit burglary.
{6064}{6112}You try shining shoes in the street...
{6112}{6189}or peddling lemonade out of a bucket|and your hash is settled.
{6189}{6242}You'll never get another job|from an American.
{6244}{6314}Yeah, and the natives|would hound and pester you to death.
{6314}{6383}- Some town to be broke in.|- What town isn't?
{6537}{6599}Can you stake a fellow American|to a meal?
{8968}{8997}Hey, mister.
{9002}{9052}Will you stake a fellow American|to a meal?
{9054}{9102}Such impudence never came my way.
{9105}{9148}Early this afternoon, I gave you money.
{9150}{9203}When my shoes were being polished,|I gave you more.
{9205}{9246}Now you put the bite on me again.
{9246}{9301}Do me a favor.|Go occasionally to somebody else.
{9304}{9390}- It's beginning to get tiresome.|- Excuse me. I didn't know it was you.
{9390}{9472}I never looked at your face, just|your hands and the money you gave me.
{9474}{9546}Beg pardon. I promise|I'll never put the bite on you again.
{9546}{9594}This is the very last you get from me.
{9596}{9685}Just to make sure you don't forget|your promise, here's another peso.
{9687}{9738}- Thanks, mister.|- But from now on...
{9740}{9824}you have to make your way through life|without my assistance.
{10014}{10090}Hey, buddy, will you stake|a fellow American to a meal?
{10100}{10133}I won't give you a red cent.
{10136}{10193}If you want to make some money|I'll give you a job.
{10196}{10241}- What's the catch?|- There's no catch.
{10244}{10306}I got a job if you want.|It's hard work, but good pay.
{10308}{10354}- Did you ever rig a camp?|- Sure.
{10356}{10416}The ferry's making off,|one of my men hasn't shown up.
{10416}{10495}I don't know what's happened to him.|He's probably drunk in some dive.
{10498}{10558}- What's the pay?|- $8 a day.
{10572}{10668}Don't just stand there.|Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.
{10671}{10716}- I'm your man.|- Come on.
{11097}{11150}- Hello, there.|- Hello, yourself.
{11162}{11212}Okay, you guys, get aboard.
{11529}{11567}Take it your way.
{12270}{12342}What's the matter with you two?|Can't you take it?
{12344}{12430}It's 130 in the shade, and there ain't|any shade up there on that derrick.
{12433}{12529}Just figure you're a couple of millionaires|in your own private steam bath.
{12531}{12567}And the sooner we're through...
{12570}{12644}the sooner we'll be back in town|drinking cold beer.
{12646}{12721}We finish within two weeks,|I'm giving you fellas a bonus.
{12723}{12797}Yeah, it's coming to us|working 16, 18 hours a day like we do.
{12800}{12850}Don't go crying to your mamas.|What do you want?
{12853}{12905}I'm paying top salaries and a bonus.
{12908}{12963}What about our pay anyway,|and when do we get it?
{12963}{13044}- I ain't seen a buck out of you yet.|- You'll get your dough, all right...
{13047}{13111}don't worry about that,|when we get back to Tampico.
{13114}{13198}What could you do with money out here|anyway, except gamble and lose it?
{13200}{13255}You'll be paid as we step off the ferry.
{13809}{13862}The agent was supposed to be here|with the dough.
{13864}{13900}Don't know what could've happened.
{13900}{13972}But don't worry.|I'll go to the office and pick up the money.
{13972}{14008}You men stay here.
{14011}{14063}Any objection to a couple of us|coming with you?
{14066}{14119}Don't you trust me?|You think I'd run out on you?
{14121}{14159}I don't think you'd do that.
{14159}{14258}But I ain't got a cent, not even enough|to buy me a glass of beer.
{14267}{14346}Say, you two guys meet me|over at the Cantina Madrid.
{14349}{14425}It's 2:15 now and I'll be over there|no later than 3:00.
{14519}{14589}Pat McCormick.|He comes here from time to time.
{14589}{14617}I haven't seen him lately.
{14620}{14675}Pat McCormick?|What about Pat McCormick?
{14675}{14754}- He's supposed to meet us here.|- Does he owe you any money?
{14771}{14838}Say, how long you guys|been around Tampico, anyway?
{14838}{14879}What's that got to do with it?
{14879}{14967}Only foreigners and half-baked Americans|fall for McCormick's tricks.
{14970}{14996}How do you mean?
{14996}{15058}I mean, he hires dumb guys like you|to work for him.
{15058}{15128}When it comes time to pay off,|he takes a powder.
{15217}{15293}How much we got left|of that $10 he gave us, Dobbsie?
{15293}{15380}- $2.50.|- That's not even enough for one bed.
{15404}{15507}I know a joint that's full of rats,|scorpions and cockroaches.
{15538}{15605}The cots are only 50 centavos a night.
{15720}{15754}Have another...
{16049}{16118}...jobs for a dime a dozen|ain't to be had at all.
{16118}{16149}Streets are full of guys...
{16159}{16202}pushing each other over the hill.
{16229}{16277}...not 10 days from here by rail.
{16279}{16384}The mountain's waiting for the right guy|to discover and take her treasure.
{16387}{16437}The question is: Are you the right guy?
{16440}{16514}Real bonanzas are few and far between.|They take a lot of finding.
{16516}{16593}Answer me this, will you?|Why is gold worth some $20 an ounce?
{16595}{16687}- I don't know. Because it's scarce.|- A thousand men go searching for gold.
{16689}{16759}After six months one of them's lucky.|One out of the thousand.
{16759}{16859}His find represents not only his own labor|but that of 999 others to boot.
{16866}{16943}That's 6,000 months to 500 years...
{16943}{17005}scrambling over mountain,|going hungry and thirsty.
{17008}{17113}The gold is worth what it is 'cause of|the human labor that went into finding it.
{17116}{17188}- Never thought of it like that.|- There's no other explanation.
{17190}{17284}Gold ain't good for nothing|except for making jewelry and gold teeth.
{17284}{17320}Gold's a devilish sort of thing.
{17322}{17413}You start out to tell yourself|you'll be satisfied with $25,000 worth.
{17416}{17487}So help me Lord and cross my heart.|Fine resolution.
{17490}{17576}After months of sweating yourself dizzy,|few provisions, finding nothing...
{17579}{17629}you finally come down to $15,000,|then $10,000.
{17631}{17706}Finally you say,|"Lord, let me just find $5,000 worth...
{17708}{17773}"and I'll never ask for anything more|the rest of my life."
{17773}{17821}$5,000 is a lot of money.
{17835}{17881}In this joint it seems like a lot.
{17881}{17950}But if you made a real strike,|you couldn't be dragged away.
{17950}{18029}Even the threat of death wouldn't|keep you from adding $10,000 more.
{18032}{18099}$10,000, you'd want $25,000.|$25,000, you'd want $50,000.
{18101}{18144}$50,000, $100,000. Like roulette.
{18147}{18202}One more time, you know.|Always one more.
{18204}{18281}It wouldn't be that way with me.|I swear, it wouldn't.
{18291}{18346}I'd take only what I set out to get.
{18348}{18408}Even if there was still $500,000 worth...
{18411}{18461}lying around, waiting to be picked up.
{18463}{18521}I've dug in Alaska|and Canada and Colorado.
{18523}{18595}I was in the British Honduras,|I made my fare back home...
{18595}{18660}and almost enough over|to cure me of the fever I'd caught.
{18662}{18751}Dug in California and Australia.|All over the world practically.
{18756}{18821}Yeah. I know what gold does|to men's souls.
{18833}{18905}You talk as though you struck it rich|sometime or other, pop.
{18905}{18938}How about it?
{18960}{19022}Then what are you doing in here,|a down-and-outer?
{19024}{19080}That's gold. That's what it makes us.
{19082}{19142}Never knew a prospector yet|that died rich.
{19144}{19216}Make one fortune, he's sure to blow it|trying to find another.
{19219}{19269}I'm no exception to the rule.
{19300}{19401}Sure I'm a gnawed old bone now|but don't you guys think the spirit's gone.
{19406}{19490}I'm set to shoulder a pickaxe|if anybody's willing to share expenses.
{19490}{19545}I'd rather go by myself.|It's best to go alone.
{19547}{19633}But you got to have a stomach|for loneliness. Some guys go nutty with it.
{19633}{19717}But going with a partner is dangerous.|Murderers always lurking about.
{19720}{19792}Partners accusing each other|of all sorts of crimes.
{19840}{19909}As long as there's no find,|the noble brotherhood will last.
{19912}{20017}But when the piles of gold begin to grow,|that's when the trouble starts.
{20058}{20137}I wouldn't mind|a little of that kind of trouble.
{20147}{20197}I think I'll go to sleep...
{20199}{20262}and dream about piles of gold...
{20264}{20348}getting bigger and bigger.
{20487}{20523}Do you believe what the old man...
{20525}{20583}who was doing all the talking|at the Oso Negro...
{20585}{20624}said the other night...
{20626}{20717}about gold changing a man's soul|so that he ain't the same kind of a guy...
{20717}{20780}that he was before finding it?
{20782}{20825}Guess that all depends on the man.
{20828}{20876}That's exactly what I say.
{20885}{20933}Gold don't carry any curse with it.
{20935}{21036}It all depends on whether or not|the guy who finds it is the right guy.
{21048}{21079}The way I see it...
{21079}{21146}gold can be as much of a blessing|as a curse.
{21226}{21288}Look who's coming out|of the Hotel Bristol.
{21317}{21377}Is that Pat McCormick|or am I seeing things?
{21477}{21509}It's him.
{21511}{21571}- Let's get him.|- Let's get him hard.
{21580}{21648}Why don't you and me|go and buy me something?
{21648}{21705}I could use a new pair of shoes.
{21715}{21763}Hello, fellows, how are you?|Glad to see you.
{21765}{21830}- Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Curtin, Señorita...|- López.
{21832}{21895}López. I want you guys|to come and have a drink with me.
{21895}{21964}I've got business|to attend to with these men.
{21967}{22031}You go back up to the hotel and wait.|I won't be long.
{22077}{22101}Okay.
{22101}{22163}Fellas, let's have that drink.|Where have you been?
{22166}{22218}I've been looking all over for you.
{22326}{22360}Three shots of rye.
{22362}{22403}Make mine brandy, Three Star.
{22405}{22465}- Two brandies.|- Rye is good enough for me.
{22470}{22552}I suppose you're wondering|about that money that's coming to you.
{22554}{22628}The fact is I haven't been paid off|on that contract myself.
{22628}{22729}If I had the money, you'd get it first thing.|I'll put you both on my next contract.
{22731}{22796}It will come through by Monday|and we can set out Friday.
{22799}{22837}Here's mud in your eye.
{22909}{22976}We want what's coming to us.|We want it right here and now.
{22978}{23038}- But didn't I just tell you...|- You better come across.
{23153}{23197}And the balance, say,|the middle of next week?
{23199}{23233}Nothing doing. Right here and now.
{23235}{23312}Every cent or you won't walk out of here.|You'll be carried out.
{23312}{23379}Let's don't stop being friends.|How about another drink?
{23381}{23436}Two more brandies.|Put the bottle on the bar.
{23439}{23487}If you want to get us liquored up...
{23489}{23578}No, I'm just inviting you|to have a friendly drink with me.
{25139}{25228}- I'm licked, boys.|- Give us our money.
{25237}{25290}Yeah, give us our money.
{25381}{25415}I can't see.
{25525}{25585}$50. $100.
{25606}{25635}$200.
{25662}{25686}$300.
{25695}{25757}- That's it, ain't it, Curt?|- Yeah, that's it.
{25810}{25865}Let's beat it before the law arrives.
{25937}{26002}Here's for the drinks|and the use of the cantina.
{26112}{26160}- You know something, Curt?|- What?
{26167}{26275}We ain't very smart,|hanging around Tampico waiting for a job.
{26292}{26328}Money's getting shorter every day...
{26331}{26405}and soon we'll be right back|where we were, on the bum again...
{26405}{26491}pushing guys for dimes,|sleeping around in freight cars.
{26503}{26549}That's right. Got any ideas?
{26580}{26647}That old man in the Oso Negro|started me to thinking.
{26649}{26673}What about?
{26676}{26733}Why not try gold-digging for a change?
{26736}{26801}It ain't any riskier|than waiting around here for a break...
{26803}{26882}and this is the country where the nuggets|of gold are crying for you...
{26884}{26980}to take them out of the ground,|make them shine in coins...
{27000}{27067}on the fingers and necks of swell dames.
{27071}{27158}One thing, living in the open is cheaper|than it is here in Tampico.
{27160}{27184}Our money'd last longer.
{27184}{27273}The longer it lasts, the greater our chance|of digging something up would be.
{27275}{27318}We'd have to have equipment, all right.
{27321}{27424}Picks and spades, pans, burros.|Wonder how much it would all cost.
{27431}{27510}- That old man would know.|- Yeah, he could give us some pointers.
{27513}{27592}He's too old to take along.|We'd have to pack him on our backs.
{27594}{27637}You can't tell|about some of those old guys.
{27640}{27707}It's surprising sometimes|how tough they are.
{27709}{27764}I don't know what gold looks like|in the ground.
{27767}{27853}I've only seen it in jewelry store windows|and people's mouths.
{27863}{27915}You know anything about prospecting?
{27927}{27978}Not much when you come right down to it.
{27978}{28052}We might have real use|for an experienced guy like that old-timer.
{28055}{28105}Let's go hunt him up right away.
{28150}{28213}Will I go? What a question.|Of course I'll go.
{28215}{28278}Any time, any day,|I was waiting for somebody to ask me.
{28280}{28337}Out for gold? I'm always at your service.
{28337}{28424}I got $300 ready cash in the bank.|$200 of it all set to invest.
{28426}{28486}Last money I got.|When it's gone, I'm finished.
{28489}{28539}If you don't take a risk,|you can't make a game.
{28541}{28580}How much dough you guys got to put in?
{28582}{28644}I've got $150 and Curtin's got the same.
{28647}{28733}$500 ain't hardly enough to buy tools,|weapons and essential provisions.
{28736}{28767}What do we need weapons for?
{28769}{28815}Meat's one thing and bandits another.
{28817}{28891}Bandit country's where we'd be going.|We need $600 between us.
{28894}{28951}- That much?|- Can't you dig up any more?
{28961}{28992}Not a red cent.
{29083}{29119}Give me my money, señor!
{29172}{29198}Get away from me, will you?
{29201}{29251}Please, señor.|Whoever draws the lucky number...
{29253}{29292}gives a present to the seller...
{29294}{29328}I don't want any lottery ticket!
{29330}{29397}If you don't, you have bad luck|the rest of your life.
{29402}{29474}What? Wait a minute.|What did you first say?
{29476}{29560}Why, he's trying to tell you|he sold you the winning ticket.
{29565}{29606}Hey, wait a minute.
{29616}{29651}This what you mean?
{29661}{29719}- You say it's the winner?|- 200 peso prize.
{29721}{29757}Where?
{29783}{29827}- That's my number.|- Sure enough.
{29827}{29903}Just look at that fat, rich, printed number.
{29906}{30009}That's the kind of sugar poppa likes.|200 pesos.
{30011}{30069}Welcome, sweet little smackeroos.
{30078}{30138}Here, son, here's a present for you|with my blessing.
{30215}{30275}Would you like to shake the hand|that bought that ticket?
{30277}{30328}- Congratulations.|- Congratulations, yourself.
{30330}{30385}You stand a profit out of this|the same as I do.
{30385}{30409}How do you make that out?
{30412}{30493}Didn't he just say we needed $600?|That's what we've got now, ain't it?
{30496}{30524}- Yeah, but...|- But what?
{30524}{30606}- Why are you putting up for me?|- This is an all-or-nothing proposition.
{30606}{30695}If we make a find,|we'll be lighting our cigars with $100 bills.
{30697}{30757}If not, the difference|between what you and I put up...
{30759}{30829}ain't enough to keep me|from being where I was this afternoon:
{30829}{30889}Polishing a bench|with the seat of my pants.
{30891}{30930}Put her there, part.
{31296}{31380}We'll buy our burros at Perla and|head northwest away from the railroad.
{31380}{31421}It's no use looking near a railroad...
{31423}{31457}or any kind of a road at all...
{31459}{31548}because construction engineers examine|every bit of ground around the road...
{31551}{31577}while they're building them.
{31579}{31620}We got to go where there's no trails...
{31622}{31728}where no surveyor or anyone who knows|anything of prospecting has been before.
{31730}{31762}The best place to go to is...
{31764}{31869}where any salaried person wouldn't go,|because he wouldn't want to risk his hide.
{33385}{33430}I got three of them!|How many did you get?
{33433}{33493}- A couple.|- I'm one up. I bet I got more than you did.
{33493}{33524}I got three. Nice shooting?
{33526}{33593}That bullet hole's two inches|from my head. That was close.
{33596}{33651}The bullets were sure flying|thick and fast in here.
{33653}{33692}It sounded like a swarm of bees here.
{33694}{33778}That bandit with the gold hat,|I had my sights on him, nice as you please.
{33781}{33838}The train gave a jolt and I missed.|Wish I'd got him.
{33840}{33898}Big boulder on the track so train stop.
{33898}{33987}Bandits got big surprise because soldiers|on the train waiting for them.
{33989}{34025}Not many passengers get killed.
{34025}{34063}Here's where we're bound for.
{34066}{34123}Don't show whether there's mountain,|swamp or desert.
{34126}{34181}That shows the makers of the map|don't know.
{34183}{34243}Once on the ground,|we open our eyes and look around.
{34246}{34313}Blow our noses, too.|Believe it or not, I knew a fellow...
{34315}{34385}who could smell gold|like a jackass can smell water.
{35581}{35610}What's all that about?
{35612}{35668}We're going into country|very wild and dangerous.
{35670}{35701}Have to cut through jungles...
{35701}{35768}and climb mountains so high|they rise above the clouds.
{35768}{35867}Tigers so strong they can climb trees|with burros in their mouths. Good.
{35869}{35962}Glad to hear such tall tales 'cause it|means few outsiders have set foot there.
{35965}{36008}Well, let's get going.
{37629}{37718}If there was gold in them mountains,|how long would it have been there?
{37720}{37787}Millions and millions of years, wouldn't it?
{37787}{37826}What's our hurry?
{37838}{37924}A couple of days more or less|ain't going to make any difference.
{37929}{37984}Remember what you said|back in Tampico...
{37986}{38061}about having to pack that old man|on our backs?
{38137}{38219}That was when I took him|for an ordinary human being...
{38224}{38260}not part goat.
{38281}{38329}Look at him climb, will you?
{38451}{38533}What gets me is how he can go all day|in the sun without any water.
{38535}{38586}Maybe he's part camel, too.
{38602}{38653}If I'd known what prospecting meant...
{38655}{38749}I'd have stayed in Tampico|and waited for another job to turn up.
{38907}{38967}- What's the matter?|- Look.
{39010}{39101}Look at it glitter. It's yellow, too, like...
{39108}{39135}Gold.
{39274}{39334}Come back, we've found something!
{39384}{39458}Look, Curt, there's a vein of it,|here, in this rock.
{39485}{39542}Look here. Look, it's all around.
{39552}{39588}What else could it be?
{39595}{39653}Only gold shines and glitters like that.
{39672}{39713}We've struck it, Curt.
{39756}{39816}Look, from the looks of things...
{39845}{39883}we've struck it rich.
{39895}{39938}Look, it's all over here.
{39943}{39993}- We found a what do you call it...|- Mother lode.
{39996}{40022}- That's right.|- Howard!
{40024}{40053}Come on. Look.
{40072}{40149}Here, look at this rock.|It's full of gold. Veins of it.
{40161}{40233}This stuff wouldn't pay your dinner|for a carload.
{40250}{40286}It ain't gold?
{40291}{40329}Pyrite. Fool's gold.
{40338}{40394}Not that there ain't|plenty of the real stuff here.
{40396}{40442}We've walked over it four or five times.
{40444}{40504}A place yesterday looked like|rich diggings, but the water...
{40506}{40549}for washing the sand was 11 miles away.
{40552}{40638}The other places, there wasn't much gold|to pay us a good day's wages.
{40638}{40698}Next time you strike it rich, holler for me...
{40698}{40765}before you start splashing water around.|Water's precious.
{40768}{40830}Sometimes it can be more precious|than gold.
{40847}{40871}Burro.
{41154}{41206}- What's up?|- Norther, looks like.
{41216}{41259}A "norther"? What's a "norther"?
{41274}{41326}Big winds from the north|this time of year...
{41329}{41425}when they blow hard, this desert country|stands right up on its hind legs!
{41650}{41710}There's only a few more miles|of this heavy stuff.
{41710}{41768}Pretty soon we'll be out of this valley.
{42741}{42794}You fellows, how about some beans?
{42883}{42919}You want some beans?
{42986}{43089}Going through some mighty rough country|tomorrow. You better have some beans.
{44067}{44110}You know what I'm thinking?
{44127}{44177}I'm thinking we ought to give up...
{44185}{44228}leave the whole outfit...
{44240}{44276}everything behind.
{44290}{44336}Go back to civilization.
{44338}{44427}What's that you say? Go back?|Tell my old grandmother!
{44429}{44501}I got two elegant bedfellows|who kick at the first drop of rain...
{44503}{44563}and hide in the closet|when thunder rumbles.
{44566}{44602}What great prospectors.
{44604}{44662}Two shoe clerks reading|about prospecting for gold...
{44664}{44748}in the Land of the Midnight Sun,|south of the border or west of the Rockies.
{44748}{44801}Shut your trap or I'll smash your head flat!
{44803}{44880}Go ahead, throw it. If you did,|you'd never leave this place alive.
{44882}{44954}Without me, you two would die here|more miserable than rats.
{44957}{45026}Leave him alone.|Can't you see the old man's nuts?
{45053}{45120}Nuts, am I? Let me tell you something,|my fine bedfellows.
{45122}{45208}There's nothing to compare you with.|You're dumber than the dumbest jackass.
{45211}{45235}Look at each other.
{45237}{45321}Did you ever see anything like yourself|for being dumb specimens?
{45410}{45434}You're so dumb...
{45436}{45525}you don't even see the riches|you're treading on with your own feet.
{45726}{45781}Don't expect to find nuggets|of molten gold.
{45784}{45839}It's not that rich.|Here ain't the place to dig.
{45841}{45899}It comes from someplace further up.|Up there.
{45901}{45954}Up there's where we've got to go.
{46117}{46168}- Is that it?|- That's it, all right.
{46168}{46199}Gold, I mean.
{46201}{46242}Sure don't look like I thought it would.
{46244}{46331}- Not much different from sand.|- Yeah. It's just like plain sand.
{46333}{46374}It don't glitter. I thought it would.
{46374}{46431}It will when it's refined by some other guy.
{46434}{46486}All we got to do is mine it|and get it back there.
{46489}{46573}Gold ain't like stones in a riverbed.|It don't cry out to be picked up.
{46575}{46611}You got to know how to recognize it.
{46614}{46661}The finding ain't all. Not by a long shot.
{46661}{46726}Got to know how to tickle her|so she'll come out laughing.
{46726}{46777}Yeah, it's mighty rich. It'll pay good.
{46777}{46839}- How good?|- About 20 ounces to the ton.
{46844}{46913}- That's $20 an ounce.|- How many tons can we handle a week?
{46913}{46947}Depends on how hard we work.
{46949}{47000}We better pitch our camp|down the mountainside.
{47000}{47036}Why, when the digging's here?
{47038}{47110}Anyone comes by, we say we're hunters,|and get away with it maybe.
{47110}{47187}- Wouldn't it be easier to file a claim?|- Easier but not so profitable.
{47189}{47266}An emissary from a big mining company|would be here soon...
{47268}{47340}with a paper in his hand|showing we had no right to be here.
{47402}{47460}How does it feel to be men of property?
{47563}{47601}The tanks'll leak some at first...
{47601}{47673}until the boards begin to swell|and close the seams.
{47726}{47808}I sure had some cockeyed ideas|about prospecting for gold.
{47810}{47863}It was all in the finding, I thought.
{47892}{47966}I thought you just had to find it,|pick it up, put it in sacks...
{47968}{48014}and carry them off to the nearest bank.
{48016}{48091}You're learning. Pretty soon|I won't be able to tell you a thing.
{48093}{48143}- Tank full yet?|- Right to the top.
{48146}{48182}Open the sluice gate.
{49078}{49134}How much do you figure it to be now?
{49155}{49198}About $5,000 worth, I reckon.
{49254}{49313}When are we going to start dividing it up?
{49376}{49407}Anytime you say.
{49409}{49477}Why divide it at all? I don't see any point.
{49479}{49534}We're all going back together|when the time comes.
{49534}{49606}Why not wait till we get paid|and then divide the money?
{49608}{49661}Either way suits me. You fellows decide.
{49664}{49721}I'm for dividing it up as we go along.
{49740}{49805}Make each guy responsible|for his own goods.
{49812}{49860}I'd just as soon have it that way.
{49860}{49930}I don't like the responsibility|of guarding your treasure.
{49932}{49966}Who asked you to?
{49985}{50038}That's right. You never asked me.
{50038}{50112}Only, I thought I was the most trustworthy|of the three.
{50114}{50141}You?
{50177}{50203}How come?
{50205}{50301}I said the most trustworthy. As far as|being the most honest, no one can say.
{50330}{50364}I don't get you.
{50364}{50424}Suppose you're charged|of taking care of the goods.
{50426}{50508}One day I'm deep in the brush|and Curtin's on his way to get provisions.
{50510}{50582}That'd be your chance to pack up|and leave us in the cold.
{50582}{50687}Only a guy that's a thief at heart would|think me likely to do a thing like that.
{50704}{50750}Right now, it wouldn't be|worth your while...
{50752}{50850}but when the pile's grown to 300 ounces,|think of such things you will.
{50872}{50910}How's about yourself?
{50930}{50968}I'm not quick on my feet any longer.
{50970}{51021}You're a lot tougher|than when we started out.
{51023}{51083}By the time the pile's grown|to be really tempting...
{51085}{51129}I won't be able to run half as fast as you.
{51131}{51184}You'd catch me|and string me up in no time.
{51186}{51244}That's why I think|I'm the most trustworthy.
{51246}{51296}Looking at it that way,|I guess you're right.
{51299}{51347}Maybe it'd be a good idea...
{51347}{51402}to cut the proceeds up|three ways every night.
{51404}{51462}It'll relieve you of a responsibility|you don't like.
{51464}{51493}Swell by me.
{51493}{51534}After we got a couple of hundred ounces...
{51536}{51594}it'll be a nuisance|carrying bags around our necks.
{51596}{51673}Each of us will have to hide his share|from the others.
{51673}{51783}And after that, he'll have to be forever|on watch that his hiding place's not found.
{51786}{51841}What a dirty, filthy mind you've got.
{51865}{51937}Not dirty, baby.|Only I know what kind of ideas...
{51937}{52009}even supposedly decent people get|when gold's at stake.
{52013}{52040}All right.
{52076}{52119}Here she goes three ways.
{54037}{54066}Dobbs!
{55473}{55509}Howard, come quick!
{55711}{55747}He's coming around.
{55788}{55855}Lay still a minute|till you get your senses back.
{55876}{55907}What happened?
{55924}{55975}Part of the mine caved in on you.
{56140}{56181}Got a knock on the head.
{56188}{56222}No bones broken?
{56248}{56281}I don't think so.
{56301}{56353}- Who pulled me out?|- Curtin did.
{56418}{56468}I owe my life to you, partner.
{56500}{56526}Forget it.
{56826}{56879}What'll you do|with your hard-earned money...
{56881}{56922}when we get back and cash in?
{56924}{56991}I'm getting along in years.|I can still hold up my end...
{56991}{57068}when it comes to a hard day's work,|but I'm not the man I was once.
{57070}{57159}Next year, next month, next week,|by thunder, won't be the man I'm today.
{57159}{57207}I think I'll settle down in a quiet place...
{57209}{57267}get a little business, hardware,|grocery store...
{57267}{57346}spend the better part of my time|reading comics and adventure stories.
{57348}{57408}One thing's for sure.|I won't go prospecting again...
{57408}{57471}wasting time and money|trying to find another gold mine.
{57473}{57524}How about yourself?|What plans have you, if any?
{57526}{57600}I figure on buying some land|and growing fruit. Peaches, maybe.
{57603}{57658}How did you come to settle on peaches?
{57667}{57699}One summer, when I was a kid...
{57701}{57775}I worked as a picker in a peach harvest|in the San Joaquin Valley.
{57794}{57840}Boy, it sure was something.
{57847}{57893}Hundreds of people, old and young.
{57900}{57948}Whole families working together.
{57953}{57993}At night, after a day's work...
{57996}{58077}we used to build big bonfires|and sit around and sing to guitar music.
{58087}{58133}Till morning sometimes.
{58142}{58231}We'd go to sleep, wake up and sing,|and go to sleep again.
{58250}{58300}Everybody had a wonderful time.
{58327}{58399}Ever since then I've had a hankering|to be a fruit grower.
{58401}{58473}It must be grand|watching your own trees put on leaves...
{58473}{58523}come into blossom and bear.
{58526}{58624}Watching the fruit get big|and ripe on the boughs, ready for picking.
{58672}{58718}What's all that about?
{58722}{58794}We're telling each other|what we aim to do when we get back.
{58804}{58888}Now me, I got it all figured out|what I'm gonna do.
{58888}{58936}Tell us about it, Dobbsie.
{58943}{59013}First off, I'm going to a Turkish bath|to sweat and soak...
{59015}{59089}till I get all the grime and dirt|out of my system.
{59104}{59190}Then I'm going to a haberdasher and|gonna get myself a brand-new set of duds.
{59192}{59228}Dozen of everything.
{59236}{59295}Then I'm going to a swell cafe...
{59307}{59387}order everything on the bill o' fare|and if it ain't just right...
{59387}{59449}or maybe even if it is,|I'm gonna bawl the waiter out...
{59451}{59502}and make him take the whole thing back.
{59509}{59542}What's next on the program?
{59583}{59624}Well, what would be?
{59869}{59921}If I were you, I wouldn't talk|or think about women.
{59924}{59974}It ain't good for your health.
{59988}{60077}Yeah, maybe you're right,|seeing how the prospects are far off.
{60080}{60111}You know what?
{60113}{60175}We ought to put a limit on our take,|agree between us...
{60178}{60231}when we get so much|we pull up stakes and beat it.
{60233}{60312}- What do you think the limit ought to be?|- Say $25,000 worth apiece.
{60315}{60377}$25,000, small potatoes.
{60389}{60415}How much do you say?
{60418}{60482}$50,000 anyway,|$75,000 would be more like it.
{60482}{60562}That'd take a year if the vein held out,|which wouldn't be likely.
{60564}{60645}What's a year more or less|when that kind of money is to be had?
{60648}{60708}$25,000 is plenty as far as I'm concerned.
{60710}{60758}Enough to last me the rest of my lifetime.
{60761}{60818}Well, sure, you're old, I'm young.
{60823}{60866}I need dough and plenty of it.
{60900}{60933}$25,000 in one piece...
{60933}{60984}is more than I ever expected|to get my hands on.
{60986}{61012}Small potatoes.
{61015}{61067}There's no use making hogs of ourselves.
{61101}{61132}Hog, am I?
{61135}{61190}Maybe you don't know,|but I'd be within my rights...
{61192}{61252}if I demanded half again|as much as you get.
{61254}{61278}How come?
{61281}{61350}There's no denying I put up|the lion's share of the cash.
{61353}{61427}So you did, Dobbsie,|and I always meant to pay you back.
{61427}{61523}In any civilized place the biggest investor|gets the biggest return, don't he?
{61535}{61588}That's one thing in favor of the wilds.
{61593}{61679}Not that I intended to demand it,|but I'd be within my rights if I did.
{61679}{61729}Next time you call me a hog|just remember...
{61729}{61770}what I could've done if I'd wanted to.
{61772}{61849}I think it'd be wise not to put things|strictly on a money basis.
{61849}{61926}Here you are, Dobbs.|What I owe you with interest.
{62142}{62206}I just don't like being called a hog,|that's all.
{63228}{63285}Don't scare me like that.|I might have let you have it.
{63288}{63324}Out for a midnight stroll?
{63326}{63374}Tiger around,|I went to check on the burros.
{63377}{63425}- So?|- What's the matter?
{63425}{63518}- I think I'll see if the burros are all right.|- Go ahead. Help yourself.
{63880}{63918}- What's up?|- Nothing's up.
{64000}{64031}Where is Dobbs?
{64034}{64093}Poking around in the dark out there.
{64185}{64235}He's sure taking a long time out there.
{64254}{64307}I think I'll go have a look-see.
{64856}{64892}Where's Curtin?
{64916}{64995}He's out there somewhere.|Said he was gonna have a look-see.
{65674}{65717}It's my turn again but I won't take it...
{65719}{65782}if you won't stop worrying|about your goods and go to bed.
{65784}{65827}We got work to do tomorrow.
{66134}{66216}Can't catch me sleeping.|Don't you ever believe that.
{66242}{66278}I'm not that dumb.
{66309}{66359}The day you try to put anything|over on me...
{66359}{66424}it'll be a costly one for both of you.
{66666}{66760}Any more lip out of you|and I'll up and let you have it.
{66784}{66901}If you know what's good for you, you|won't monkey around with Fred C. Dobbs.
{66990}{67064}You ought to see Dobbs.|He's talking to himself a mile a minute.
{67067}{67122}Something's eating him all right,|I don't know what.
{67124}{67172}He's just spoiling for trouble.
{67354}{67407}"We're running short of provisions,|Dobbsie.
{67410}{67465}"How about you going to the village?"
{67477}{67527}Who does Howard think he is,|ordering me around?
{67530}{67561}What's that, Dobbs?
{67561}{67594}- Nothing.|- Better look out.
{67594}{67645}It's a bad sign when a guy talks to himself.
{67647}{67688}Yeah? Who else am I gonna talk to?
{67690}{67731}Certainly not you or Curtin.
{67733}{67796}- Fine partners you two are.|- Got something up your nose?
{67798}{67832}Blow it out, it'll do you good.
{67834}{67896}Don't think you two|are putting anything over on me.
{67899}{67949}- Take it easy.|- I know what your game is.
{67949}{67978}You know more than I do.
{67980}{68057}Why am I elected to go to the village|instead of you or Curtin?
{68059}{68143}Don't think I don't see through that.|You two are together against me.
{68146}{68172}The two days I'd be gone...
{68172}{68242}would give you lots of time|to discover where my goods are.
{68244}{68275}If you fear along those lines...
{68278}{68318}why don't you take your goods with you?
{68321}{68388}And run the risk of having them|taken from me by bandits?
{68390}{68445}If you run into them,|you'd be out of luck anyway.
{68448}{68501}They'd kill you for the shoes on your feet.
{68510}{68585}So that's it. Everything's clear now.
{68592}{68637}You're hoping bandits will get me.
{68640}{68697}That would save you a lot of trouble,|wouldn't it?
{68700}{68764}And your consciences|wouldn't bother you none neither.
{68784}{68834}All right, Dobbs, forget about it.
{69534}{69570}Just like I thought.
{69572}{69625}- What's the idea?|- Put your hands up.
{69678}{69755}I've a good mind to haul off|and pump you up, chest and belly alike.
{69755}{69805}Would you mind telling me|what this is about?
{69807}{69858}It won't get you anywhere playing dumb.
{69858}{69889}Well, I'll be.
{69906}{69990}- So that's where your goods are hidden?|- Hey, what's the trouble here?
{69992}{70054}Seems like I accidentally stumbled|on Dobbsie's treasure.
{70057}{70131}Accidentally? Why were you trying|to pry up that rock?
{70134}{70179}I saw a gila monster crawl under it.
{70182}{70215}Brother, I got to hand it to you.
{70217}{70285}You can certainly pick up a good story|when you need one.
{70304}{70385}Okay, I'm a liar.|There isn't a gila monster under there.
{70397}{70460}Let's see you stick your hand in|and get your goods out.
{70462}{70510}- Go ahead.|- Sure I will.
{70534}{70560}But you try any bad moves...
{70563}{70630}Don't worry. I'll stay right where I am.|I want to see this.
{70630}{70673}Reach in and get your goods.
{70675}{70743}If you don't, we'll think you're yellow,|won't we, Howard?
{70781}{70860}They never let go, do they, Howard,|once they grab onto you?
{70898}{70990}You can cut them in two and the head|will still hang on till sundown, I hear.
{70990}{71064}By that time the victim|doesn't usually care 'cause he's dead.
{71066}{71114}- Isn't that right, Howard?|- I reckon.
{71124}{71196}Why don't you stick your hand in|and get your treasure?
{71198}{71234}Couldn't be because you're scared...
{71234}{71287}after the way you've been shooting|your mouth off?
{71289}{71313}Show us you ain't yellow.
{71316}{71383}I'd hate to think my partner|had a yellow streak up his back.
{71385}{71443}I'll kill you, you dirty, thieving...
{71491}{71531}Okay, Howard, I got him covered.
{71534}{71608}Another bad move out of you|and I'll blow you to kingdom come.
{71611}{71675}Howard, turn that rock over, will you?
{74344}{74390}The federales are very efficient.
{74440}{74495}Yeah. Bandidos, eh?
{74498}{74557}Yeah, seems between them|they had a diamond ring...
{74560}{74617}pearl earrings, a lot of money|and a railway ticket...
{74620}{74682}with the date of the Aguascalientesile|train robbery on it.
{74682}{74742}They've been here several days,|drinking, shooting...
{74745}{74807}The villagers are afraid|to go out of their huts.
{74809}{74850}Where are they taking them now?
{74852}{74891}To the cemetery.
{75183}{75243}The federales|don't operate in our American way.
{75246}{75325}They're not fingerprint experts,|but they can follow any trail.
{75327}{75380}Against them, no hideout is any use.
{75382}{75440}They know all the tricks of the bandits.
{75440}{75502}You can bet your sweet soul|they'll trace down...
{75505}{75574}every last one of that group|that attacked the train.
{75577}{75651}It'll take time,|months maybe, but they'll do it.
{75776}{75816}Not many Americans get around this way.
{75819}{75869}You're the first|I've bumped into in a long time.
{75871}{75895}That so?
{75898}{75963}- Mighty rugged country hereabouts.|- Yeah.
{75984}{76013}My name's Cody.
{76044}{76071}I'm from Texas.
{76104}{76152}- What's your game?|- I'm a hunter.
{76152}{76202}- Professional?|- Yeah.
{76214}{76243}What all do you hunt?
{76258}{76320}Tiger cats, anything of commercial value.
{76346}{76401}How long did you say|you'd been in these mountains?
{76404}{76428}A few months.
{76430}{76500}Ever seen anything|that looked like pay dirt?
{76536}{76615}I've a hunch there's loads of the real goods|up in those mountains.
{76636}{76684}No, I know|the whole landscape around here.
{76687}{76747}If there'd been gold,|you can bet I'd have seen it.
{76749}{76795}There's nothing doing here for gold.
{76797}{76847}I can look at a hill five miles away...
{76847}{76907}and tell you if it carries|an ounce or a shipload.
{76934}{76965}If you haven't found anything...
{76967}{77008}I'll come with you, put your nose in it.
{77010}{77070}There's indications in the valley,|lots of indications.
{77070}{77128}By tracing the rocks,|I find they come from a ridge...
{77130}{77166}washed down by the tropical rains.
{77169}{77221}- You don't say so.|- Yes, I say so.
{77284}{77320}So much for those bandits.
{77353}{77425}You gotta hand it to the Mexicans|when it comes to swift justice.
{77428}{77480}Once the federales get their mitts|on a criminal...
{77483}{77562}they know what to do.|They hand him a shovel, tell him to dig.
{77562}{77591}When he's dug deep enough...
{77591}{77679}they tell him to put the shovel down,|smoke a cigarette and say his prayers.
{77687}{77773}In another five minutes he's being covered|over with the earth he dug out.
{77775}{77842}Yeah, you gotta hand it to them all right.
{78133}{78212}I meant what I said about going along|with you. Those are my burros.
{78214}{78293}I'm ready to start|if you'll let me go with you to your camp.
{78296}{78356}Thanks anyway,|but I prefer going it by myself.
{78360}{78392}Good luck.
{78689}{78775}I went way around, stayed on hard ground|which wouldn't show the tracks.
{78778}{78866}Every time I hit a high point and looked|I'd see he was still following me.
{78869}{78938}I guess it's only a matter of time|till he shows up here.
{78948}{79037}- I move we tell him straight off to beat it.|- Now, no, that'd be foolish.
{79037}{79128}He'd sit for an hour playing the innocent|and then report us to the officials.
{79130}{79212}Once they come, we can't stay|or take our goods with us if we left.
{79214}{79284}There's nothing else to do|but kill him the minute he appears.
{79284}{79322}No crime to visit these mountains.
{79322}{79399}He may be a guy that likes to wander.|You can't shoot him for that.
{79401}{79447}If you were to shoot him|it might come out.
{79449}{79495}We don't have to shoot him necessarily.
{79497}{79569}We can push him off a rock|and claim it was an accident.
{79571}{79617}Just who's gonna do the pushing, you?
{79619}{79648}We'll toss for it.
{79662}{79718}You're sure he was trailing you, are you?
{79720}{79758}- Absolutely.|- How come?
{79758}{79801}Because there he is.
{80216}{80259}Come over by the fire.
{80502}{80562}I know quite well,|you fellas, I'm not wanted here.
{80564}{80595}Even after what you told me...
{80595}{80667}I couldn't resist the desire|to sit and jaw with an American.
{80667}{80732}Why don't you go where Americans|want to talk to you?
{80732}{80761}Durango isn't too far off.
{80763}{80830}They got one|of them American clubs there.
{80837}{80876}I'm not after that.
{80878}{80950}I've got other things on my mind,|more important.
{80984}{81029}So do we. Don't make any mistakes.
{81032}{81075}Our biggest worry is your presence here.
{81077}{81106}We got no use for you.
{81111}{81173}We don't even want you|for a cook or a dishwasher.
{81178}{81214}No vacancies, understand?
{81235}{81314}In case I don't make myself clear,|you'll be doing yourself a favor...
{81317}{81370}packing up and getting out|tomorrow morning.
{81372}{81446}Go back where you came from.|Take our blessings with you.
{81485}{81509}Thanks.
{81528}{81617}Go ahead. Help yourself. We're no misers.|We don't let guys starve to death.
{81645}{81681}Tonight, you're our guest.
{81713}{81748}But tomorrow morning...
{81751}{81828}Iook out, no trespassing around here,|you know?
{81832}{81868}"Beware of the dogs." Get it?
{81993}{82075}I got myself five foxes and a lion|while you were away at the village.
{82079}{82127}- How are the hides?|- Pretty good.
{82135}{82197}- Where'd you hit them?|- Right through their eyes.
{82199}{82276}Excuse me for butting in, but there's|no game here worth going after.
{82278}{82319}It wouldn't take a week for a hunter...
{82322}{82386}to clean up all around|for five miles in each direction.
{82439}{82480}Yes, there's no good hunting here.
{82482}{82525}That's why we made up our mind|to leave...
{82528}{82573}so that we could look|for something better.
{82576}{82636}Yes, stranger, you're dead right.|Awful poor ground.
{82638}{82676}It took us some time to find it out.
{82679}{82715}Poor ground, you say?
{82720}{82763}Depends on what you're looking for.
{82777}{82801}For game, yes.
{82813}{82866}Mighty good ground for something else.
{82897}{82928}What might that be?
{82947}{82971}Gold.
{83130}{83158}That's a good one.
{83158}{83218}I told you in the village,|there's no gold around here.
{83221}{83300}If there was one single ounce of it,|I'd have seen it, believe me.
{83300}{83396}If you haven't found any gold here,|you're not as smart as you appear to be.
{83396}{83451}Well, maybe, you're right.
{83458}{83482}Who knows?
{83520}{83580}We never thought about gold.|Gives me an idea.
{83600}{83633}Guess I'll sleep on it.
{83650}{83684}I'll hit the hay.
{83705}{83729}Yeah. Me, too.
{83743}{83782}See you in the morning, mister.
{84163}{84230}I can't figure this bird out.|Is he wise to us or not?
{84233}{84293}Whether he is or not,|he looks fairly harmless to me.
{84305}{84372}- Looks can be mighty deceiving.|- No denying that.
{84451}{84501}I'm keeping my boots on this night.
{84501}{84561}Might take it in his head|to murder us in our sleep.
{84561}{84638}- Anything can happen. I'll tell you what.|- Well, then?
{84640}{84707}You guys go to sleep|and I'll be watchdog for a few hours.
{84710}{84746}Then you both can take your turns.
{84748}{84806}- Okay. Got your gun handy?|- Yeah. Right here.
{85542}{85571}Good morning, friend.
{85626}{85671}Where'd you get the water|to make coffee?
{85674}{85726}- I took it out of the olla.|- You did, did you?
{85729}{85789}We didn't carry that water here|for you to make coffee.
{85791}{85870}- I didn't know water was so hard to get.|- You know it now.
{85873}{85909}I'll fill it up for you.
{85911}{85940}What's up?
{85947}{85995}I caught this guy stealing our water.
{86002}{86079}The next time I'll let it out of you|through two little round holes.
{86079}{86165}I thought I was among civilized men|who wouldn't begrudge me fresh water.
{86168}{86206}Who's not civilized?
{86379}{86427}I could easily do the same for you.
{86429}{86482}It's not settled yet who'd come out on top.
{86499}{86527}This time I took it.
{86537}{86570}Thanks for your kind attention.
{86573}{86652}If I was you, stranger,|I'd pack up and go while the going's good.
{86659}{86693}I mean to stay right here.
{86695}{86748}The brush and the mountains are free,|aren't they?
{86748}{86810}Sure. That's right,|whoever's first on the spot.
{86813}{86863}That holds for hunters,|but not for gold miners.
{86865}{86925}Unless they have happened|to have registered their claim.
{86928}{86966}Who says we have a claim to register?
{86969}{87052}Whatever you say or don't say,|tomorrow I start to dig for gold here.
{87280}{87338}I know you guys|can bump me off any minute...
{87338}{87405}but that's a risk worth running|considering the stakes.
{87407}{87446}Let's lay all our cards on the table.
{87448}{87510}As I see it, you guys have to do|one of three things:
{87513}{87590}Kill me, run me off|or take me in with you as a partner.
{87590}{87637}Let's consider the first.
{87640}{87717}Another guy may come along tomorrow.|Maybe a dozen other guys.
{87717}{87745}If you start killing them...
{87745}{87808}how far are you prepared to go?|Ask yourselves that.
{87808}{87889}Also, don't forget,|the one actually to do the bumping off...
{87892}{87949}would forever be in the power|of the other two.
{87952}{88028}The only safe way would be|for all of you to drag out your cannons...
{88031}{88088}and bang away at the same instant|like a firing squad.
{88091}{88153}We wouldn't stop at anything|to protect our interests.
{88155}{88191}I claim killing me isn't it.
{88225}{88275}But, of course, that's for you to decide.
{88299}{88333}As for choice number two...
{88333}{88386}you run me off,|I might very well inform on you.
{88386}{88429}We'd get you if you did that.
{88434}{88496}We'd get you|if we had to go all the way to China.
{88498}{88575}Of your find is the reward I'd get.
{88577}{88623}And that would be mighty tempting.
{88635}{88695}It's a strong argument|in favor of number one.
{88697}{88731}I don't deny it.
{88733}{88781}But let's see|what number three has to offer.
{88788}{88858}If you take me in as a partner,|you don't stand to lose anything.
{88863}{88951}I'll not ask a share in what you've made|so far, only in the profits to come.
{88990}{89023}What do you say?
{89081}{89151}Mind, stranger, letting us talk this over|among ourselves?
{89153}{89184}Not at all. Go ahead.
{89189}{89237}I have to look after my burros anyway.
{89589}{89654}- What do you think?|- Sending him away is out of the question.
{89654}{89709}Either we bump him off|or make him a partner.
{89712}{89776}F.C. Dobbs ain't a guy|that likes being taken advantage of.
{89784}{89819}Do the mug in, I say.
{89824}{89858}He told us how, didn't he?
{89858}{89913}All of us hold out our cannons|and let him have it.
{89915}{89956}What do we gain by bumping him off?
{89959}{90019}If he was asking to share in what we made|it'd be different.
{90019}{90062}I don't mind being taken advantage of...
{90064}{90110}if it isn't money out of my pocket.
{90110}{90146}And whoever else comes along...
{90148}{90215}they're to be invited in, too.|Come one, come all?
{90218}{90282}You got a point there.|No question about that.
{90309}{90333}But killing...
{90335}{90417}- What's the matter, ain't you up to it?|- Sure, I'm up to it.
{90486}{90522}Let the majority decide.
{90568}{90604}What's your vote, partner?
{90611}{90642}For or against?
{90774}{90798}For.
{90870}{90918}Let's make it short and sweet for him.
{91843}{91891}So it's number one, is it?
{91896}{91949}Better take a look down that hill first.
{92229}{92294}I can't make out what they are.|They must be soldiers.
{92296}{92340}So that's your stinking game, is it?
{92340}{92416}Informing. I knew you were an informer.|I knew it all the time.
{92419}{92474}You're wrong, brother.|This means all our funerals.
{92476}{92505}What's that?
{92505}{92563}If it's what I think it is,|may the Lord be with us.
{92565}{92656}They're not soldiers, they're bandits.|After guns and ammunition, not gold.
{92656}{92723}Some villager must have told them|about the American hunter.
{92726}{92805}They don't look like soldiers to me, either.|They are bandits.
{92807}{92869}We better start thinking|of a way to defend ourselves.
{92872}{92953}We can hide in the rocks but|we'll lose the burros and the whole outfit.
{92953}{92997}The best thing is to fight.
{92999}{93057}You have good eyes.|Stay here on this lookout...
{93057}{93107}for the time being|and watch their movements.
{93109}{93169}You herd all the burros|in that thicket there.
{93172}{93260}Dobbs, we'll wrap up all our belongings|and dump them in the trench.
{94171}{94212}They're turning onto the trail.
{94215}{94265}- How many of them are there?|- About a dozen.
{94267}{94337}They'll be an hour getting here|so we better eat something.
{94347}{94383}Come on down, friend.
{95840}{95840}next sub
{95840}{95898}Look, Howard.|The one in the gold hat, remember?
{95900}{95948}Yeah, the man in the train robbery.
{95951}{96006}They'll think whoever was here is gone.
{96116}{96176}Some want to go back down|the mountains, others want to stay...
{96178}{96243}and use this site as headquarters|to raid the villages.
{96246}{96277}How about pouring it into them?
{96277}{96361}- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?|- No, let's hold our horses.
{96843}{96871}We are federales.
{96883}{96936}You know, the mounted police.
{96943}{97001}If you are the police,|where are your badges?
{97001}{97070}Badges? We ain't got no badges.
{97094}{97135}We don't need no badges.
{97138}{97198}I don't have to show you|any stinking badges.
{97198}{97248}Better not come any closer.
{97320}{97370}We didn't try to do you any harm.
{97380}{97433}Why don't you try to be|a little more polite?
{97440}{97509}Give us your gun|and we'll leave you in peace.
{97521}{97567}I need my gun myself.
{97605}{97655}Throw that old iron over here.
{97658}{97713}We'll pick it up and go on our way.
{97715}{97785}You go anyway without my gun,|and go quick.
{97845}{97900}All right.
{98466}{98540}Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.
{98555}{98631}We don't want to get your gun|for nothing. We want to buy it.
{98660}{98742}Look, I have a gold watch|with a gold chain...
{98754}{98792}made in your own country.
{98797}{98898}The watch and the chain,|they're worth at least 200 pesos.
{98912}{98953}I'll change it for your gun.
{98979}{99046}You better take it.|That's a good business for you.
{99051}{99099}You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.
{99109}{99200}Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?|We won't get it?
{99207}{99231}I'll show you.
{101187}{101223}Anybody get hurt?
{101262}{101298}Looks like we won that round.
{101319}{101413}- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...|- We spotted him, too. The train robber.
{101415}{101475}- Maybe they got enough?|- I doubt it.
{101475}{101557}Since they know there's four guns,|they'll be more determined than ever.
{101559}{101657}- What do you suppose they'll pull next?|- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.
{101686}{101753}Cody, are you all right?
{102955}{102981}He's dead.
{103024}{103072}Got it right through the neck.
{103103}{103132}One less gun.
{103252}{103305}Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.
{103329}{103389}If they're up to what I think they are,|it ain't funny.
{103391}{103444}- What's that?|- They're building moving barricades.
{103444}{103473}An old Indian trick.
{103475}{103549}They crawl and push the barricades.|You can't see where to shoot.
{103552}{103657}I'd be willing to trade my share of the|mine right now for a few hand grenades.
{103660}{103708}You'd better get to your posts.
{104269}{104314}They're beating it.
{104496}{104564}- What do you make of that?|- Your guess is as good as mine.
{104585}{104643}Wait a minute,|this may be some trick to lure us out.
{104643}{104729}I don't think so. They ain't|good enough actors for this kind of a trick.
{105137}{105194}Hey, partner. Up here.
{105197}{105257}Here's a sight if there ever was one.
{105530}{105614}Federales. Look at them.|I could kiss every one of them.
{105616}{105700}They must've gotten it from the villagers|there were bandits headed here.
{105703}{105750}Why don't they wait here,|make a fight of it?
{105750}{105789}They know all the tricks that's why.
{105791}{105870}With us behind and the federales facing|them, they wouldn't have a chance.
{105873}{105914}Go get them, sick them, tie them.
{105916}{105988}Chew them up and don't spit them out.|Swallow them.
{105990}{106014}Am I happy.
{106017}{106081}Tell you the truth,|I was already eating dirt.
{106122}{106163}I wonder who he is.
{106220}{106261}And if he's got any folks.
{106264}{106292}Supposing he has?
{106295}{106345}Let's take a look at his belongings.
{106863}{106897}A few hundred pesos.
{106928}{106997}Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.
{107031}{107098}A letter from Dallas, too.|It must be his home.
{107115}{107156}Reckon she's his girl.
{107206}{107235}Not bad.
{107278}{107345}"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.
{107352}{107448}"It was such a relief to get word|after so many months of...
{107484}{107508}"silence.
{107532}{107599}"I realize, of course, that...
{107606}{107721}"there aren't any mailboxes|that you can drop a letter in...
{107743}{107801}"out there in the wild."
{107813}{107846}You better read it.
{107863}{107930}"But that doesn't keep me|from worrying about you.
{107964}{108072}"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses|his daddy almost as much as I do.
{108081}{108143}"He keeps asking,|'When's Daddy coming home? '
{108165}{108235}"You say if you do not make|a real find this time...
{108237}{108273}"you'll never go again.
{108285}{108364}"I cannot begin to tell you|how my heart rejoices...
{108378}{108434}"at those words, if you really mean them.
{108450}{108510}"Now I feel free to tell you...
{108515}{108580}"I've never thought|any material treasure...
{108594}{108700}"no matter how great, is worth the pain|of these long separations.
{108745}{108817}"The country is especially lovely this year.
{108832}{108913}"It's been a perfect spring.|Warm rains and hardly any frost.
{108928}{108980}"The fruit trees are all in bloom.
{108997}{109050}"The upper orchard looks aflame...
{109055}{109117}"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.
{109136}{109187}"Everybody looks forward to big crops.
{109203}{109256}"I do hope you are back for the harvest.
{109354}{109441}"Of course, I'm hoping|that you will at last strike it rich.
{109450}{109489}"It is high time for luck...
{109498}{109544}"to start smiling upon you.
{109556}{109601}"But just in case she doesn't...
{109611}{109683}"remember we've already found|life's real treasures.
{109697}{109750}"Forever yours, Helen."
{109863}{109918}I guess we better dig a hole for him.
{110184}{110244}- Yeah, not so good.|- Not so good as yesterday.
{110246}{110304}Want my opinion?|Lt'll be a lot less from now on.
{110304}{110349}We've taken|all the gold this mountain has.
{110349}{110393}How much do you figure we got today?
{110393}{110467}Not as much as we were aiming to collect.|Not $40,000.
{110469}{110510}I'm willing to lower my hindsight.
{110513}{110604}We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.|I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.
{110606}{110649}Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.
{110652}{110700}The sooner the better|as far as I'm concerned.
{110702}{110745}I don't want to keep that dame waiting.
{110747}{110822}It'll take a week to break the mine,|put the mountain back in shape.
{110824}{110848}Do what to the mountain?
{110851}{110899}Make her look like|she was before we came.
{110901}{110927}I don't get it.
{110927}{110990}We wounded this place.|It's our duty to close her wounds.
{110990}{111076}The least we can do to show our gratitude|for all the wealth she's given us.
{111078}{111141}If you guys don't want to help me,|I'll do it alone.
{111153}{111220}You talk about that mountain|like it was a real woman.
{111239}{111306}She's been a lot better to me|than any woman I ever knew.
{111309}{111378}Keep your shirt on, old-timer.|Sure, I'll help you.
{112316}{112356}I reckon that's about everything.
{112356}{112433}Each man's burros with his goods|will be his own responsibility.
{112433}{112457}Come on.
{112503}{112546}Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.
{112594}{112654}Yeah, thanks, mountain.
{113277}{113318}I've been thinking about her.
{113335}{113380}Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.
{113399}{113423}You know what?
{113426}{113517}We ought to give them a fourth just|as if he'd been our partner from the start.
{113519}{113563}What? A fourth of all our goods?
{113570}{113620}- That's right.|- Are you crazy?
{113622}{113699}If not for him, we wouldn't have|walked away from that mountain.
{113699}{113723}Ask Howard.
{113728}{113783}The buzzard would have gotten fat|on us all right.
{113783}{113845}Yeah, it might just as well have been|one of us.
{113848}{113908}But it wasn't.|It's our good luck and his bad.
{113925}{113982}Whatever you guys do,|I'm going to give a fourth.
{113982}{114068}I got more than I need, anyhow.|Half what I got is enough to last me out.
{114071}{114104}- Fourth?|- Sure.
{114107}{114181}You two guys must have been born|in a revival meeting.
{114407}{114442}We got company.
{114538}{114572}Steady, boys.
{115356}{115382}Coffee.
{115505}{115538}Give him some tobacco.
{115898}{115975}We give them our tobacco,|they give us theirs, I don't get it.
{115977}{116027}Why not everybody smoke his own?
{116042}{116087}Take some and thank them.
{116222}{116265}They're after something.
{116284}{116337}Takes them a while to come to the point.
{116346}{116435}To say what you want right off the bat|isn't considered polite among Indians.
{117171}{117219}They got nothing but time?
{117970}{118039}His boy fell in the water,|they fished him out.
{118039}{118106}- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.|- Tough.
{118140}{118181}I'll go have a look at the boy.
{118183}{118257}I'll be back in a little while.|Before morning, probably.
{118461}{118516}Look after my goods while I am gone.
{119610}{119634}Tequila.
{123238}{123312}Artificial respiration did it|and a few Boy Scout tricks.
{123314}{123367}I think it was more shock than drowning.
{123367}{123453}He hadn't swallowed much water.|Maybe he was stunned while diving.
{123458}{123537}How did these Indians know we were|in this neck of the woods anyhow?
{123540}{123636}When you're near their villages,|don't ask me how, they just know.
{124350}{124377}What's up?
{124379}{124444}He's insisting we return to his village|and be his guests.
{124446}{124513}Tell him to forget it.|Tell him he don't owe us a thing.
{124779}{124849}If he doesn't pay off his debt|all the saints will be angry.
{124849}{124887}This is no laughing matter.
{124887}{124978}I'm afraid he's determined|to take us with him, even if it means force.
{124981}{125014}I'll handle this.
{125151}{125237}Wait a minute. You can't fight your way|out of this. Put your guns away.
{125240}{125333}Have every Indian in the mountain on|our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.
{125554}{125590}What'd he say then?
{125595}{125669}It didn't make any difference|about you guys but I have to come.
{125671}{125727}- It's like that, he just wants you.|- Looks like it.
{125729}{125765}Why don't you go with them?
{125765}{125839}Stay a few days and we'll meet you|in Durango. We'll wait there.
{125842}{125904}- What about my goods?|- Why don't you take them with you.
{125906}{125997}If they found out they might forget he was|their honored guest and bump him off.
{126000}{126045}What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?
{126048}{126139}We'll take them with us if you want us to|and wait for you in Durango.
{126185}{126237}I reckon that's about the only solution.
{126237}{126328}I bet you'll remember this|the next time you try to do a good deed.
{126340}{126415}Maybe after I've stayed with them|they'll give me a horse.
{126415}{126463}Then I'll be a day or two behind you.
{126463}{126511}That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.
{126513}{126571}Yeah, all the luck in the world.
{126575}{126671}We'll be lonesome without you. But|my Sunday school teacher used to say:
{126686}{126767}"You got to learn to swallow|disappointments in this sad life."
{126767}{126796}Hurry up and join us.
{126798}{126875}Look out for those Indian dames.|They tell me they're smart.
{126875}{126928}One of them squaws might marry you.
{126940}{127024}Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out|a good-looking squaw and marry her.
{127024}{127108}They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.|They don't nag at you, either.
{127110}{127146}So long, partners.
{127194}{127232}See you in Durango.
{128657}{128719}Ain't it always his burros|that won't march in line...
{128721}{128813}stray off the trail and smash their packs|against the trees and rocks?
{128834}{128932}I wish they'd stray off far enough|to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.
{128944}{129000}Why'd you offer|to carry his goods for him?
{129002}{129047}As if he couldn't manage by himself.
{129050}{129110}He knew what he was doing|when he turned them over to us.
{129112}{129160}Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?
{129179}{129259}What's the use of railing against|the old man? It won't do any good.
{129261}{129328}Save your breath|for the next piece of trail.
{129335}{129386}I'm stopping here for the night.
{129390}{129470}If you want to go on it's okay with me,|but take his burros with you.
{129472}{129508}They ain't my responsibility.
{129510}{129573}It's early. We can make four,|five miles more before dark.
{129573}{129669}Nobody ordered you to stay here.|You can go 20 miles more for all I care.
{129697}{129728}Ordered me?
{129760}{129786}You?
{129824}{129875}Who's ordering who to do anything?
{129887}{129947}You talk like you're boss of this outfit.
{130002}{130062}Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.
{130129}{130179}All right, if you can't go any further.
{130182}{130225}Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.
{130227}{130280}I can go four times|as far as a mug like you.
{130282}{130369}But I don't want to. I could if I want to,|but I don't want to, see, mug?
{130450}{130493}What's the use of hollering?
{130496}{130575}We're started on something|and we've got to finish it, like it or not.
{130577}{130616}We'll camp here.
{130791}{130841}Wonder what the old man's doing now.
{130843}{130935}Eating a meal of roast turkey|and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.
{130937}{131002}This is the first day we've had|to manage without his help.
{131004}{131059}Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.
{131062}{131117}How far away|do you suppose the railroad is?
{131119}{131186}- Not so far as the crow flies.|- We ain't crows.
{131213}{131280}I figure we can reach the high-pass|in two days more...
{131282}{131342}then it'll be three or four days|to the railroad.
{131342}{131414}That's figuring no hard luck|on the trail, of course.
{131505}{131546}What's the joke, Dobbsie?
{131589}{131635}Aren't you going to let me in on it?
{131637}{131695}In on it? Sure I will.
{131709}{131735}Sure.
{131791}{131848}Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?
{131851}{131922}I was thinking what a bonehead play|that old jackass made...
{131925}{132009}- when he put all his goods in our keeping.|- What do you mean?
{132011}{132081}Figured he'd let us do his sweating|for him, did he?
{132086}{132150}- We'll show him.|- What are you getting at?
{132177}{132225}Can't you see? It's all ours.
{132225}{132299}We don't go back to Durango at all.|Not at all.
{132320}{132349}I don't follow you.
{132352}{132414}Don't be such a sap.|Where did you ever grow up?
{132414}{132479}All right, to make it clear|to a dumbhead like you...
{132479}{132567}we take all his goods and go straight|up north and leave the jackass flat.
{132567}{132649}You aren't serious, are you? You don't|really mean what you are saying.
{132651}{132723}Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing|he don't mean.
{132788}{132898}As long as I'm here and can do anything,|you won't touch the old man's goods.
{132903}{132949}I know exactly what you mean.
{132954}{133011}You want to take it all for yourself|and cut me out.
{133013}{133117}No, I'm on the level with the old man,|like I'd be with you if you weren't here.
{133117}{133200}Get off your soapbox. You only sound|foolish out here in this wilderness.
{133200}{133241}I know you for what you are.
{133241}{133335}For a long time I've had my suspicions|about you and now I know I've been right.
{133337}{133419}- What suspicions?|- You're not putting anything over on me.
{133421}{133457}I see right through you.
{133457}{133541}For a long time you've wanted|to bump me off at the first opportunity...
{133543}{133594}and bury me out here|in the bush like a dog...
{133596}{133690}so you could take not only the old man's|goods but mine in the bargain.
{133702}{133769}When you get to Durango safely|you'll have a big laugh...
{133771}{133829}thinking how dumb|the old man and I were.
{133865}{133944}You make another move towards me|and I'll pull the trigger.
{133965}{134028}Now, get your hands up.|Come on, get them up.
{134116}{134160}Was I right, or was I?
{134169}{134253}You and your Sunday school talk|about protecting people's goods.
{134263}{134335}You. Go on, stand up,|and take it like a man.
{134347}{134380}Come on, get up.
{134464}{134493}Let go of it.
{134572}{134630}- The cards are dealt the other way now.|- Yeah.
{134630}{134668}Now listen to me...
{134680}{134721}Look, you're all wrong.
{134723}{134802}Not for a moment did I ever intend|to rob you or do you any harm.
{134805}{134841}Just like I said...
{134843}{134925}I'd fight for you and yours|like I'd fight for the old man's.
{134927}{134987}If you really mean that|give me back my gun.
{135179}{135215}My pal.
{135270}{135373}Wouldn't it be better the way things are|to separate tomorrow or even tonight?
{135373}{135445}- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?|- Why me more than you?
{135447}{135534}So you could fall on me from behind,|sneak up and shoot me in the back.
{135536}{135570}All right, I'll go first.
{135572}{135620}And wait for me on the trail|to ambush me?
{135620}{135675}Why wouldn't I do it now|if I meant to kill you?
{135675}{135733}I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.
{135737}{135833}You don't have the nerve to pull the|trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.
{135833}{135932}If you think like that, there's nothing|to do but to tie you up every night.
{136054}{136109}I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.
{136111}{136176}Three times 35 is 105.
{136181}{136258}I'll bet $105,000|you go to sleep before I do.
{137214}{137270}Get up there at the head of the train.
{138720}{138749}Get up!
{138795}{138888}The cards are dealt the other way now,|and for the last time no more shuffling.
{138890}{138950}- What cards are...|- I'm going to finish this right now.
{138953}{139013}I won't take orders from you|like I had to do today.
{139013}{139101}- You mean you're going to murder me?|- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.
{139104}{139195}I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take|from me when I wasn't looking at you.
{139197}{139260}- The old man'll catch up with you.|- He will, will he?
{139262}{139329}I got an answer for that one, too.|Know what I'll tell him?
{139332}{139428}I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and|made your getaway taking all our goods.
{139428}{139476}He'll be looking for you and not me.
{139478}{139574}Up. March. Today I had to march|to your music, now you march to mine.
{139574}{139615}- Where?|- To your funeral.
{139646}{139687}Come on, keep going.
{139703}{139756}Get up. Sleepy?
{139775}{139842}You'll be asleep soon enough.|Sound asleep.
{140778}{140821}Maybe I didn't kill him.
{140833}{140907}Maybe he just staggered and fell down|without being hit.
{141785}{141833}You keep it, it's yours anyhow.
{142216}{142281}No, they won't find him.
{142319}{142391}I'll dig a hole for him|first thing in the morning.
{142559}{142590}This fire...
{142609}{142648}don't give much heat.
{142784}{142818}Conscience.
{142852}{142883}What a thing.
{142936}{143015}If you believe you've got a conscience,|it'll pester you to death.
{143017}{143084}But if you don't believe you've got one...
{143089}{143132}what can it do to you?
{143149}{143247}Makes me sick all this talking and fussing|about nonsense.
{145091}{145146}Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.
{145163}{145225}Ain't very likely anybody will find him.
{145240}{145333}In a week, the buzzards and the ants|will have done away with him anyway.
{145420}{145520}I don't know what's getting into me.|Was that really a tiger?
{145719}{145743}No.
{145791}{145878}What if his eyes are open, looking at me?
{145921}{145995}Best thing to do|is to get to the railroad in a hurry.
{146539}{146573}Burro.
{146631}{146683}It's better not to have buried him.
{146688}{146736}I did right, yeah.
{146789}{146873}What I should have done, maybe,|was bury his clothes...
{146885}{146942}and leave him to the ants|and the buzzards.
{146952}{146983}Buzzards!
{146997}{147079}If somebody saw them circling,|they'd know something was dead.
{147108}{147158}Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.
{147184}{147218}Lucky for me.
{147913}{147942}Curtin!
{148168}{148199}Where are you?
{148486}{148570}I better get a hold of myself.|I mustn't lose my head.
{148621}{148681}There's one thing certain, he ain't here.
{148709}{148765}I got it. The tiger.
{148791}{148899}Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have|dragged him off to his lair, that's what.
{148920}{149016}Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones|will be left to tell the story.
{149165}{149211}Done as if by order.
{151640}{151695}I came to in the middle of the night.
{151714}{151769}My gun was on the ground beside me.
{151800}{151884}He must have left it there|to make it look like suicide.
{151915}{152009}I figured he'd come back in the morning|to see if I still had a flicker of life.
{152009}{152071}I thought about waiting for him|and letting him have it...
{152074}{152143}but there was a good chance|in my condition I might miss...
{152146}{152203}so I decided to crawl away|like a poisoned dog.
{152205}{152292}- Take it easy, you're talking too much.|- Don't you worry about me.
{152294}{152357}I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.
{152359}{152457}It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off|with our goods and is on his way north.
{152457}{152532}- Yeah.|- I reckon we can't blame him too much.
{152532}{152563}What do you mean?
{152565}{152623}I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.
{152625}{152692}I think he's as honest|as the next fella, or almost.
{152692}{152767}The mistake was leaving you two|in the depths of the wilderness...
{152769}{152817}with more than $100,000 between you.
{152817}{152872}That's a big temptation, partner,|believe me.
{152874}{152910}He shot me down in cold blood.
{152913}{152992}After I was down he shot me|a second time just to make sure.
{152994}{153076}If I was young and out there with one|of you, I'd have been tempted, too.
{153078}{153150}Maybe I wouldn't have fallen,|but I reckon I would've been tempted.
{153153}{153217}There now. You're almost as good as new.
{153244}{153304}Now, to find that thief|and get our goods back.
{153536}{153611}They're not only giving me a horse|but coming to protect me.
{153613}{153651}- You ain't going.|- Who says so?
{153654}{153706}You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.
{153709}{153764}- You aren't leaving me behind.|- Look at you.
{153766}{153850}You're weak as a kitten.|Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.
{153853}{153882}I'm going.
{153889}{153944}Well, I reckon you're going.
{154699}{154728}Burro!
{155730}{155759}Made it.
{157298}{157342}Have you got any cigarettes?
{157423}{157493}No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco...
{157524}{157560}if that'll do.
{157577}{157644}No paper to roll it in?
{157660}{157689}Papers?
{157761}{157797}Here you are.
{157852}{157912}- Going to Durango?|- Yeah.
{157941}{157982}That's where I'm headed.
{157991}{158039}I've got to sell my burros.
{158058}{158123}I got to get some money.|I haven't got a red cent.
{158123}{158154}Matches?
{158257}{158322}Money? We need money, too.
{158346}{158411}Yeah? I could use a good mule driver...
{158435}{158473}maybe two or three.
{158660}{158708}How much is the pay?
{158732}{158763}Two pesos.
{158775}{158833}Of course, I can't pay you in advance...
{158835}{158912}I got to wait till I get to town|so I can get the money.
{158955}{159003}Do I know you from someplace?
{159025}{159063}Maybe I know you.
{159087}{159140}No, I don't think so.
{159200}{159250}- Are you alone?|- No.
{159289}{159322}I'm not alone.
{159356}{159425}I got a couple of friends|coming along on horseback.
{159444}{159507}Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.
{159782}{159816}That's funny.
{159823}{159912}A man all by himself in bandit country|with a string of burros...
{159917}{159984}and his friends behind him on horseback.
{160164}{160216}Your friends must be very far behind you.
{160216}{160284}Pablo cannot see any dust|even from their horses.
{160291}{160329}They'll be along any minute, I tell you.
{160444}{160521}I know who you are.|You're the guy in the hole.
{160528}{160581}The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.
{160598}{160648}I never laid eyes on you until now.
{160674}{160722}What you got in the bags?
{160869}{160943}- Seems to me like hides.|- Yeah.
{160984}{161029}That's what they are, hides.
{161037}{161092}Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.
{161123}{161149}Yeah.
{161200}{161291}Sure you don't want to come along|with me and help me with the burros?
{161439}{161468}Burro.
{161730}{161770}Get away from my burro.
{161780}{161885}We can sell those burros|for just as good a price as you'd get.
{161888}{161926}Get away from my burro.
{161926}{162041}You can't frighten even a sick louse|with that. You can only shoot one of us...
{162053}{162147}and he wouldn't mind too much.|The federales are after him anyway.
{162149}{162195}So what with your gun?
{162207}{162264}- We'll take that chance.|- Get back there.
{169976}{170057}- Shooting.|- Volley. Execution probably.
{170585}{170640}- Dobbs is dead.|- What?
{170654}{170733}- Bandits got him.|- Our goods. What about our goods?
{170925}{170997}- What?|- He says our goods are safe in his office.
{171047}{171126}- It's not here, Howard.|- Keep your shirt on.
{171757}{171786}What?
{172131}{172205}He heard the bandits talking|while they were waiting to be shot.
{172208}{172270}They thought it was bags of sand|hidden among the hide...
{172273}{172328}to make it weigh more|when Dobbs went to sell them.
{172330}{172361}Where are they?
{172558}{172618}They're in the ruins outside town.|Come on!
{176023}{176104}Laugh, Curtin, old boy,|it's a great joke played on us...
{176104}{176169}by the lord of fate or nature,|whatever you prefer...
{176171}{176255}but whoever or whatever played it|certainly had a sense of humor!
{176258}{176320}The gold has gone back|to where we found it!
{176788}{176872}This is worth ten months|of suffering and labor, this joke is!
{177521}{177579}Well, Howard, what next I wonder?
{177591}{177663}I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned|as a medicine man.
{177665}{177716}I'll have three meals a day, five if I want...
{177718}{177785}roof over my head,|and a drink now and then to warm me up.
{177788}{177852}I will be worshipped, fed,|and treated like a high priest...
{177855}{177948}for telling people what they want to hear.|Good medicine men are born not made.
{177951}{177991}Come and see me sometime, my boy.
{177991}{178063}Even you'll take off your hat|when you see how respected I am.
{178063}{178135}The day before yesterday,|they wanted to make me their legislature.
{178138}{178169}Their whole legislature!
{178169}{178260}I don't know what that means. I think|it's the highest honor they can bestow.
{178262}{178329}Yeah, I'm all fixed|for the rest of my natural life.
{178329}{178382}How about yourself?|What do you aim to do?
{178385}{178423}I haven't got any idea.
{178425}{178514}You're young. You've got plenty of time|to make three or four fortunes.
{178526}{178596}You know, the worst ain't so bad|when it finally happens.
{178598}{178668}Not half as bad as you figure it'll be|before it happens.
{178670}{178725}I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.
{178730}{178799}I'm out a couple of hundred dollars|when you come down to it.
{178802}{178859}Not very much compared|to what Dobbsie lost.
{178862}{178912}Any special place you're bent on going?
{178915}{178970}No, all places are the same to me.
{178984}{179058}You can keep my share of what the burros|and the hides'll bring...
{179058}{179157}if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.|See Cody's widow. Better than writing.
{179157}{179253}And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.
{179356}{179387}How about it?
{179440}{179468}It's a deal.
{179540}{179579}Well, let's get going.
{179929}{179982}- Goodbye, Curtin.|- Goodbye, Howard.
{179984}{180030}- Good luck.|- Same to you.
