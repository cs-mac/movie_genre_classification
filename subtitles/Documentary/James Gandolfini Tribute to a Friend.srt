1
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,838
Grandmother!

2
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,876
Grandma, please open up the door!

3
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,446
-You should see somebody else.
-Grandma!

4
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,126
Excuse me.

5
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,226
This is private property.

6
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:57,065
Janet Hardy's family might not appreciate
you going all demolition derby on it.

7
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,369
We don't mind.

8
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,701
Oh, wait a minute.

9
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,476
You're her granddaughter, Katie Lawrence.

10
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,378
I played a little girl on TV
called Katie Lawrence.

11
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,072
My name is Cilla McGowan.

12
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:16,648
And please, don't tell me I haven't changed
a bit 'cause I know that's just not true.

13
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,259
No, you've changed.

14
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,021
A lot. Your grandmother was amazing.

15
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,299
Working with Brando and Beatty
and McQueen.

16
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,131
Those hit songs. An Academy Award winner.

17
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,063
Two-time Academy Award winner.

18
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,443
Yeah, and I never met her.
She died before I was born.

19
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,138
Listen, you're not gonna brain me
with that sledgehammer

20
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:47,653
-if I come a little closer, are you?
-Well, not unless you give me cause.

21
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,855
Ford Sawyer.

22
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,185
I live across the road.

23
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,593
Who names their kid after a car?

24
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,395
Apparently I was conceived
in the back of a Ford Mustang.

25
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,803
Good thing your father didn't have a Camry.

26
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:12,643
Well, I'll let you get back to work.

27
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,711
I work at home, too,
so if you need anything, give a holler.

28
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,314
Thanks for the help, neighbor!

29
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,636
Grandmother?

30
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,366
Cilla?

31
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,065
Hi.

32
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,777
Did you bring my pills?

33
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,813
Oh, that's a good girl.

34
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,982
Grandma needs to sleep.

35
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,758
Where's your mother?

36
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,695
-Where's Johnnie?
-Grandma, Johnnie's dead.

37
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,329
I have to hurry.

38
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,036
Don't do that. No! Don't do that, Grandma.

39
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,141
Don't take those! Don't do it.

40
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,778
Are you kidding me?

41
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,029
What the heck happened here?

42
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,938
Somebody just cut down my new trees.

43
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,409
You know, some guy's been lurking around.

44
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,674
He must've really disagreed
with your landscaping choices.

45
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,807
-You must be Brian.
-I am. You're definitely Cilla McGowan.

46
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,111
-Hi.
-Hi.

47
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,446
I'm gonna get this fixed up for you, okay?

48
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,579
I'm gonna give Shanna down at the nursery
a call and get you some replacements.

49
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,645
Thank you, Brian.

50
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,919
This is the master bathroom.

51
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,355
Buddy, we're gonna take this wall back,
push it back four feet.

52
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,230
That toilet is gonna end up right there

53
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,965
and this whole entire wall's gonna be
all glass bricks.

54
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,008
Whole shower wall, right there.

55
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,838
You know, you won't have any privacy.

56
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,378
That's so that the natural sunlight
gets in the shower.

57
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,643
Why in God's world does anybody need
this many showerheads?

58
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,150
It's body jets, Buddy. It's very modern.

59
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,449
Oh, it's not just a shower, Buddy,
it's an experience.

60
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,659
Wait till you try it out. Come on,
check out the kitchen. You'll like it.

61
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,465
-You want me to get that for you, Cilla?
-No, thanks, I got it.

62
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,325
Check this out.

63
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,000
-Awesome.
-Right?

64
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,163
Yes.

65
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,901
Isn't that amazing?

66
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,271
I'm surprised anything's left in here

67
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,435
with all the tenants that this place had
over the years.

68
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,138
Will this not make the most incredible
office space, though?

69
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,202
It would.

70
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,647
Would you have the guys move all this stuff
into the barn tomorrow?

71
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,685
-Absolutely.
-That'd be great.

72
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,743
Have them be careful.
It's all my grandmother's stuff.

73
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,881
I don't even know what's in here.
Look at this.

74
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,085
So the gardens will be restored
to their original glory.

75
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,154
Yeah, I'll get rid of all the vines
and squatter bushes that have taken over.

76
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,099
Perfect. That tree. That oak tree, l...

77
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,104
Shanna, who is that man?

78
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,836
That's Carl Hennessey.

79
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,671
Hennessey. Thank you.

80
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,379
Excuse me, Mr. Hennessey!

81
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,149
Mr. Hennessey.

82
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,077
Hi, Mr. Hennessey.

83
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,886
Did you see who cut down my trees?

84
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,589
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

85
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,133
What is his problem?

86
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,843
Oh, wow.

87
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,884
Grandma, you kept your rare ones.

88
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,711
You saved them.

89
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,955
"Songs for a Rainy Afternoon."

90
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,097
Wow.

91
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,968
Perfect.

92
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,169
Grandma, Mom and Johnnie.

93
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,182
Oh, Grandma.

94
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:30,938
"Trudy, my heart pounds as I write this.

95
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,005
"Every night I dream of you,

96
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:39,082
"your laugh, your smell, your taste.

97
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,985
"l dream of making love to you.

98
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,218
"I'm yours forever."

99
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,227
A secret admirer.

100
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,192
-Cilla, you in there?
-Yeah.

101
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,864
Hi.

102
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,034
Housewarming present?

103
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,235
Actually, no.

104
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,610
It's payment, in advance.

105
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:17,912
I'm a graphic novelist and I'm creating
a new character for a new series.

106
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,581
And I need you. You're my woman.

107
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,963
Will I be needing my sledgehammer?

108
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,967
Wait. Look.

109
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,339
This is Dr. Cass Murphy.

110
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,967
She's an archeologist,
professor of the same.

111
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:43,276
She's a quiet, cool, solitary woman,
emotionally repressed, you know?

112
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,076
She looks boring.

113
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:52,287
She'll find an ancient weapon when
she's trapped in the cave by an evil sorcerer.

114
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,484
Naturally.

115
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,926
Listen, Ford,
I have a lot of work to do still, okay?

116
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:05,064
She transforms into a Celtic goddess
with china doll skin, amber eyes.

117
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,837
Fierce, sexy.

118
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,533
Her weapon of choice,
a two-headed hammer.

119
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,132
I need you, and your sledgehammer.

120
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,269
I think you should go now.

121
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,546
I just need a couple of shots of you
while you're working around the yard.

122
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,777
-This guy bothering you?
-I can handle him.

123
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,217
Hey, Brian.

124
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,548
What, does everybody know
everyone else around here?

125
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,750
-Pretty much.
-Yeah, we went to high school together...

126
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:31,455
And still play a poker game that our
daddies' daddies started 50 years ago?

127
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,124
-52 years ago.
-52 years ago.

128
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,396
I didn't get to go to high school.
I had a tutor that came to the set.

129
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,461
-Well, that's cool.
-Oh, no. No, no, no. Not cool.

130
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,539
Especially when it came time for the prom.

131
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,579
My parents used to hang here all the time.

132
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,777
There were some wild-ass parties here.
We're talking wild-ass.

133
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,921
Well, there's a tradition that I'll restore.

134
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,281
Ford, go home.

135
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,125
-You're married.
-I know.

136
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,060
Nice.

137
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,033
Nice. Hold that right there. Up, up, up.

138
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,906
Beautiful.

139
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,576
Can you do one with the...
Like up over your head, both arms?

140
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,945
Nice. Beautiful. I'm loving it.

141
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:30,648
How about one just regular like you're gonna
swing it right above your head?

142
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,854
Beautiful.

143
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,653
Could you hold it up there?

144
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,332
Look, Ford, I don't know
if you've noticed or not,

145
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,426
but I'm actually trying
to make some progress here.

146
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,164
Just pretend like I'm not even here.

147
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,865
Oh, easily done.

148
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,070
Wait, wait, can you go back to that,
just hold that for a second?

149
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,940
Real good. Hold that.

150
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,873
That's beautiful. Freeze.

151
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,913
So, it can't be nice staying in a house
without running water.

152
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,250
If you want, you could shower at my place.

153
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:08,021
Now that is actually an offer
I don't think I can refuse.

154
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,853
So, what's next?

155
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,527
I have to take my Virginia State
Contractor's License test.

156
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,570
So, listen, could you help?

157
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,904
Yeah, no, I don't do hammers.

158
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,637
But I wield a pretty mean spatula.

159
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,374
How do you like your steak?

160
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,881
So I can hear it whisper, "Moo."

161
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,342
I brought your bottle of wine.

162
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,414
The return of the prodigal Pinot.

163
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,648
I was just in the middle
of saving the universe from aliens,

164
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,554
but the universe can wait.

165
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,955
Naturally.

166
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,193
My mother, who's an actress,
always hated it here,

167
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,296
but she just couldn't bring herself
to sell the place.

168
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,833
So I'd been thinking about buying it
from her for years.

169
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,813
-Even though you'd never been here?
-Janet loved The Little Farm.

170
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,581
And I always wanted to know why.

171
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,181
Besides, it's where she died.

172
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,016
I never really liked Hollywood anyway.

173
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,188
-More wine?
-Sure.

174
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:27,425
-Hit me, baby.
-But you were so successful.

175
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:33,862
Well, one hit show, several, thanks,
several B movies,

176
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,706
yeah, does not a career make, so...

177
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,145
<i>-Madame.
-Thank you, monsieur.</i>

178
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,345
My mother loved the idea of us
being this big acting family,

179
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,854
Iike the Fondas or the Barrymores.

180
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,491
She pushed me into it.

181
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,084
But, you know, the one good thing
about being a child star

182
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,597
was that my TV family and l
became very close.

183
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,667
All I wanted was a home.

184
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,538
What? What?

185
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,402
What?

186
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,082
You know, from the movies and the pictures
I've seen of your grandmother,

187
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,879
you're way more beautiful than she was.

188
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,588
This would be me officially hitting on you.

189
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,449
That's not a smart idea.

190
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,121
I've already hit my quota of mistakes
for the decade.

191
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,056
-What?
-Live a little.

192
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,795
Oh, I have. See, I've lived a lot.

193
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:44,937
For instance, if I were to sleep over,
right, I wouldn't sleep in the spare room.

194
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,901
I'd sleep with you.
Would you like some salad now?

195
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,072
Yeah.

196
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:54,718
Thank you for the lovely dinner
and the wine.

197
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,778
Appreciate everything.
Being hit on, you know.

198
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,155
Thank you.

199
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,291
Let me walk you home.

200
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,421
I just live right across the street.

201
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,998
-Who's that?
-Steve.

202
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,132
Steve!

203
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:15,898
Hey!

204
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,069
-Cilla!
-Steve!

205
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,478
-Hey, hey!
-Steve, give me a hug!

206
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,079
-I'm so excited that you're here.
-It's beautiful. Come on, let's go.

207
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,123
We can make something amazing
out of this, right?

208
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,987
-And we create a space right here.
-Why didn't I think of that?

209
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,588
-And you can go straight to the porch.
-You're a genius.

210
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,928
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

211
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,599
Hi.

212
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,477
Just wanted to see if you got home okay.

213
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,280
Who is it?

214
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:06,847
This is Steve Chensky, to whom
I was married for about five minutes.

215
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,851
It was five months, Cilla.

216
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,599
Steve taught me everything I know
about flipping houses.

217
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,998
And a few other things.

218
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,969
Steve, this is Ford Sawyer.

219
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,505
-Ford Sawyer?
-Yeah.

220
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,167
The Ford Sawyer?

221
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,937
No fricking way.

222
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,706
Ford here created the Prodigal series.

223
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,182
He is The Prodigal.

224
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,952
Oh, dude, check this out, man. Look at this.

225
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,224
You did that?

226
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,619
Not that, but yeah. The Prodigal, he's mine.

227
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,059
-Cool.
-Cool?

228
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,967
Really cool.

229
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,819
You know, I'm really happy you're here.

230
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,186
And you can stay as long as you want,

231
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,749
but you really need to get
your own sleeping bag, okay?

232
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,962
Excuse me. Please.

233
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,333
-It's just, I can't get this side zipped.
-Okay.

234
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,434
Oh, for crying out loud.

235
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,464
You know, we'd take up less room
if we spooned.

236
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,305
And, even less if we...

237
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,207
Harsh.

238
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,378
Okay.

239
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,332
Did you hear that creak?

240
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,998
-It's an old house, Cill.
-No, that was a creak.

241
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,400
It creaks.

242
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,439
Somebody already vandalized my trees.
I just wanna make sure.

243
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,504
Should we go investigate?

244
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,106
No.

245
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,098
Steve.

246
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,408
Prodigal Man. How goes it?

247
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,971
Thought you might like these.

248
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,979
Prodigal originals, issues one through six.

249
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,306
Bro.

250
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,849
Wow. Thanks, man.

251
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,787
So, Steve, you mind if I ask you
why you and Cilla split?

252
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,285
Took us about five minutes to realize

253
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,888
we were better at the friend gig
than the marriage thing.

254
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,263
I love her, like a sister.

255
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,065
Thanks.

256
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,274
You know, if you're gonna be
hanging around for a while,

257
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,904
you can crash at my place.
No sense you sleeping in the barn.

258
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,471
-I'm not sleeping in the barn.
-Oh, really?

259
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,143
I just figured, you know, I saw a flashlight
going down there last night.

260
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,751
No fricking way. When?

261
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,288
3:00 in the morning.

262
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,719
-No way.
-The place is trashed. Look at this.

263
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,759
They tore through these boxes.

264
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,393
And all her jewelry.

265
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,595
What are you boys up to?

266
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,628
Ford saw somebody skulking around
last night.

267
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,729
Oh, my God.

268
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,003
-Same time you heard that creaking noise.
-Oh, no.

269
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,108
If I were you, I'd start locking the barn.

270
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,073
Look at all this.

271
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,576
-What?
-What is it?

272
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,521
It's a splinter.

273
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,581
Oh, I feel so much safer
with you boys around.

274
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,934
I offered Steve a room.

275
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,694
Well, that's very neighborly of you.

276
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,138
Not really.

277
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,505
I couldn't sleep knowing the two of you guys
were sharing a bedroom.

278
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,674
-Thanks.
-Well, thank you, neighbor.

279
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,022
-All right.
-Thank you.

280
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,081
Wanna come to dinner
with me tonight in town?

281
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,059
Sorry, I got a date with Shanna.

282
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,119
The landscaper. That was fast.

283
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,227
-Life's short.
-Yes, it is.

284
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,567
All right.

285
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,701
Have fun!

286
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,264
Don't wait up.

287
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,108
Pregnant?

288
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,775
You were pregnant.

289
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,551
Oh, Grandma, what happened to you?

290
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,557
Hollywood is where the magic happens.

291
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:48,730
In the real world, we're just ghosts,
but here, we're real.

292
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,859
But this isn't real.

293
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:55,338
I hated acting. I felt so alone
being the center of everyone's attention.

294
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,432
I was always happy on set.

295
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,312
But you killed yourself.

296
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,971
-And if you were pregnant...
-lf?

297
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,051
<i>If, if, if</i>

298
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,350
"lf" is for tomorrow.

299
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,454
Who is the father?

300
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,024
Who is the father?

301
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,257
Who is the father?

302
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,942
Hey!

303
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,681
-Good morning, Cilla.
-Morning.

304
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,658
-I brought delicious donuts.
-I love donuts.

305
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,523
Hey, is Steve up yet?

306
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,696
-I thought he spent the night with you.
-No.

307
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,432
This lock's been cut.

308
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,003
I locked that last night.

309
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,939
-Oh, God.
-Oh, no.

310
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,948
Oh, God. Honey.

311
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,676
Will somebody call 91 1!

312
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,149
Stay with me, baby.

313
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:52,889
Just breathe.

314
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,762
Why would anyone wanna hurt Steve?

315
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,595
-lt was probably just some scavenger.
-No.

316
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,999
Steve was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

317
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,161
Ford.

318
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,202
-Hey.
-Hey.

319
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,402
Cilla, this is my mom, Cathy.

320
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,172
You poor dear.

321
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,838
Mom works here as a volunteer.

322
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,412
Your friend is in very capable hands.

323
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,352
Dr. Patel is operating,
but it's gonna be a few more hours.

324
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,553
Thank you, Mrs. Morrow.

325
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,921
-Please, call me Cathy.
-Cathy.

326
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,391
Thanks, Mom.

327
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,663
-And I'll call you if I hear anything.
-Thanks.

328
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,931
I'm gonna go back to your place and make
sure everything's okay. Are you okay?

329
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,767
-Okay. Thank you.
-Yeah, thanks.

330
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,365
-Bye.
-All right. See you later.

331
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,507
Ford, you don't need to stick around.

332
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,567
-I'm not leaving you alone.
-Okay.

333
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,873
May I help you?

334
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,882
-I'm looking for a Cilla McGowan.
-That's me.

335
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,583
-Ms. McGowan.
-Yes.

336
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,984
-I'm Detective Wilson.
-Nice to meet you.

337
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,682
-Hello, Al.
-Ford.

338
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,255
I'd like to speak to you alone.

339
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,325
-Fine, I'll go make a phone call.
-Thanks.

340
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:05,820
Okay.

341
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,092
What exactly is your relationship
to Mr. Chensky?

342
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,799
Exactly, we used to be married.

343
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:15,838
-Was Mr. Chensky jealous of Mr. Sawyer?
-Oh, no, no.

344
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,808
Steve absolutely idolizes Ford.

345
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,072
You know, you should
check into Mr. Hennessey

346
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,045
and see what he was doing last night.

347
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,843
Carl Hennessey? Why?

348
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,344
I had just planted some new trees
and somebody chose to chop them down.

349
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,254
Hennessey's van was parked
outside my house.

350
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,122
I confronted him about it. He spat at me.

351
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,724
-You know, Hennessey does have motive.
-What do you mean?

352
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,288
Well, his son died last year

353
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,631
and he still blames your grandmother
for what happened.

354
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,192
What happened?

355
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,270
You don't know
about your Uncle Johnnie's accident?

356
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,275
I know my Uncle Johnnie died in a car crash.

357
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:57,440
Well, Hennessey's son was in the car
with him and he was left a quadriplegic.

358
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,843
Oh, my God.

359
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,044
Your Uncle Johnnie was driving
and he was drunk.

360
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,989
So Hennessey blamed my grandmother
and now he blames me.

361
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,184
I'll talk to Hennessey.

362
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,751
In the meantime, I'll send a cruiser
past your place every couple of hours.

363
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,696
Thank you. Thank you.

364
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,635
You should probably get an alarm system.
Or a big dog.

365
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,695
I'll get an alarm system.

366
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,473
Less cleanup.

367
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,070
-Thanks, Al.
-See you, Ford.

368
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,642
Thank you.

369
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,741
Sleep at my house tonight.
I don't want you staying alone.

370
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,683
Oh, no. I'm gonna be sleeping in my house.

371
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,617
Fine. So will l, then.

372
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,812
In my own bag.

373
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,457
This is not negotiable.

374
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,661
You could put your sleeping bag
on the mattress next to me... Mine.

375
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:52,995
Okay.

376
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,766
You can turn around now.

377
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,398
I sleep in boxers.

378
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,269
I've seen boxers.

379
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,233
I'm not as decent as you.

380
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,404
Okay.

381
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,553
I've never seen those boxers before.

382
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,327
I get Prodigal swag for free.

383
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm glad you're here.

384
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,711
Glad to be here.

385
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,962
Good night.

386
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,630
Cilla. Cilla, over here. This way.

387
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,073
-Who are you looking for?
-Trudy.

388
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,272
But you are Trudy.

389
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,180
Of course.

390
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:50,118
But Janet's much more interesting. Here it is.

391
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,783
Oh, my.

392
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,629
Who did you kill that night, Janet or Trudy?

393
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,502
I'm pregnant.

394
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,615
I'm finally happy again.

395
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,544
Cilla!

396
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,795
Would you keep this here for me?

397
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,960
There are so many people
in and out of my house.

398
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,595
Sure.

399
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,766
"Trudy Hamilton."

400
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,508
That was my grandmother's real name.

401
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:53,312
It seems like the affair started just
about a few months before Johnnie died.

402
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:57,179
The last letter was mailed
and sent to The Little Farm

403
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,053
about a week before Janet killed herself.

404
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,325
They're all unsigned.

405
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:06,329
But they're all postmarked from around here.

406
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,554
He was married.

407
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,965
And Janet was carrying his baby.

408
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,900
If she was carrying his baby,

409
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,641
and if Janet knew she was pregnant,
why would she kill herself?

410
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,069
Maybe it was an accidental overdose.

411
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,273
Listen to this. The last one.

412
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:30,812
"This stops now. The calls to my wife,
the threats, the hysteria stops now.

413
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,320
"Whatever we had, it's over, Janet."

414
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,986
And there's a section...

415
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:40,997
"Don't threaten me again
or you will pay for it.

416
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,657
"l promise you."

417
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,768
What if she didn't commit suicide?

418
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,802
Wilson should have these.

419
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,674
No, not yet. Letters from Janet Hardy's lover.

420
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:56,670
No.

421
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:01,851
All that speculation, the press,
the obsessed fans.

422
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,320
My grandmother's name
would be dragged through the mud again.

423
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,587
And any chance that I had at a normal life
will go up in flames.

424
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:13,824
So for now, this will just be our little secret.

425
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,534
You wanna go get some ice cream?

426
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,931
You are a very confusing man, Ford.

427
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,902
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

428
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,571
-Thanks.
-That's Janet's granddaughter.

429
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,012
-Hi.
-Hi.

430
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,180
See what it's like being
Janet Hardy's granddaughter?

431
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,352
Complete strangers just stop you
and stare at you,

432
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,020
tell you that you remind them of her.

433
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,298
Do l? Am I like her?

434
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,059
I don't even know who I am.

435
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,665
Well, I'm not sure
what your grandmother was like,

436
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,536
but I'm getting to know you.

437
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,709
What, neurotic, self-doubting?

438
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,210
-And smart, self-assured. Driven.
-Okay, right.

439
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,815
-What do you think?
-Okay.

440
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:12,117
So, you want to replace
all the broken rosette medallions

441
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,889
-with these...
-Shamrocks.

442
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,588
-...shamrocks?
-Yes. Yes, they are lrish and lucky,

443
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:22,287
and I think my grandmother
would've gotten a big kick out of them.

444
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,064
What was she like, my grandma?

445
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,435
I remember her laugh.

446
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,869
She kind of lit the place up.

447
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:36,237
Do you remember any talk of her
getting friendly with a local man?

448
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,582
Lots of folks said all kinds of things.

449
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,619
Most of it wasn't even
in the same neighborhood as the truth.

450
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:49,083
"What distance is required
between masonry veneer and sheathing?"

451
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:54,297
All right, we've got, "A, five inches.

452
00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:00,202
"B, one inch. C, two inches."

453
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,036
All right, this one's easy.

454
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,041
I know you hate losing to a girl. Come on.

455
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,104
It's a no-brainer. Okay.

456
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,109
I'm going with one inch.

457
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,121
Come in.

458
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,485
This is really fantastic.

459
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,958
And extremely disappointing.

460
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,835
-You don't like it?
-I love it.

461
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,231
Means you won't be showering
at my place anymore.

462
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,437
I might.

463
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,744
If you ask nicely. Towel, please.

464
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,785
Thank you. This is huge.

465
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,588
-It's a beach towel.
-You said big.

466
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,385
A Prodigal towel.

467
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,022
I thought I might make you dinner tonight.

468
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,432
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.

469
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:07,460
I'm really nervous about that test.
It's coming up soon. I have to study for it.

470
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,005
Well, you can't study on an empty stomach.

471
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,813
Besides, I'm making
my number two specialty.

472
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,606
You all right?

473
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,644
Mac and cheese?

474
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,758
What's your third specialty, Lunchables?

475
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,155
You know when a guy offers
to cook dinner for you,

476
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,062
especially when your kitchen's a disaster,

477
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,763
I wouldn't complain.

478
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,540
Why are you doing all this for me?

479
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,973
Because I believe you matter.

480
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,376
That's the second time
you've said something to me

481
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,045
that nobody's ever said to me before.

482
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,083
What was the first?

483
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,757
That you wouldn't leave me alone.

484
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,366
Hey!

485
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,039
Hennessey! Hey!

486
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,303
-Get away. Get away.
-I've had enough of you!

487
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,540
You have hurt us enough.

488
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,982
I've hurt you?
What the hell are you talking about?

489
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,576
-You'll not get away with it.
-You almost killed Steve.

490
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,711
Do you know he's in the hospital?

491
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,483
-Stop spinning your lies to the police.
-Did you know that?

492
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,955
I'm not lying to the police.

493
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,549
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my house!

494
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,152
You stay away from everybody I know!

495
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,426
You stay away!

496
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,668
-Cathy, hi.
-Hello, Cilla.

497
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,581
-How are you?
-How's Steve?

498
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,640
-He's doing better, getting stronger.
-Yeah? Good.

499
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:06,347
-I'm Tom. Cathy's husband.
-Hello.

500
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,119
How's our son working out?
Is he doing the job for you?

501
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,024
Brian's doing fantastic.

502
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:15,156
So you are Tom. The Tom,
finally the real estate guru.

503
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,327
Maybe we could talk sometime
about the local market.

504
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,563
I'd love to find some fixer-uppers.

505
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:24,005
-Anytime, I'd love to help.
-Thank you.

506
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,339
You really are putting roots down.
That's fantastic.

507
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,572
Well, I better go see Steve.

508
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:35,452
But I'd love it if you two could drop by
and maybe see some of Brian's work.

509
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,216
Okay, I was hoping you'd invite us.
Take care. Be strong.

510
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,221
-All righty.
-Bye. Thanks.

511
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,890
The reason to make this place home
is because of people like the Morrows,

512
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:53,969
and Brian, Shanna and even cranky Buddy.

513
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,770
And Ford.

514
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:05,515
I know that I don't have the best track record

515
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,144
when it comes to relationships,
present company included,

516
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,920
but I really think I'm falling for this guy.

517
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,355
Damn.

518
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,930
Steve? Steve?
Steve, did you just say something?

519
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,495
Did you just talk? Talk to me, baby.

520
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,674
What are you doing here?

521
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,973
You're here, you're in Virginia.

522
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,637
-Oh, right.
-You're fine.

523
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,945
Everything's going to heal.
I'm so glad you're okay.

524
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:46,956
-ls my bike okay?
-Yeah. Your bike is perfect.

525
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,992
It's perfect. I already shipped it back to LA.

526
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,331
<i>Little Farm. I'm not here right now,</i>

527
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,343
<i>but you can leave
your message after the beep.</i>

528
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:13,942
<i>Hi. You didn't answer the door
and now you're not answering this,</i>

529
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,852
<i>so I'm wondering if I should worry
or be insanely jealous</i>

530
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,389
<i>because you ran off with someone.</i>

531
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,456
<i>Anyway, give me a call
so I know one way or the other.</i>

532
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:31,098
Man, you are so cute,
and if I wasn't so tired right now,

533
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,662
I'd go right on over there
and jump your bones.

534
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:53,118
They bypassed the alarm by busting the lock
off the cellar doors here.

535
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,989
Well, I'll get Brian
to wire the cellar doors, too.

536
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,087
Whoever did this knew
you were out of the house.

537
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,725
I strongly believe that Mr. Hennessey
had something to do

538
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,666
with my grandmother's death.

539
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,227
Your grandmother committed suicide.

540
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,501
Now they're all unsigned.
That could've been Hennessey.

541
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,443
The lower case Ys are really distinctive,
like little fish hooks.

542
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,345
I mean, it would be easy
to check his handwriting.

543
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,607
Yeah.

544
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,850
That would make Hennessey
and your grandmother lovers.

545
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,821
Think about it. I mean,
if Hennessey was sleeping with Janet

546
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,983
when his son was killed,
it would be a really heavy guilt trip.

547
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,495
The tenor of the letters,
they all changed after the accident.

548
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,327
Then Janet found out she was pregnant
and wanted to keep the baby.

549
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,460
Hennessey could've killed my grandmother
and made it look like a suicide.

550
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:42,096
Well, Hennessey claims he was at home
with his wife when Steve was attacked,

551
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,003
and she backs him up.

552
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,002
I'm gonna talk to them again.
And I'll get a writing sample.

553
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,344
Why am I still here?

554
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:57,219
I could go back to LA with Steve, make
a perfectly good living flipping houses.

555
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,119
Go is not an option.

556
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,187
You know you wanna stay.

557
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,592
Yeah, but what if it's a mistake?

558
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,957
I don't think so.

559
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,597
I think this house is worth fighting for.

560
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,038
Would...

561
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,117
Would you hold me for a little while, please?

562
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,111
Sure.

563
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,186
Thank you.

564
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:39,923
Better?

565
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,357
Yeah.

566
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,668
We'll figure it out. But not tonight.

567
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,306
Tonight we'll just lie here
and listen to the house settling

568
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:02,751
and the night, and the bugs.

569
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,288
Why aren't you in a relationship?

570
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,753
-Been saving myself.
-For what?

571
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,156
You.

572
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,025
What if I never came here?

573
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:23,332
Well, I'd have been a very lonely man.

574
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,170
Hennessey, open up!

575
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,938
Hi. Excuse me, I need to speak
with your husband, please.

576
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,417
-He isn't here.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

577
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,450
-Listen, little girl, you've got to stop this.
-Me?

578
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,183
-What the hell are you talking about?
-What?

579
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,124
-Lying to the police.
-No, no, tell your husband to stop.

580
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,060
-Stop what? My husband is a good man.
-Stop the vandalism, stop the attacks.

581
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,326
-Stop stalking me.
-Yeah, you, just go away, now.

582
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,196
-Do you know that your husband's a stalker?
-You and your kin

583
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,760
have done nothing
but bring us sorrow and misery.

584
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,913
That guy is absolutely crazy.

585
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,676
You do not come to my house

586
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,475
-and you do not talk to my wife.
-You are one crazy son of a bitch.

587
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:40,183
Hey! What are you doing?

588
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,582
Get back.

589
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,250
Stay down or I will need to keep you down!

590
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,383
I called the police.

591
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,791
I see you in there, Janet Hardy.

592
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,891
Take Mr. Hennessey to county.

593
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,095
He's absolutely crazy.

594
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,670
He thinks I'm Janet Hardy.

595
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,832
You better get that arm checked out
at the hospital.

596
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,637
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

597
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,474
It's all over now, Cilla. Hennessey's gone.

598
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,877
Come here.

599
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,675
Wow.

600
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,516
This is incredible.

601
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,432
Oh, my lord. She's a goddess.

602
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:34,000
-An ass-kicking goddess.
-She looks so strong and bold.

603
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,472
-And fierce and sexy.
-And nothing like me.

604
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,640
Where's this coming from?
I got all this from you.

605
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,444
I'm thinking about giving Brid a tattoo.

606
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,183
Wow. Celtic symbol of female power.

607
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:57,158
-Like Steve didn't tell you.
-No. Kismet.

608
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,189
All my life people have watched me,

609
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,699
took pictures of me, observed me.

610
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,904
And, I didn't have control over it.

611
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,935
This little tattoo is private.

612
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,208
I control who I share it with.

613
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,543
-I can change her face if you want.
-No, no, no.

614
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:24,053
I love being the inspiration
for a comic book heroine.

615
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:25,953
It's just...

616
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:32,454
I just think that the cup size
is a bit exaggerated, you know.

617
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,655
Well, let me get it right.

618
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,961
Let you see yourself as I do.

619
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,836
How do you...

620
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,064
-Just...
-Do you want me to pose like?

621
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,938
...make yourself comfortable.

622
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:49,501
-What, I'm not comfortable enough for you?
-Somewhat.

623
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,308
-Just lie back.
-How do you want...

624
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,719
Baby face, come here.

625
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,585
Nice.

626
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:09,864
You wanna move that leg up a little
and give me a little space?

627
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,568
That's nice.

628
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,965
Bring your hand up
above and next to the other arm.

629
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,939
-There?
-Yeah. Little more comfortable.

630
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,481
Beautiful.

631
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,758
So why a Celtic tattoo?

632
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,597
My grandmother's mother's name

633
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:56,106
was Annie Rose McKenna. She was lrish.

634
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,815
You're not gonna put the tattoo
on her behind, are you?

635
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,753
Sexy. Very sexy.

636
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,687
What about on her bicep?

637
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:18,627
-I can do that.
-Like a real superhero.

638
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,662
-Done and done.
-Thank you.

639
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,163
-Fabulous.
-Can I see it?

640
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,870
-Sure.
-It's ready?

641
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,821
I have had my picture
taken about a zillion times

642
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,958
and nobody's ever actually captured me.

643
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,612
We should do that again sometime soon.

644
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:54,054
At least try, if you can manage.

645
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,685
Well, the first time
I was only going about 75%.

646
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,656
Now for round two.

647
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,700
Oh, no, that's my alarm.

648
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,738
My truck!

649
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,538
Ford? Just stop it!

650
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:26,313
Oh, man, my tires.
Ford. Ford, they slashed my tires.

651
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,124
They keyed
the whole entire side of the truck.

652
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:32,093
-What the hell's that?
-What?

653
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,630
It's me.

654
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,033
It's a Katie Lawrence doll.

655
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,038
My God.

656
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,545
This is what they wanna do to me.

657
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,149
Give me that.

658
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,144
-It's not over.
-Come here.

659
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:13,266
We'll take the doll in and see
if we can pull any evidence from it.

660
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,134
Has anyone else threatened you
or treated you oddly?

661
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,107
I've gotten some looks, stares, comments.

662
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,278
I'll double the drive-bys
and park a cruiser out front.

663
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:27,043
-Well, where was Mrs. Hennessey?
-We're looking for her.

664
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,523
There you are.

665
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,762
-Can I get a hit of your coffee?
-Sure.

666
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,704
Sitting here, for the first time,

667
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,306
I can see why she felt the way she did
about it here.

668
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,171
I feel it, too.

669
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:05,553
That's 'cause you're not just rebuilding
a house, you're bringing it back to life.

670
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,320
As a tribute to my grandmother.

671
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:12,593
But it's really... It's for me, too.

672
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,600
Morning, Alvin.

673
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,302
-Morning.
-Morning.

674
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,845
Forensics couldn't lift any prints
from the doll,

675
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,881
but we found some residual cornstarch.

676
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,542
-Cornstarch?
-Modified cornstarch.

677
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,744
Whoever did this to your car
was wearing latex gloves.

678
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,981
They're very common,
but we're looking into it.

679
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,147
Good.

680
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,015
And we found Mrs. Hennessey.

681
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,685
She was staying down at a motel
near the prison.

682
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,956
She was visiting her husband.

683
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,623
She's back, so I'm gonna pay her a visit.

684
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,496
-Thank you.
-See you.

685
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,763
-Have a good day.
-You, too.

686
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,695
Hey, shouldn't you be getting going?

687
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,476
Excuse me.

688
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:06,946
-ls this the Contractor's License exam?
-Yes, ma'am. Take a seat.

689
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,817
Gentlemen.

690
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,817
Wow. Things are looking up, huh?

691
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,927
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

692
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:32,873
Okay. All right, everyone, you got two hours
before the break. Good luck.

693
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,777
I am Contractor Girl.

694
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,441
To your success.

695
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,846
No. Yeah, I can't...

696
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,335
So I've been doing some detective work.

697
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,743
After the test,
I went down to the Hall of Records.

698
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,807
Look what I found.

699
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,407
That's Janet Hardy's autopsy report.

700
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,580
"Janet Hardy was a 38-year-old
Caucasian woman,

701
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:55,021
"died of acute combined drug
and alcohol intoxication.

702
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,458
"The manner of death
is determined to be accident."

703
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,258
There's no mention of a pregnancy. Look.

704
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:06,231
It's possible that Janet lied
about being pregnant.

705
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,896
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

706
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,903
Excuse me. Dr. Rice?

707
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,773
-Do I know you?
-No.

708
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,312
But my grandmother was Janet Hardy.

709
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,473
Here, look at this.

710
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:26,882
You examined her heart, her stomach,
her blood.

711
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,254
How did you miss the pregnancy?

712
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:38,433
Look, I was persuaded
to leave that detail out of my official report.

713
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:42,528
-By whom?
-I got a frantic phone call.

714
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,703
It was the publicist who called me.

715
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,039
She begged me not to note the pregnancy.

716
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,110
Why would you listen to her?

717
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,343
The way I saw it,
the only victim of my omission

718
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,180
was the unborn baby.

719
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,982
Unless Janet didn't kill herself,
then they're both victims.

720
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:05,391
Young lady, I didn't see any hand
in Janet Hardy's death except her own.

721
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:11,231
If Janet's publicist knew she was pregnant,
she probably knew she was having an affair.

722
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,666
-Let me try something.
-Who're you calling?

723
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,904
<i>-Hello.
-Mom, it's Cilla. Yes.</i>

724
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,133
No, I know you're busy.

725
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:24,842
I know, I just have to ask you
one quick question.

726
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,915
Who was grandmother's publicist
when she died?

727
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,351
<i>She had the same publicist her whole life.
It was George.</i>

728
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,686
<i>-Who?
-You don't remember?</i>

729
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,621
-Are you sure?
-You're coming to...

730
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,663
No, I don't wanna fly there
and be in your show.

731
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,358
<i>-Okay? I'm sorry.
-You should be in my show.</i>

732
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,760
Did you know that Grandma was pregnant
when she died?

733
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,868
Or that she was having an affair?

734
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,533
<i>-You are obsessed.
-Mom. I'm not obsessed, Mom.</i>

735
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:55,338
<i>-Yes, you are.
-Mom?</i>

736
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,471
Okay.

737
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,476
I come from a dysfunctional family.

738
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,884
Well, that was interesting.

739
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:09,721
So, it couldn't have been Janet's publicist
that called Dr. Rice.

740
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,324
Janet's publicist was a man.

741
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,822
Mrs. Hennessey.

742
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,571
-Mrs. Hennessey, please.
-Haven't you done enough?

743
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,606
No. Listen,
let's just stop this craziness, okay?

744
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,700
-Just go away.
-I'm not going anywhere.

745
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:30,211
Mrs. Hennessey, what happened
to your son's a tragedy, but...

746
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,873
But it was an accident
that I had nothing to do with.

747
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,383
Mrs. Hennessey, please.
When my grandmother died,

748
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,646
was it you that called Dr. Rice?

749
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:41,821
Mrs. Hennessey, please.

750
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,253
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

751
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,765
Just need to mail this to the publisher.
I'll be right back.

752
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:52,960
Okay.

753
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,182
I'm sorry.

754
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:12,643
-Oh, sorry. You okay?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm fine.

755
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,919
I saw Ford's truck
and my office is right there.

756
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,524
Okay.

757
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,687
-And following up on our conversation...
-Cool.

758
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,429
...current comps and listings.

759
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:26,334
That's great.

760
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,966
This soft market is a great opportunity.

761
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,063
Well, I will check it out.

762
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,841
She's not selling you Little Farm, Tom.

763
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,706
-Now, look at you.
-We're talking about

764
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:36,506
future business ventures, okay?

765
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,912
-I'll see you kids later.
-Okay. Have a great day.

766
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,844
-Get out of here.
-Get out of here, you.

767
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:49,183
This is what I was telling you about.

768
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,425
All up here, original plaster, man.

769
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,726
Oh, look at the little shamrocks. I love them.

770
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,963
The parties, they were so much fun.

771
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,101
I especially remember
that last Christmas party.

772
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,945
That's the last time I was here.

773
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,148
All the decorations.

774
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,515
Oh, and the lights.

775
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,323
<i>They were all over.</i>

776
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,424
And music.

777
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:27,953
Oh, the music.

778
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:35,468
Oh, and the amazing pink couch right here.

779
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:42,575
And Janet in her sexy blue dress.

780
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:47,814
Everybody just begged her to sing.

781
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:56,317
There was a box
baby grand piano over there.

782
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,294
Oh, and who was it...

783
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:05,699
Everybody thought she was having an affair
with a composer.

784
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:09,837
-Lenny Eisner.
-Lenny Eisner. Right.

785
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:15,237
But then it turned out that he was gay.

786
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,050
It was happier times.

787
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,185
It was...

788
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:32,685
It was that Christmas, too,
before Johnnie's death.

789
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,601
I'm sorry.

790
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,634
I took a morbid turn.

791
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:55,312
Old houses, they're full of life and death.

792
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:04,559
Cathy, do you remember

793
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:11,931
Janet having an affair with some...
A local married man?

794
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,825
Somebody local?

795
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,269
I don't know, honey.

796
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,171
No jealous wives beating her door down?

797
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,438
Not that I ever heard of.

798
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,508
Okay.

799
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,418
You are so very much
like your grandmother.

800
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:38,518
Your spunk and your determination.

801
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:43,793
And all these horrible things
keep happening to you, but you stay.

802
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:53,202
I think your grandmother
would be very, very proud of you.

803
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,275
Maybe you could help me with something.

804
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,573
I'm just trying to put names to all the faces.

805
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:06,519
Why, honey, that's Big Drew Morrow,
Brian's grandfather.

806
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,682
He died about 20 years ago.

807
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,553
Sweet. Look at him.

808
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:17,798
-Hey.
-Hi.

809
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,698
-What's the matter?
-I'm depressed.

810
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:26,099
I thought I found out something,
but it was just another dead end.

811
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:34,142
Well, let me make you feel better.

812
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,109
Sit.

813
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,146
Okay.

814
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,980
Close your eyes.

815
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,889
Close them.

816
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:49,386
-Can I open them now? I hate surprises.
-Not yet.

817
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,467
Can I open my eyes, please?

818
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:54,798
Open them.

819
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,673
Oh, my gosh.

820
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,100
It's fantastic.

821
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,946
-Wow.
-You're the first to see it.

822
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,986
It's such a work of art.

823
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,718
"Her quest had taken her far away."

824
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,285
I couldn't have done it without you.

825
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,858
Seriously, I had nothing
before you came here

826
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,663
and started swinging your sledgehammer.

827
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,738
Be mine.

828
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,714
Be your what?

829
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,713
My family.

830
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:47,781
Ford, please don't do this.

831
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,958
Look, I draw comics and I play video games.

832
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,460
But I make a pretty decent living.

833
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:58,055
I'm a fairly good cook
if you like steak and Mac and cheese.

834
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:00,331
Which I think you do.

835
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:05,272
Ford, listen to me.

836
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,732
You're steady.

837
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,210
I'm disordered.

838
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:13,912
All right?

839
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,443
Yeah.

840
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,854
-Marry me.
-Okay.

841
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:25,818
Look. I am a third-generation screw-up
when it comes to men.

842
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,193
My grandmother, complete disaster.

843
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:32,098
My mother,
my mother has been married five times.

844
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:36,063
Yeah, five husbands. Five.

845
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,035
Can you believe it?
Me, I was even married once

846
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:42,839
for like five minutes.
Trust me, save yourself a lot of heartache.

847
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,140
Open it.

848
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,141
It's not poisonous, I swear.

849
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:59,784
You don't wear a lot of jewelry.
When you do, you don't go in for the flash.

850
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,389
You're not the type of girl who's gonna
impress the other girls with a big, fat rock.

851
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:06,992
And you work with your hands,
so that had to be considered.

852
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:10,003
You put a lot of thought into it.

853
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,535
It's not that hard.

854
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:17,970
All right, say I said, "Yes, yes,"
you know, "Let's get married,

855
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,811
"let's go to Vegas,
like my grandmother and my mother,

856
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,443
"let's go to The Little Chapel of Love."

857
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:26,317
You pack the bags, I'll book the flights.

858
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:31,453
What is wrong with you?
You're making my head spin here.

859
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:35,019
You're not thinking about any practicality
or the reality of the situation.

860
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:37,190
-Like what?
-Like where would we live?

861
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,724
-The Little Farm.
-Okay, what would we do with this house?

862
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,828
This house I bought as is.

863
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,338
You've made a home for yourself
at The Little Farm.

864
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,573
Let me into your home, Cilla.

865
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:01,247
-I'm drowning here.
-I just wanna try it on.

866
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:02,722
It's pretty.

867
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,553
Okay.

868
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,026
-Okay.
-Okay?

869
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,396
-Okay.
-Okay.

870
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:19,398
-Oh, great, an audience.
-I need my construction gloves.

871
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,306
Yeah, you big toughie.

872
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,744
Would you focus on the mattress?

873
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,045
I can't focus on anything else.

874
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:32,149
This is just ridiculous.

875
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,378
Let's not forget,
I taught Brid everything that she knows.

876
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,316
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

877
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,948
Ford! Ford!

878
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:46,925
What does it say?

879
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,631
"Leave or die."

880
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,460
Put it in the van for me.

881
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,241
I'm sending this doll to Forensics.

882
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:03,573
We found a couple of footprints in the mud
near the kitchen.

883
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:07,013
They're small like a boy's
or a woman's prints.

884
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,846
-What about Mrs. Hennessey?
-I sent a car to check on her.

885
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:13,251
Whoever's doing this is coming
in your house while you're at home.

886
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,085
I wouldn't stay here anymore.

887
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:18,024
-Well, we can stay at my house.
-That's a good idea.

888
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,687
Good news is, they're getting sloppy.

889
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,659
We're gonna get them.

890
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,767
Hey, Sam, did you get your note?

891
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:32,429
Guess we shouldn't have brought
the mattress over here.

892
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,272
<i>Unit 11, Unit 11, come in.</i>

893
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:46,546
<i>-What's your 20, 11?
-I'm about...</i>

894
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:59,058
-I believe in love.
-Love never made you happy.

895
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,864
But it gave me Johnnie and Dilly.

896
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,607
And this one.

897
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,408
Maybe this one will be another boy.

898
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:18,212
Who's the father?

899
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,149
Did he hurt you?

900
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,088
He loved me.

901
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,227
-Did the baby ruin everything?
-Not my baby, Cilla.

902
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,096
Her baby.

903
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,701
His wife was pregnant?

904
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,799
You've read all the letters.

905
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,302
What's his name?

906
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,178
-Janet, tell me his name.
-Pay attention.

907
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,380
You have the answer.

908
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,153
Morning.

909
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,823
Can't you ever sleep in?

910
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:04,093
Had another dream last night.
I missed something.

911
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:11,634
"l have my wife, my children,
and the one on the way to think about."

912
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,332
His wife was pregnant, too.

913
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,502
The guy was a baby factory.

914
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,948
And the kid would be about 35 now.

915
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,711
My age.

916
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,412
We have to find out who was born
in the months following her death.

917
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:29,082
We'll know exactly who the father was.

918
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,991
Monday we could drive up to Richmond
and look at the birth records.

919
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,052
What about your yearbook?

920
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,562
The kids had to be in your class.

921
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,296
-You're good.
-You think?

922
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:44,134
Robert Mach, Mark McCorkle.

923
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,633
They moved out of town.

924
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,272
Okay, Denise Messenger.

925
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:50,538
She's gone.

926
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,979
Brian Morrow. Even Brian's the right age.

927
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,681
About half the class is.

928
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,650
You were a math nerd?

929
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,952
Algebra tutor and great kisser.

930
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:12,499
And there's Janet and Johnnie
and that's Hennessey's son.

931
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,902
There's Tom. That must be Cathy.

932
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:20,234
I hardly recognize her.

933
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,745
This must be the last Christmas party
before Johnnie died.

934
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:26,212
They all look so young and happy.

935
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,251
Oh, that must be Brian. Go.

936
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,516
-No.
-Come on, go, have fun.

937
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,618
-Go.
-I'm not leaving you here alone.

938
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,818
-I'm fine.
-Brian will understand.

939
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,726
No, Brian's gonna blame me. Go.

940
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,093
All right.

941
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:45,133
But lock the door behind me
and set my alarm.

942
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,725
And if anything happens you call me.

943
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,827
I promise. Okay?

944
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,032
Scram!

945
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,409
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Ford.

946
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,560
Hello?

947
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,461
Ford?

948
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:26,472
I'm out.

949
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,170
Come on, we're just teasing.

950
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,836
Anyone want another beer?

951
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,204
What the heck, bro.

952
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,875
Okay, you're living on the edge, huh?

953
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:37,578
Hello?

954
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,183
Hello?

955
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,294
Wait one sec.

956
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,835
Cathy, you frightened me.

957
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,970
-I'm so sorry to bother you.
-It's okay.

958
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,703
I went by your house first
and then I saw the light on here.

959
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,007
I lost one of my rings
and it was my grandmother's.

960
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,810
That's terrible.

961
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:10,783
I took it off when I washed my hands
in your powder room.

962
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,820
Okay, I don't remember seeing it.

963
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,550
The place is a real mess,
but let's go down there,

964
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,216
Iet's look for it.

965
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,693
-Thank you so much, sweetheart.
-Don't worry about it.

966
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:24,459
I've had my ring for a few days.
If I had lost it, I would go berserk.

967
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,364
What? What ring?

968
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:31,300
Well, Ford has asked me to marry him.

969
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,106
Oh, that's beautiful.

970
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,876
Oh, I can't believe I didn't notice that.

971
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,576
We're gonna live here at The Little Farm.

972
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:46,087
And it looks like
we're gonna be staying for a while.

973
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,279
-What was that?
-I don't know.

974
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,347
-Did you hear that?
-Okay...

975
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:53,986
Come on. All right, I don't know what it was.
Come on, let's get in there.

976
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,821
You can't hide in there all night.

977
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,356
I'm just looking to delay
losing the rest of my money.

978
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:04,463
-Well, that's inevitable. Come on back.
-We miss you, man.

979
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,677
-Let me just run and see.
-All right.

980
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,087
-I found it.
-Great.

981
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,423
Thank goodness.

982
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,869
Look at me, I'm shaking.

983
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,335
Oh, it's beautiful.

984
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:39,601
Cilla, could I trouble you for a glass of wine

985
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,939
and maybe an Aspirin?

986
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:45,175
-I've got such a headache now.
-Of course.

987
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,107
The kitchen's right that way.

988
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,946
I think there's already an open bottle
of wine. I'll get your Aspirin.

989
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:53,215
-All right, thank you.
-No problem. Help yourself.

990
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:05,360
Hi. You found it.

991
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,468
Yeah. Here.

992
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,637
I'd like to make a little toast.

993
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,607
To you and Ford,

994
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,711
may you have a long and happy life together.

995
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:21,713
Thank you.

996
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,993
Please excuse this mess.

997
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:36,196
I have been sorting through
all of these images, old and new,

998
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,960
just trying to tell the right stories.

999
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:43,601
The house and my grandmother's life.

1000
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:46,070
What a wonderful idea.

1001
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,273
What's up?

1002
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,917
-You had an affair with Janet Hardy.
-What?

1003
01:20:56,985 --> 01:21:00,250
Cilla found your letters.
The handwriting matches.

1004
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:06,625
I love Brian and Cathy. That's why
I'm talking to you before I go to the police.

1005
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,522
With what, a bunch of unsigned letters?

1006
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:12,089
Never said they were unsigned, Tom.

1007
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:25,902
Look, I was mesmerized by her.

1008
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,777
I betrayed my wife.

1009
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:35,883
And when I heard from Brian
that things were found,

1010
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,652
personal things...

1011
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,691
You went to Cilla's house
and nearly killed Steve?

1012
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:44,254
I never meant to hit him that hard.

1013
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,361
Did you kill Janet Hardy?

1014
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,299
You all look so happy.

1015
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:50,128
Look at Tom.

1016
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,035
He was so handsome.

1017
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,500
He means everything to me.

1018
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,081
You got the timing mixed up.

1019
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:07,220
The couch wasn't pink.

1020
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,783
She must've bought that
after that Christmas.

1021
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:13,453
And she's not wearing the blue dress.

1022
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:16,697
Marriages are tenuous things.
They take work.

1023
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:20,458
There wasn't anything
I wouldn't do to keep Tom.

1024
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,662
I'd do anything to keep him.

1025
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:29,643
I starved myself, exercised,
liposuction, facelift.

1026
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,875
Tom would never look at me

1027
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:39,046
and want another woman again.

1028
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:41,748
Again?

1029
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,219
Again.

1030
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:49,457
You...

1031
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:51,893
Cilla?

1032
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:55,063
You okay?

1033
01:22:55,136 --> 01:23:00,335
That wine must've went straight to my head.
I have to get something to eat.

1034
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,969
-I just have to get something to eat.
-Here. No, it's all right.

1035
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:07,071
Come on, sit here.
I think you need to drink the rest of that.

1036
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:10,413
Oh, I better not.

1037
01:23:11,686 --> 01:23:12,948
I insist.

1038
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,718
Just a little more.

1039
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,753
Finish the job.

1040
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,825
I went to her house.

1041
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:30,734
She said that she was keeping the baby
and we argued.

1042
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:39,036
But, I swear to you, she was alive when I left.

1043
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:42,581
I couldn't kill Janet.

1044
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,544
She was carrying my child.

1045
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:49,123
Janet called your house.

1046
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:54,020
Yes. She spoke with Cathy.

1047
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,928
Oh, my God. What did she do?

1048
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,696
Cilla's at my house alone.
You call the police.

1049
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:07,468
You...

1050
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,276
You put something in my drink.

1051
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:21,114
Yeah. Yeah.

1052
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,051
Seconal.

1053
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:26,927
Same as your whore of a grandmother.

1054
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:29,329
The pictures.

1055
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:34,900
You were remembering the pink couch
the night she died,

1056
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:38,402
not the night of the party.

1057
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,499
Aren't you a little smarty-pants.

1058
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,735
Oh, no, you don't. No.

1059
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:49,811
Just relax, dear.

1060
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:57,090
Soon you'll pass out just like Janet did.

1061
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,426
And then...

1062
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:10,161
I'll help you to another drink or two or ten.

1063
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,513
Come on, Cilla, pick up.

1064
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:28,588
I don't think
you wanna be disturbed tonight.

1065
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:37,858
Janet.

1066
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,366
She could've had anybody.

1067
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:45,929
But she took my husband.

1068
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:49,742
And she made a fool out of me.

1069
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,578
I didn't have anything to do...

1070
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:58,017
You came back
and you shoved it in my face!

1071
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:06,049
You know, I tried to get you to leave.

1072
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,662
Yeah, I cut down your trees,

1073
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:14,064
destroyed your truck.

1074
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:26,775
If only you had gone away.

1075
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:39,555
Why couldn't you let this house die?

1076
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,504
Cilla? Cilla?

1077
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:56,543
Cilla! Cilla!

1078
01:26:58,313 --> 01:26:59,473
Cilla!

1079
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:12,023
I'm sorry.

1080
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:15,024
I tried to help you.

1081
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:17,821
You did, honey.

1082
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:20,260
Help me. Help me.

1083
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,331
But I couldn't save you.

1084
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,533
Save yourself, Cilla.

1085
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:34,006
All right. That's it.

1086
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:37,043
Cilla.

1087
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,717
Missy-May.

1088
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:46,259
Go to sleep.

1089
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,086
Save yourself.

1090
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,266
Go to sleep.

1091
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:26,693
Cilla!

1092
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:29,596
Tom?

1093
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:45,278
Cilla? Cilla.

1094
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:47,418
Cilla?

1095
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:50,683
-You move again, I'll shoot you.
-Ford, it wasn't me.

1096
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:53,520
It wasn't me. I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

1097
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:56,188
It was her. It was her. It was her.

1098
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:58,330
Cilla, come on.

1099
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,333
-Come here, baby.
-Ford,

1100
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:02,198
I did it like Brid.

1101
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:06,005
I CSI'd her ass.

1102
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:09,970
Cilla.

1103
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,774
Cilla, stay awake, baby.

1104
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:17,410
Come on, baby, help's coming.

1105
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:23,052
Come on, stay awake.

1106
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,887
-Cilla. Stay with me, baby.
-I did good.

1107
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:12,963
We have to be at Brian's in an hour.

1108
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:16,276
Well, if we've got an hour, let me draw you.

1109
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:21,310
The last time you drew me,
I think it took a little more than an hour.

1110
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:26,215
Well, we can skip the preliminaries
