25
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,418
- Do you have any dreams for the future?

26
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,573
- Well... I don't know. 

27
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,539
- What would you like to do after the war?

28
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,752
- In addition to visiting parks of course.

29
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,091
- Play the piano.

30
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,953
- And draw.
- So you are an artist?

31
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,392
- Nah.
- In the Louvre:

32
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,489
- all the great artists and then Laaksonen, eh?

33
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,994
- Nobody from my town never even visited Paris.

34
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,511
- But think about it. A grand opening. 
You'll invite me to there as well.

35
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,080
- There I will be telling everyone how I know you.

36
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,212
- You must have big dreams in life.

37
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,871
- The Eastern Front will fall. 
We will be relocated there soon.

38
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,729
- There are just so many Russians. Way too many.

39
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,555
- I will tell the boys that they must dream big..

40
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,578
- ..and think about victory. 

41
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,955
- Oh well. 

42
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,377
- Captain. Heikki.

43
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,117
- You can keep it.

44
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,553
- Let's go.

45
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,656
- Good morning.
- Morning.

46
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,952
- I spoke with my boss.

47
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,290
- He promissed you could try working at the firm.

48
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,771
- What do you mean?
- I showed him your art work.

49
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,298
- That landspace that you painted for dad. 

50
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,049
- He will probably change his mind when he sees me.

51
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,178
- We really need the money. 

52
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,772
- Your veteran discount isn't helping much. 

53
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,914
- Do you have any idea how expensive 
cheese is in the black market?

54
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,949
- Do you feel better?

55
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,120
- You are starting to look like youself again.
- Oh really?

56
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,830
- A little. You do distantly resemble my brother.  

57
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,735
- I got a straight flush.
- What do you mean by that?

58
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,317
- I crossed over everyone I know who 
quit smoking since the war began.

59
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,811
-Born in 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925.

60
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,859
- Dear brother, the war is over.

61
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,354
- A fucking Russian.

62
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,799
- Touko. Touko.

63
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,919
- I'm here, you have nothing to worry about.

64
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,411
- Listen, don't worry. 

65
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,793
- Nothing to worry?

66
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,679
- Nothing to worry, nothing.

67
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,972
- What would I have to be worried about?

68
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,336
- Give me one as well. 

69
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,529
- You just need to find someone.

70
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,538
- Someone to look after you. Someone special.

71
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,436
- I had someone special during the war.

72
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,860
- Oh really? What happened?

73
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,575
- As usually happens during a war. 

74
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,496
- She was a war nurse?
- No. 

75
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,795
- You are not in your right mind.

76
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,678
- It's because the war. But it will pass.

77
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,250
- You just need to get a job and meet new people.

78
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,360
- Many girls would be interested of 
a handsome Officer such as you.

79
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,939
- You received the medal because you fought bravely. 

80
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:03,263
- Right?

81
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,691
- I guess.
- Just get a hold of yourself and start living your life. 

82
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,635
- Good night.

83
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,391
- Good night. 

84
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:11,495


85
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,430
- He is a fagg!

86
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,574
- Get out now. Or I'm calling the police.

87
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,253
- Learn to behave.

88
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,331
- You will be banned for a month. At least!

89
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,271
- Better make it lifelong. 

90
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,413
- Thanks love.

91
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,251
- What's your name?
- Nipa.

92
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,490
- Would you like to see something?
- I would prefer doing something.

93
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,417
- Wow.

94
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,972
- Can I keep this?

95
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,815
- Stop!
- Police! 

96
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,739

97
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,613

99
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,217
- You two in there! Stop that immediately!

100
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,500
- Stop!
- I got one. 

101
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,897
- We are the police, stay still.
- Get him!

102
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,533
- And who do we have here?
- Good evening. What is going on in here?

103
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,519
- We are cleansing the park from criminals. 

104
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,417
- Why does it need be cleansed?
- For the Olympics.

105
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,309
- I see. Are you interested in spearing, stake jumping.. 

106
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,834
- ..or perhaps a friend of wrestling?
- Well I am interested in spear throwing.

107
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,695
- Good. Hurry then. Before the they arrive.

108
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,091

109
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,774

112
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,811
- Fantastically. 
- Great.

113
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,696
- Let's go.

114
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,954
- Laaksonen.
- I can't show this to the client.

115
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,391
- Make something out of it.

116
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,815
- Jansson, about this winter's long johns -campaign.

117
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,552
- What is your situation with that?

118
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,913
- Excuse me.

119
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,531
- Could you come with me for a moment, please? 

120
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,371
- If you could sit down.

121
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,137
- Maria, can I borrow you for a moment as well?

122
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,498
- Just a moment.

123
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,632
- Um..

124
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,459
- Look into the eyes. No, not mine. Each others.

125
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,538
- Good. Now think about a morning..

126
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,256
- The first morning after you first, you know.

127
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,814
- Think naughty things. 

128
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,514
- Now think about how it feels to touch one another.

129
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,857
- Just like that. Gabriel, think a little further.

130
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,976
- Touch each other so you feel the sparks.

131
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,093
- Good.

132
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,893
- Guess what?
- What?

133
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,198
- Our boss said he is very satified with you.
- Oh great.

134
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,809
- What are you doing?
- Work. Just work.

135
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,918
- Promoting the sales of useless products with immoral means. 

136
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,780
- Ha-ha. Show me. 

137
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,880
- I won't.
- Are you afraid that I'll laugh?

138
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,894
- No, don't.
- But I'll promise.

139
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,178
- I'll have a look.
- No.

140
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,890
- What is it?

141
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,917
- Have a seat.

142
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:50,439
- Sit!

143
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,277
- Would you sit already!

144
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,278
- No, please don't. 

145
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,059
- Don't be like that! You have a beautiful face.
- No I don't.

146
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,229
- You do. Let me. 

147
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,779
- Well?
- I'm done.

148
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,815
- I'm not sure if I want to see it. 

149
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,071
- I don't look like that. 
- I think you do.

150
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,730
- I'm not that pretty. 
- You are.

151
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,471
- Those legs?

152
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,954
- You never learned how to draw legs. Those look like sticks.

153
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:43,055
- Let me show you how it's done. 
Can you hand me the drawing pad?

154
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,192
- Well?

155
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,572
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

156
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,550
- Be careful not to break a sweat. 

157
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,295
- Ten seconds.
- No, no..

158
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,713
- Ready..
- No, not yet.

159
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,738
- Set, go!
- Go!

160
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,950
- You are incredibly good. 
- No, I'm not. 

161
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,753
- But you are.

162
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,035
- I have been thinking, that maybe sometime..

163
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,053
- ..someday, I would have my own exhibition. 

164
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,759
- Why someday? Why not tomorrow?
- No.

165
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,173
- What kind of artist you are..

166
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,333
- ..if nobody sees your work?
- Nobody wants to see them anyway.

167
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,269
- Look who's talking. You won't show your work even to me.

168
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,620


169
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,244


170

178
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:09,804
<i>- Passports please.</i> 

179
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,269

181
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,859
<i>- Are you lost?</i>

182
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,552
<i>- How is the pheasant hunting?</i>

183
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,936


184
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,519
<i>- You should ask him.
- Thank you.</i>

185
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,993
<i>- In English or German?</i>
- Depends.

186
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,215


187
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,014


188

191
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,719


192
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,958


193
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,611


194
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,051


195
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,431


196
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,551


197
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,555


198
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,979


199
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,675
<i>- Are you going out?</i>

200
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,459


201
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,433

204
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,338
- Name three different streets..

205
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,677
- ..that across with Helsinginkatu and Runeberginkatu.

206
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,255
- Apollonkatu, Hesperiankatu and Topeliuksenkatu.

207
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,134
- If you are originally from Kaarina, 
why don't you speak a dialect?

208
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,717
- My parents were teachers. 
This is how we spoke at home.

209
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,659
- Why there was an unknown man in your room..

210
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,290
- ..who also, according to you, stole 
your travel documents and wallet?

211
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,179
- We were discussing about pheasant hunting.

212
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,489
- Is this yours?

213
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,340
- It was found in your room.

214
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,974
- I'm going to return to Finland..

215
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:03,659
- ..and based on these answers, I cannot 
confirm that you are a citizen of Finland.

216
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,020
- The Germans will see you as a 
spy or at least as a criminal.

217
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,576
- But I know what you are..

218
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,635
- ..and I'll report back to counsil..

219
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,011
- ..that the man the Germans arrested is not Finnish.

220
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:27,338
- I will leave you here for them to interrogate you.

221
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,216
- Heikki.

222
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,849

223
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,098

224
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,536
- Worked in the air force of Helsinki during the war.

225
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,930
- What about him?
- I know him.

226
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,575
- Could a meeting be arranged?
- Regarding what?

227
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,969
- Pheasant hunting.

228
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,374


229
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,410


230
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,258


231
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,712
- Do you know this man?
- No. 

232
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,850
- I'm Lieutenant Laaksonen.

233
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,271
- We fought together in Sky Observation park in Helsinki.

234
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,976
- There were some close calls.

235
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,632
- There were no battles in there!

236
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,536
- I meant the air forces in Helsinki during the war.

237
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,791
- We fought together. I served under you command.

238
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,733
- I see.

239
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,689
<i>- Could you give us a moment alone?</i>

240
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,498
<i>- Certainly.</i>

241
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,836
- Is this a somekind of a trap?

242
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,438
- Are you trying to get me caught?
- I'm the one trapped here. 

243
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,077
- How did you know I'm in Germany?
- I didn't.

244
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,391
- Your name was merely mentioned.

245
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,173
- I see. 

246
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,630
- We know each other, right? We are both..
- Shh, please. 

247
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,956
- Both war officers. 

248
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,113
- This is ridiculous. Such a fuss over nothing!

249
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,331
- You are creating this yourself. 
With drawings such as this.

250
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,053
- It's a piece of paper!

251
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,859
- A naughty picture somebody drew for amusement.

252
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,818
- It is not just a piece of paper!

253
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,853
- It's an atomic bomb which can land you in jail.

254
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,431
- There will be an investigation. 
They will search your home.

255
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,135
- They will interrogate your
family members and co-workers.

256
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,395
- I don't care about what happens to me. But my family..

257
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,880
- Could you help me out?
- I can't. 

258
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:41,535
- Okay. Let's make a deal. 
- You have to swear on your officer honor..

259
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,733
- ..that you have never done anything inglorious.

260
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,257
<i>- Gentlemen.</i>

261
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,536
<i>- Mr. Laaksonen here is..</i>

262
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,290
<i>- ..an honorable Finnish war Officer.</i>

263
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,299
<i>- Let's hear from Mr. Laaksonen.</i>

264
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,779
<i>- Yes. I thank you.</i>

265
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,172
<i>- And..</i>

266
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,359
<i>- I didn't do anything wrong.</i>

267
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,815
<i>- We are happy to help Finnish nation.</i>

268
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,256
<i>- The case is closed.</i>

269
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,553
<i>- Thank you.</i>

270
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,932
- Mr. Laaksonen, my wife and I would be..

271
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,575
- ..delighted to have you over for a lunch sometime. 

272
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,396
- Are you married?
- Of course.

273
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:56,500
- I live in Helsinki and sometimes invite the 
right kind of people over for a small party.

274
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,156
- You could join us sometime.

275
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,416
- It needs to be kept low-key. 

276
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,491
- Artists are always welcome. 
- Thank you.

277
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,072
- My wife is very understading about the matter.

278
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,633
- Hey.

279
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,860
- Did you enjoy your time in Berlin?
Did you bring any souvenirs?

280
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,575
- They didn't get past the Customs.

281
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,895
- What are you wearing?
- It's a new hobby of mine.

282
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,196
- What?
- You were the one who told me to have fun and live my life.

283
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,811
- I found a tenant for us, who will be here shortly.

284
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,534
- Some religious girl from the countryside?

285
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,499
- No need to get up for me. I'm 
Touko Laaksonen, Kaija's brother.

286
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,815
- Veli. I mean my name is Veli Mäkinen.

287
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,817
- People also call me Nipa.

288
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,931
- You have a very beautiful home.

289
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,258
- How did you find this place?
- Thank you. A war widow sold us the house.

290
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,539
- We have met before! 
- You are mistaken. 

291
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,579
- Would you like to see your room?
- I would be happy to. 

292
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:31,016
- Touko! You are here as well?
- Of course, I like these performances. 

293
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,620
- You like dance performances?
- Yeah. I have a season ticket.

294
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:44,771
- Weren't you supposed to be working on the campaign?
- It's done. It's perfect.

295
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,793
- Oh? What's the slogan?

296
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,751
- It's "yum yum, chocolate it's good".

297
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,980
- Doesn't sound so ready yet.
- Oh well.

298
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,959
- Could you fetch me some sparkling wine?
- Of course.

299
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,169
- Would you like some as well?
- I would, thank you.

300
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,655
- You know, you solo part was..

301
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,978
- I forgot my wallet home.

302
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,610
- And how did you pay for your ticket?
- The season ticket, you rememeber?

303
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,135
- Kaija, could you go get them? 
I'll pay you back at home.

304
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,091
- Sure.
- Thank you.

305
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,449
- We have met before. 
- If we have, I was drunk at the time.

306
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,971
- Here you go.
- Thank you. 

307
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,929
- Thank you for inviting me here to see the performance.
- Well, thank you for coming.

308
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,138
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

309
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,136
- Very rarely these own projects come 
true. My writings in example..

310
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,775
- ..nobody wants to publish them. 

311
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,271
- Finland might not be ready for this yet.
- You know how it is in here.

312
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,229
- I was told that now it's a 
great time to be in marketing.

313
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,210
- And I am a good advertiser. As are you Touko.

314
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,176
- Which is why you are now our main drawer.

315
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,152
- Congratulations about that by the way. 
- Thank you.

316
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,540
- So you are interested in motorcycles?
- Yes.

317
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,331
- Riding on top of that..

318
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,293
- Yeah, would be nice to ride it.
- Indeed. 

319
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,189
- Gentleman, may I take a photo with you?

320
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,377
- Alright, let's take one.
- Grab the handle.

321
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,973
- From here?
- Yeah.

322
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,180
- Just think how the power is controlled by it.

323
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,572
- Touko join us.

324
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,350
- It's a children's game.
- We are all children of God.

325
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,255
- Come on!
- Touko! Touko! Touko!

326
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,340
- Are you a virgin?
- No.

327
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,239
- Touko, truth or dare?

328
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,700
- Pick truth.
- Truth.

329
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,053
- No! Dare.

330
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,940
- Kiss Heidi.

331
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,271
- Kiss!

332
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,710
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

333
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,438
- Seems like it's my turn. 

334
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,932
- Oops! It stopped at Kaija. 

335
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,890
- Truth or dare?

336
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,293
- Truth.
- So dare it is.

337
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,152
- Kiss Heidi.
- Touko dear, it's forbidden by the law.

338
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,769
- Just do it this time.

339
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,978
- Almost, Kaija, almost.

340
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,657
- During the war, there was a blackout in Helsinki.

341
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,098
- You might be too young to remember. Or maybe not. 

342
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,416
- But the atmosphere was electric.

343
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,971
- A plane roared in the sky over the city.

344
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,977
- It was so dark that we couldn't see anything. 
We were asking who are you? Who is touching me?

345
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,412
- Hey dad.
- Hey.

346
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,458
- It's nice to see you again.
- Hey. Welcome.

347
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,893
- Hey. I'm Nipa.

348
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,413
- Welcome. Nice to meet you. 

349
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,690
- Where is my godson Aaro?

350
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,015
- What?
- Come!

351
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,529
- One. Two. Three. Four. 

352
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,419
- Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

353
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,630
- Nine. Ten! Here I come!

354
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,452
- Ha! Found you.

355
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,094
- I enjoyed coming here as a child.

356
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,293
- What were you doing here?

357
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,971
- Polished boots.

358
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,214
- Before it was believed, that if unmarried woman..

359
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,393
- ..would roll around in the meadow on Mid-Summer's Eve.. 

360
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,572
- ..she would be able to see her future 
husband's reflection on the lake's surface.

361
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,912
- The meadow behind the house is a perfect place for that.

362
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,769
<i>- How do the Mid-Summer spells really work?</i>

363
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,809
<i>- You see, it's because during the Mid-Summer 
night, the sun doesn't set beyond the horizon.</i>

364
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:47,737
<i>- And then the men couldn't hide. Like 
your father tried to hide from me.</i>

365
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,739
<i>- I tried to hide? No I didn't. 
Your mother is trying to fool you.</i>

366
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,890
- I would only destroy everything. Your family..
- You wouldn't. 

367
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,699
- I'm not good. I'm rotten.
- No you are not. 

368
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,373
- Good evening. 

369
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,292
- Everyone should see these.

370
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,376
- Yes?
- We are here for the gathering.

371
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,978
- Good day. 

372
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:29,488
- He is so handsome.
- I know. And waiting for you. Go!

373
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,018
- Darling.

374
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,537
- Darling..

375
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,900
- There is someone at the door!

376
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,893
- Oh fuck! It's the police!

377
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,433
- Fucking hell! Take everything with you.

378
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,613
- Heikki, let's go.
- No.

379
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,820
- No, I'll stay to delay them.
- It's the police! Open the door!

380
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,274
- Just go without me.
- Open the door right now!

381
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,910
- Vieno.. 

382
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,929
- Open this door at once or we will break through it!

383
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,696
- This is the police. Open!

384
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,252
- No! Don't take that route! This way.

385
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,177
- We should have parties like that as well.

386
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,590
- I don't think Kaija could handle it. 

387
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,310
- I wan't an apartment of our own, together.

388
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,991
- With big windows and yellow curtains.

389
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,957
- Yellow colour is for sissies.

390
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,900
- I want the windows to be open. And us to 
be able to dance there with our friends. 

391
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,778
- With what money?
- If you would start selling you art.

392
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,534
- Where?
- Out there in the world.

393
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,432
- Maybe somewhere in the world. But never in Finland.

394
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,070
- Let's just get our own aparment.
- And just throw my little sister on the streets?

395
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,396
- Yeah, little sister. She is only thirty.

396
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,059
- Stop dreaming the impossible.

397
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,939
- I want you to hold my hand during day light.

398
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,978
- I want the curtains to be open.

399
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,072
- It's a nice idea, but still totally unrealistic.
- Want to bet on it?

400
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,610
- Sure. For a whisky bottle.
- It's a deal.

401
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:39,898
- You practically lost already.
- You know, you're the sissy.

402
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,573
- What the?

403
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,731
- No wonder we lost the war..

404
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,100
- ..since we had a gay sissy like you shooting there.

405
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,198
- I'm tired of fighting. I fought my wars.

406
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,271
- I'm not a freaking freedom fighter.

407
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:02,297
- Yeah. "I'm just a willy artist who 
only wants to fuck and have fun!"

408
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,680
- Yellow is a colour for sissies.

409
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,674
- They almost didn't let me visit. 

410
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,219
- Told them that I'm your brother. 

411
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,312
- They are taking a good care of me.

412
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,718
- Fantastic.

413
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,169
- Because I need help.

414
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,257
- The only help you need is with mixing the gin and tonic.

415
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,880
- And I could help you.
- You can get better too. 

416
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:11,053
- Except that I'm not ill. Just like you aren't.

417
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,697
- I will get better and have children.

418
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,618
- Come with me. Let's get out of here.

419
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,540
- Did you hear that we founded a new club?

420
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,610
- A motorcycle club.

421
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,654
- Without the motorcycles.

422
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:43,429
- Touko.. Thank you for visiting me. 

423
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,076
- But I want to get better.

424
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,871
- I already lost my job. I don't want to 
loose everything else I still have.

425
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,132
- Heikki..

426
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,818
- Goodbye my friend.

427
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,013
- Lieutenant.

428
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,812
- Captain.

430
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,891
- I read the article.

431
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,798
- Poor Heikki.

432
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,199

- You got mail from America.

454
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,180
- Again in the cover?

455
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,736
- And a letter from that Doug.

456
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:48,054
- Your number one fan. How is he?

457
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,310
- They want me to go there.

458
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,798
- They would like to organize one or two exhibitions.

459

- He wants to help me.

460

- To America?
- Yeah.

461
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,571
- Congratulations.

462
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:52,972
- You know, I could fall for someone as successful as you.

463
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,373
- Watch out. You could get hurt.

464
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:08,117
- It's Kaija.
- Is the food ready?

465
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,556
- Not yet.

466
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,339
- Evening. 
- Good evening. I'm so hungry already.

467
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,795
- You are always on time.
- Yeah. 

468
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,600
- I knew the place was in chaos.

469
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:25,896
- You guys can be such pigs. 
Should I clean here quickly?

470
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:28,011
- Just hire a cleaner already.

471
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,470
- Are you having a party?
- Just celebrating a little.

472
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,538
- It isn't even six o'clock yet.
- It's good to be on time my darling.

473
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:44,174
- What are you celebrating then?
- Life. That it's fun to be alive.

474
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,718
- And that we are leaving for America.

- Oh?

476
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,531
- Well it doesn't concern me.  

477
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,889
- How about some dancing? Maybe a little bend?
- I don't know.

478
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:16,691
- Stop! I'll pee myself.

479
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,255
- These are sexy. You will loo amazing in these. 

480
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,731
- You should go see a doctor.

481
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:36,053

577
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,278
- Good evening. 

578
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,751

01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,519
- Like the ones you always draw?
- Yeah.

582
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,294
- Many of them?
- Nah, just a few.

583
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,579

584
01:24:54,780 --> 01:25:02,540

than this one dancer I know.

587
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,871
- L.A. has the best doctors in the world.

588
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,115
- For them, throat cancer is just like flu.

589
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:38,072
- We can get a house with a garden 
and parrots in there.

590
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,837
- I like the idea of parrots.

591
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:46,699
- The weather is always warm in there. 
Sun is shining and sea glowing blue.

592
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,792
- Almost everyone is like us in California.

593
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,635
- Sometimes heterosexuals suffers from harassment.

594
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,695
- And I have to defend them. They 
also have the right to exist. 

595
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,994
- And the right to live the way they want to.

596
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,300
- Oh how noble you are.

597
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,635
- Why didn't you tell me that you are sick?

598
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,231
- I didn't want you to see me die.

599
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,119

600
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,592
- It's alright. 

601
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,293
- Let's make underwear for you from this fabric.
- From this?

602
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:50,811
- It feels comfortable. And it would be see-through.

603
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,378
- Good evening.
- We would like to order curtains from this.

604
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,298
- How long would you like them to be?

605
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,249
- Two-seventy?
- Two-seventy.

606
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,053

607
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,817

608
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:36,891

- Well..

609
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,393
- ..I owe you so much more than that.

610
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,172
- Would you like sewed rings in the curtains?

611
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:50,892
- I do.
- Would you like rings such as these?

612
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,452
- I do. 

613
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:06,459
- I wan't people to know about us.

614
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,470

615
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:11,093
- I promise. 

616
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,938
- Tell it to everyone.

617
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:18,737
- You had to take the elevator?
- What are you saying?

618
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,196
- Elevators are for old people.

619
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,693
- How have you been?
- Just great.

620
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,977
- I miss Nipa everyday.

621
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,732
- Yeah.

622
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,571
- Let me see the new ones.

623
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:52,937
- I don't know if they are even worth seeing.

624
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:55,618
- You will see.

625
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,793
- Here. 

626
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,269
- You have made a lot of progress.
- Oh really? 

627
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,131
- You have.

628
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,037
- These are good. 

629
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,253
- This is my favourite.

630
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,699
- You should have a exhibition.
- I won't be having one.

631
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,174
- My work is nonsense. Terrible.

632
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,658
- They are, just look at them.

633
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,497
- Neither of us grew into a real artist.

634
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:34,936
- You nor me.

635
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,371
- You think so?
- Well I doesn't seem like it.

636
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,500
- Let's clean already. Are you throwing this one away?

637
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:49,394
- Nipa loved this book.

638
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,357
- I guess it's finally my turn.

639
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,013
- I see.

640
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,050

641
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,077

- Around the world.

642
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:43,398
- These willy drawings?
- They are liked.

643
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,977
- Sure..

644
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,337
- At least you are using that silly nickname..

645
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:58,772
- ..and not ruin the family name.

646
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,115
- Scruffy, cheap sex magazines.

647
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,297
- Where is the vacuun cleaner?

648
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,492
- You could have signed the guest book.

649
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,815
- Kaija, the phone is ringing.

650
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,773
- Touko Laaksonen.

651
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,753
- Would you like me to make food?

652
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:33,131
- Umh. I'm on the phone.

653
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:37,055
- Sorry. Can you wait?

654
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,750
- No need. I'll go dine later.

655
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,429
- This call is from America, could you?

656
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,032


657
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,972


658
