1
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:08,820
<i>Front door!</i>

2
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:12,958
I know what the rules are. I'm just
asking if you can make an exception.

3
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,194
There are no exceptions.
That's why we have rules.

4
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,396
I know what a rule is.
I'm just telling you..

5
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:18,730
You don't have an X-ray
machine back there?

6
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,432
You don't have
an X-ray machine?

7
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,667
No. I've got to see it.

8
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,890
<i>I bet you're not
going to miss that dri.</i>

9
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,560
Or the ambiance.

10
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,763
I would've gone
a lot further.

11
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:02,007
You know, they gave me a
brochure on reintegrating.

12
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,642
Yeah?
Yeah.

13
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,510
A social worker came by.

14
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,813
What did he say?

15
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,816
Go slow.

16
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,753
We can go slow.

17
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,003
Hey.
Hey.

18
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:34,940
I just wanted to remind you that
I won't be coming in tomorrow.

19
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,809
That's right.
It's the big day!

20
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,312
You must be thrilled..

21
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,480
Yeah.

22
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,616
And excited
and nervous and..

23
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,352
And I wanted to thank you,
just for everything.

24
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,021
You've been
so understanding.

25
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,791
Oh, I'm sure there's more to it
than what's on the news, so..

26
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,695
I know, but to a lot of people
you say "insider trading,"

27
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:00,832
and it may as well be murder.
You just stop existing.

28
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,834
So, thank you
for everything.

29
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,574
I wasn't sure
what I should wear.

30
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:14,880
I tried to find
something new to buy,

31
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,015
but I couldn't find
anything that looked good.

32
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,818
Honey, you
look beautiful.

33
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,921
And I can only imagine how
you're gonna look to him.

34
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,773
Oh!
Oh, Mama.

35
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,043
Oh.

36
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,714
Come on. Let's get out of here
before they change their mind.

37
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,839
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:26,418
<i>Babe, you remember that hedge
fund manager I met inside?</i>

39
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,919
Marshall Hellman?

40
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,590
The Stanford guy?
Yeah.

41
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:37,129
Super smart. He was in for some
tax thing, but he'll be out soon.

42
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:40,632
He's got money in Dubai
and a lot of connections.

43
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,003
I can get us back
to where we were, Em.

44
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,105
I promise. I can make that happen.

45
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,976
Okay, baby.

46
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,560
Thank you.

47
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,686
I don't understand what
you're saying! Just relax!

48
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,154
Hello.

49
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,889
I'm Dr. Banks.

50
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,992
This guy's on something,
okay? Listen, just relax!

51
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,727
Officer.
This guy's on something.

52
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,863
He came swinging at me.

53
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,030
Stand back and
let me talk to him.

54
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,999
He was trying
to hold up a taxi.

55
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,601
You understand?
He came at me!

56
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,083
Augustin? Augustin.

57
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,054
He's fine.

58
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,815
What is it?
What's going on?

59
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,218
He saw his dead father driving the taxi.

60
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:18,957
He saw the ghost of his
father. He was a cabbie.

61
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,625
So I was right.
He's nuts.

62
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,562
No. It's grief.

63
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,298
Just grief painting
pictures in his brain.

64
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,033
He sees ghosts.

65
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,973
He's Haitian. It's not
unusual for Haitians

66
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,708
to see their loved ones
shortly after they die.

67
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,578
Weird for me and you, but
it's perfectly normal for him.

68
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,146
Right, what do
you have next?

69
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:45,083
MVA in bed eight, with minor
head trauma, in need of a consult.

70
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,722
Double shift today?

71
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,090
Better living
through chemistry.

72
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,330
Miss Taylor.

73
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,098
Yeah?
I'm Dr. Banks.

74
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,635
Oh, they said I might
have a concussion,

75
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,303
but I don't have to stay
here for that, right?

76
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,306
Uh, we have to wait for the
CT scan results to know that.

77
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,609
I have a couple of
questions for you.

78
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,210
How's your head?

79
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,312
It hurts.

80
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,615
How was it before
you hit the wall?

81
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,317
What do you mean?

82
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,653
How have things
been going with you?

83
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,254
Generally speaking.

84
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,127
Why are you here?

85
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,030
I'm a psychiatrist,
Miss Taylor.

86
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,865
Normally,

87
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,635
when people hit things
with their car,

88
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,171
there are skid marks
on the pavement.

89
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,842
A brick wall's a pretty good
reason to use the brakes,

90
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,410
turn the wheel.

91
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:49,014
You didn't do that.
You went straight in.

92
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,349
It says here the
attendant told the police

93
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,319
you were pretty upset
before you got in the car.

94
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,956
Now, the insurance company
are gonna check the brakes,

95
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,791
but I prefer
to just ask you.

96
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,729
Did you try to hurt
yourself this morning?

97
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,012
Do you still want to
try and hurt yourself?

98
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,947
Emily.

99
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,088
How do you feel about
staying here for a few days?

100
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,124
Here?
Mmm.

101
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,228
No, I can't stay here.

102
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,198
Martin just got home and
I have to be there for him.

103
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Is that your
husband, Martin?

104
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,402
Yes, and he just
got out of prison.

105
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,038
I have to be there, and I have
a job. I have to go into work.

106
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,374
He doesn't make
any money yet.

107
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,877
Are you married?

108
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,813
Yes.

109
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:58,349
Or you were away for a
long time and you come home

110
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:02,020
and your wife is in
the mental hospital?

111
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:07,025
We waited for four years.
I can't stay here.

112
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,494
I think you may have tried to
hurt yourself this morning, and..

113
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,964
It was a mistake.
I lost it for a minute.

114
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,266
I promise, that's not
going to happen again.

115
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,037
Do you have an office?
Mmm.

116
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,940
Well, I could come
see you at your office.

117
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,274
I could come as
often as you want.

118
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,144
I could come two
or three times a week.

119
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,046
I was in therapy
once before,

120
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,316
and I remember that structure
really helps with hopelessness.

121
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,254
I promise. I just
really want to go home.

122
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,124
Okay. So we'll
release her to you,

123
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:43,128
um, but I want to see her in my office
this week. That's the deal we made.

124
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,830
I just had no idea
this was still going on.

125
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,999
Oh, honey, I think she must have
been putting on a brave face.

126
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,769
She was afraid to tell you.
She was afraid to tell me.

127
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,904
I want to start her on
this. It's called an SSRI.

128
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,107
It affects the neurotransmitter
in the brain called serotonin.

129
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:02,781
<i>Basically, it helps stop the
brain from telling you you're sad.</i>

130
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,450
<i>In a few weeks, she should
start to feel better.</i>

131
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,420
No, of course.
Of course.

132
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,059
It was soft. Absolutely,
it was soft in that first..

133
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,830
But we are going
to tighten it up.

134
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:22,033
Sure, that's what we do.

135
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:25,904
Yeah. I think it'll be interesting
to regroup after the Dallas groups.

136
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,240
Emily?

137
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,476
Are you okay?

138
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,261
Emily?

139
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,836
Aww!

140
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,072
What happened?

141
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,409
Oh!

142
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,412
These made me sick, too.

143
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,915
I had better luck
with Celexa.

144
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,092
<i>I used to draw when I was a
kid. Mostly people, though.</i>

145
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,330
Teachers and kids
from my class.

146
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,032
Boys that I liked.

147
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,901
Sometimes cats.

148
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,506
I used to try and get
their faces perfect.

149
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,479
That's why I came to New York, I
wanted to get into graphic design.

150
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,915
I was taking classes
when I met Martin.

151
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,216
How did that happen?

152
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:52,156
I was working at this, uh, bar
downtown to help pay for school,

153
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,393
and he kept coming in
after work.

154
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,429
And he would just order
the most complicated drinks.

155
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,065
Things that I had
no idea how to make.

156
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,570
One night, he climbed over the bar

157
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,306
and offered to teach
me how to make them.

158
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:13,044
And he ended up staying until
we closed. Then he asked me out.

159
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,018
I didn't know who he was or
what he did. He was just..

160
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,521
He was just
this guy in a suit.

161
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,525
And watched me
while I made drinks,

162
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,162
and that made me
really nervous.

163
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,498
Then he stared at me
like I was a painting.

164
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,270
He had this beautiful sailboat,
and he took me out on it.

165
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,205
Taught me how to ski.

166
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,176
He swept me off my feet.

167
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:49,514
Proposed to me in Maui that winter
and we were married by spring.

168
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,118
How old were you?

169
00:15:55,187 --> 00:16:00,491
That was five years ago,
so I was 23.

170
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,398
Time goes by so fast.

171
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,704
Is this ever going
to go away?

172
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,008
You said you felt
depressed before.

173
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,277
Did you see anyone
about it last time?

174
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,982
Yeah. In Greenwich,
Connecticut. Victoria Siebert.

175
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,317
I had to stop seeing her
when they took our house away

176
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,120
and I had to move
back to the city.

177
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,056
Do you mind if I contact Dr.
Siebert about your history?

178
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,992
No, of course not.

179
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,626
<i>I saw her four years ago. Mmm.</i>

180
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,262
For a little
over nine months.

181
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,998
She didn't just have the
rug pulled from under her,

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,301
she had the rug,
the home, the husband.

183
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,571
Her entire life, gone.

184
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:51,609
Even her health insurance. She
moved into the city to find work

185
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,746
and I never heard
from her again.

186
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:58,282
I'm glad she's seeing a man this
time. I think that will help.

187
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,485
Why is that?

188
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,588
Never felt seen
by her father.

189
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,126
Then her husband ends up in
jail and she's abandoned again.

190
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,529
I'd be happy to see her have
a different kind of experience.

191
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,799
She says you tried
her on medication.

192
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:19,704
Oh, yes. Wellbutrin.
Prozac. Effexor.

193
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,774
Really struggled.
Mmm.

194
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:26,511
I remember she had problems
with sleep and nausea. Chills..

195
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:30,148
I'm putting her on Zoloft,
see if she can tolerate that.

196
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,517
Oh. Well, maybe she's a candidate
for one of these newer meds.

197
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,653
Sometimes the newest thing
gives them confidence.

198
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,624
They see the ads
on TV, they believe.

199
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,260
I have a patient with
some similar issues.

200
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,429
I put her on Ablixa.

201
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,497
Welcome, everyone!
Thank you for coming.

202
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,266
We'll be starting
the presentations soon,

203
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,201
so if everyone can
come in and take a seat.

204
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,674
You know, I may have some
samples here. Let me see.

205
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,245
No. I must have
given them all away.

206
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,315
Here! Have an Ablixa pen.

207
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,788
I would have prescribed it
for Emily after she miscarried.

208
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,223
Miscarried?
Hmm.

209
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,459
After he went to jail.

210
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,227
She, uh, hasn't
mentioned that.

211
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,795
No?
No.

212
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,163
Has he been
released yet?

213
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,832
A week ago.
Oh!

214
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,533
Well, maybe that will
help turn things around.

215
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,601
Hmm.

216
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,705
Look, don't mention
anything to Carl or Kayla

217
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,441
about Hellman. It'll
just make things easier.

218
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:37,281
I still think Carl's the
one who went to the Feds.

219
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,118
He probably gave
us these tickets

220
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,653
because he feels shitty
about everything.

221
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,792
I hope these things work.

222
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,794
Hey.

223
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:57,301
Look, if you don't feel up
to this, I can go by myself.

224
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,371
I understand if you don't
want to see those people.

225
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:04,442
<i>But I got to get back
out there at some point.</i>

226
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,445
<i>If I just sit here by myself,
I'm just gonna feel worse.</i>

227
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,681
<i>I have to at least try. Dr.
Banks would want me to try.</i>

228
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,463
Carl?

229
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,465
Martin! Welcome back.

230
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,300
How are you, sir?
Hi!

231
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,701
Emily, good to see you.
Hi. Good to see you.

232
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,637
Kayla, you remember
this beautiful lady here.

233
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:33,738
Hi.

234
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,240
Thank you so much
for having us.

235
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:40,278
Oh, my, your dress is beautiful!
I love it. It's gorgeous.

236
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,380
Thank you. We're so
glad you guys could come.

237
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,215
It's our pleasure.
Thanks again.

238
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,289
I'm going to go to the bar and get
a drink. Does anyone want anything?

239
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,790
Is that
such a good idea?

240
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,892
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll be right back.

241
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,764
She looks amazing!

242
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,566
She's doing well.

243
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,902
But going away is hard, and so
is coming back, for everyone.

244
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,405
Martin, I just want to
say I wish I had done

245
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,973
a better job of reaching
out. I really do.

246
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,977
No. That's fine. It's the
culture. It's over now.

247
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,315
Good evening, ma'am.
Can I get you something?

248
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,517
Yes, a vodka seltzer, please.

249
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,635
There you go. Enjoy.

250
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,769
Thank you.

251
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,713
Em. So, Martin
was just telling..

252
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,284
Honey, what's wrong?

253
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,722
I can't do this.

254
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,729
You know, I went through
a very bad time last year.

255
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,632
I found a lump.

256
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,768
I just fell apart.
I was so depressed,

257
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,904
and, uh, my doctor prescribed
something called Effexor.

258
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,508
It really helped.

259
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,814
Can you get
Martin for me?

260
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,785
Yeah.

261
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,056
Hey.

262
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,991
I'm sorry.

263
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,894
I'm sorry!
I can't, I'm sorry.

264
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,996
It's okay, it's okay.

265
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,497
Come here.

266
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,805
Not so close, ma'am!

267
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,575
Thank you.

268
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,054
Oh, the advantages of having a
husband who can write prescriptions.

269
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,427
What are they
called again?

270
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,995
It's a beta blocker.
Hmm.

271
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,534
Is it bad that
I'm doing this?

272
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,668
Everyone takes them.

273
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,870
Lawyers, musicians.

274
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,006
People going to interviews for big jobs.

275
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,009
It doesn't make you
anything you're not.

276
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:08,179
It just makes it easier
for you to be who you are.

277
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:13,918
It's between me
and two other people.

278
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,654
A woman from Merrill
and a guy from Citicorp.

279
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,589
But Hazlitt says
I have the inside track.

280
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:22,860
Sorry, D. I've got to return
this. It's an emergency.

281
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,062
This girl is
really struggling.

282
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,667
Dr. Banks, I really
need to talk to you.

283
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,502
Emily.

284
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,871
Yeah. I just
got your message.

285
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,773
I'm with my wife.

286
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,078
I went to your office, but you
weren't there. So I came here.

287
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,881
Could we just go talk?

288
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,218
If it's an emergency,
I can admit you.

289
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,019
No. I just, um..

290
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,024
I was getting on
the subway and..

291
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,197
And I was like
when I was in the car.

292
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,238
I have to go to work.
I just need five minutes.

293
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,607
You're going to go
to work after?

294
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,610
Okay, five minutes.
Okay.

295
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,745
I'm sorry.

296
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,013
Call me after
the interview.

297
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,057
<i>Emily,
I know this is hard.</i>

298
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,960
<i>But the hopelessness
you're feeling is a symptom.</i>

299
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,729
<i>We have to leave
that in the past.</i>

300
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,733
A psychologist once said,

301
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,235
"Depression is an inability
to construct a future."

302
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:43,140
But you have a future.
At home with Martin.

303
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,580
He's trying to start
a new business.

304
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,750
With this guy Hellman
that he met in jail.

305
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,252
How does that
make you feel?

306
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,221
I don't know.
I mean, he's trying.

307
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,990
He's really trying
to make things better

308
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,594
and I'm just not
helping at all.

309
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,930
I mean, I'm trying, too. I went..

310
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,302
I went shopping to try and make
things more exciting for him.

311
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:13,170
You are trying.

312
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,945
I can't take the Zoloft
anymore. I can't. I'm dizzy.

313
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,080
I can't sleep.
I have no sex drive.

314
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,950
I understand that.

315
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,719
This woman I work with,
Julia, she..

316
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:32,089
She said she's on this other, new
medication, and it's really helping her.

317
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,991
I thought maybe
I could try that.

318
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,130
Taylor!

319
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,137
Have you taken
Ablixa before?

320
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,372
No.

321
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,241
Some of the side effects
may include

322
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:55,312
<i>nausea, muscle weakness,
insomnia, change in appeti,</i>

323
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,916
<i>dry mouth, irritation.</i>

324
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:03,654
<i>There were court seats at
Knicks games, fishing trips</i>

325
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,723
to Cape Cod.
It was crazy.

326
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:08,859
One year, Warner-Lambert
took us to Hawaii.

327
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:12,730
I gave a talk for five
minutes and played 36 holes.

328
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,999
What did Pfizer have to pay to
make their whole thing go away?

329
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,634
Two billion?

330
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,969
Lilly paid over a billion
to settle the Zyprexa thing.

331
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,039
Do we have to talk about
this? You're ruining my lunch.

332
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,274
A certain rep,
who will remain nameless,

333
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,110
gave me tickets
to the World Series.

334
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:28,879
Got my son an autographed ball! Hmm.

335
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,414
If only I'd known
you liked baseball.

336
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,650
Where was I
for all this?

337
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:35,052
Some British
boarding school, probably.

338
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:38,889
Well, it's not a violation of the
pharma code to buy you doctors lunch

339
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,692
as long as we talk about business
for at least five minutes.

340
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,661
Ready? Go!

341
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:47,231
We're starting a trial for our
new anti-anxiety drug, Delatrex.

342
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,967
We're looking for a
couple of docs to consult.

343
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,237
It's probably going to run
for about a year. Any interest?

344
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,807
I'm out. I'm doing something for
the competition. Signed an NDA.

345
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,410
You should cancel
her filet for that.

346
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:02,146
I'm teaching next semester and
feeling a little overextended.

347
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,248
How about you,
Dr. Banks? Too busy?

348
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,052
Not as busy as my partners.
What do you need?

349
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,853
<i>Getting warmer,
but, no.</i>

350
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,256
Uh..

351
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,958
Thirty thousand?
Ah!

352
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,861
Fifty thousand.

353
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,229
Really? Wow.
Yes.

354
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,731
Really.

355
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,233
What do you
have to do?

356
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:27,371
Go to a few meetings, recruit
some patients, track some data.

357
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,373
So you'll be
even busier.

358
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,874
Yes.

359
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,912
But the flip side is

360
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,115
that if, for instance,

361
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:41,218
the buttons
on this shirt

362
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,455
suddenly fell off,

363
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:47,224
I would be able
to buy a new one.

364
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,160
Oh, I see.

365
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,429
Mom?

366
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,298
Mmm.

367
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,801
Yes, honey! In here,
sweetie. Just unpacking.

368
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,838
I was having
a bad dream.

369
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,306
Oh, love.
Oh!

370
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:06,977
Honey, you're in luck. Jon
is very good with dreams.

371
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,179
Yes, I am.
So, he's gonna help you.

372
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,347
Back to bed, sweetie.

373
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,985
Do I have to dream
when I sleep?

374
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,254
Yeah, I'm pretty
much sure we all do.

375
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,189
They don't all
have to be bad.

376
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,760
Albert Einstein,
remember him?

377
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,294
Yeah.

378
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,164
He figured out
relativity in a dream.

379
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:30,167
And Paul McCartney
wrote entire songs.

380
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:34,037
And I dreamt of your mom
before I even met her.

381
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,808
So what are you
going to dream about?

382
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,364
Whoever makes this drug is
going to be fucking rich.

383
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,457
Em!

384
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,496
Em! It's the middle of the
night. Turn down the music!

385
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,469
Em?

386
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,042
Are we expecting someone?

387
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,547
Em, can you hear me?

388
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,120
What are you doing?

389
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:32,956
<i>Can't she
stop taking drug?</i>

390
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,292
Isn't there an
alternative approach.. No!

391
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,294
God, no.
I can finally sleep.

392
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,630
I have some energy.
We had sex.

393
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,500
It was like we were
actually together.

394
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,970
Maybe something else
would do the same thing.

395
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:50,974
Absolutely. There are
still other SSRis, SNRls.

396
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,476
No.

397
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,678
I've tried everything else.
You don't know, Martin.

398
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,614
You've never had this. You
don't know what it's like.

399
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:00,183
Okay? Every afternoon
it's like..

400
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,288
It's like there's
this poisonous fog bank

401
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,191
rolling in on my mind,
and I'm paralyzed.

402
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:12,029
If I have to start over, I think
I should see a different doctor.

403
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,367
I'm sorry
you feel that way.

404
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,237
I understand
your frustration.

405
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,006
What do we do?

406
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,475
There are things we can
do to make this work.

407
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,577
<i>Other medications
we add to the Abli,</i>

408
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:33,183
<i>while the Ablixa helps you get
a handle on your depression.</i>

409
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:36,186
I'm going
to Otisville today.

410
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,222
They finally approved
me to see Hellman.

411
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:45,028
He's thinking we might want
to set up shop in Houston.

412
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,665
He's got a lot of
connections down there.

413
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,168
I thought we were going
to move back to Greenwich.

414
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:59,242
I'm sure that we can find
great people in Houston, too.

415
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:05,082
I want to be totally clear that I am
being paid to participate in this study.

416
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,451
If you don't want to take
part, I totally understand.

417
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:10,687
There are other meds besides
Delatrex I can prescribe.

418
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:14,091
So, my medication
is free.

419
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,393
I don't have to report it to my
insurance company or anything?

420
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:21,231
For as long as you choose to be a
part of the study, your meds are free.

421
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,599
Oh, that's great.

422
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,369
We'll start today.

423
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:44,588
<i>Emily, I don't understand.
It's almost 4:00.</i>

424
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,090
<i>What happened?</i>

425
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,796
I got on the train, and
I just forgot to get off.

426
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,269
Martin is thinking
about moving us,

427
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,606
and I'm just

428
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,675
really..

429
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,114
Go home, Emily.

430
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:14,418
But you have to know
this can't happen again.

431
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,586
It's not working for me.

432
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,263
Hey.

433
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,768
Hey. Hey.

434
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,170
What's happening?

435
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,509
They gave it to the guy
from Citicorp.

436
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,744
Oh, I'm sorry, D.

437
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,715
It's fucking hopeless.

438
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,307
Emily?

439
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:51,148
Hellman says you are
going to love Houston.

440
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,217
What'd you get me?

441
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,155
Em?

442
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,661
Em?

443
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,766
God damn it. Em?

444
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,668
These fucking pills.

445
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,609
Em.

446
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,513
You sleeping again?

447
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,650
Stop!

448
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,219
Ahh!

449
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,936
Em, call somebody.

450
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,306
Help me.

451
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,674
Call somebody.

452
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,510
Help me.

453
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,645
Did he hit you?

454
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,880
Did he threaten you?

455
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,425
Was anyone else here? Who
else was coming for dinner?

456
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,461
What?

457
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,934
I was asleep and I..

458
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,904
I woke up and I saw him. He wasn't..

459
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,939
He wasn't moving.

460
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,309
And that's all..
That's all I remember.

461
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,448
<i>Dr. Siebert.</i>

462
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,085
Hello, there. I'm sorry to
bother you. It's Jon Banks.

463
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,887
It's about Emily.

464
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,021
<i>Uh, there's been
an incident.</i>

465
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:49,826
<i>Nobody else on the
building security camera.</i>

466
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,827
The prints on
the knife are hers.

467
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,562
Where is her lawyer?

468
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:56,032
She doesn't have one.
Just kept talking about you.

469
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,568
No sign of struggle
on either one of them.

470
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,439
We had an appointment last night
that she didn't show up for.

471
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,376
When was the last
time you saw her?

472
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:07,711
Four days ago.

473
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:08,912
And what was she like?

474
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,984
Any idea why the dinner table
was set for three, Dr. Banks?

475
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,955
She doesn't remember
anything about a guest. Kids?

476
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,726
No, she didn't
have children.

477
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,894
She was taking these.

478
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:27,497
For depression, right?
I've seen the ads.

479
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,065
She ever talk to you
about something like this?

480
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,501
I'd like to speak to her,
if that's possible.

481
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,103
You can talk to her
at Rikers.

482
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,405
It's possible, you see,
that she was asleep.

483
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,141
What?

484
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,910
That's maybe why she
doesn't remember anything.

485
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,912
It's a side effect
of this medication.

486
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,484
She's had other episodes.

487
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,954
She kills people
in her sleep, too.

488
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,462
Stand up, please.
And turn around.

489
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>She ever
tell you anything to</i>

490
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:06,469
make you believe she could
be violent, or that he was?

491
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,571
And before you
answer that

492
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:13,476
or tell me about some kind of
patient-doctor confidentiality thing,

493
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,712
let's just think
about the future here.

494
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,149
The future?

495
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:22,485
Well, this goes one of
two ways, doesn't it?

496
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:26,523
See, either she's
a murderer or

497
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,660
she's a victim of
her medical treatment.

498
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:34,664
In which case, you're the
target of a big civil suit.

499
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,867
<i>Either way,
someone gets punishe.</i>

500
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,937
<i>Her or you.</i>

501
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,911
<i>The state's enjoyed working
with you in the past, Dr. Banks.</i>

502
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:50,513
<i>I'd like to see you
consulting with us on this one.</i>

503
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,716
This is different.

504
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:55,885
Is it?

505
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,026
I never want to see
another pill again.

506
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,831
They want me to
take something else.

507
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,999
Another pill
to help me sleep.

508
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,006
I don't understand
why this is happening.

509
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,913
Is there any way that

510
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,016
somebody else did it,

511
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,085
and made it look like me?

512
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,991
I don't think so.

513
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:40,263
That's not what
the police are saying.

514
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,113
I don't know what else I could
have done. She wanted to stay on it.

515
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,916
Jon. You can't
follow them around

516
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,618
taking things
out of their hands

517
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,753
they might use to
hurt themselves.

518
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:07,090
We see them for an hour a day,
maybe a couple of times a week.

519
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,725
I think they're
going to charge her.

520
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,760
With what?

521
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:14,764
You said she has no
memory. No criminal intent.

522
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,065
They can't do that.

523
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,669
<i>A man in Arizona.</i>

524
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,771
He killed his wife,
threw her in the pool,

525
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:24,107
took off his bloody clothes,
put them in the trunk of his car.

526
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:26,809
Woke up the next morning,
no memory of it.

527
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:29,012
Didn't even know she was dead until
they charged him with the crime.

528
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,948
Neighbors even saw him
throw the body into the pool.

529
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,785
He was acquitted last year.

530
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:39,722
A woman bludgeoned her husband
while on vacation in Sanibel Island.

531
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,026
They were both asleep at
the time. Another acquittal.

532
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:46,062
I have to tell you, I have
been approached by the state

533
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,797
to consult
for them as well.

534
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,866
I assumed as much.

535
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:53,970
I am in a rather difficult spot
here. I hope you appreciate that.

536
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:56,239
I know you are,
but if she goes away,

537
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,642
It just makes the whole system look bad.

538
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,881
She ever talk about
killing her husband?

539
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:07,283
No. If she had, I
would have reported it.

540
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:09,886
You spoken to
any of the family?

541
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:12,055
Martin's mother. She's
the one who hired me.

542
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,893
We need your help.

543
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,233
You want to
talk about it?

544
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,041
A patient of mine
was arrested.

545
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,980
For something bad?

546
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:39,182
Yeah. Pretty bad.

547
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,254
Did the person do it?

548
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,291
Are they guilty?

549
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,865
In this case,

550
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,334
those are two very
different things.

551
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,879
I was afraid you would
never want to see me again.

552
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:51,120
I hope you know that if I could
trade places with Martin, I would.

553
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:54,924
I would give anything if there were
someone who could make that deal.

554
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:58,261
I just don't understand
how it happened. How?

555
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,931
I don't know.

556
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:05,268
I don't know. It doesn't
fit for me. It's like..

557
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,473
It's like
it never happened.

558
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,942
But I don't
understand it.

559
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:17,447
You watch the commercials on
TV, people are getting better!

560
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,416
I was getting better. Dr.
Banks was really helping me.

561
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,319
But, he just got out

562
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,222
and now he's gone.

563
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,357
I know.

564
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,863
Can I give
you something?

565
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,265
What?

566
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,367
I want to make
a statement.

567
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,311
People need to know
what can happen.

568
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,381
For Martin's sake.

569
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,349
<i>"We go to doctors"</i>

570
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,119
<i>"with our sadness"</i>

571
00:45:56,121 --> 00:46:00,056
<i>"and our faith in the hope they
will guide us toward health."</i>

572
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:03,459
<i>"But instead I have gone
down a path toward a misery"</i>

573
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:06,329
<i>"I never could
have imagined."</i>

574
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:09,999
<i>"And I have taken
my loved ones with m."</i>

575
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:15,505
<i>"My only hope is that no one
else follows me to this place. "</i>

576
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:18,374
<i>And again, this is a note
from your daughter-in-law.</i>

577
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:21,844
<i>Who may face
murder charges.</i>

578
00:46:21,846 --> 00:46:23,179
<i>Yes.</i>

579
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,515
<i>For what a dg
made her do.</i>

580
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:30,219
<i>We invited a representative from
Sadler-Benelux, the makers of Ablixa,</i>

581
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,188
<i>to come here
this morning</i>

582
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,124
<i>and discuss this very tragic
story, but they declined.</i>

583
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,194
<i>However, our Dr. Peter Joubert,
in fact, a Manhattan psychiatrist</i>

584
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:41,030
<i>who specializes in
anti-depression drugs like Ablixa,</i>

585
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:47,436
<i>Peter, if nothing else, this
seems a very troubling gray area.</i>

586
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:51,374
<i>Josh, it is. And that
is why the FDA, in 2004,</i>

587
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:54,477
<i>asked that anti-depressants
come with a black box warning..</i>

588
00:46:54,479 --> 00:47:00,383
<i>of suicidality in
children and adolescents.</i>

589
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:03,452
Zucchini or asparagus?
I don't know. Both.

590
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,955
<i>That warning was expanded to
include young adults in their 20s.</i>

591
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:08,858
<i>Peter, where's the doctor in all this?</i>

592
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,093
<i>What's his or her
responsibility?</i>

593
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:13,863
<i>I'm sure people have a
lot of questions for him.</i>

594
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:16,032
What about the permission
slip for the field trip?

595
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,300
Do you have that?

596
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:19,869
Did you remember?
Are you excited? What?

597
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,106
There he is! Dr. Banks!
Did someone famous..

598
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:26,142
How long have you been
seeing Emily Taylor?

599
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,610
Seeing who?

600
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:29,412
Did you know that your husband
was treating Emily Taylor?

601
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,613
Take him out of here.

602
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:31,948
What is happening?

603
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,149
Go that way!

604
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:36,853
You have no comment
about any of this?

605
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,554
No, not at the moment.

606
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:42,959
I have no comment. She's my
patient. That's all I can say.

607
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,193
What's your relationship?

608
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,395
I saw some press
people downstairs.

609
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,498
I think they had cameras.

610
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,367
Is that for you?

611
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,607
There's a back stairway,

612
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:00,409
if you'd be more
comfortable leaving that way.

613
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:07,617
My wife never liked
me coming here.

614
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,155
I'm worried she's
going to see something.

615
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,894
It's going
to be a "thing."

616
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,097
Was she the one
with the blonde hair?

617
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:25,401
I think I saw her in the elevator.
She seemed totally normal.

618
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,070
I'd really like to focus more
on what's going on with you.

619
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,640
What was she taking? It's
not what I'm taking, is it?

620
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:32,942
No. You're taking
something else.

621
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,280
You'd..
You'd tell me, right?

622
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:39,582
As part of the Office's
medical conduct review,

623
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:42,385
we'll need to have access
to your charts and records.

624
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,654
Current and past patients.

625
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,294
Absolutely.
Whatever you need.

626
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,632
You went to school
in the UK, at Durham.

627
00:48:56,634 --> 00:49:01,604
What made you decide to
practice here in the States?

628
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:05,608
Where I come from, if anyone
goes to see a psychiatrist

629
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,377
or takes medication, the
assumption is they're sick.

630
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,579
Here, the assumption
is they're getting better.

631
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:13,482
I see.

632
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:17,620
You first came in contact with
Miss Taylor after a suicide attempt.

633
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,291
She drove her car
into a wall.

634
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,460
You decided not
to hospitalize her?

635
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,999
She described her suicide
attempt as a mistake.

636
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,437
And expressed a desire
to get better.

637
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:36,639
Her husband wanted
her home as well.

638
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:41,644
In addition, she had no
history of violent behavior.

639
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,347
Driving a car into
a wall isn't violent?

640
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:49,618
I didn't think she
posed a risk to others.

641
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,088
I saw her regularly,
here in my office,

642
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,623
and consulted with her
previous doctor as well.

643
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,292
Dr. Siebert.
Hmm.

644
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,494
I've spoken to her.

645
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:04,166
You also do work at the
hospital, a number of shifts.

646
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,169
Sometimes nights.

647
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:11,173
And you said you're doing
pharmaceutical consulting.

648
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,376
That's a pretty
large workload.

649
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,179
My wife lost her job.

650
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:21,050
And we have a boy, my
stepson, in private school.

651
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,087
I bought a new place
downtown, too.

652
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:33,129
So, longer hours, higher
volume of patients, more stress.

653
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,378
Anything else?

654
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,684
I'll need to ask your
partners some questions.

655
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,219
Of course.

656
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,760
<i>They can't come after you
for any of this, right?</i>

657
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:07,530
<i>No, that's
not going to happen.</i>

658
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:09,331
They don't blame me.

659
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:15,571
I'm just an
expert witness.

660
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,441
Like I was on that case
with the kid from Uganda

661
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:21,077
who couldn't
stop stealing stuff.

662
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,516
They just need me to explain
things to the jury. That's all.

663
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,287
So after the trial,
it's over.

664
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,122
Absolutely.

665
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,661
<i>She was sad.
Very sad.</i>

666
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:39,862
Every day.

667
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,566
Did she say why?

668
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:47,536
No. It is just
how she was.

669
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:48,771
<i>Some people sl.</i>

670
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,775
Some jump.
We keep an eye out.

671
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,646
I remember her.
Right on the edge.

672
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,450
She worried me.

673
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,786
<i>What makes us human?</i>

674
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:06,455
What differentiates us
from, let's say, insects,

675
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,624
is that we have
consciousness.

676
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:13,329
An awareness of what we're
thinking and what we're doing.

677
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:18,134
If, for example, I'm hungry,
I am consciously aware of that.

678
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:21,604
And so, I go to the fridge
and I make myself a sandwich.

679
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:24,874
So you intend to
make a sandwich.

680
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:25,908
Yes.

681
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:32,181
So, what you are saying
is that to have intent,

682
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,449
we must also have
consciousness.

683
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,185
Objection, Your Honor.

684
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:39,288
The question calls for a legal
conclusion, not a medical one.

685
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,157
Overruled.

686
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:42,691
You may continue.

687
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,795
Consciousness
provides a context,

688
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,797
or meaning,
for our actions.

689
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:51,767
If that part of you
doesn't exist, then,

690
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,837
basically, we are functioning
much like an insect,

691
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,174
where you just
respond instinctively

692
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:00,576
without a thought to
what your actions mean.

693
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,611
And that part..

694
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,548
That part that provides
meaning to action,

695
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,183
does that exist
when we're asleep?

696
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:08,651
No.
No.

697
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,689
So, without consciousness,
how do we prove intent?

698
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,824
I don't
believe you can.

699
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:18,327
<i>I think
she'll take it.</i>

700
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:22,364
But she does not walk out of the
hospital next week, or next month.

701
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,832
She goes away for a while.
That's part of the deal.

702
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:25,301
She'll have to
agree to that.

703
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:26,902
You think
that'll work?

704
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,208
I can get Dr. Banks to
help explain it to her.

705
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,843
Here's what we're prepared to live with.

706
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:37,246
State agrees
to an NGRI.

707
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:39,882
We make a side agreement about
how long she's institutionalized

708
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,718
before there's any sort
of hearing on her release.

709
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,654
So I'm not guilty,
but I'm still going away?

710
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,657
NGRI means Not Guilty
for Reasons of Insanity.

711
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,559
You're not
guilty of murder.

712
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,362
You'll be moved to the Wards
Island Forensic Psychiatry Center

713
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:54,296
for a period of time.

714
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,431
But I can't leave.

715
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,433
No, not for a while.

716
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:59,368
You'll be
under observation.

717
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,905
I'm not crazy.
You know I'm not crazy.

718
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:07,009
In my opinion, you are a victim
of circumstance and biology.

719
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,713
Isn't your opinion
the one that counts?

720
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:13,315
No, I'm just one doctor.

721
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,718
It may help to have you
examined by another psychiatrist.

722
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,820
We should get Dr. Siebert.

723
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:20,022
She's known me for a lot
longer, and she could testify.

724
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:23,859
Dr. Siebert's records have
already been submitted to the D.A.

725
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:26,695
And you weren't in her care
at the time of the murder.

726
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,468
But if I'm just a victim of
circumstance and biology..

727
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,273
It was the Ablixa.
You told me I should stay

728
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:40,476
on the Ablixa. I would never
be here if it weren't for that.

729
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:44,380
Emily, if you take this plea, as soon
as a psychiatrist says you're ready,

730
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,282
we'll apply
for your release.

731
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:47,816
What if I say no?

732
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,321
Then we keep going.

733
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:55,024
But they have a body, they have
your prints on the murder weapon,

734
00:54:55,026 --> 00:54:56,625
and they have you
at the crime scene.

735
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,461
We can't argue that you
didn't do any of that, so,

736
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,731
one day, it goes to the
jury and maybe they acquit,

737
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:03,999
you walk out of
here on your own.

738
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:05,834
Or maybe it goes
the other way.

739
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,605
Well,
what do you think?

740
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:11,573
I will tell you
what I know.

741
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:14,677
An NGRI defense is only
successful 1% of the time,

742
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,012
and they are giving
you that today.

743
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:21,917
Nobody here has ever had a
bad result? Nobody here has had

744
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,086
a client react
to a side effect?

745
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:27,489
Your arrogance here is breathtaking.
You take no responsibility?

746
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,792
For her body's reaction
to a medicine?

747
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:31,327
It only just came
on the market!

748
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,796
She has come up in a number
of my sessions as well.

749
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:35,597
It's become a part of
the environment here.

750
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,733
I have clients who are afraid
to take their medications.

751
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,935
We had the state board here.
It's on the nightly news.

752
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:43,639
Look, I spoke with her lawyer
and the D.A. We worked it out.

753
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:45,874
She's taking an NGRI.

754
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:48,477
She's going to hospital for
observation. It's behind us.

755
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,845
It's all gonna go away.

756
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,448
Bullshit, Jon! It is
splashed all over you!

757
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:55,017
It's going to follow
you around forever.

758
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,852
And us, too, if we're
standing next to you.

759
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,855
What does that mean? If
she's not guilty, why am I?

760
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,557
Rational people may
look at it like that,

761
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,826
but we don't see a great
many rational people here.

762
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:07,730
We shouldn't even have to ask.
You should see what's happening.

763
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:09,932
But that seems
hard for you!

764
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,845
Do you think
I screwed up?

765
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,514
I don't know.

766
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,720
I noticed the Taylor
woman in the waiting room.

767
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,722
She was very attractive.

768
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,393
A wounded bird. Fragile.

769
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:40,129
Would you have treated her
differently if she was a man?

770
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:41,430
Gene.

771
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:45,567
That's not what happened.

772
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,904
Maybe it's time
for you to slow down.

773
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,740
Your client load is down.
Get some cheaper space.

774
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,575
Focus on what's
going on with you.

775
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,943
Unbelievable.

776
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,514
I received a letter, Jon.

777
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,015
I haven't shared
it with anyone,

778
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,818
but I think it
will likely surface.

779
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,086
What kind of letter?

780
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,092
It's about Alison Finn.

781
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,797
<i>It was during
my residency.</i>

782
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,733
There was a walk-in clinic
at the university.

783
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:20,002
I saw her maybe
three times.

784
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,771
She saw other people
there as well,

785
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,908
called the suicide
line every other night.

786
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,076
She was a
paranoid schizophrenic

787
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,547
and a drug addict.
Very sick girl.

788
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:32,781
She knew where you lived.

789
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:33,882
She stalked me.

790
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,552
The letter says you
took her to London.

791
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,754
Never.

792
00:57:38,756 --> 00:57:40,722
Why are they writing this?

793
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:42,791
Their daughter
committed suicide

794
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,594
and left a very
graphic note, naming me.

795
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,132
It never happened. Look.

796
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:53,735
It's not unusual for there to
be emotional transference between

797
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,637
a patient
and a therapist.

798
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,640
Had her perform
oral sex in your car?

799
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,043
Never! It was a fantasy!

800
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,200
<i>Depression can
take away your energy.</i>

801
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,704
<i>It can steal away your time.</i>

802
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,788
<i>A number
of years ago,</i>

803
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,623
<i>I had a patient who
was having an affair.</i>

804
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:57,693
Came in here every week like
he was going to confession.

805
00:59:57,695 --> 01:00:00,362
Cried, repented.
Didn't stop.

806
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,901
Then one day, he comes
in and says it's over.

807
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:09,204
He's finally got a handle on his
issues, like some great epiphany.

808
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,942
It was about six
or seven months later

809
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:18,246
his wife turns up and says he has a
whole other family in another state.

810
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,717
He'd been lying to her.

811
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,186
And he was lying to me.

812
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:30,025
The kids blamed me. The wife blamed
me. Even the patient blamed me.

813
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,095
At times, I blamed me.

814
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:40,068
The point is the cardiologist can
see it coming, the heart attack,

815
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:43,171
from the tests.
It's in the blood.

816
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,408
But who can
see the lies?

817
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,778
Or the past,
or the sadness?

818
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:58,420
You didn't tell me
you wrote the article.

819
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:02,224
We were consulting on a
patient, not comparing rsums.

820
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:04,860
It would have been
a little self-involved

821
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:07,262
for me to mention it,
don't you think?

822
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:09,765
It wasn't about me,
it was about Emily.

823
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:13,402
Why didn't you tell me
about the sleepwalking?

824
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,237
Me tell you?

825
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,406
She told you
about them.

826
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:19,207
And you kept her
on the Ablixa.

827
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,276
It was a decision
you made, Jon.

828
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,846
How did you know that?

829
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:25,914
Know what?

830
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,454
That she had more than one
episode. How would you know that?

831
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,259
Did she have them when
she was your patient?

832
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:39,828
I know because
it's in the news.

833
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,164
That's how I know.

834
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,933
Everyone knows.

835
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,303
Everyone knows
everything, Jon.

836
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,416
Like that?
At that speed?

837
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,452
No, faster than that.
Oh, faster than that.

838
01:02:03,454 --> 01:02:07,089
Yeah, and she was
carrying the seat belt.

839
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:08,724
She was wearing the
seat belt? Are you sure?

840
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:09,858
Yeah, I saw it!

841
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,733
<i>One moment, you're living high
on the hog, and the next moment,</i>

842
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,969
you're visiting your hubby
in jail, eating ramen?

843
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,138
Who wouldn't be depressed?

844
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,841
And then what happened..

845
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:29,044
Oh, God,
it's just so tragic.

846
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,982
I've suffered from my own
depression, so I understand.

847
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:37,519
I'm sorry to hear that.

848
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:42,858
"Every afternoon, around 3:00,
like a poisonous fog bank rolling in"

849
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,260
"on my mind,
and I'm paralyzed."

850
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,895
"A poisonous fog"?

851
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:49,264
That's not me. It's William
Styron. Yes. William Styron.

852
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,433
<i>Darkness Visible.
Darkness Visible.</i>

853
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,369
<i>There are times when I feel
I could have written it, but..</i>

854
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,506
<i>So is she</i>

855
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:59,875
doing any better?

856
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:01,076
I'm keeping
an eye on her.

857
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,860
Excuse me.
Are you Julia?

858
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,930
Julia? Are you Julia?

859
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:27,035
Sorry to disturb you.
Are you Julia? No.

860
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:29,070
Julia? Are you Julia?

861
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:30,872
No, I'm Joan.
Julia.

862
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:32,908
Is there a.. Are you
Julia? No, I'm Susan.

863
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,176
Is there
something else?

864
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:37,245
I wanted to speak
to her friend, Julia.

865
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:40,949
Julia? I don't think we
have a Julia that works here.

866
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,384
Really?

867
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,487
Hey.

868
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,257
Look at this.

869
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:53,195
She knew all about airbags and
seat belts. Fucking commercial runs

870
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:56,064
on a loop in the lobby
where she works.

871
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,468
Where were you?
What?

872
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,239
You forgot me
at school.

873
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:06,508
I was here.
I was doing this.

874
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,944
Honey, go to your room. Start your
homework. I'll be there in a minute.

875
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:10,512
I'm sorry.

876
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,250
What is all this?
The Delatrex thing?

877
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,485
No, look, I went
to her office.

878
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:20,288
There is no Julia at
work who takes Ablixa.

879
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,291
What are you
talking about?

880
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,527
Why did she
make up Julia?

881
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:31,299
I don't know.
Isn't she sick?

882
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:34,336
I thought sick people
sometimes make things up.

883
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:43,278
<i>Yeah, much better.
I've been doing a lot of..</i>

884
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,148
running on the treadmill here to try
and get in shape and stimulate serotonin.

885
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,118
You're not feeling like
you're in a "poisonous fog"?

886
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,120
No.

887
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,289
No, not so much anymore.

888
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,493
That phrase really
stuck with me.

889
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,029
How did you
come by it?

890
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,467
I don't know, really. Um..

891
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,104
I guess it's just..

892
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:11,473
I guess that's how
I felt back then.

893
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:14,276
You know, maybe I heard it
or read it somewhere.

894
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:20,282
Back on the boat with Martin, we
used to always see the fog rolling in.

895
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:23,451
I'm sure a lot of depressed
people have felt that way before.

896
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:29,524
The important thing is that I
think the fog is finally lifting.

897
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:33,395
And I really think I'm going to
be ready to get out of here soon.

898
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,102
I have to go, I'm sorry. I
have a meeting in the city.

899
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:48,143
Do you think maybe, uh, next time
you could stay a little longer?

900
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:51,479
It's just I don't have
any other visitors

901
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:54,582
and this is really all I
have to look forward to.

902
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,520
What about your
friend, Julia?

903
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,489
Julia?

904
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,627
Yes. From the ad agency.

905
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:10,165
Oh, Julia. No, I worked
with Julia at the bar.

906
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:13,668
I haven't heard from her
since everything happened.

907
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,205
I haven't heard
from most people.

908
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:22,677
Are you okay?

909
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:31,219
I know what it's like to have your
entire life change out from under you.

910
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:37,525
The only difference is, you didn't
do anything wrong and Martin did.

911
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,529
<i>So,
the reason I calle.</i>

912
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:44,099
I mean, with all the attention
in the paper on the Taylor case,

913
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:46,201
and with the ethics
probe and such,

914
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,536
I wanted to tell
you that, um..

915
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,707
We need to ask you
to step off the study.

916
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,442
I'm sure it's all
blown out of proportion,

917
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,411
but we can't have you
on the payroll now.

918
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:58,380
I could be anonymous.

919
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,582
Still do the work.

920
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,518
I'm real sorry.

921
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,787
I feel horrible
about this.

922
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:12,227
Maybe you can be part of
another study when this is over.

923
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:13,628
All right, then.

924
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,131
The funny thing is, with
Sadler-Benelux in the toilet,

925
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:17,565
we're up like 30%.

926
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,368
What?

927
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,705
The guys down on Wall Street are cashing
in because of what happened with Ablixa.

928
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:26,307
Worked out
super well for us.

929
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,209
<i>You can bet
on a stock to go down,</i>

930
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,512
<i>just like you can
bet on it to go up.</i>

931
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:32,614
A few days before 9/11,

932
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:37,485
there was a huge surge in the
purchase of options of airline stock.

933
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:40,088
No one knows why.
It's a complete mystery.

934
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:43,358
But United fell 40%
after the planes crashed

935
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,260
and people made
a lot of money.

936
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:49,097
Thinking something's going
to happen isn't illegal.

937
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:51,599
Breaking the law to make it
happen is a different story.

938
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,636
Jon, I know what insider trading
is. I used to work in finance.

939
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:56,704
Sure, you do,
but, look. See!

940
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,242
Hey. See what happened
at Sadler-Benelux

941
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,811
right after
Martin Taylor died.

942
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:05,346
Down. Way down.

943
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:09,651
AziLyle, on the other
hand.. up. Way up.

944
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:12,587
She did it. She made
it happen, do you see?

945
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:14,355
Do you see?
Ablixa was her idea!

946
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:17,225
But you prescribed it.
You did that.

947
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,730
I got a job today.

948
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,835
Huh? They offered me full time.

949
01:08:26,837 --> 01:08:29,504
I left you a message
this morning.

950
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:32,307
I didn't hear. My phone was off
'cause I was at the hospital.

951
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:34,542
Hopefully with this and the consulting
money we can finally get back..

952
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:37,879
No, the Delatrex thing
is over. It's gone.

953
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:40,748
They fired me.

954
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:42,884
What?

955
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:47,255
When?
Today.

956
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:50,291
That's why I have to make
this thing with Emily work.

957
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,228
I'm not letting another
Alison Finn happen,

958
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:56,331
I don't want to hear
about Emily or Alison.

959
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,699
But this is starting
to make sense now!

960
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,268
No, it's not
making sense!

961
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:04,405
It doesn't make sense that you're
sitting here doing this all day long!

962
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:07,175
The case is over.

963
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:09,878
The photographers are gone,
your partners are gone,

964
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,447
the Delatrex thing
is now gone.

965
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,252
You're the only one
that's still here.

966
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:20,421
I just want to
know what happened.

967
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:23,291
A woman you were treating
killed her husband.

968
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,461
That's what happened.

969
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,935
<i>But I already
told the truth.</i>

970
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:37,438
That's what this
test will help to prove.

971
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,873
How does it do that?

972
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:41,776
It helps to show your
true state of mind.

973
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:45,680
Sodium amytal gives us a
window into someone's psyche.

974
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,448
It lowers inhibitions.

975
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,785
We make a video of the test
and we show it to the judge.

976
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,456
It's just you know
how I feel about drugs.

977
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:58,259
Emily, this is the
fastest way out of here.

978
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,629
What does it do to me?

979
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:04,966
Initially, you'll
feel light-headed.

980
01:10:04,968 --> 01:10:10,338
And then you will get a
sense of well-being. Calm.

981
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,474
After a few minutes, you'll
probably get drowsy and fall asleep.

982
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,243
What do you do while
that's happening?

983
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:16,811
I ask questions.

984
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:20,748
You answer. You say whatever
you feel about what happened.

985
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,585
What motivated you to come
and see me in the first place?

986
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:25,853
My motivation was to
get over my depression

987
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,822
and to have a life
with my husband.

988
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:29,824
Then that's what
this will show.

989
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:31,793
What if I say
something else?

990
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,930
What do you mean?

991
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:39,901
I just mean, what if I say something
that makes my situation worse?

992
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:45,940
You say anything you're not happy
with, I'll destroy the video.

993
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,414
How old are you, Emily?

994
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:54,749
Twenty-eight.

995
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,353
Where are we?

996
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:02,890
Wards Island
Psychiatric Forensic Center.

997
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,395
What is the capital
of New York?

998
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,565
Albany.

999
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,901
Do you know
why you're here?

1000
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,373
Because my
husband is dead.

1001
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,907
How did he die?

1002
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:24,579
They said I stabbed him,
but I can't remember.

1003
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,650
Did you want him dead? Did
you kill Martin on purpose?

1004
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:31,519
No.

1005
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:35,423
I wanted us to sail away together
on the boat, all three of us.

1006
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,059
The three of you?

1007
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,562
Madeleine.

1008
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,331
What happened
to Madeleine?

1009
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,001
I lost her
because I was sad

1010
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:50,705
and she didn't want to stay
inside a sad person anymore.

1011
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,745
He gave me so much and
then they took him away.

1012
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,947
I wanted to give
him a daughter.

1013
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:03,951
But you killed him.

1014
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:08,089
Were you angry with him?
Did you hate him?

1015
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:11,759
No. I never would have hurt him.
I loved everything about him.

1016
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:14,595
The way he smelled,

1017
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:17,532
his hands. Everything
about him, I loved.

1018
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:19,400
Did you do it
for the money?

1019
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:20,968
Like he did?

1020
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:24,939
Emily.

1021
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,910
I loved everything
about him.

1022
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,746
<i>Emily, can you hear me?</i>

1023
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:33,748
<i>I can't remember.</i>

1024
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,516
That's what she said in her
statement. She doesn't remember.

1025
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,684
She's lying.

1026
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,519
What does her
falling asleep prove?

1027
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,455
You have to destroy this.
You're torturing the poor woman.

1028
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:50,498
It's saline.

1029
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,935
I gave her saltwater.

1030
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:55,036
What?

1031
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:56,804
There was no drug.

1032
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,108
So, why did
she pass out?

1033
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:04,479
You don't put in a performance
like that on saltwater.

1034
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:07,115
Call the hospital.
Order a blood test.

1035
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:09,984
You won't find any
amytal in her system.

1036
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,454
She's been lying
this whole time.

1037
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,031
Destroy that.

1038
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,535
No. Call the hospital.

1039
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:29,070
Order a blood test.
Not a chance.

1040
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:31,572
We have her. Arrest her. Dr. Banks..

1041
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:32,940
I want my life back!

1042
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,442
Destroy it before
it destroys you.

1043
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:37,011
She knew the safety
features of the car..

1044
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:39,414
You don't want to say
that to me or to anyone.

1045
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:41,482
Another thing. Sadler-Benelux
is down. Stop talking, Dr. Banks.

1046
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,017
Stop! It's too late!
Millions of dollars were made!

1047
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,853
No! You could have
worked with us! I asked.

1048
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:49,056
The verdict's in. It's too fucking
late for whatever that circus is

1049
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:50,158
that you just
showed me.

1050
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,560
You see, we can't
just start over.

1051
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:54,595
We have double jeopardy
laws in this country.

1052
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,531
Check her bank account.

1053
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:59,700
We did. We always do. Nothing.

1054
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:03,104
No insurance policy, no stock
holdings, no inheritance from Martin.

1055
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,207
And you didn't catch it
and someone died.

1056
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,512
And I didn't catch it and
someone didn't go to jail.

1057
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:14,148
We failed.

1058
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,851
See, that's what your little stunt
proves. If it proves anything,

1059
01:14:16,853 --> 01:14:18,920
it proves we got beat.

1060
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:21,889
And that you
lied to a woman

1061
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:25,893
who's not guilty about what
you were putting in her arm.

1062
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,562
Now, I don't know how
you feel about that,

1063
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:29,831
but I would rather it
stay between you and me.

1064
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,968
You were never here.

1065
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,870
<i>Just come out there</i>

1066
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:38,873
and see her once. Please.

1067
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,042
She wasn't depressed.

1068
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:42,977
I actually
can prove it.

1069
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,012
Why would I
examine her now?

1070
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:47,548
Is that what you wanted
to see me about? Shit, Jon!

1071
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:50,518
I solved it finally, on
my own. Just come see her.

1072
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,186
You're stuck in
some old place, Jon.

1073
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,088
I think you need someone
to help pull you out.

1074
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:57,024
I can refer someone good.
Are you still seeing her?

1075
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:58,993
I'm consulting. I'm
her expert on this case.

1076
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,062
Well, that has to stop!

1077
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:03,931
You want to make it go away, you go out
to Wards Island and resign from the case.

1078
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,032
Step off.
I can't do that.

1079
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,268
Well, then it's not
going to go away.

1080
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,871
Okay, you won't come
and see her with me? No.

1081
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:14,108
Some Adderall. Just a
short term, 20 milligrams.

1082
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,879
That's why you called,
isn't it? I'm struggling

1083
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:21,215
to hold focus here, Gene. That's
what it's for, to help people focus.

1084
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:22,617
You want to focus
on something,

1085
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:24,051
focus on never
seeing her again.

1086
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,759
<i>D, I've been thinking
about what you said.</i>

1087
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,762
Look, you're right.
It's time to move on.

1088
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:37,098
I'm heading over to
Wards Island right now.

1089
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,066
<i>I'm not gonna
see her again.</i>

1090
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:01,789
You went to see Emily.

1091
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,124
Damn right, I did.

1092
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,826
You could have
called me first.

1093
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:07,295
She called me.

1094
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:09,564
She was very upset.

1095
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,933
It was kind of a dramatic
stunt to pull on a woman

1096
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:15,736
who's already in a great
deal of emotional pain.

1097
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,105
I don't understand
your thinking.

1098
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,277
I'm trying to determine
her state of mind

1099
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:26,581
so I can chart the best
course of treatment.

1100
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,583
"Treatment"?

1101
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:30,718
You gave an amytal
interview to a woman

1102
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,588
who's been declared
not guilty.

1103
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,122
I hope you
learned something.

1104
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:36,324
Oh, I did.

1105
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,960
Quite a lot, actually.

1106
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:43,764
I think she requires
more observation.

1107
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,132
And she'll need more
medication as well.

1108
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:08,155
This is Dr. Siebert
on Bridge Street.

1109
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:10,825
I'd like an envelope
delivered to Manhattan.

1110
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,699
Hey.

1111
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,305
Where's the little guy?

1112
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,375
Fuck!

1113
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:29,210
I'm not going to
go to the police,

1114
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:31,278
or whomever one goes
to in this situation.

1115
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,280
I'm just going to go away.

1116
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,684
What? Wait! Hey, wait!

1117
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,319
Wait?

1118
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:41,088
Wait for this
to happen again?

1119
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,058
Another Alison or Emily?

1120
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,329
Oh, wow. See?

1121
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:51,165
Okay, these
prove everything.

1122
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,767
She took these.

1123
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,937
These were sent by a
friend of the husband's.

1124
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,272
No, that's not true.

1125
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,807
Stay away from us.

1126
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,309
Wait! Dierdre!

1127
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,881
Dierdre. Dierdre,
wait a minute.

1128
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:08,916
No, Jon. Wait a minute. Hello, love.

1129
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,999
<i>You have two
unheard messages.</i>

1130
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:26,734
<i>First unheard message.</i>

1131
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:29,837
<i>Yes, Dr. Banks?
This is Jeffrey Chils</i>

1132
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:32,440
<i>from the Office of
Medical Conduct Revi.</i>

1133
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:36,377
<i>I have some questions about
Alison Finn. Can you call me at..</i>

1134
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:38,913
<i>Deleted.</i>

1135
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,050
<i>This is Dr. Siebert.</i>

1136
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:45,720
<i>I'm sure you've received
my latest notes</i>

1137
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:48,723
<i>concerning the Emily
Taylor case by now.</i>

1138
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,758
<i>There is,
I think you'll agree,</i>

1139
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,960
<i>a different course
of treatment to pursue</i>

1140
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:56,363
<i>that is in everyone's
best interest.</i>

1141
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:59,133
<i>Maybe we can meet
for a coffee? Thanks.</i>

1142
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:02,369
<i>Saved.
End of new messages.</i>

1143
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:06,340
<i>Check erased messages.
Press 1-9.</i>

1144
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:09,276
<i>You could get
national coverage on thi.</i>

1145
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,146
"Shrinks fucking patients"

1146
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:15,216
"and manipulating them
into killing their spouses."

1147
01:19:15,218 --> 01:19:16,484
Hot stuff.

1148
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,055
I would say this would
ruin your practice.

1149
01:19:21,057 --> 01:19:22,923
But wait.

1150
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,459
You don't have
a practice anymore

1151
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:29,363
or a wife or a kid,
I'm betting.

1152
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:34,101
So what else
can you lose?

1153
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,304
Martha can certainly use
those in a wrongful death suit.

1154
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,074
State revoke
your license, yet?

1155
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,112
I always tell
my patients,

1156
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,448
"You know what the best
predictor of future behavior is?"

1157
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,551
"Past behavior."

1158
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:53,454
Well, you don't have
any more patients.

1159
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:56,857
The only problem with having
a crazy person for a partner

1160
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:59,393
is they tend
to stay crazy.

1161
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:00,928
You should know
how difficult it is

1162
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:03,264
to cure a pretty girl
with daddy issues.

1163
01:20:03,266 --> 01:20:06,801
Nice try, Jon.
I'm not buying it.

1164
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,003
Spend the fucking money now.

1165
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,339
Because they're
coming to take it back.

1166
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,477
What are you
talking about?

1167
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,147
You could go
and ask her.

1168
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,449
Only she asked me to
keep you from seeing her.

1169
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,352
She told me everything.

1170
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:35,095
Everything? No, I'll
tell you everything.

1171
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:37,965
You wouldn't be here if
you had nothing to lose.

1172
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:41,001
She already got a "not guilty"
verdict. You, on the other hand..

1173
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:44,038
Fuck you! You get her out of
there right now, you hear me?

1174
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,341
You do that and you won't hear
from either one of us again.

1175
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,176
Yeah, you can go back
to chatting with

1176
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,245
rich white people
about their problems.

1177
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:54,315
She's cured,
as of right now, Jon.

1178
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,384
You're a fucking genius!

1179
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:05,192
<i>She's been
very agitated late.</i>

1180
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,462
I think it best we
restrict her visitors.

1181
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:12,199
And no phone calls, either,
without notifying me first.

1182
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,635
She's been resisting
her medication as well.

1183
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:17,071
Very confrontational
with the staff.

1184
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:18,973
She seems to be
getting worse.

1185
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:20,374
Mmm. I was afraid of that.

1186
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,914
That's a mouth guard.

1187
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:30,484
It stops her smashing her
teeth, biting her tongue off.

1188
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:33,087
The current lasts
for about five seconds.

1189
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:37,358
They'll have administered
a paralytic agent,

1190
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,560
but they put a tourniquet
on the ankle, you see?

1191
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,562
To make sure she
is having a seizure.

1192
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,665
Keep your eye
on that foot.

1193
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,370
It's actually been shown
to be remarkably effective

1194
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:50,638
for treating
severe depression.

1195
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,173
None of the side effects
you get with pills.

1196
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:56,543
No idea what it might
do to a normal person.

1197
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:59,280
I also wanted to
give you another test.

1198
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:02,616
A personality inventory. Just a
series of true-or-false questions.

1199
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,485
<i>First saved voice messag.</i>

1200
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:06,620
<i>This is Dr. Sieber.</i>

1201
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:09,056
<i>I'm sure you've receivd
my latest notes</i>

1202
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:11,158
<i>concerning the Emiy
Taylor case by now.</i>

1203
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,693
Not a very subtle tool,

1204
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:14,428
but the results will be
of interest to the board.

1205
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,463
<i>A different course
of treatment to purse</i>

1206
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:17,498
<i>that is in everyone
best interest.</i>

1207
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,433
They like hard
data to look at.

1208
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,503
Wait. What is she saying?

1209
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:24,471
Who?

1210
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,179
I don't think you should
be my doctor anymore.

1211
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:34,148
I think you should
resign my case.

1212
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:40,321
Victoria's paying me
way too much for that.

1213
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,624
Out of your share,
I assume.

1214
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,263
The shock treatment was her
idea. It damages the memory.

1215
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:53,334
It's in our best interest
that you start forgetting.

1216
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,604
Are you ready for your
treatment, Ms. Taylor?

1217
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,511
Oh, no, I scheduled
it for tomorrow.

1218
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:16,991
I need to use
the phone.

1219
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:18,525
You can be next.

1220
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,366
I need to call
my lawyer now.

1221
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,169
Are you going
to be long?

1222
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:30,371
You going to be long?
I need to use the phone.

1223
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,242
Are you going to be long?
Isn't there a time limit?

1224
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,211
I need to call someone. My
shrink is fucking with me.

1225
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,780
Can you get off now?

1226
01:23:39,782 --> 01:23:42,316
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor.
You've been restricted.

1227
01:23:42,318 --> 01:23:44,718
By who?
By Dr. Banks?

1228
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,689
He's not my doctor anymore.
He attacked me. He's sick.

1229
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,491
Miss Taylor,
you need to step back.

1230
01:23:50,493 --> 01:23:53,694
Get off the phone.
Get off the phone!

1231
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:56,397
Miss Taylor,
you need to relax.

1232
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,635
Get me Dr. Siebert!
This is bullshit!

1233
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:05,506
I shouldn't even be here! I'm not
sick! Get me Dr. Siebert! No! No!

1234
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:08,175
Relax! Relax!

1235
01:24:08,177 --> 01:24:09,743
No, I don't want it!
I don't want it!

1236
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:12,713
Yes. Dr. Siebert?

1237
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:14,715
Dr. Banks.

1238
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,553
I've been thinking about
our last conversation.

1239
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,255
Yes.

1240
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,425
An idea occurred to me.

1241
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,193
Mmm-hmm.

1242
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:28,195
Maybe I am a genius.

1243
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:46,213
Hello there! Best we
don't talk inside, right?

1244
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:48,182
Talk about what?

1245
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:51,085
Uh, she wants to go
before the judge this week.

1246
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,619
And what is she
going to say?

1247
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:55,122
Well,
it depends.

1248
01:24:55,124 --> 01:24:58,692
She could tell a long, sordid
story about her former shrink.

1249
01:24:58,694 --> 01:25:01,095
Suggest the SEC investigate.
The whole story.

1250
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,796
That would make national
coverage, wouldn't it?

1251
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,434
And what do you get out
of it? Oh, I don't know.

1252
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:11,472
Peace of mind. Like I said, it depends.

1253
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:18,879
No.

1254
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,782
No, no.

1255
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:28,622
This will be the last
time we speak. Okay?

1256
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:32,793
You get her released, and we
go back to being strangers.

1257
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,731
Unless, of course, you want
to consult on other patients.

1258
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,671
No.

1259
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,397
The staff told me you were
having a difficult time.

1260
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,404
So, I've added
medication that will help.

1261
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,817
If I tell you the truth,
do I have to take the pills?

1262
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,591
I won't be able to tell the
truth if I take any more pills.

1263
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:45,585
<i>Imagine everything
you ever wanted</i>

1264
01:28:45,587 --> 01:28:47,854
<i>shows up one day and
calls itself your li.</i>

1265
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,459
<i>And then, just when you
start to believe in it.</i>

1266
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:56,396
<i>Gone. And sudden,
it gets</i>

1267
01:28:56,398 --> 01:28:59,566
<i>very hard
to imagine a futur.</i>

1268
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:01,802
<i>That's depression, right?</i>

1269
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:16,550
<i>So I went to
see Dr. Sieber.</i>

1270
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,986
<i>We talked abt
my childhood.</i>

1271
01:29:19,988 --> 01:29:23,523
<i>About disappointmet
and Mommy and Dadd.</i>

1272
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,959
<i>And I told hr
about Martin.</i>

1273
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,528
<i>And she told me that her
marriage with her husband</i>

1274
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,865
<i>had never been anythg
but a meeting of min.</i>

1275
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,702
<i>And minds start to
wander after a whi.</i>

1276
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,373
<i>He had traded her in for
a younger model, so she was</i>

1277
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:42,409
<i>alone and lonely.
It didn't take muc.</i>

1278
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,114
<i>I think she alwas
liked girls,</i>

1279
01:29:47,116 --> 01:29:49,583
<i>she just never found oe
she liked as much as m.</i>

1280
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:56,056
<i>She taught me w
to be depresse.</i>

1281
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:59,726
<i>What drugs had
which side effec.</i>

1282
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,062
<i>What symptoms went
with what diagnosi.</i>

1283
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,898
<i>And I taught hr
everything Marn</i>

1284
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,902
<i>ever told me about
derivatives and deal.</i>

1285
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:12,406
<i>The trades were in her nam.
So I forgave Martin.</i>

1286
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:14,040
<i>I went to vit
on the weekes</i>

1287
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,076
<i>and told him that
I would wait for h.</i>

1288
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,128
<i>What do you docts
call faking?</i>

1289
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,430
<i>"Malingering"?</i>

1290
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:39,099
<i>Such a funny word.</i>

1291
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:43,737
<i>Girls learn to fake thins
at a very early age.</i>

1292
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:47,073
<i>Probably around the same time
that boys are learning to li.</i>

1293
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:56,550
<i>We needed everyone to see how much
I wanted it to work out with us.</i>

1294
01:30:56,552 --> 01:30:59,119
<i>How much I lovd
my husband.</i>

1295
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:01,655
<i>And how terriby
depressed I wa.</i>

1296
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,494
<i>When did you
decide to kill him?</i>

1297
01:31:07,496 --> 01:31:10,530
<i>It's not a decision
you make just once.</i>

1298
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:12,966
<i>You make it ovr
and over again,</i>

1299
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,602
<i>every time you
look at your le</i>

1300
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:18,839
<i>and you see the position
you're in and who put you there.</i>

1301
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:24,811
<i>Each and every fucking
problem, every disappointment.</i>

1302
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:26,780
<i>And you thk
to yoursel,</i>

1303
01:31:26,782 --> 01:31:30,684
<i>"Maybe if he just goes awa,
it'll all get better. "</i>

1304
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,536
<i>Everything would he
worked out perfecty</i>

1305
01:31:49,538 --> 01:31:52,672
<i>if you had just
disappeared after the trial</i>

1306
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,708
<i>like you we
supposed t.</i>

1307
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,943
<i>Why me?</i>

1308
01:31:56,945 --> 01:31:58,979
Was it because
of Alison Finn?

1309
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:04,251
That was just
a happy coincidence.

1310
01:32:04,253 --> 01:32:06,553
A convenient distraction.

1311
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:08,255
It didn't have
to be you.

1312
01:32:08,257 --> 01:32:10,056
It could have been
you or anyone else

1313
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:12,192
who walked into my room
with a prescription pad.

1314
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:16,129
We didn't go looking for you,
we just looked at the world.

1315
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,238
<i>I read somewhere tt
there's a differene</i>

1316
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,207
<i>between tears of jy
and tears of rage.</i>

1317
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:29,543
<i>Is that true?</i>

1318
01:32:29,545 --> 01:32:31,778
<i>It's in the chemistry, but
you can't tell by looking</i>

1319
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:34,114
<i>they all just
look like tear.</i>

1320
01:32:44,326 --> 01:32:48,328
Hello? Hello, I think I
need help! I think my..

1321
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:52,232
My husband's bleeding and I think
he's.. I think he's been stabbed

1322
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:56,169
and he's dead. He's
dead, I think he's dead.

1323
01:32:56,171 --> 01:32:59,039
I think he's dead!
You need to send someone!

1324
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:00,707
Please!

1325
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:12,185
You never did take the Paxil, did you?

1326
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:15,055
No.

1327
01:33:15,057 --> 01:33:16,256
Or the Zoloft.

1328
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:18,325
No.

1329
01:33:18,327 --> 01:33:20,060
Only the Ablixa.

1330
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:23,029
Didn't really do
anything for me.

1331
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:29,135
So, when did she
start paying you?

1332
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:40,080
She always knew you'd
turn on her someday

1333
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:45,218
like you did
with Martin.

1334
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:51,324
Past behavior is the best
predictor of future behavior.

1335
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,861
That's what she
said about you.

1336
01:33:57,231 --> 01:34:00,166
And how long do you two
plan on keeping me here?

1337
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:08,141
Why would we ever
let you leave?

1338
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:11,778
Because

1339
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:15,248
maybe there's
a better deal.

1340
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:30,764
<i>Over the course of her confinement,
I've come to the conclusion</i>

1341
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:33,366
<i>with a reasonable degre
of medical certainty</i>

1342
01:34:33,368 --> 01:34:38,438
<i>that Emily Taylor is neither
mentally ill or dangerous</i>

1343
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:42,075
at this time. I believe
with the proper treatment

1344
01:34:42,077 --> 01:34:46,312
she is not a threat
to herself or others.

1345
01:34:46,314 --> 01:34:48,882
In my opinion,
she's ready to move onto

1346
01:34:48,884 --> 01:34:50,950
the next phase
of rehabilitation

1347
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:53,687
with ongoing supervision,
as outlined

1348
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:57,357
in the outpatient
order of conditions.

1349
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:03,196
The risk of relapse back into
a dangerous mental state is low.

1350
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,033
I've submitted to the court the
conditions under which I believe

1351
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:10,437
the order of confinement
may be rescinded.

1352
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:14,841
And do you, Ms. Taylor, understand

1353
01:35:14,843 --> 01:35:17,410
that if you violate the
terms of your release,

1354
01:35:17,412 --> 01:35:20,080
I will have to issue a
new order of confinement?

1355
01:35:20,082 --> 01:35:21,381
Yes, Your Honor.

1356
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:48,475
I text her
like 20 times a day.

1357
01:35:48,477 --> 01:35:52,078
Zach, you're beginning
to see a pattern, right?

1358
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,783
Everyone leaves. It's not
a pattern, it's a fact.

1359
01:35:56,785 --> 01:35:59,786
And how does this connect
to you being adopted?

1360
01:35:59,788 --> 01:36:02,088
I think
it started there.

1361
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,923
And now
I'm making it happen.

1362
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:07,827
You know, I get scared that
people will leave and then

1363
01:36:07,829 --> 01:36:12,298
I, uh,
end up making them leave.

1364
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,901
Excuse me, Dr. Siebert,
I think someone wants you.

1365
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:23,309
Uh, I'm sorry, Zach,
this is an emergency.

1366
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:25,311
We're gonna have to
pick this up next time.

1367
01:36:25,313 --> 01:36:26,980
You didn't tell Banks anything, did you?

1368
01:36:26,982 --> 01:36:29,816
Of course not.

1369
01:36:29,818 --> 01:36:33,019
How much did you have
to pay him to get me out?

1370
01:36:33,021 --> 01:36:36,322
It doesn't matter. You're
out. It's taken care of.

1371
01:36:36,324 --> 01:36:39,259
You didn't leave
me much choice.

1372
01:36:39,261 --> 01:36:41,995
What did you do with
the rest of the money?

1373
01:36:41,997 --> 01:36:43,997
Two accounts.

1374
01:36:43,999 --> 01:36:46,332
Mine's in Dubai,
yours is in Grand Cayman.

1375
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:52,038
God.

1376
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:55,809
Are you sure you didn't
tell him anything else?

1377
01:36:55,811 --> 01:37:01,848
Because there are SEC violations.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

1378
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:03,483
I'm exposed here.

1379
01:37:03,485 --> 01:37:04,951
Yes, you are.

1380
01:37:04,953 --> 01:37:06,419
And I'm vulnerable.

1381
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:12,225
Oh, God, I missed you.

1382
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:19,899
You taught me to be
such a sad, sad girl.

1383
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:23,903
Do I look sad now?

1384
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,343
Do you remember
the first time?

1385
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:31,511
Yeah.

1386
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:33,279
Do you remember
how wet I made you?

1387
01:37:33,281 --> 01:37:34,347
Oh, yeah.

1388
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:36,249
Do you want
to do that again?

1389
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,318
Yeah.

1390
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:01,407
What the fuck is that?

1391
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:03,409
You didn't leave
me much choice.

1392
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:07,447
Oh, my God.

1393
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,989
Dr. Siebert,
you're under arrest.

1394
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:17,390
You're being charged
with conspiracy to

1395
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,592
commit murder and
securities fraud.

1396
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:54,160
Within the next 10 minutes.
I think she's just arrived.

1397
01:38:54,162 --> 01:38:55,495
Yeah, she's here.

1398
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:58,698
And thank you.

1399
01:39:05,205 --> 01:39:07,340
Here I am.
Cured at last.

1400
01:39:07,342 --> 01:39:08,408
You're late.

1401
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:09,709
How long do
I have to stay?

1402
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:19,285
I'm going to put you
on some medication.

1403
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:20,653
What?

1404
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:24,457
This is for Thorazine.

1405
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:27,460
It's a tranquilizer,
been around for years.

1406
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:29,162
You know the people
shuffling around

1407
01:39:29,164 --> 01:39:31,631
like zombies with vacant
eyes in the prison ward?

1408
01:39:32,433 --> 01:39:33,466
They were on Thorazine.

1409
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,203
So this is
for Depakote.

1410
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:41,174
It'll settle
your mood,

1411
01:39:41,176 --> 01:39:42,375
but hair loss

1412
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:44,544
is a side effect.

1413
01:39:48,182 --> 01:39:49,582
What is this?

1414
01:39:49,584 --> 01:39:51,384
As part of our arrangement,
I'll also be sending you

1415
01:39:51,386 --> 01:39:53,186
to the Gramercy
for urine tests

1416
01:39:53,188 --> 01:39:57,023
to make certain you take your
meds. And I'm seeing you again

1417
01:39:57,025 --> 01:39:59,492
tomorrow, all right?
Try not to be late.

1418
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:01,194
Angry people are
frequently late.

1419
01:40:01,196 --> 01:40:02,729
This is bullshit!

1420
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:06,099
You sound angry. Have
you read the court order?

1421
01:40:06,101 --> 01:40:08,334
You have to obey the
terms of your release.

1422
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,436
Yeah, I'm here.

1423
01:40:10,438 --> 01:40:14,440
Those terms mandate that if I
believe you are a danger in any way

1424
01:40:14,442 --> 01:40:17,543
I need to send you back
to hospital immediately.

1425
01:40:17,545 --> 01:40:20,213
If I don't, I'm in violation of the law.

1426
01:40:20,215 --> 01:40:23,549
I got Siebert for you.
I'm a cooperating witness.

1427
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:26,452
"Very noncompliant.. " The
deal was I testify against her

1428
01:40:26,454 --> 01:40:28,354
and I get out. ".. With
a history of violence."

1429
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:30,456
This isn't out, this
is fucked! "Dangerous."

1430
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:33,059
I think this needs
a new diagnosis.

1431
01:40:33,061 --> 01:40:34,761
Based on what?
What did I do?

1432
01:40:34,763 --> 01:40:39,032
"There are objects and creatures
all around us only I can see,"

1433
01:40:39,034 --> 01:40:42,702
You filled that out!
Schizoaffective disorder.

1434
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:44,404
I think I need
to send you back.

1435
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:51,611
Mrs. Taylor!

1436
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,283
Emily Taylor!

1437
01:40:58,218 --> 01:40:59,752
Miss Taylor, stop!

1438
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:07,393
Central,
we have a 330-20.

1439
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:10,263
No, he's lying!
He's lying!

1440
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:13,533
I'm not sick, I'm not sick!
I promise I'm not sick!

1441
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:16,502
He's the sick one! He
just wants the money!

1442
01:41:16,504 --> 01:41:18,771
No, I'm not sick,
I promise!

1443
01:41:18,773 --> 01:41:20,840
Don't bring me back,
I don't want to go back!

1444
01:41:20,842 --> 01:41:23,576
I don't want to go back!
I don't want to go back!

1445
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:41,387
How are you
doing today, Emily?

1446
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:45,658
Better.

1447
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:50,563
Much better.

1448
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,880
