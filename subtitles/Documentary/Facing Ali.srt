1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,639
<i>Beautiful.</i>

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,639
<i>Rumble, young man.</i>

3
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,910
<i>Cook, Champ.</i>

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,746
Float like a butterfly, Champ.

5
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,117
Rumble, young man.

6
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,852
Cook, Champ.

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,926
Everybody stop talking now. Attention.

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,266
I told you... All of my critics...

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,102
<i>I told you all that I qas
the greatest of all time...</i>

10
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,208
Let's go back to the beginning.

11
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:58,482
Every race and color that's
ever came to this country...

12
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,616
have shed they blood in this ring.

13
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,253
In the '20s and '30s...

14
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,663
you had the immigrant nations
all going to America.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,832
That's why you had all the Jewish fighters,
Irish fighters...

16
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,736
and Italian fighters.

17
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,638
The game hasn't changed.

18
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,975
It's just different people playing the part.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,378
- Boom. Boom.
- You had to fight to make a living.

20
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,723
You can lose your life giving the people
what they wanna see.

21
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:38,696
Nowadays, nine out of 10
are Mexican, Puerto Rican...

22
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,665
'cause they're the biggest
influx now into America.

23
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,430
One-two combination...
Left, right, boom.

24
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,200
This is what built America, man.

25
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,641
Every freakin' one of us...

26
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,874
have shed our blood in this ring.

27
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,081
But when Ali come in the game...

28
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,590
he just took it to another level...

29
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,886
A step above the crowd.

30
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,328
You know how great I am.
I don't have to tell you about my strategy.

31
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,336
I'll let my trainer tell you.
Bodini, come here.

32
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,030
Bodini, tell 'em.
What are we gonna do?

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,438
You gonna float like a butterfly
and sting like a bee.

34
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,177
Rumble, young man. Rumble.

35
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,040
That's what we gonna do. You heard it.
That's my trainer. He'll tell you.

36
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,378
We're talkin' about 1958.

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,421
Cassius Clay walked in and said...

38
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,983
"I want everybody
who weigh 175 pounds to stand up."

39
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,085
And everybody...

40
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,391
Didn't nobody know who he was.

41
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,056
He said, "I just wanna let you know.

42
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,533
You know who gonna win
all this here thing here tonight?

43
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,263
It's gonna be me."

44
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,397
Cassius Marcellus Clay
is a great name in Kentucky.

45
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,443
He meant a lot to black people...
to the black community.

46
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,879
<i>And he means a lot
to the black community today.</i>

47
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,382
I mean, who was more revered
than Muhammad Ali?

48
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,750
More revered than any other fighter
ever in boxing history.

49
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,847
More revered, perhaps,
almost any other person in history.

50
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,858
Oh, yeah, we knew about him.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,928
He was light heavyweight in the Olympics...

52
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,054
like I was a light heavyweight in them days.

53
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:22,100
This man was supposed to have been the
fastest light heavyweight they've ever seen.

54
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,229
You got a guy 6 foot 31/2.
He was moving like a middleweight.

55
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,967
<i>And when you've got
fast feet and fast hands...</i>

56
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,771
which he had,
that makes some sort of a fighter.

57
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,210
I am the greatest!

58
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,292
Was I jealous of him? Yes.

59
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,599
The guy was tall. He was good lookin'.

60
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,264
Everybody was jealous of him.

61
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,279
I was training in Angelo Dundee's gym.

62
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,683
Cassius Clay was there.

63
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,187
He was really busy searching
for himself down there.

64
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,686
I remember one time he was saying,
"Japanese are in Japan.

65
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,786
Russians are in Russia.

66
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,797
Germans are in Germany.

67
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,595
What country is called 'Negro'?"

68
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,869
And this guy stood up...

69
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,873
"What country is called 'White Folks'?"

70
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,040
The '60s, I think, was where
black people as a whole...

71
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,677
came together and said,
"Enough is enough."

72
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,279
We declare our right on this Earth...

73
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,122
to be a man,
to be a human being...

74
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,961
which we intend to bring into existence
by any means necessary.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,561
I will be 21 January the 17th...

76
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,834
and I predict that by the end of 1963...

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,465
I will be the youngest
heavyweight champion in history.

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,954
Cassius, since you're not
worried about this guy Cooper.

79
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,889
How about when you get through
with him? What are your plans after that?

80
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,893
Well, you're right. I'm not even
worried about this big bum.

81
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,553
Cooper will only be a warm-up...

82
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,860
until I get to that big,
ugly bear, Sonny Liston.

83
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,231
I used to train
in southeast London in them days...

84
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,397
and I used to run, like,
4:00 in the morning.

85
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,942
And I used to see all these old girls,
like mums and grandmas...

86
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,171
who used to be doing early morning cleaning,
like, in the big factories.

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,717
They used to say to me, "You stop that
loudmouth. Give him a good wallop."

88
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,258
I fought him at Wembley Stadium
in front of 40,000 people.

89
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,626
He came in the ring
with a blue silk dressing gown...

90
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,789
with a crown on.

91
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,425
You could feel the atmosphere.
God, I mean..."Henry! Henry!"

92
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,560
It was so thick
you could cut it with a knife.

93
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,504
So here we go. It's the fight of the year.

94
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,043
Clay from the right-hand corner,
against Cooper of Britain.

95
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,648
See, '63 when I first fought him,
he was a novice at inside fighting.

96
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,876
I mean, I roughed him up inside.

97
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,214
I had his nose bleeding in the first round.

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,619
And he kept looking at the ref...
"Look, ref, break, break!"

99
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,920
Right into Clay's face, and he's scoring
heavily with him. He's hurting the American.

100
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,088
I came from a working-class family.

101
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,598
No good fighter comes
from a middle-class family.

102
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,137
You gotta be wanting to get
out of the environment you're in.

103
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,638
That's what motivates a fighter.

104
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,545
My father was a boy soldier
in the First World War.

105
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,487
He was in the Royal Horse Artillery,
pulling them old cannons...

106
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,524
and he did a bit of boxing in the army...

107
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,651
so he taught us
the fundamentals of boxing...

108
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,321
Got down on his knees
and taught us that way.

109
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,626
And listening to stories
about Granddad...

110
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,826
I mean, he must have been
rather a character.

111
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,133
And he was into 20-round
bare-knuckle fighting.

112
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,333
When Granddad was fighting
a man, and if he had a wife...

113
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,377
and the wife sort of butted in...

114
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,413
my gran used to go up and start a fight.

115
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,880
And she never sort of pulled hair...

116
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,918
It was full bloody punches.

117
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,288
As a working-class lad like I was...

118
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,858
I never expected to get any honors.
Good Lord.

119
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,951
I mean, I boxed because
I liked boxing, all right.

120
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,929
Then, suddenly, I got a knighthood.

121
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,058
I've been to Buckingham Palace
10, 15 different occasions.

122
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:53,400
You know, and I'm a royalist. I believe in
the royal family. I don't want a president.

123
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,738
I don't want some trumped-up guy who's,
like, gonna con the country...

124
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,903
and wanna be a president.

125
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,310
The queen hasn't put a foot wrong.
She's done everything right.

126
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,976
One or two of the family
have just let her down a bit.

127
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,987
But I still want a king and a queen
more than a president.

128
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,252
He's threatening, and he's teasing Cooper.

129
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,322
He was doing a bit of showboating.

130
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,524
He was dropping his hands,
so I showed him one left.

131
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,932
I showed him another left, and then
when he couldn't get back any further...

132
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,334
I hit him with a left hook.

133
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,373
And when I used to hit
with the left hook...

134
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,374
the eyes used to shoot up
to the top of their head...

135
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,706
and both his eyes
were at the top of his head.

136
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,174
He's up at about three.

137
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,183
Well, he learned one thing.

138
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,743
He learned that, basically, he had a pretty
good chin, if he didn't know that before.

139
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,915
He knew that he could take a good shot
and then recover from it.

140
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,224
And now we come to round five.

141
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,799
The Ali fights were
the worst cuts in my career.

142
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,537
Basically, the bone
would come through the flesh.

143
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,045
A plastic surgeon stitched it.

144
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,981
He put 40 stitches on the inside,
and 40 stitches on the outside.

145
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,779
The towel has come
in from Cooper's corner.

146
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,425
Ali always paid me a great tribute...

147
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,655
'cause he always said,
"Cooper hit me so hard...

148
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,756
he didn't only shake me,
he shook my relations in Africa."

149
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,267
Now, that's a really good line.

150
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,667
You gotta give him credit.

151
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,307
I met Ali on September 22, 1963...

152
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,250
and he was dressed like a...
kinda like a preppy white guy.

153
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:52,484
You know, he had a brown suit,
and, like, straight pants.

154
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,119
The promoter of the fight,
Bill King, asked me if I would...

155
00:09:56,228 --> 00:10:00,358
sign to fight Cassius Clay, as he was
known then, if I beat Mike DeJohn.

156
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,431
Mike survived the fight.

157
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:07,028
In the sixth round, I knock him down.
Looked like he's dead.

158
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,302
He finally gets up.
I knock him down again.

159
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,970
The referee walks over,
picks him up off the floor...

160
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,980
then proceeds to give him
a standing eight count.

161
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,642
I said to myself,
"Man, I think I'm in trouble here."

162
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,777
I was lucky to win a 10-round
split decision. It was a joke.

163
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,082
Next day in the paper Ali says,
"I'm not fighting Chuvalo.

164
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,988
He fights rough and tough
like a washerwoman."

165
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,220
So I said, "I gotta get dressed up
as a washerwoman."

166
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,956
Chuvalo's a washerwoman.
You know how women fight.

167
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,659
They have a wild... wild style...

168
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,794
Ladies style of fightin'.
That's the way he fights.

169
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:43,500
So I went to a rental place
and got a big bonnet hat.

170
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,544
I got a flower-print dress.
And I put some makeup on.

171
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,876
I got some granny glasses
perched down the bottom of my nose.

172
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,074
And my contract with Ali.

173
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,152
So I walk in. People are wondering,
"Who the hell is this guy?"

174
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,051
I'm in drag.
I said, "Yoo-hoo, cautious.

175
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,090
Yoo-hoo, cautious."
And he looks over.

176
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,216
I said, "You forgot to honor
this contract."

177
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,194
What I didn't realize, though,
at the time, was that...

178
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,560
they were already negotiating
a fight with Liston.

179
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,368
Float like a butterfly. Sting like a bee.

180
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,475
Rumble, young man. Rumble.

181
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,848
I'll get him at the weigh-in.

182
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:41,359
Sonny Liston was born
to be a big, brute boxer.

183
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,560
We'd have these terrible sparring matches.

184
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,799
He was the only man to ever stand up to me.
No one has ever stood up to me.

185
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,876
Liston will kill him...
Kill him in the first round.

186
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,876
- Liston.
- Second round, Liston.

187
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,570
Liston in four.

188
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,208
Dig that tonight somebody will die
at ringside from shock.

189
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,752
I can remember watching Ali...

190
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,651
going to the weigh-in...

191
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,781
and he was ramping off all the time.

192
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,882
I thought, "He's gonna be
completely knackered by tonight."

193
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,257
I thought Liston was gonna tear him apart.

194
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,798
I thought he was a lead-pipe cinch
to win by a K.O.

195
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,266
Sonny Liston was an awesome...

196
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,496
powerful athlete.

197
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,812
Cassius Clay moved like a gazelle...

198
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,143
In and out, side to side. Off the ropes,
and always in the center of the ring.

199
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,776
His strength was his speed.
He was very fast.

200
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,150
Cassius Clay has surprised everyone.

201
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,519
He just took it to another level.

202
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:42,287
He was very gifted. Very gifted.

203
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,991
Seconds remaining in the sixth.

204
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,827
The crowd now cheering
the challenger.

205
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,336
They might be stopping it.
That might be all, ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,839
Well, it was a big upset.
I mean, let's be honest.

207
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,707
Liston was a bit slower,
where Ali could pick him off.

208
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,837
He could dance around him, you know.

209
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,381
And he made Ali look good.

210
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,451
A lot of people talk about Ali's greatest
fight was with Cleveland Williams...

211
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,350
but Cleveland Williams had just been shot
a few months before that fight...

212
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,355
and he wasn't the same Cleveland Williams.

213
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,824
I think that's Muhammad Ali's greatest
fight ever... The first Liston fight.

214
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,020
- Come here, Champ.
- I'm the greatest fighter that ever lived!

215
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,462
And I just turned 22 years old.
I must be the greatest.

216
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,228
I told the world, I talk to God every day.

217
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,565
If God's with me,
can't nobody be against me.

218
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,663
I shook up the world.
I know God. I know the real God.

219
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,969
- Cassius, wait a minute.
- I am the king of the world!

220
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,634
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- I'm prettier.

221
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,645
- Hold it. You're not that pretty.
- I'm a bad man.

222
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,647
I shook up the world.

223
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,061
I have a religion,
which is the religion of Islam...

224
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,426
that most people don't understand...

225
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,499
and they don't seem to like.

226
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,295
I'm not one of these
who run around...

227
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,393
forcin' my way
in another man's restaurant...

228
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,029
and marrying out of my own race.

229
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,937
When he first fought Liston...

230
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,738
and he won the title, they praised him.

231
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,214
But when he announced it
that he was a Black Muslim of Islam...

232
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,614
the white mass booed him.

233
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,416
Why do you insist on being
called Muhammad Ali now?

234
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,083
That's the name given to me by my leader and
teacher, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

235
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,422
That's my original name.
That's a black man's name.

236
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,122
Cassius Clay was my slave name.
I'm no longer a slave.

237
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,434
What the fuck is that?

238
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,777
When he really met Malcolm X,
Malcolm X was filled with it.

239
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,414
He fed him some social science.

240
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,286
Fed him some political science.

241
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,417
And, of course, gave him some history.

242
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:59,930
And a bit of untruths
to paint the story that...

243
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,763
"You are someone special.
You are the greatest."

244
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:08,169
Malcolm X enlightened Ali in a lot of ways.

245
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:12,506
When Ali talked,
a lot of times you could hear Malcolm.

246
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,511
Black children should learn
about their own culture...

247
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,309
not about England,
not about France, not about Rome.

248
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,316
They should learn about Asia and Africa.

249
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,443
They should learn
about their own black selves.

250
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,898
I don't have to be
what you want me to be.

251
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm free to be what I want to be,
and think what I want to think, right?

252
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,632
I don't believe in forced integration.

253
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,644
That period in history was very chaotic.

254
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,543
They had the Civil Rights movement.

255
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,639
They had the Black Muslim movement,
and the split...

256
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,618
with Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad,
the leader of the Black Muslims.

257
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,349
Elijah Muhammad,
the head of the movement...

258
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,689
is the father of eight children
by six different teenaged girls.

259
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,820
I didn't have no meeting with Malcolm X.

260
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,728
- Who said that?
- He came in the hotel...

261
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,824
and was in your room
for a couple of hours.

262
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,994
No, he was there
for about an hour or so.

263
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,504
But as far as linking me
with him or something like that...

264
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,598
I don't know nothing about his plans
or his future plans or what he's doing.

265
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,610
I follow the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

266
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,704
Malcolm X rose to speak
to his followers in Harlem.

267
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,716
One minute later,
he was shot down by 10 bullets.

268
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,582
Eighteen minutes later, he was dead.

269
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,498
<i>Say can you see</i>

270
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,597
<i>By the daqn's early light</i>

271
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,011
The challenger is the first
to enter the ring.

272
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,880
Muhammad Ali, Cassius Clay, 23...

273
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,248
champion, never defeated as a pro.

274
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,260
Kind of hard to believe now, this century,
looking back in the '60s...

275
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,455
that Ali was kind of a... believe it
or not... a social pariah at the time.

276
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,032
Muhammad Ali.

277
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,102
Couple days prior to the fight...

278
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,368
it had been set up that
if Liston wins, I fight Liston.

279
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,568
If Ali wins, he fights Patterson.

280
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,147
The fight took place...

281
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,479
and Liston takes a dive.

282
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,082
Sonny Liston said, "All I care
about is the do re mi."

283
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,489
And so he was tellin' me then...

284
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,561
he was boxing strictly for money.

285
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,631
It wasn't like he threw a fight.
"I'm just fighting for money."

286
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,600
I mean, to me,
he just didn't fancy the fight.

287
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,637
He knew Ali was just too fast,
too quick for him.

288
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,604
And he just... I think he swallowed it.

289
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,434
Liston was scared to death
of Black Muslims.

290
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,342
He was threatened by the Black Muslims.

291
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,938
And he took a dive.
Everybody knows it.

292
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,416
I knew it, and I was quite vocal
about it in the ring after.

293
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:13,685
If Liston would have lost legitimately,
I would have had no qualms.

294
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,193
But since he took a dive,
I voiced my opinion.

295
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,827
When they ask me about
the army, I will say directly...

296
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,955
"No, I will not go.

297
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,626
Why should me and
other so-called Negroes...

298
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,638
go 10,000 miles
away from home here in America...

299
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,870
to drop bombs and bullets
on other innocent brown people...

300
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,378
who's never bothered us?"

301
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,380
And saying,
"My fight ain't with the Vietnamese.

302
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,473
Them people ain't did nothin' to me."

303
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:16,680
I think that gave
all the young black men pride.

304
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,985
We could identify with that move
that he made.

305
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,255
Cassius Clay, a member
of the Black Muslim religion...

306
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,922
went immediately to the third floor
of the induction center...

307
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,430
where processing began.

308
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,900
He came out and said,
"I've got nothing against the Viet Cong."

309
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,402
He said, "They don't call me nigger."

310
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,904
If I'd have got up in 1940 and said...

311
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,703
"Well, I think the Nazis and Hitler,
they're lovely people"...

312
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,107
the public would have turned against me.

313
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,442
The Ali situation
when he didn't want to go...

314
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,709
I applaud that.

315
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,250
I mean, I think people
should do that even now, today.

316
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,286
That stuff in the Middle East is bullshit.

317
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,221
We wanna tell them what to do...

318
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,519
and I think our government is wrong
for doing that.

319
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,424
Muhammad Ali left the induction center...

320
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,394
to the cheers of supporters chanting...

321
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,898
"If he don't go, we don't go."

322
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,525
I'm the champ of the world,
Mr. Athletic Commissioner.

323
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,536
And I'm here to fight for the title.

324
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,538
- Mr. Clay...
- Muhammad Ali, sir.

325
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,632
- Mr. Muhammad Ali. Either one.
- Just Muhammad Ali, sir.

326
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,870
When you appeared before
this commission before...

327
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,040
if I recall correctly, you said you were
the "people's champion."

328
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,139
Yes, sir.

329
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,583
Do you think that you're
acting like a people's champion?

330
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,881
Yes, sir.

331
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,658
Ali was the W.B.C. Champion.

332
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,659
There was also another champion around...

333
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,457
Ernie Terrell... W.B.A. Champion.
World Boxing Association champion.

334
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,430
Hey, man, I got a title.

335
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,627
All I wanted to do now...

336
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,330
I just wanted to go
and get the one that Ali had...

337
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,067
and would pile it on top of this one.

338
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,439
Ali-Terrell, uniting the titles.

339
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,240
Muhammad Ali,
the World Boxing Council champion...

340
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,612
and Terrell,
the World Boxing Association champion.

341
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:56,518
It was originally scheduled for a showdown
in Rutherford, New Jersey...

342
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,648
but there was so much heat
exerted by the war veterans...

343
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,852
that they literally pushed the fight out
of the United States into Canada...

344
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
because they were upset
with Ali's stance on Vietnam.

345
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,162
I think I had a $250,000 guarantee.

346
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,362
Some guy said that,
"There ain't gonna be no guarantees."

347
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,770
Well, when he said that,
I pulled out of the fight with Ali...

348
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,899
and he fought Chuvalo.

349
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,308
The real reason Ernie Terrell
pulled out of the fight...

350
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,812
Because his manager got beaten up.

351
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,041
His manager of record
was Bernie Glickman.

352
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,050
His real manager was Tony Accardo...

353
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,019
a mob boss from Chicago
with links to Frankie Carbo...

354
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,386
and the front man for him
was Bernie Glickman.

355
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,551
I was a kid then.
That's the way I look at that.

356
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,528
And I didn't know who was
a mobster and who wasn't...

357
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,530
to tell you the truth about it.

358
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,863
Bernie Glickman went to see Herbert
Muhammad, Muhammad Ali's manager...

359
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,698
I think he posed the threat...

360
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,137
"Herbert, if Ali wins the fight...

361
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,505
you're gonna end up
in a cement box in Lake Michigan."

362
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,976
All Herbert Muhammad had to do was...

363
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,809
And his henchmen would come over.

364
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,644
And they beat the hell
out of Bernie Glickman.

365
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,742
He went to the hospital,
beaten within an inch of his life.

366
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,754
From the hospital
he went directly to the loony bin...

367
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,915
to the mental institution,
where he eventually lost his life.

368
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,652
He never saw the light of day again.

369
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,422
That's why I got the fight
with Muhammad Ali.

370
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,027
Never been treated so nice in my life.

371
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,159
I haven't had no people makin' wisecracks.

372
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,262
Everybody's friendly...
the children, the waitresses...

373
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,341
the hotel managers, the policemen...

374
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,342
Everybody's as nice as they can be...

375
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,742
and it's a lot different
from where I come from.

376
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,406
I came from a poor neighborhood.

377
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,915
You know,
just a working-class neighborhood.

378
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,543
Most fighters come
from disadvantaged groups.

379
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,554
Hard to find a rich kid to be a fighter.

380
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,851
I mean, you got a punch to the nose,
a bleeding nose...

381
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,394
The guy says to himself, "I don't want
to make a living doing this stuff."

382
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,760
My mother and father were Croatians.

383
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,299
My father went to school two years.

384
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,528
He was eight years old,
working tobacco fields.

385
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,968
My mother didn't have any formal schooling.

386
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,872
My mother used to pluck chickens
for half a cent a bird.

387
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:02,675
She'd pluck 200 chickens
to make one dollar.

388
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,648
And my father skinned cattle...

389
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,878
before they had machines
to tear off the hide.

390
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,114
He used to do it
with a broken arm.

391
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,057
My father was so paranoid
about losing his job.

392
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,424
He would vacation
every year for two weeks...

393
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,191
but during that vacation,
he would go to work...

394
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,233
and watch, not one man,
but two men do his job.

395
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,066
I mean, for 40 years, with this huge elbow
jutting out of his arm.

396
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,436
Broken arm doing the work of two men.

397
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,441
He never complained about Canada ever.

398
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,671
He would just say,
"Canada's a good country. It gave me a job."

399
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,614
I remember going over to Morgan's Cigar
Store, which is like a variety store...

400
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,617
and they had a magazine rack,
and on the rack...

401
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,619
<i>was a magazine called The Ring.</i>

402
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,916
Called itself "the Bible of boxing,"
as it does today.

403
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,923
And I saw these guys
with muscles on the cover.

404
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,050
Open to the pages, more guys with muscles.

405
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,129
I said, "Man, this is for me."
I went home.

406
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,493
"Ma! Ma! Get me a set of boxing gloves.
I wanna be a fighter."

407
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,008
The way this fight figured...

408
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,012
Everyone thought that Clay
would come out...

409
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,606
and dance around,
just as he's doing right now.

410
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,618
When I fought Ali,
I realized very quickly...

411
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,654
that he was the quickest guy I ever fought.

412
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,815
He wasn't a big puncher,
but he was very, very quick.

413
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,223
Very, very fast on his feet,
and his punches were lightening quick.

414
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,354
The plan was to go to the body.
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

415
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,490
Down to the kidneys.
Over the kidneys. Steppin' over here.

416
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,058
And I would rake him to the body,
and the idea was to slow him down.

417
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,071
I thought maybe he'd be pretty tired
and I had a shot to knock him out.

418
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,535
In the first round
Ali tried to con me into something.

419
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,805
He put his hand behind my head,
pulled me close...

420
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,904
and then kind of dared me
to hit him in the body.

421
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,711
And he tried to make it look like...

422
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,343
he was a real brave guy,
he was a real tough guy...

423
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,649
but he only did it once.

424
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,267
And Cassius Clay...

425
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,632
wins a hard-fought,
action-packed championship fight.

426
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,331
In the newspapers they made it
sound like it was an easy fight.

427
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,739
It was far from an easy fight.
It was a tough fight.

428
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,574
They didn't expect Ali to say that was
the toughest fight he had up to that time.

429
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,410
You know, they didn't expect him
to say that, but he did.

430
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,179
And he went to the hospital
after the fight with bleeding kidneys.

431
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,584
And me... I went dancing with my wife.

432
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,930
The wife and I had five children...
four sons and a daughter.

433
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,331
And I lost three sons, and I lost my wife.

434
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,668
I lost my three sons to drugs.

435
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,367
I lost my wife to suicide
after the loss of our second son.

436
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:48,742
One son shot himself.
Two others died of heroin overdose.

437
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,441
And my wife died, ironically, from pills...

438
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,280
that she'd taken from my sons
in a previous drugstore heist.

439
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,414
The hold that drugs
have on a person is unbelievable.

440
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,619
I was told by one of my sons...

441
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,822
that drugs had such
a strong hold on him...

442
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,801
that when he and his brother
would go down to use...

443
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,531
they would ask the dealer
at the bar if he had...

444
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,837
and the dealer would show him the white
stuff in the palm of his hand... the heroin.

445
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,004
And when they would see
the smack in the dealer's hands...

446
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,980
my sons would be so desperate for it...

447
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,574
that as soon as they would see it...

448
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,177
within the flash of one single second...

449
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,121
the very first single second...
both of my sons, on cue...

450
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,124
would crap their drawers.

451
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,353
Crap their drawers,
soon as they see the drug.

452
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,192
Then they would pay for the drug.

453
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:44,462
Then they would take the drug into the
bathroom of the hotel where they were...

454
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,469
and...

455
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,998
they would...

456
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,639
Then they would suck it up in a syringe...

457
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,044
and they would shoot it
into a waiting vein.

458
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:01,608
And only then would my handsome sons
clean themselves off.

459
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,656
Every time I tell that story
I get sick to my stomach.

460
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,957
When my son died, four days later,
my wife took her life.

461
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,490
That was such a bleak period.

462
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,625
I was in bed for a month and a half.

463
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,670
I don't even remember going
to the bathroom during that period.

464
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,671
I must have, but I don't remember.

465
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:25,300
But I do remember my son
Mitchell coming to visit me.

466
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,106
My son Steven was alive at the time.

467
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,410
My daughter Vanessa.
My daughter-in-law Jackie.

468
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:36,453
My only grandchildren at the time, Jesse
and Rachel, who are Steven's children.

469
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,112
And some of my friends coming over...

470
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,215
hugging me and kissing me and telling me
they loved me each and every day.

471
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,558
Every day. And I remember
articulating to myself...

472
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,792
after a few weeks,
how love made you feel.

473
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,027
I said love makes you feel strong.

474
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,833
Love makes you feel tender.
Love makes you feel secure.

475
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,238
Love makes you feel appreciated.
Love makes you feel important.

476
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,905
I think we all have to feel strong, tender,
secure, appreciated, important.

477
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,845
I think we all have to feel like that.

478
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,318
I'd like to do a song for you that I done...

479
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,866
<i>two days before I fought Muhammad Ali,
on The Jack Benny Shoq.</i>

480
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,696
It's a strange song.
Muhammad didn't like it too well.

481
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,703
But I'd like to do it for you.

482
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,706
From Hollywood...

483
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,480
<i>Won't you come home
dear Cassius</i>

484
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,109
<i>Won't you come home</i>

485
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,246
<i>I've trained the whole year through</i>

486
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,658
<i>Are you afraid, Muhammad</i>

487
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,059
<i>Are you afraid</i>

488
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,529
<i>Of what I'll do to you</i>

489
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,863
- Why don't you call me my name, man?
- Well, what's your name?

490
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,369
You told me your name
was Cassius Clay a few years ago.

491
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,497
I never told you my name
was Cassius Clay.

492
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,507
My name is Muhammad Ali...

493
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,373
and you will announce it
right there in the center of that ring...

494
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,504
after the fight if you don't do it now.

495
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:13,641
When you're gonna fight, you don't go
and try to make friends with the guy...

496
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,652
'cause you're gonna fight him.

497
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,016
- You heard me.
- Don't call me no Uncle Tom.

498
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,022
- Just back off of me.
- And so, ladies and gentlemen...

499
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,591
Uncle Tom.

500
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,785
Until he touched me, I was all right.

501
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,921
But he pushed me,
and that's when we started wrestling.

502
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,626
Another interview
has been recorded for posterity...

503
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,499
as the two gentlemen
continue to promote the fight.

504
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,908
As you know, I have a question
to ask him on the day of the weigh-in...

505
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,316
and his answer will determine
how bad I'm gonna beat him.

506
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,958
I knew Ali was fast,
so what I was gonna do...

507
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,459
I had a jab. I'm pretty good at it myself.

508
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:01,623
I was gonna throw the jab out there
and beat him to the punch.

509
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,396
Ernie Terrell, pressing the champion,
sending in stinging punches.

510
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,664
The first round was okay.

511
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,206
I felt like I fought pretty good then.

512
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,404
But then what happened is,
he grabbed me around the neck...

513
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,412
and pulled me over to the rope.

514
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:20,348
Then he started pokin' me in the eye
like this right here.

515
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,476
He was pokin' me in my face
with this thumb...

516
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,487
and his thumb hit me in the eye...

517
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,717
and then he rubbed across the face
with the heel of his hand.

518
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,091
Well, he said he didn't do it,
but you know how that is.

519
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:36,324
None of my professional fights
have been one thing dirty.

520
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,334
Terrell is known for being a dirty fighter.

521
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,597
He's got a record for being a dirty fighter.

522
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,868
When I got my eye damaged...

523
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,103
it just messed up
my whole style of fighting.

524
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,112
So what I had to do then...

525
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,910
was come out with
a peek-a-boo style, like...

526
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,075
Just to stop the punches.

527
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,551
And that's the way
I fought the rest of the fight.

528
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,428
If you was a black boy
growing up in Mississippi...

529
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,863
stayed in your place.

530
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,596
If you stayed in your place,
you would have got along with all of 'em.

531
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,537
And when you crossed that line...

532
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,268
You know, trouble.
It was just really rough.

533
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,615
Joe Louis was a black man.

534
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,116
In fact, I was shocked
to find out that he was.

535
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,812
And all of the neighbors and everybody...

536
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,479
They would work real hard, fast...

537
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,319
"I wanna see Joe Louis.
I wanna hear Joe Louis over the radio."

538
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,484
You know, really rejoicing.

539
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:42,123
And I just thought that anybody
that had that kind of impact was great.

540
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:47,603
And when we moved to Chicago,
I saw one of the gyms.

541
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,574
It was on the fifth floor
of this building...

542
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,542
that I first put on boxing gloves.

543
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,080
Rocky Marciano trained there.

544
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,275
Jersey Joe Walcott trained there.

545
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:04,151
So as a kid, and I would go home and watch
'em on television when they fought...

546
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,019
and it was definitely
an inspiration to me...

547
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,685
to come out here and do it myself,
and that's what I did.

548
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,998
What's my name? What's my name?
What's my name?

549
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,830
Most of the time when he said,
"What's my name?"

550
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,768
That didn't bother me.

551
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,841
But gets to your patience.

552
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,172
- What's my name?
- I noticed his hand was down...

553
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,302
So I was gonna try myself to get one in...

554
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,438
but he was out of punching range.

555
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,183
And there's the end of the fight.

556
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:38,847
A brilliant boxing exhibition
by champion Muhammad Ali...

557
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,322
What is his name?

558
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,986
His name is Cassius Clay,
far as I'm concerned.

559
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:48,828
When the fight was over, the only thing
I wanted from Ali was a return bout.

560
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,960
All the other stuff...
What do they talk about? That wasn't me.

561
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,562
I just wanted to get a return bout
because I thought...

562
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,164
the one I fought in was flawed...

563
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,804
and I wanted the real,
true chance to beat him.

564
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,812
<i>You took a powder, Cassius</i>

565
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,510
<i>One day in March</i>

566
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:13,556
<i>To London and Toronto too</i>

567
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,422
<i>Ain't it a shame</i>

568
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,018
<i>You changed your name</i>

569
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,122
<i>I'll change your features too</i>

570
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:27,535
<i>I'll change your features too</i>

571
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,572
Heavyweight champion Cassius Clay,
at a federal court in Houston...

572
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,014
is found guilty of violating
the U.S. Selective Service laws...

573
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,779
by refusing to be inducted.

574
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,808
Whatever the punishment,
whatever the persecution is...

575
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,677
for standing up for my religious beliefs...

576
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,479
even if it means facing
machine-gun fire that day...

577
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,917
I will face it before denouncing...

578
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,616
Elijah Muhammad and the religion of Islam.
I'm ready to die.

579
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,320
I mean, it was a gutsy thing to do,
but it didn't do him any good.

580
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,989
I mean, he had to have what?
Three years out of boxing?

581
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,431
And they would have been
some of his better years.

582
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,970
My brother Michael died in Vietnam.

583
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,268
They let me come home to the funeral.
I was in prison.

584
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,811
And I watched my mother. You know?

585
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,608
And when we buried him,
a part of her went with him.

586
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,615
You know? So, yeah.

587
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,742
I can identify with Ali when he said...

588
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,583
"It's not my fight, man.
My fight is right here, man."

589
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,487
My intention is to box,
to win a clean fight.

590
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,858
But in war, the intention
is to kill, kill, kill, kill...

591
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,659
and continue killing innocent people.

592
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,290
'68 was a wonderful time for me.

593
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,768
I had been rescued
from the gutter in Houston, Texas.

594
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,032
My life was nothin'
but a thief and a bandit and a mugger.

595
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,338
If someone would come up and talk politics
to me, didn't ring a bell to me.

596
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,572
And then having a chance
to represent my country in Mexico City...

597
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,649
and I'm standing
in the middle of that ring...

598
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,547
just won my Olympic gold medal,
people started applauding...

599
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,382
I said, "I gotta let them know where
I'm from. Hey, look, I'm from America."

600
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,389
So I waved the flag.

601
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,619
I got home,
and some people took offense to it.

602
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:33,686
"How could you do that? How could you
do that when the brothers were doing that?"

603
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,892
And looking back in hindsight,
put another chip on my shoulder...

604
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,970
'cause I dared anyone to even
bring that up again in that fashion.

605
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,040
So it just made a tougher guy out of me.

606
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,041
With Ali, it was principles, you know...

607
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:49,307
and I think that if he had his choice
to make over again...

608
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,541
knowing Ali,
he would make the same one.

609
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,244
The heavyweight championship is at stake...

610
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,515
as champion Joe Frazier...

611
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,056
takes on Jimmy Ellis.

612
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,330
Joe Frazier becomes the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world...

613
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,388
I ain't botherin' him. Don't he bother me.

614
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,024
I don't pity on nobody
when I climb through the ring.

615
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,103
I go out there to take him out.

616
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,104
These boxing authorities...

617
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,265
people who will rate Joe Frazier
over me...

618
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,172
and rank him the champion
when I've never been beat...

619
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,041
And for Joe Frazier to be a champion,
he's gotta beat me.

620
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,581
See, those eliminations
were only imitations.

621
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,651
He's not the real champion, and I will...

622
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,572
After a three-and-a-half year layoff
he fought Jerry Quarry.

623
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,173
Then he fought Oscar Bonavena.

624
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,186
Even when they let him come back...

625
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:41,349
he was still a stride ahead
of the pack...

626
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,791
but that's where
they started reachin' him.

627
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,832
That's where they started touching him.
That's where they started hitting him.

628
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,925
Before then, they wasn't
even putting a glove on him.

629
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,104
If he goes down again... It's over!

630
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,106
I prove 'em wrong every time.

631
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,143
They said I couldn't come back.
No fighter has ever come back.

632
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,680
They look real bad when they make these
public statements and can't back 'em up.

633
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,476
It's bad to predict against me.

634
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:10,316
All I say to all of my fans out there, and
anybody who's been following me...

635
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,480
I don't encourage nobody to bet...

636
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,526
but please don't put nothin'
on Joe Frazier.

637
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,189
The heavyweight champion
of the world, Joe Frazier.

638
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,530
You couldn't get Joe Frazier on this show...
"How do you feel, Champ?"

639
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:47,214
He has no rhythm, no footwork, no class.

640
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,418
He cannot talk.

641
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,894
And who told him he could sing?
He can't sing.

642
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,174
Well, he came from
a very, very humble background.

643
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,576
I don't care. He's the other type Negro.

644
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,513
He's not like me,
'cause he's the Uncle Tom.

645
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,947
He's not an Uncle Tom.

646
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,042
Why did he insist
on calling me Cassius Clay...

647
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,348
when even the worst of the white enemies
recognize Muhammad Ali?

648
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,481
He keeps saying Clay. "He's still Clay.

649
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,957
He gonna stay Clay,
and to me he'll always be Clay."

650
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,053
Joe Frazier told me,
"This guy keep callin' me an Uncle Tom."

651
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,395
And he said, "I don't want my wife thinkin'
that I'm peepin' in windows."

652
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,765
He actually thought
he was calling him a peeping Tom.

653
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,770
He didn't know what
an Uncle Tom was.

654
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,103
Joe couldn't come back
with him verbally. He couldn't...

655
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,336
You know, he wasn't a match
for Ali that way...

656
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,708
so he had to prove it with his fists.

657
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,240
In 1971, that was truly
the fight of the century.

658
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,744
Hadn't been a fight like that,
with that much magnitude...

659
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,406
that much interest,
in the history of boxing.

660
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,883
The first fight had all this suspense...

661
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,080
About Ali coming back after his layoff,
and they were both undefeated.

662
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,158
It was a hell of a buildup.
It was a hell of a fight.

663
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,956
Muhammad Ali entering the ring there...

664
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,122
with his Black Muslim
entourage behind him.

665
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,978
Joe Frazier had
all the fighters' respect in the top 10.

666
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,317
But anybody that ever saw him fight...

667
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,323
and understand the game of boxing...

668
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,723
will tip their hat to Mr. Frazier.

669
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,455
...in the red trunks.

670
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,997
Joe Frazier in the green trunks.

671
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,963
They appear very light.

672
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,695
That was a hard left hook
that caught Frazier.

673
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,703
He knows that.

674
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,468
Ali wasn't the same guy
that I had fought in '66.

675
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,704
In '66 he was quicker
and he had more stamina.

676
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,213
He could throw punches at length
for a longer period of time.

677
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,228
Joe Frazier was a tough pit bull.

678
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,772
A little dog, man. Trust me.
Joe Frazier could fight, dog.

679
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,841
Joe Frazier was relentless.

680
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:54,741
His biggest asset was his constant punching
and the intensity of his attack.

681
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,076
He never... It was punch after punch
after punch after punch.

682
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,084
The round is over. The round is over.

683
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,881
What a round.

684
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,050
Muhammad Ali was really out that time.

685
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,797
Ali's best punch... the jab.

686
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,776
<i>Left and rights to the body.</i>

687
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,651
I'm sittin' three rows ringside.
I'm lookin' at him.

688
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,284
When he hit the canvas,
his eyes was like that...

689
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,989
but when he hit the canvas... boom.

690
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,191
His back didn't even stay. Just boom...

691
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,200
He just come right back up
and stood up...

692
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,997
and looked at him like that.

693
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,969
I said, "Okay."

694
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,633
As a fighter,
when you see that in a fighter...

695
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,007
that's respect.

696
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,013
I think Muhammad Ali,
if he had it all to do over again...

697
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,346
he would have just been nice to Frazier,
and won on points.

698
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:18,649
Frazier just couldn't lose. He was prepared
to die in that ring that night.

699
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:22,692
And Joe always felt kind of betrayed
by his own people, I think...

700
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:25,887
because most black people were rooting
for Muhammad Ali against Joe Frazier...

701
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:30,228
and Joe Frazier felt more like
the average black guy from the ghetto.

702
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,792
He was blacker than Ali.
He was poorer than Ali.

703
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,997
He had a tougher upbringing than Ali.

704
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,904
Joe Frazier brought the best out of Ali.

705
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,068
Ali brought the best out of Joe Frazier.

706
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:45,740
It took two to keep our sport
at the head of the pack.

707
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,551
There it is. The round is over.

708
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:53,714
The winner by unanimous decision...

709
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:57,453
and still heavyweight champion
of the world...

710
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,461
Joe Frazier.

711
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:16,974
Even now, if you talk
about Ali to him, Joe will say...

712
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,914
"God's punishing Ali
because of all the things he's done."

713
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,008
And you couldn't win with Ali.

714
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,247
When it come down to you talking
and him talking...

715
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,323
everybody gonna be on his side.

716
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,654
Joe couldn't take that.

717
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,660
And I don't blame him.

718
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,662
I've raised 10 kids...

719
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:37,461
and there's always one child
who can take a joke, and another who can't.

720
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,468
Muhammad could say something...

721
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,937
and just tick Frazier off,
and Muhammad would be smilin' about it.

722
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,995
Walk right.

723
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,926
Ali, who it seems to me
has taken Kenny Norton more lightly...

724
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,833
in the pre-fight buildup here...

725
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,203
than any opponent
I have known him to fight.

726
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,486
Either Kenny Norton
is a much better fighter...

727
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,559
than anybody thought...

728
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,094
or Muhammad Ali
has gone back a lot more...

729
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,621
than one could have
reasonably believed.

730
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,978
The final round... round 12.

731
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:55,884
Good right!
And that right hurt Muhammad Ali.

732
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,373
He knew his jaw was hurting,
but he didn't know it was broken.

733
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,176
So he gonna keep right on going.
And that's the man that comes out of him.

734
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,915
Everybody know I wasn't
in shape for the Norton fight.

735
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,818
I was at a nightclub with Howard Cosell
out all night before the fight.

736
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,356
The press even wrote about
how I wasn't living clean.

737
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,689
Muhammad Ali... Norton could
beat him on any given night.

738
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,730
I don't think he's ever beaten
Kenny Norton to be honest with you.

739
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,662
Ladies and gentlemen...

740
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:40,294
the referee, Frank Rustage...

741
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,066
Seven points, Norton. Five points, Ali.

742
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:48,634
There it is! One of the greatest upsets
again in boxing history!

743
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,209
I was afraid of Joe Frazier because
you can't hurt him, I thought.

744
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:08,451
I seen him beat Muhammad Ali
and rest his head on his chest.

745
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:12,187
I said, "No one does that!
He conquered the man in that first fight."

746
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,354
But I'm number one contender.
I had to face him.

747
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:19,299
When George Foreman hits you, it's like a
Mack truck hitting you at 40 miles an hour.

748
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:24,430
And when Joe Frazier hits you, it's like a
Pontiac hitting you at 100 miles an hour.

749
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,839
There's a different feel to it, you know.

750
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,706
But they both hurt.

751
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,646
Frazier has never taken
this kind of punishment.

752
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,248
Frazier's down again!

753
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,862
Frazier is being battered
in Foreman's corner.

754
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,496
Joe's about to go down
and does! And it's over!

755
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,575
Once a guy climbed one
of those Mount Everest...

756
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,735
he's conquered everything.

757
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,144
It's the easiest time in the world
to push him down...

758
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,478
'cause he's already made it to the top.

759
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:11,577
After he beat Muhammad Ali,
there was not that much left of Joe Frazier.

760
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,522
I tell you, if I'd fought him two years
earlier, it wouldn't have been like that.

761
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,303
Once I became heavyweight champ
of the world, and the way I'd done it...

762
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:30,532
looking at the film, and people
telling me I'm the best fighter ever.

763
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,973
"Never been a puncher like you, George."
All those pats on the back, compliments...

764
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,443
I started to eat them, really.

765
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,315
I faced Kenny Norton who had
even beaten and broken Ali's jaw.

766
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,318
And beat him twice, if you ask me.

767
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,650
Frazier... Creamed him,
knocked him down.

768
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,985
So I figured,
I'm gonna fight Muhammad Ali.

769
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,719
He's the least of all those guys.
He's older.

770
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,625
This is gonna be the easiest fight
of my life. I wasn't even nervous.

771
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:59,296
I had to trick him into this fight. I had to
make the world think my legs were gone.

772
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:03,099
"He can't dance no more. Previous fights
show where he stands in the corner."

773
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,197
I did that on purpose, man!

774
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,111
Can I dance? Is the pope a Catholic?

775
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,843
Is you colored?

776
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:20,783
Just like I thought Sonny Liston
was gonna rip Muhammad Ali apart...

777
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,653
I thought George would do the same thing.

778
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,354
I figured, I'm just gonna walk in and win
this fight in maybe one, two, three rounds.

779
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,694
Knock him out. The most confident
I'd ever been in a boxing match.

780
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:44,505
<i>Ali, bomayel
Ali, bomayel Ali, bomayel</i>

781
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,983
I'm happy because, for the first time
I don't have butterflies, I'm not nervous.

782
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,524
This is what I always wanted from boxing.

783
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,959
The bell rang. He comes out,
lands a few shots.

784
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,963
I land a good one. He tries to run.

785
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,158
I corner him up, beat him
whenever I wanted to.

786
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:08,226
I thought, this is gonna really be easy.
If I can only get him into an exchange.

787
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:11,637
Then after I'd beaten him up
really good in the side.

788
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:15,370
And I said, "Come on."
He said, "No way!" and covered up.

789
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,742
And I remember
I went whalin' and whalin'.

790
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,566
I thought I was gonna get him,
and that bell rung.

791
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,368
It must've been about
the third or fourth round.

792
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,943
He looked at me as if to say,
"I made it."

793
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,171
From then on, it was a different fight.

794
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,774
You could tell Foreman was,
like, frustrated.

795
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,352
The worst thing punchers can do...

796
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,547
is sling their big punches and hit thin air.

797
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:04,418
I tried to get him. I tried to corner him.
I tried every shot in the world.

798
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,052
But he took it. And he started whispering,
"Is that all you got, George?

799
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,461
That all you got?"
Then I really tried to get him.

800
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,191
Look at Ali.
Continues to taunt George.

801
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,534
Definitely serious. Tremendous
combination by Muhammad Ali.

802
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,871
Ali played a trick that got into his head.

803
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:24,413
Even when he thought of punching
at his body, Ali was blocking him.

804
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:28,041
He was like this.
'Cause Foreman was swinging this way.

805
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,220
And when he swang it up top,
he had his hands like this.

806
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:37,783
And Ali was looking at him,
pulling him to him. "Is that all you got?"

807
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,828
He is definitely head hunting
with his right hand.

808
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,365
Ali could take a good punch,
'cause I used to hit him in the gym.

809
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,491
Another strategy
that he was working on...

810
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,366
I felt that he was gonna do
in the real fight...

811
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:52,237
that is throw punches, back into
the corner and let him bang him.

812
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,244
By the seventh round, playing
around, dropping his hands.

813
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,837
I said, "I'm gonna get him now
'cause I'm gonna drop my hands."

814
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,815
I heard Angelo scream,
"Muhammad, don't play with that sucker!"

815
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,319
And when I did that, he picked his hands up
and that was the last chance I had.

816
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,653
He backed away from the corner,
and I turned to spin him...

817
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,953
and he hit me with a one-two combination...
left, right, boom!

818
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,690
And the right hand caught me. I fell
to the floor, tried to break the fall.

819
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,500
When I was knocked down,
I looked up in the corner...

820
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,366
'cause I was told never listen to
the referee, find your cornerman.

821
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,930
I raised my head up. I found Dick Sadler.
He told me, "Stay down." I'm waiting.

822
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:29,375
Then he's, "Okay, up!"
'Cause you wait and let him count.

823
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,607
When I jumped up, the fight was over. I was
no longer heavyweight champ of the world.

824
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,546
I was devastated.

825
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,142
Eighth round knockout!

826
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:41,451
He knocked out George Foreman!

827
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,856
He did it with such guile,
it was so beautiful to watch him.

828
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,019
I thought for sure
he was gonna be annihilated.

829
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,064
And as the fight started to unfold,
you could see what was happening.

830
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,963
Then when it happened, it was like,
"Holy mackerel!" What a Hollywood ending.

831
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,866
Have you seen anything
more Hollywood than that?

832
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,806
Probably the best punch
of the whole fight...

833
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,604
was never landed.

834
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:05,238
Muhammad Ali, as I was going down,
stumbling, trying to hold myself.

835
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,875
He saw me stumbling.
Ordinarily, you finish a fighter off.

836
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,785
I would have. He got ready to throw
the right hand and he didn't do it.

837
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:18,323
That's what made him, in my mind,
the greatest fighter I ever fought.

838
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:20,623
If I remember rightly...

839
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,564
George Foreman injured himself
and had to put the fight off.

840
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,862
And he stayed in Africa.

841
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,531
Well, I think they got
a few tribes women over there.

842
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,577
He over-enjoyed himself.
So he was never quite the same.

843
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:39,671
When he got into it with Ali,
Ali just knew he had too much for him.

844
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:45,554
We were in Deer Lake and he was
getting ready to fight George Foreman.

845
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:49,113
A lot of women around. And I said,
"Man, you know, you gotta be in shape.

846
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,693
Don't take no chances
with these women."

847
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,285
And that's when he told me,
"Shut the hell up."

848
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:57,525
He says, "I've been doing this...
You don't know boxing.

849
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,432
I know boxing.
You don't tell me what to do."

850
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,437
And I shut up.

851
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,769
Went on about my business, you know.

852
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:08,071
Like he said, he knew what
he was doing, and he did.

853
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,407
'Cause he won the fight.

854
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:15,515
Ali had so many...
so many people around him.

855
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,951
Everybody had a little job to do...
that they could do for him.

856
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,582
Howard Bingham,
flash man, camera man.

857
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,388
Booker, he was the security guard.

858
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:28,987
Lloyd Wells had a few girls come around.

859
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,965
I tell you, man, the women
that came to that camp...

860
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,161
He had his pick.
You hear what I'm saying?

861
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:41,141
This man had his pick
of the most finest women that I ever seen.

862
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:46,079
And I was thinking,
"Damn! Why can't it be me?"

863
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,116
<i>Ali, bomayel</i>

864
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:54,552
Muhammad Ali had picked up
something else along the way.

865
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:57,649
I guess when he had the troubles
with the draft.

866
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,594
Then he'd gone to Africa, and people
believing in him. "You mean so much to us."

867
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:06,931
He found something to fight for other
than money and championship belts.

868
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:10,494
And when that person finds something
like that, you can't hardly beat them.

869
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,269
I proved that Allah is god...

870
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,675
Elijah Muhammad is the messenger,
and I have faith in them.

871
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,644
And regardless to the world
and the pressure...

872
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:22,684
I made it an easy night because
Allah has power over all things.

873
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:26,619
See, fighting ain't about how big
and how strong you are.

874
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,385
Fighting's about how patient you are.

875
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:33,223
God had a way of getting
George Foreman's attention.

876
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,561
I told you! I told you in the beginning
you couldn't beat us.

877
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:41,933
But you're gonna be champion again one day
when the prophet's finished.

878
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,201
Next time, why don't you be pushing
on the ropes. Let the man hang out there.

879
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,208
It wasn't me. It was God!

880
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,574
I came home and I was angry
for a long time.

881
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,204
I figured I'd been betrayed
by my manager.

882
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,840
I'd been given things in my water.
The ropes were loose.

883
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:59,354
I had all the kind of excuses
that filled me with hatred and revenge.

884
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,424
I felt like I lost everything,
not just the championship of the world...

885
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,652
but I lost myself as a man.

886
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,356
Foreman attempted a comeback,
but that ended in 1977.

887
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:11,797
I fought Jimmy Young in
Puerto Rico in March of'77.

888
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,961
After the decision,
Jimmy Young is the winner.

889
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:17,198
I couldn't believe that.
I went back to the dressing room.

890
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,605
And as I was walking back
and forth to cool off, I started thinking.

891
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:25,340
Who cares about a stinkin' boxing match
when I got money, I got cars?

892
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,110
I said,
"I could retire and then die."

893
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,878
Die! I couldn't fight it.

894
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,954
It just started dominating
my conversation.

895
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:35,855
I realized I was about to die in a dirty old
dressing room with all those homes I had.

896
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:40,486
Right within my thoughts I heard a
voice say, "Do you believe in God?

897
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,587
Why are you scared to die?"

898
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,863
So I tried to make a deal with the voice.
I said, "I'm still George Foreman.

899
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:50,735
I can box and give money
to charity and for cancer."

900
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,072
And a voice answered me right back,
"I don't want your money. I want you!"

901
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:58,147
And I remember tears coming down
because I knew that was it.

902
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:01,307
My leg gave out on me.
And I said, "Y'all, I'm fixin' to"...

903
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,647
Before I could say another "die,"
I was gone.

904
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:08,781
Within a split second, over my head,
under my feet was just nothin'.

905
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,791
I looked behind me and I seen...

906
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,952
I saw everything I'd ever worked
for crumble.

907
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:16,395
Like you burn a piece of paper and it stands
and you touch it and it crumbles.

908
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:21,266
I was dead. Smelly old death. And this
horrible smell that goes along with it.

909
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,134
I just got mad. I said,
"I don't care if this is death.

910
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,573
I still believe there's a God."
I just didn't believe in religion.

911
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,077
When I said that,
a gigantic hand just reached in...

912
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:34,616
nothing, hopelessness,
no more, and pulled me out.

913
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,446
And I was alive
in that dressing room again.

914
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,452
Evidently, they had
picked me up off the floor.

915
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,523
I saw blood coming out of my forehead.
I hadn't been cut from the boxing match.

916
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,252
But I saw it.
My masseur said, "Move your hand!

917
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,954
He's bleeding where they crucified him!"

918
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,361
And I started screaming,
"Jesus Christ has come alive in me!"

919
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,866
I fought eight men to get in the shower
and start screaming...

920
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,028
"I'm clean! Born again! Hallelujah!"

921
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:58,301
They strapped me down in an ambulance.

922
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,774
And I said, "You just witnessed a miracle
and you won't believe it."

923
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,869
They rushed me to intensive care.

924
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,313
I lost a boxing match,
but I was where I wanted to be in life.

925
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,044
And I've been telling that story since.

926
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:13,145
I'm talking about Jesus Christ,
the true son of the living God.

927
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:23,428
The first time that
I ever stepped in the ring...

928
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,229
I was in the Colorado
State Penitentiary in Canon City.

929
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,998
When I got up in the ring
and I looked around...

930
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:34,475
I knew then that this is where I belong.

931
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,205
It was like putting the rabbit
in the briar patch.

932
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,043
- How long were you in the penitentiary?
- Seven and a half years.

933
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,346
- You went there for what?
- Second-degree murder.

934
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,148
It was a six-by-eight cement slab.

935
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:49,520
One blanket, no pillow.

936
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,217
A bowl of spinach.

937
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,454
And every three days, you get a meal.

938
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,426
That's the hole.

939
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:58,557
I was still doing push-ups
on a bowl of spinach.

940
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:05,203
And when they put me in privileged max where
they were giving me three meals a day...

941
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:09,108
I started doing a 1,000 push-ups
in an hour.

942
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:15,850
When I was in jail,
me and this guy got into an confrontation.

943
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,113
He had a knife. I didn't have one.

944
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,086
When he hit me with the knife... boom.

945
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,181
And he hit a main artery going to the heart.

946
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,658
So they had to open me up, cut me across.

947
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,286
Put all my insides up on my chest.

948
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,797
I had 36 blood transfusions.

949
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,300
Died twice on the operating table.

950
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:38,965
But it wasn't my turn.
God gave me another shot at life.

951
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,671
When I got out, I was 28.

952
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,771
I won the national A.A.U. Title.

953
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,681
I fought Duane Bobick
and I knocked him out.

954
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,548
He didn't move for five minutes.

955
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,420
I wanted to be a pro.
I wanted to be one of the guys...

956
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,789
so my people sent me to spar with Ali.

957
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,125
I worked with him for,
I think, four rounds.

958
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,393
He was a special person.
He didn't try to take advantage.

959
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,335
Then I left from there and I went up
to the Catskills to work with Joe Frazier.

960
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:13,534
Tell Frazier this fella's a good amateur
and he's not out for no reputation.

961
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,703
Give him a good little boxing lesson,
but don't hurt him.

962
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:20,873
But if you make Frazier look too bad, which I
believe you will, 'cause you're a good boxer.

963
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,349
You'll hit him all night with those jabs...

964
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:26,012
that you don't hit me with,
but you'll hit him all night.

965
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:29,091
People like what they saw.
They saw...

966
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:33,355
the raw talent that was there
that over a period of time would develop.

967
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:38,195
I was 30 when I turned pro.
I fought Ali four years later.

968
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,928
The rest is history.

969
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,605
I knew that was my time.

970
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:58,118
I knew that this was
the moment that I worked for.

971
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:02,179
This is where I had to put it
all together in one night.

972
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,259
Ali was such a good fighter,
'cause Ali really didn't need a lot of room.

973
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:11,390
He was sharp, man. He'd come over your jab.
He could beat your hook.

974
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,060
Everything I had to do
was from right in here.

975
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,196
I couldn't open up 'cause if you open up,
that's all he needed.

976
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,536
Uppercut was my best punch.

977
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,337
Bang! Bang! Bing!

978
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:24,777
Then bop, bang, bing!
Then bop, beep, beep, beep, bop!

979
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,548
Tenth round was a close round.

980
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,485
But I think I won it because
I was in the controlling position.

981
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:45,491
There was 19 of us...
14 boys and five girls.

982
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,662
And we grew up in the projects.

983
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,739
We didn't always have a lot.

984
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,105
But we cared for each other.
We looked out for each other.

985
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,202
I came from a family of religious people.

986
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,440
My mother's father was a bishop.

987
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,607
My mother's mother was a missionary.

988
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,379
My father's mother was a missionary.

989
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,012
My father's father...

990
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,387
was a bootlegger.

991
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,960
I took after him, didn't I?

992
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,096
They gave me 15 to 25.

993
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:19,133
I'm in solitary confinement.

994
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,793
I had this dream...

995
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:23,667
I was fighting for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

996
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,807
And guess who it was... in the dream.

997
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:32,373
Ali.

998
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,142
And when I got out...

999
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:38,448
the things that I was doin' in the fight,
it was just like the dream.

1000
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,193
In the eleventh round,
I'm ahead on all scorecards.

1001
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:49,060
I was starting to move more.
Getting him to reach at me.

1002
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,328
And he threw a right hand. Pow!

1003
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,563
And it knocked me into the ropes.

1004
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,231
Well, I already know how
to fight off the ropes.

1005
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,639
I learned how to do that in prison.

1006
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,983
I took some shots. I took some shots.

1007
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,025
Freddy Nunez, the referee, stopped it.

1008
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,290
I couldn't believe it, you know.

1009
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:23,524
I'm ahead on all scorecards.

1010
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:26,897
"Come on, man. This is my moment."

1011
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,902
Am I bitter? Forget about it.

1012
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,736
I never took it personal.

1013
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:39,042
If there don't be no Ali, you think you'd be
sitting here talking to Ron Lyle?

1014
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:40,706
About what?

1015
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:48,180
But I'm still fighting.
I'm just in the corner now.

1016
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,953
I'm showing 'em how to fight.
I'm teaching 'em how to fight.

1017
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:57,192
I like trying to make a difference
in their little lives in the boxing game.

1018
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,860
If I can shed a little light
on some knowledge of the game...

1019
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,531
and they pick it up and they use it
and they take advantage of it...

1020
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,370
it's all good...
that's what I'm here for.

1021
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,748
It will be a thrilla
and a chilla and a killa...

1022
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,414
when I get the gorilla in Manila.

1023
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:23,992
I know, yeah.

1024
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,551
- I got your conscience with me.
- Yeah, how 'bout that?

1025
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:31,360
- I'm gonna keep it right here in my pocket.
- Ain't gonna do it.

1026
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,901
Fifteen rounds. And here is round one.

1027
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:45,037
The Thrilla in Manila was a heck of a fight.

1028
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,047
They both kind of died in that fight.

1029
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:50,277
Neither fighter was the same
after that fight, markedly so.

1030
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,151
Frazier is hurt.

1031
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:26,744
Is puffed around both eyes.

1032
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,055
It's all over!

1033
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,838
Boxing is a strange sport.

1034
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,568
You can overstay your welcome
and you can get physically hurt.

1035
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,576
Wiped out. Devastated mentally.

1036
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,613
Your brain can only take
so many shots to the head.

1037
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:58,615
The Thrilla in Manila was Ali's exit.

1038
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:02,452
He take that, he could be the president
of the United States.

1039
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,753
'Cause he's still sharp at this time.

1040
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:10,696
But like all fighters,
and I'm no different...

1041
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:14,530
you want to know if you can
still do it one more time.

1042
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,914
Earnie Shavers,
he's the hardest puncher I ever faced...

1043
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,922
and that's including Foreman.

1044
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:46,757
He hit me, man, and my feet just came...
The ground came up and met me.

1045
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,352
I ain't never been hit like that.

1046
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:52,059
Earnie Shavers was the hardest
I ever been hit.

1047
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:56,103
Ali don't even hit
compared to what Shavers did.

1048
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,445
Earnie Shavers, the challenger...

1049
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:42,847
he has knocked out his opponent
19 times in the first round.

1050
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,950
Oh, good right hand by Shavers!

1051
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,027
<i>Right hand. And Ali is hurt!</i>

1052
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,022
Oh, a right hand!

1053
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,430
Another flurry by Ali.

1054
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,005
Toe to toe!

1055
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,255
What a fight!

1056
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:18,345
Leon Spinks, a gold medal winner
at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal...

1057
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,444
is a young man on the move.

1058
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:23,956
Since turning pro,
he's had only had seven fights.

1059
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:27,222
And number eight will be for
the heavyweight championship of the world...

1060
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,820
as he takes on Muhammad Ali in Las Vegas.

1061
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,990
You think he is an old man though?

1062
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,001
Any man is old when he's 36.

1063
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,713
Spinks, incidentally,
is a tremendous underdog...

1064
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,977
at 8-1 Las Vegas odds.

1065
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,019
So here we go for round one.

1066
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,771
Big question here...

1067
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,448
Can Muhammad Ali,
with three minutes to go...

1068
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,419
and the final round coming up,
come back and win this fight?

1069
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,665
Okay, there is no tomorrow.

1070
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:43,204
He just got hammered!
Spinks just got hammered with a right hand!

1071
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:47,742
And Spinks comes back with a counter.
Another counter! Another! Another!

1072
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,243
And Spinks backing up the champion.

1073
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,973
With eight seconds remaining,
he just hammered Ali!

1074
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:54,639
Ali looks like he's in trouble.

1075
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,047
He's leaning against the ropes.
With two seconds.

1076
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,545
The new heavyweight!

1077
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:49,068
They didn't rob me. He did win the fight.

1078
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,400
I did lose it.
It was close, but I did lose it.

1079
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,337
And that's not gonna help me.

1080
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:56,069
Going around talking about it,
it's not gonna get the title back.

1081
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:58,372
We just admitted the strategy was wrong.

1082
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,380
We made a mistake. We all lose in life.

1083
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:03,042
We're gonna lose our mothers,
our fathers, our brothers, our sisters.

1084
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,779
We can lose our lives,
our eyesight, our health.

1085
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,754
And you just have to learn to live
with these conditions and keep going.

1086
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,262
Leon, what did you do
after the fight last night?

1087
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:26,396
That good, huh?

1088
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,841
With whom?

1089
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:44,124
You feel you have any extra responsibility
as far as your image goes?

1090
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:48,525
I don't know. I just stepped in.
I won't know until I get deeper into it.

1091
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,036
Heavyweight boxing champion
Leon Spinks is in the Bahamas today...

1092
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,128
denying drug possession charges...

1093
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,265
made against him early yesterday morning
in his native St. Louis.

1094
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:19,210
The challenger of tonight's bout...

1095
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:23,416
the former two-time great champion...

1096
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:27,791
from Louisville, Kentucky,
Muhammad Ali, the greatest.

1097
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:33,194
There's the bell.
And we're under way. Round one!

1098
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:56,655
And a good exchange as round...
Ali does his little shuffle...

1099
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,953
and the crowd loves it!

1100
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:04,157
All he needs to do is survive to 15
and he's the next champion of the world.

1101
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,792
For the first time,
unprecedented if he does it.

1102
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:11,201
Then he says he wants to retire.
Retire as the first black...

1103
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:14,207
ever to retire
as heavyweight champion of the world.

1104
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,106
It's all over!

1105
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:20,705
And Ali is the world heavyweight
champion for the third time.

1106
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:22,612
And here comes the Ali circle.

1107
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:47,532
A tremendous crowd of people
are pushing their way in.

1108
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:51,169
I says, "I cannot go out on
another loser. It's terrible."

1109
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,247
I should have quit after Foreman.

1110
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,543
I went too long. I took one too many.

1111
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:59,211
That's why I'm so lucky today to be here...

1112
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,311
able to make these boasts.

1113
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:03,481
And now, forever champion.

1114
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:08,460
To get away clean.
To come back and get out...

1115
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:12,932
and be able to say,
I'm the first black man...

1116
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:16,265
to win and get out clean.

1117
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:28,309
I wish I was smarter than I am.

1118
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:34,048
But if I could write and read and spell
as good as everybody else...

1119
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:37,647
that got a college education,
I wouldn't be who I am.

1120
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:43,029
I was 13 years old working in an ugly old
shoeshine shop in the car wash.

1121
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:46,100
Smoked some marijuana, got high.
I was selling marijuana on the street.

1122
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,795
I didn't want to do that anymore.

1123
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:53,772
I said, "I gotta stop." At that time
I was, like, 16 and a half, 17 years old.

1124
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,605
Quit. Started boxing.

1125
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,147
All I had was some talent and a heart.

1126
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:04,649
My trainer at the time
knew Angelo Dundee.

1127
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,652
He said, "We're going up
to Deer Lake, Pennsylvania...

1128
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:09,655
to see Ali at his training camp."

1129
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:13,921
Ali happened to have scheduled a exhibition,
and no one was there for him to box.

1130
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:15,757
So he asked me,
"Do you want to box me?"

1131
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:18,832
I said, "I don't want to box you, man.
I ain't ready for you."

1132
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,901
He said, "I ain't gonna hurt you.
I ain't gonna hurt you."

1133
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:24,870
We boxed three rounds. He didn't hurt me,
but I ended up with a black eye.

1134
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:28,136
And that was something that I was proud of,
that I could show off...

1135
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,905
me being a sparring partner,
me helping Muhammad Ali.

1136
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:34,243
That was even more a thrill.
It was like, "Wow, I'm with the champ."

1137
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,010
But it was a whole mess up there.

1138
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:41,520
Everybody was jealous
and jockeying for position...

1139
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:44,353
trying to be closer to Ali
than the next person.

1140
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:48,759
One time, we all drove back
to Chicago to get paid.

1141
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:52,594
Ali went in the bank,
and called each person in the bank...

1142
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,600
and paid 'em and came back.

1143
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,398
And somehow, somebody said,
"How much money you got?"

1144
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:01,703
"Well, I got 10,000."
"I got 5,000. How'd you get more than me?

1145
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,209
You didn't do this,
and I was doing this and I was doing that!"

1146
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:08,510
They was arguing about
who was getting more money than what.

1147
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:10,811
And my thing was...

1148
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:13,978
he didn't have to give me anything,
'cause he pays you every week.

1149
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:18,286
And it went on and went on and went on
that way until I left.

1150
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:23,861
The last day was when
he fought Chuck Wepner in 1975...

1151
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,399
when I got my last pay for $3,000.

1152
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:29,231
I said, "I can't be your sparring partner
no more. I gotta go do my own thing."

1153
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,067
He wished me luck.
And that's when I took off.

1154
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:35,808
Ain't nobody gave me anything.

1155
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,845
Don King controlled my situation.
They had me.

1156
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,881
I fought one year, six times,
and made $700.

1157
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,883
I thought he was finished with me.

1158
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,921
I wasn't supposed to be there. My legs were
too small. I was just to copy Muhammad Ali.

1159
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:52,550
I couldn't fight. I couldn't take it.
But I proved them all wrong.

1160
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,857
Three years later,
I'm heavyweight champion of the world.

1161
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:58,090
How do you think you'll do
against Muhammad Ali?

1162
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,895
Muhammad Ali... There's no question about
Muhammad Ali anymore.

1163
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,903
There's no more Muhammad Ali.
There's only one Larry Holmes.

1164
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:07,099
Muhammad Ali has seen the bright side.
Now he's on the dark side.

1165
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:19,611
I've had two years rest. Two years off.

1166
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:22,121
Two years off,
and I'm gonna whoop Holmes.

1167
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:24,714
It's hard to say no to all that adulation.

1168
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,590
It's hard to say no when
you're constantly in the public eye...

1169
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:30,129
when you're as revered as he was.

1170
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,062
I will destroy Holmes.

1171
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:35,602
And I want you to play
this thing over to the public...

1172
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,036
He wanted to do
what he wanted to do.

1173
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:49,378
Just like me. Just like you.

1174
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:52,849
Here comes Larry Holmes.

1175
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:55,752
The W.B.C. Heavyweight champion.

1176
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:58,485
A man who deserves recognition.

1177
01:29:58,593 --> 01:30:02,723
I was put in a no-win situation.
I beat him up, I beat up an old man.

1178
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,593
He beats me up, I never had it.

1179
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:11,970
All those years I was with him,
I never heard him curse at me like that.

1180
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,507
I never heard him curse period
like that, you know?

1181
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:19,603
"Motherfucker." "Son of a bitch." "Kick
your ass." And "I'm gonna fuck you up."

1182
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:21,614
He's lost his cool already!

1183
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:23,843
But he said all that,
and I was like, "Whoa."

1184
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:27,045
Green having trouble
getting the fight started.

1185
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:29,055
The bell for round one.

1186
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,318
Wide-eyed, posturing Ali.

1187
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,519
I wanted to bully Ali around...

1188
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:36,859
like he would bully somebody else around
as a sparring partner.

1189
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,626
I'm the man. This is my domain.

1190
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:42,430
You're trespassing.
And now you have to pay for it.

1191
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:45,233
Good right to the belly!

1192
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:48,797
My thought was to go and back him up,
keep him up against the ropes.

1193
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:51,208
And make him fight.
Just make him wear out.

1194
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:55,373
He was concentrating
on protecting himself.

1195
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:59,044
And I was able to just go straight in...

1196
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:03,214
and do whatever I wanted to do because
there was nothing coming back at me.

1197
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,818
Ali gets to his feet...

1198
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:10,125
ever so slowly for the 10th round.

1199
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,196
You could see when Ali
fought Holmes, he was shot.

1200
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:17,032
He wasn't the same fighter
in any way, shape or form...

1201
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:19,800
that he had been in the years previous.

1202
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,842
I was almost afraid
to hit him in the body.

1203
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:25,708
I was in the camp
with him many times that...

1204
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:30,375
when he went to the bathroom,
he was urinating blood.

1205
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,248
And I didn't want to do that to him.

1206
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:36,847
Holmes's corner keeps
telling him to punish Ali.

1207
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:51,605
When Holmes had him in front of him...

1208
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:54,641
it was like hitting a
slow-moving heavy bag...

1209
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:58,007
a heavy bag that once had skills,
but the run was over.

1210
01:31:58,112 --> 01:32:01,878
It was time to go. Time to quit.
Time to call it a day.

1211
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:08,015
I realize the legend
that this man has been.

1212
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:10,613
I would hope they would stop this fight.

1213
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:15,355
By Ali passing the torch
to one of his sparring partners...

1214
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:17,624
it was time for him to step down.

1215
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:22,768
I wanted him to quit like he quit.

1216
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:25,805
Just like he did...
sitting on the stool, and me walking away.

1217
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:29,035
The whole game's over!
I'm the chief second!

1218
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:31,407
- I stop the fight!
- All right.

1219
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,779
I went to his room after the fight.

1220
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:38,818
And I said to him, man...
I said, "I love ya."

1221
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,650
He said, "If you love me,
why did you beat me up like that?"

1222
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:45,715
When I left, he said,
"I will be back. I will return."

1223
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,792
I didn't see any health problems
in the future for him.

1224
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:53,697
I thought he was gonna be okay. But of
course, we all know that he's not okay anymore.

1225
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:57,794
That he has health problems
resulting from...

1226
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:01,500
either a predisposition
to that condition or to boxing...

1227
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,237
or maybe it's a combination of both.

1228
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:06,438
All this problem he's got now...

1229
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:09,778
has nothing to do basically
with Parkinson's...

1230
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:12,284
what they call his Parkinson's syndrome...

1231
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:15,844
And I was with him,
and he had his doctor with him.

1232
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:19,120
And as he went out of the room,
his doctor explained to me.

1233
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:22,593
He said... 'Cause I said to him,
"Boxing hasn't done this to Ali."

1234
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:25,291
He said, "Look, Mr. Cooper,
what you gotta realize...

1235
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:28,766
he got hit so many times
on the back of the neck...

1236
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:32,669
some brain cells have been killed off
at the base of his brain.

1237
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:36,038
It's these brain cells
that trigger a chemical release.

1238
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:38,873
They're not doing that."

1239
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,346
I think that boxing
had some effects on him...

1240
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,747
but basically, this Parkinson's thing...

1241
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,785
it's something that's...

1242
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:49,515
I've never seen this on any human being
like it's affected Muhammad Ali.

1243
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:54,520
At the time I saw him with Holmes...

1244
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,462
I thought more a sense relief
than anything else...

1245
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,499
that it's finally over...

1246
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,228
and that these people
still remember him as a great champion.

1247
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:04,270
'Cause there's too many
great fights to remember.

1248
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:07,773
And the last one he had was kind of...
was kind of a sad ending.

1249
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:11,777
But they all knew at one time
he was the greatest.

1250
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:17,743
"You're not the champ. Look at you,
you losing. You lost three rounds already.

1251
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:19,820
Come on, Leon. I hit you four times."

1252
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,013
This worries a man.

1253
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:41,473
He put it on the line, brother.

1254
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:46,842
The representation that he gave
to the black community...

1255
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:52,010
will never be forgotten,
no matter what.

1256
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,451
I am the greatest!

1257
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:26,019
Float like a butterfly.

1258
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:04,291
He was here. It was a fund-raiser.

1259
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:05,949
It was for Parkinson's, the disease.

1260
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,427
And they were taking pictures
for different newspapers and magazines.

1261
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:14,593
<i>Macleans magazine took a picture of Ali
touching my hair and him saying to me...</i>

1262
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:16,863
"Hey, man, you got some pretty hair."

1263
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:27,774
When I last saw him,
he was out walking.

1264
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:31,474
And I was just elated.

1265
01:36:31,585 --> 01:36:35,646
I would like to see him
a well Ali for the rest of his days here.

1266
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:37,815
I would just hope that that happens.

1267
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:42,652
I am the greatest!

1268
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:46,726
He had a big heart, good chin.

1269
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,166
Fast feet, fast hands.
What more do you want?

1270
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:51,568
You can't get anything else.

1271
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:04,083
I love Ali like a brother...

1272
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:07,552
and like a guy that is a celebrity...

1273
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:10,146
like a guy whose done
a lot for a lot of people.

1274
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,987
Ali was one of those guys that...

1275
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,328
made you feel good about yourself.

1276
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,365
He'd make everybody feel good.
You know, everybody.

1277
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:23,129
<i>Ali, bomayel Ali, bomayel</i>

1278
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:28,366
I look at Muhammad Ali today,
especially, and I see a hero.

1279
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:33,208
Forget about some minority and all of that.
This man was a hero to the world.

1280
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:36,715
And heroes, it doesn't matter
if they lost an arm or leg...

1281
01:37:36,817 --> 01:37:39,547
they're still beautiful
because of what they've done.

1282
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:51,462
When I see him, he's love.

1283
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:56,127
Ali was all about love, man.
You know what I mean?

1284
01:37:56,237 --> 01:38:00,139
Like I say, he can't speak for himself...

1285
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:02,709
but we can speak for him.

1286
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:55,477
Float like a butterfly! Sting like a bee!

1287
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:58,745
Float like a butterfly! Sting like a bee!

1288
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:00,820
Float like a butterfly!
