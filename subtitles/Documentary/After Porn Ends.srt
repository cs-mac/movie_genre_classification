2
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:34,037
Uh, we don't get TV in this
house, um, we all have computers.

3
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,617
My daughter and my son are three and two
and they each have their own computers,

4
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:41,575
and they're lined up next
to mommy's computers, and,

5
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:44,312
um, my little girl is
really really super smart.

6
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:47,109
She can use a computer really well,

7
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,995
she surfs around this, online
and she uses photoshop

8
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,468
she uses word, I mean she's
only three years old

9
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:54,557
and she can read and write
and use a computer

10
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:56,304
just like an adult, she's pretty amazing.

11
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,944
I didn't plan to be a single mom.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,090
I didn't plan to be stuck
in the middle of the desert

13
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,461
where I don't know anybody,

14
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:03,807
it's just kind of
all been thrown for a loop.

15
00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:08,928
So at that point I said
we gotta arrest him,

16
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:11,921
so we arrested him,
and he cried like a baby, didn't he.

17
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,463
"I can't go back to jail! Ahhhhhhhh!"

18
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,591
and he just cried like a baby.
I said okay.

19
00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:18,980
I gave him the opportunity
to make very small

20
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,606
reasonable payments,
he didn't make any of the payments,

21
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:25,196
I warned him if he didn't make the payments
I was gonna come and take his grandma's car.

22
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,451
That's what he forced us to do,
and the day that I took this car

23
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:31,915
his little 87-year-old grandma
or mother was out there with her walker

24
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,589
watching us take her car.

25
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,725
And it was one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,772
But you know what? Business is business.

27
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:44,241
So. Now the clay is pretty much
conditioned, it's ready to be worked with.

28
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:50,225
We're gonna give ourselves, a base, and
then uh, he will be put into action.

29
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:53,378
I would see if he can find a girlfriend.

30
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:56,729
Since he's gone throughout
this radical surgical procedure,

31
00:01:56,873 --> 00:01:58,908
to have his
penis re-installed.

32
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:03,748
Imagine how happy he is when he wakes up
and finds out, he's got a dick again.

33
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:07,919
Wow, you know that's a, that's a big
day in the coyote's life. Huh?!

34
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,907
And I knew that, getting this opportunity
to be on a mainstream show,

35
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,471
I knew my whole life,
like, once I got out to LA,

36
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:19,838
once I could get on a reality show,
and get the opportunity to show people,

37
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:22,332
like, about me,
that that would be the big thing

38
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:25,573
I need to move forward mainstream. I just
need that one opportunity to get there.

39
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:29,473
No! What happens is it like, it like, like,
you're trying to put it in it like bends.

40
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:32,543
And you, it's better if it's like a
solid one. -That's reality right there.

41
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:38,222
No, I'm not kidding. But, like, one like
this, then it doesn't, it goes faster.

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,295
And he comes from, of course the uh, story
of the old testament, the story of Josean.

43
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:47,927
Um, and this is
kind of a modern day adaptation of that.

44
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:50,556
Currently, (unintelligible conversation)
That is amazing,

45
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,601
that is amazing
and God bless you and take care.

46
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,331
I'm definitely still growing spiritually.
I don't think you can ever quit growing.

47
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:05,334
There's always room to get closer to God
and things to learn about him and...

48
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:09,416
ways to change your life and to improve.

49
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:12,011
It is a mess.
- You're a mess.

50
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,005
It's a mess. But that's
the way gnocchies are.

51
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,854
A little bit of a mess.

52
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:19,834
It's like, a guy told me once,
when he was painting.

53
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:22,242
Is that how you,
how it was more basic and then he went in.

54
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,672
Well it wasn't more basic,
it was just a painting I did

55
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:27,314
and then one day I took it out and I just
started painting

56
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:30,362
all this other stuff in there
and just went in with this reds and...

57
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,642
I don't, I don't remember
what it looked like before,

58
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:35,903
I can't remember, I just, very hard to
keep a band together and I only wanna play

59
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:38,568
with certain guys
that I really love playing with.

60
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:41,079
Cause it all comes together, it's
like summer theatre you know.

61
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,700
Wow! I got a barn, and
I got to, I got to,

62
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:48,754
I got the instruments, we'll put our own
show on! You know what I mean.

63
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,462
It all still has that, that element.

64
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:56,243
This is uh, one of the Chinatown series.
From my home town. After the mill closed.

65
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:59,676
I mean, pretty much closed.

66
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:02,443
What'd you get last year, for
your birthday, from Aunt Lynny?

67
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:05,569
I think a Power Ranger suit. -You got what?
No, you didn't!

68
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:08,086
You didn't get a Power Ranger suit
that was for Halloween.

69
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:11,175
You got an electric guitar...
A 'lectric guitar...

70
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:13,839
A REAL electric guitar!

71
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:17,155
Why? Because you told aunt Lynny you
wanted to grow up to be a rockstar.

72
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:21,790
You know what, I just see a beautiful
girl and I just wanna hug her!

73
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,697
Well, I love this one right here,
so I telling you.

74
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:29,685
I currently reach out to women and men in
the sex industry and the porn industry

75
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:33,243
and I absolutely love pulling them
out of the pit

76
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,533
the porn industry pit.

77
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:41,595
It's 1800 square feet and, the guest
house is around 600 square feet.

78
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,534
That little garage area, I don't know.

79
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:49,224
Um, it took me about a year to really
get serious about studying,

80
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:55,618
and, it took me three times to
pass the test, but I did it and,...

81
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,271
here I am.

82
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,510
Got into real-estate, I've
been in it for five years.

83
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:07,904
Over here. -Yup.
- Dark and mild.

84
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,326
No, he likes the dark heavy.
Dark heavy.

85
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:13,993
When I'm at home,
I run around with no makeup on,

86
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,385
a pair of sweatpants, bare foot, a t-shirt,
and I'm usually out in the yard digging.

87
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:22,346
Because I like to plant things,
I like to grow things.

88
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,184
Or decorating my house.

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,427
I like to do crafty things,
like, you know, I don't,

90
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,756
I know I don't seem like
the domestic goddess!

91
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:35,034
But I, I,
I like to make things for the house

92
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:39,080
and I love to cook.
And, I'm a very good cook.

93
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:46,090
I had a little bit, of, a, some bad
terrible terrible news, uh, this April.

94
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:50,912
Um, I was diagnosed with uh,
stage three melanoma cancer.

95
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:55,918
So for the past four or five months I've
been dealing with that and on chemo.

96
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:58,609
They recommended complete dissection
of the lymph-nodes,

97
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:04,483
and then to be on heavy-dose interferon,
which would be uh, intravenous,

98
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:08,682
which I would get five times a week, for
the first month, and then after that,

99
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:14,491
three times a week, for eleven
months, for the rest of the year.

100
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:18,332
And um, it's, it's been tough.

101
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,784
It's actually great here, cause, how
many porno stars live here? I know...

102
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:25,803
There's some more uh, there's
some more coming in uh, Sunset,

103
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:29,583
uh, Houston, uh,
Taylor Saint-Claire just moved here.

104
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,331
What, whatever happened to uh,
she was really hot, but I loved her.

105
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:35,728
What happened to that um... oh
godammit, I don't know their names

106
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,928
I'm really bad with this, um...
You remember their tits. Yeah.

107
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:41,969
Oh god, she was um,
oh that doesn't make any difference.

108
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,335
She was living here for
a long time she was so hot.

109
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:46,103
(unintelligible conversation)

110
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:50,010
Oh yeah, she just moved outta town,
yeah, she just moved outta town.

111
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,596
And uh, that's the only thing
I missed out on in life.

112
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:54,559
I've done, pretty much everything I wanted.

113
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,057
I did wanna have kids,
didn't have the opportunity

114
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:01,519
to meet the right woman the right
time, so I do kinda miss out on that,

115
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,968
but uh,
nobody gets everything there's other guys

116
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,366
that have great kids
and they love every minute of it

117
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:10,396
they kinda wish they were me,
fantasy wise,

118
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:14,216
but um, nobody gets everything.

119
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:22,106
<b>AFTER PORN ENDS</b>

120
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,130
I started modeling in ninth grade.

121
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:29,159
My mom put me through modeling school,
I graduated from modeling school,

122
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:35,644
started doing beauty pageants, and
model searches, and bikini contests.

123
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:42,218
So, I was exposed, to,
not so much the adult industry

124
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,669
but just knowing that I could make money
with my body.

125
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,795
I had a roommate at the time,

126
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,620
um, that was a dancer, and she knew
an agent, his name was Jim Salf.

127
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:55,924
He said, "Hey, there's a producer
that saw your picture

128
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:59,399
and he'd like you to come do a movie
how would you like to do a movie?"

129
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,114
And I said, uh, well,
I've never done a movie before

130
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,414
but sure, I could do it, no problem.

131
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,099
I went down and I had
braids like Bo Derek

132
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,470
at the time and, and
did my first scene.

133
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,745
It was a three-way. I had never
even, been with a woman,

134
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:19,344
I didn't know what to do with a woman,
I had, no idea what I was doing.

135
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,963
But the minute those lights hit me,

136
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,373
I swear that was
where I was supposed to be.

137
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,785
Everyone said do it, do it, do it.

138
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,318
And the more you do the more money you
can make dancing on the dance circuit,

139
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:35,262
the more magazines you can do,
the more you're exposed, you can,

140
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:39,594
I mean gosh, I have a sex toy line, now
we wanna do an action figure of you.

141
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,824
Okay! I mean, all of it
was just like, cool!

142
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:46,459
You know, sign me up! Sure!

143
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,756
I was just having a blast, I mean,
there were fans

144
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:54,528
lined up for miles and miles
and miles that flew,

145
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,354
I mean some people came from
Poland and Berlin,

146
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,140
and come to think of it
when I went to Poland,

147
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:03,061
to um, sign autographs and whatever,

148
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:05,788
I mean, when I got off the plane
I needed a body guard!

149
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:12,421
I mean, for a porn star to be that big,
around the world,

150
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,642
I mean, it was un-believable,
I mean felt like a...

151
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:16,975
I was a true super star!

152
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,854
I mean people, were knocking
each other down.

153
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:23,654
Heeeere's Houston!!!!

154
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:32,208
Over the Dali Lama in the newspaper,

155
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,779
I was the headliner.
I mean, that's unbelievable.

156
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:38,455
I was still under contract,
I was with Metro Productions

157
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:41,237
for a few years,
and they're the ones that also produced

158
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,126
uh, the Houston 500,
the world's biggest gang-bang.

159
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:48,376
Um, at that point when I first signed
with Metro,

160
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:52,714
it was already known going in
that I was gonna takeover,

161
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:57,060
uh, Jasmine Saint-Clair's
title and do this gang-bang.

162
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,383
So, going into my contract with Metro,

163
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,066
I already knew that I was gonna be
doing that,

164
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:06,758
so, I wasn't,
I wasn't looking for things to,

165
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,752
oh I've gotta be more crazy and wild,

166
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:13,887
you know honestly
it just all came to me naturally.

167
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:16,282
Like, I mean, I had a labiaplasty,

168
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:19,081
and that was before
a lot of women even knew

169
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:24,364
that they can get their labia trimmed if
you have larger labia lips and you know,

170
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:27,846
when I did that it was like, oh,
it was just a no brainer

171
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:32,272
I'm gonna encase that in lucite
and auction it. The trimmings.

172
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:37,837
I mean, it's just things just came
to me, I was just a publicity whore.

173
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,679
I was good at it.

174
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,851
I had invested my money, uh,
I bought a home,

175
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:46,867
as well as, um, put a lot of money
in mutual funds,

176
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:50,732
and many years ago
when the stock market went kaput,

177
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:55,889
I lost, like, almost all my savings.
And that hurt me.

178
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,052
Um, but I did still have my house
that I owned in LA,

179
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:02,330
um, and then when things got rough
of course I sold it,

180
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:05,591
not for financial reasons but when I
wanted to get out of the industry.

181
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:11,045
I'm professor of communications
studies and psychology at UCLA.

182
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:17,059
I study a variety of topics,
but one of the major areas

183
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,619
that I study is pornography.

184
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:23,654
I'm Faith, and since 1984
I've done about 600 films.

185
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:25,806
About a thousand scenes, give or take.

186
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:29,587
Um, I've won
several dozen awards for acting

187
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,170
in sex performances
and fan favorite and this and that.

188
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:36,726
I think it might be up,
this year for best non-sex role

189
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:40,287
I've also moved into
the occasional character part

190
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:42,234
that doesn't involve having sex.

191
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:44,899
I write about the sex industry pretty much

192
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:50,325
from the fall of 1995
until the fall of 2007.

193
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:53,349
"The History of X:
One Hundred Years of Sex in Film"

194
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,794
is the name of my first book.

195
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,801
I've been in the
adult entertainment industry

196
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,450
for basically 35-36 years,
in every capacity.

197
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,286
I started as a writer, became an actor,

198
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:07,965
director, agent, and now
I'm sorta the, papa bear

199
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,757
to the adult entertainment industry,
protecting adult welfare,

200
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,686
which I run, and, watch over
the overaged juvenile delinquents

201
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,728
and what I refer
to as the playpen of the damned,

202
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:18,421
which is the X-rated industry.

203
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,159
What we give them in the adult
entertainment industry

204
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:25,852
for a brief shiny moment is
immortality, validation, and credibility.

205
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:30,430
Every one of us, no matter how
insignificant we may think we are,

206
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,944
wants to be recognized at one
time or another in our lives,

207
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:36,725
and when you went to those conventions
they lined up at your booth

208
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:40,136
like they were getting
signatures from professional athletes.

209
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:44,594
My parents divorced. My dad took us
far away from our mother,

210
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,601
and ran away with us.
He became an alcoholic.

211
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:52,618
Then I moved in with my mom and the
family relationship changed, um,

212
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,905
I felt kind of lost. I worked a
regular job, um, in an office,

213
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:03,441
for five years, but while I was doing
those things I also found um,

214
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:08,612
a modeling website and I put
my pictures on the website,

215
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:13,816
and then um, you know, I was still working
in the office but people were emailing me

216
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:19,590
about doing shoots.
And I thought it would be cool to do,

217
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:23,744
like, bikini stuff, or, even though
I never really even

218
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,856
walked around in bikinis I thought
it would be, kind of neat.

219
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:33,251
So, eventually, I did take a job, um doing,

220
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:37,267
um, you know they were only asking me to
do nudes and eventually I just did it.

221
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:40,674
I went to my first shoot,
in like a hotel room,

222
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:47,661
and um, it was just supposed to be
topless, and it, was, it was really scary.

223
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,803
Um...

224
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:53,485
It was weird.

225
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,752
Well ever since I,
since I got into the business,

226
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,748
I always got emails, that said that
you, you don't look quite comfortable,

227
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:07,393
and I think that it was the innocence,
that, attracted my, a lot of my fans,

228
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:10,425
is that I didn't look totally comfortable
in anything I did,

229
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:13,016
and even if I was speaking I didn't
look totally comfortable

230
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,253
and I never looked confident, I wasn't
very verbal, I wasn't, you know,

231
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:21,059
over the top with the noises
or anything, um.

232
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:26,756
I dunno, I just started feeling,
really depressed about it. Honestly.

233
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:34,421
And, then I hit rock bottom myself,
emotionally, where I um, got really upset

234
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:37,261
and I'd go in the bathroom and
I threw a glass

235
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:42,959
on the ground and then I um, just crying

236
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,621
and fall to the ground
and just started like,

237
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:48,403
pounding my wrists into the glass,
and blood was,

238
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,486
just started going everywhere, and...

239
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,963
I dunno, I just kinda lost that hope.

240
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:57,932
I did have a stalker, um, he started
off just sending me hate-mail.

241
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:03,157
He's an atheist, so he was pretty
much, putting down what I believe in

242
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,963
and trying to get me to debate him.
He, heh, became obsessed with me

243
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:14,093
and developed like this, crush on me. And
then I told him we would never date,

244
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:18,010
I don't know you I don't know where you
live, you're too young, blah blah blah.

245
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,842
And um, he flipped out.

246
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:25,996
The thing that pushed me to the edge was
he said he was gonna, um, he wanted

247
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:29,189
to bash my head into the concrete
until my brains spilled out.

248
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:32,029
And then kill my cat and stuff like that.

249
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:37,716
A few fans had emailed me the last year
or so and said they were praying for me

250
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:40,143
and that they were not
looking at porn anymore,

251
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:42,583
and, you know,
and then I had this other guy saying

252
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:45,432
you need to put a warning on your
website because kids can see this

253
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:47,531
my fourteen-year-old son found this,
and then...

254
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:51,807
Just all kinds of people were like, sending
me these emails, random emails and...

255
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,557
You know it uh, and of course I would,
I was always kind of sympathetic

256
00:15:56,715 --> 00:16:00,319
to whatever they said but, um,
there was some,

257
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:03,986
you know I was still kind of hardened too,
at the same time, because I was like well,

258
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:08,094
I can't do anything else, this is what I'm
good at. This is all that, I know.

259
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:14,095
And, I kind of believed it at the time.
I didn't have anybody you know,

260
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:19,045
saying, you're better than that.
So, um...

261
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:22,712
Some adult stars do "find god" and leave,

262
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,770
but those are people who needed,

263
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:28,093
who needed to be gone anyway,
and did not have

264
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:30,509
the personal strength to do it
and so they do look outside

265
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,217
for something to help them leave.

266
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:35,358
Um, there are plenty of people in the
business who really shouldn't be here,

267
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,747
because they have conflict about...
if I was-, if I'd been raised

268
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,517
to be ashamed of my body,
and to feel bad about men

269
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,447
and their and the horrible desires,

270
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:48,046
but, did porn for other reasons eventually
those two things are gonna co-,

271
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,767
wheels are gonna come off the bus.

272
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,924
I can only deny it so long,
people try to deny,

273
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,089
they stuff their feelings with, with drugs,

274
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,602
and alcohol, or whatever it is
they stuff their feelings with

275
00:16:57,604 --> 00:17:00,177
and after a six months, one year,
five year, ten years, whatever

276
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:03,018
it finally goes you know what?
I can't do this anymore.

277
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,427
Because for religion and especially
western religion, especially Christianity

278
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,029
says I love you, I forgive you,
you can come home now.

279
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,788
And I will not push you out.

280
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,597
And so that is incredibly powerful
and incredibly potent

281
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,812
to have someone finally say
I don't shame you.

282
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,658
I love you. You're welcome here.

283
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,962
Sign me up!

284
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:26,961
When you're involved in this
industry you lose your humanity.

285
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,527
You're no longer treated as a human being
by eighty percent of people out there.

286
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,755
You're now, now scum.

287
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:36,360
Like they maybe wanna,
do certain things with you.

288
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,768
But then, you're still scum.

289
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,494
And, like if, they may be thrilled
to have a roll in the sac with you

290
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,627
but when they leave, when you leave
they're gonna wanna burn the sheets.

291
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:50,400
Uh, ah, I got into porn by accident. It
wasn't something I planned on doing,

292
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,037
uh, probably mighta been the, the least
likely thing I thought I woulda done.

293
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,820
I was singing in bands after I, a
baseball thing didn't work out,

294
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:02,603
uh, I knew I could sing
so I started singing in rock bands.

295
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:05,307
And of course like all
struggling musicians you

296
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,494
gotta make a little extra
dough on the side.

297
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:11,454
It actually, my, my first naked job
I was a nude art model

298
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,959
for like you know college art
classes and stuff like that.

299
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:16,275
And I was really kinda shy
but not about my body

300
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:18,849
just about talking
I was kinda shy about talking.

301
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:22,114
But yeah I'd get naked in front of
people so I did that and a couple girls

302
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:25,449
in one of the classes asked to take
some pictures of me and they did and...

303
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:28,229
They came out pretty good and they said
can we send them to some magazines

304
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:30,637
I said I don't care do what you want.

305
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,248
And they sent'em out and and next thing
I know I got a letter from Playgirl,

306
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,162
and, but High Society said they
like to do a boy/girl thing

307
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:38,983
but I said alright.
So it was the first thing I ever did.

308
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,459
And they had a woman editor and at the
end of the shoot she goes you know uh,

309
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:44,856
I noticed you were taking care of
business pretty good,

310
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:48,765
did you ever think about doing a porn
movie cause I got some connections.

311
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:51,426
And I go,
I never really thought about it, no.

312
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:54,489
She goes well you know, I think,
I can get you 250 bucks.

313
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:58,653
Like, 250 bucks man! 1978
that was some good cash,

314
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:00,265
that's what I was making a week!

315
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,427
So I said uh,
alright I'll try it, you know.

316
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:07,670
So I did it and uh, guess I was good
at it cause they kept calling me back.

317
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:10,489
And uh, that's kinda how it got started.

318
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:13,926
I, I used to say it's like borrowing
somebody's body to masturbate with.

319
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:15,827
Uh, excuse me,
if you're not busy do you mind

320
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,826
if I jerk off in your pussy with my dick?

321
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,506
Uh, it's kinda like that,
which it's not bad,

322
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:23,947
I mean you know,
better than real jerkin' off, but...

323
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,625
When I first started producing up-and-
comers I get this letter in the mail

324
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:31,724
and I open it up, and I see this
unbelievably, good-looking,

325
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:36,604
very young looking blonde girl,
with beautiful natural boobs,

326
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:42,383
little baby face, and she wants to know
if I can help her get in the porn biz.

327
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:44,953
Girl's name was Jenna Jameson.

328
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,690
I remember saying this
I mean holy christ

329
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:49,305
if I get this girl to shoot for
me we're gonna sell some tapes.

330
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:51,323
I said well if you don't wanna do guys
you know

331
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,717
I'll let you pick whatever girl you want
if you wanna do that. And she liked girls.

332
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,590
So she picked this girl that
I happened to be working with

333
00:19:57,592 --> 00:19:59,931
that day who was doing her first movie,
Kylie Ireland,

334
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,425
so Kylie and Jenna were doing
their thing together

335
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:05,281
and uh, everything was going good,

336
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:08,844
and they took a little break
and while they were lying there I...

337
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,615
I think I said something like,

338
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:14,118
man Jenna that's a
tasty looking pussy you got.

339
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,937
And I believe she said well why
don't you come in and taste it.

340
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,422
I was...

341
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:22,951
Okay, I was doing the camera but
I handed it to my assistant,

342
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:25,973
Bob hold onto this, start shooting.

343
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:28,984
So I get in there and
I start going down on her

344
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:31,371
and she starts squealing
that little squeal that she had

345
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:35,225
and um, I'm guessing she's kinda
liking it you know,

346
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,527
and seemed like she was getting off
and everything's good

347
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,731
and I said man, I am so fuckin' horny now.

348
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:42,881
I said would you guys mind maybe like,
giving me a double blowjob or something?

349
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:46,537
And they said sure, we can do that,
and I'm like... Thank you, thank you!

350
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:52,547
And they did and it went well and
a week later she kinda called me back

351
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,356
and said you know what you weren't
so bad I think I could probably do

352
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:59,381
a boy girl thing with you and the
rest is kinda history after that.

353
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:03,561
"It's a Daddy Thing" number three!
Old man, can make a comeback!

354
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,456
Yeah!
Still there baby, no viagra yet!

355
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,643
Um, and it, you know,
it's cool you do your thing,

356
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,791
you go home, you came,
you relax you know but,

357
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:16,526
I'm kind of an affectionate kinda guy,

358
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:18,697
and so I kinda miss that part
of it and that's why

359
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:21,280
I still like having a relationship,
when it happens, you know.

360
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:25,650
And uh, you know for example eh,
Tera Patrick man,

361
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,935
not only was she incredible in bed but
there was just, I just liked her.

362
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:32,490
And, that that, sense of humor
and the craziness,

363
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,319
a little bit different, you know.

364
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:38,437
So, I hadn't dated anybody in so long
when I met her

365
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:43,353
I forgot how to do it, and uh, I
did ask her out to dinner twice,

366
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,617
and we went out to dinner
and we had a good time but

367
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:50,789
I dropped her off at her place without
asking her if I could, come in.

368
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,919
And I don't know eh, I might have,
she mighta thought I was weird.

369
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:57,856
I already had sex with her
a couple of times, on camera,

370
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,825
and she mighta thought it was weird that I
didn't wanna come up and finish the date,

371
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:04,600
but I was kinda showing her that
I wasn't just there for the sex,

372
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:10,267
and, maybe it wasn't a good move cause
you leave a beautiful woman like that

373
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,554
alone for too long and
somebody else is gonna come along

374
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:15,741
and somebody else did come
along and that was that.

375
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,575
She made it today, this
is Tera Patrick. Hello.

376
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:22,789
And uh, Tera is reasonably known in the
business and hasn't even worked that often.

377
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:24,990
Apparently. Um.

378
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:31,450
<i>I was just trying to pace myself right now.</i>
- One of my all time favorites.

379
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:39,972
Most of the people
who seek it out don't have

380
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:44,859
means of making that kind of money
by other means.

381
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:49,016
I mean very few women say hmm,
I'm going to become a surgeon

382
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:52,183
or I'm going to become a pornography star.

383
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:55,113
This country does not raise people
with a very good work ethic.

384
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:58,242
They don't know how to do anything else.
They don't know how to do retail,

385
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,916
they don't know how to do
Excel spreadsheets.

386
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:04,788
Many people who
make their way to adult entertainment,

387
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,016
like rock-and-roll,
are not suited for nine-to-five work.

388
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:12,203
I, ran away from home at sixteen

389
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:14,311
and was living on the streets at seventeen.

390
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:16,772
Uh, everything I owned
was in two garbage bags.

391
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:22,184
Um, my parents were saying
I hope you just kill yourself

392
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:24,153
and make life a lot easier
for the rest of us.

393
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:27,833
Uh, it was just on and on and on
so there I was out on the streets

394
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:32,825
and then, when I got taken in with a
foster family, um, I made sure that

395
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:35,925
I kept finishing school with good grades
because that was gonna be my future

396
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:38,755
that was gonna be my ticket outta there
and then when I went to college

397
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:42,078
on full academic scholarship.
I never actually went to classes.

398
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,654
I said okay I've got free room
and board, I need to make money.

399
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:47,177
I need to get some sort
of security and stability

400
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:51,978
in my life so I don't have to
turn tricks to get food to eat.

401
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:55,569
So I took up stripping,
I went to all the local strip bars,

402
00:23:55,571 --> 00:23:59,496
and from there I started doing
magazines in New York City.

403
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:02,455
I would take a train to New York
City on weekends and do magazines.

404
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:06,621
And then, uh, a photographer said
he knew a director in California

405
00:24:06,623 --> 00:24:09,856
named Bud Lee who could direct me in
some movies if I wanted to do that.

406
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:14,328
So um, I packed up my suitcase and
a teddy bear and went out to LA.

407
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:18,336
Made a movie for Bud Lee, married him,
didn't come back.

408
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:21,348
The reason that I wanted to do porn,

409
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,508
even though I was so smart,
Miss MENSA and all that is

410
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,801
uh, it's precisely because
I wanted to stop being known

411
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:32,913
as the nerd the geek the,
the one that you come over

412
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:35,860
and you be nice to me just so you
can copy off of my tests, you know.

413
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:39,749
I would hang out with some of my
misfit friends and they had,

414
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:42,987
they had adult magazines hidden under
their bed and they would look at them

415
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,926
and I would be peeking over their shoulder.

416
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:46,813
I wish someone
looked at me like that.

417
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:49,045
And that was just like my
wildest fantasy that

418
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:53,168
someone would think that I was
pretty and sexy and, woo!

419
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,546
All my life I'd just been
the nerd and the geek.

420
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:57,770
So it was like a fantasy
come true for me that

421
00:24:57,772 --> 00:25:00,179
someone wanted to see me on the cover
of a magazine.

422
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:01,947
When I got to porn it was like

423
00:25:02,013 --> 00:25:05,126
wait, I get to pick which one of these
good-looking guys I wanna sleep with?

424
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,823
And uh, you're gonna pay me for it

425
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:09,659
and then you're gonna put me on a box
cover and give me tons of money?

426
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:13,129
It was just uh, a really big step
up from where I was coming from.

427
00:25:13,784 --> 00:25:16,867
Porn wasn't all that much of a mental
challenge for me shall we say, um,

428
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:20,704
standing there and saying
my silly lines just,

429
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,713
it didn't take up a
whole lot of my day

430
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:25,864
so meanwhile you got a lot
of time to sit around and wait

431
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:29,010
so uh, I just kept myself busy
by learning every single job on the set.

432
00:25:30,686 --> 00:25:34,298
Um, I... I would get the grips
to take me down to the grip truck

433
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,437
and show me the names of everything on
there and teach me how to do everything

434
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:40,762
by showing up with my little grip belt and
my shorts and my gloves and no shirt on.

435
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,845
And I would ask very nicely if they
would teach me their job and they did,

436
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:49,421
and, much the same way I learned editing,
directing, producing, scriptwriting,

437
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,119
um, every job on the set I've gotten.

438
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:55,763
If you look on IMDB my name has got all
credits next to it I did everything.

439
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,825
I even designed my own box covers.

440
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:02,507
Um, what made me different was
I was the first half-asian

441
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,974
to become an A-list star in the business.

442
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:07,934
Um, before I'd started
there was the white girls

443
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:11,079
and the black girls and the asian girls
and each had their own separate genre,

444
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:15,542
and, they didn't mix, you, you don't put
an asian girl in a white girl movie.

445
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,176
It's just the way it was.

446
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,496
And then when I came in
and I was only half-asian

447
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:22,309
the features were soft enough that
they could still put me on a cover

448
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:25,684
and I could still be a white girl, or and
asian girl, they could play me either way.

449
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:28,919
Or they could play me as an Indian
or a Gypsy, or, Greek girl!

450
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,502
They gave me all the different roles.

451
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:33,569
So they just, they wound up using
my look as very versatile.

452
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:37,269
And so I became the first "cross-over"
star from a minority,

453
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:39,352
and then uh, I guess
they did pretty well with me

454
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:42,653
cause after I left Vivid they got
Koby Tie, who was full asian, so,

455
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:46,706
I kinda opened the door
for the minorities to become A-listers.

456
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,857
I, I hated doing live appearance.

457
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,971
Oh I'm getting sweaty just looking
at this picture. Yeah.

458
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:54,850
I spent like all year long
dreading the CES Show.

459
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,833
I would just have to keep telling myself

460
00:26:56,835 --> 00:26:59,566
they're more scared than you are,
they're more scared than you are.

461
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:03,028
Cause I'd smile and I'd say "So what's
your name?" and they'd go...

462
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:06,624
they'd just look at me.
Okay what's your name?!

463
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:10,716
If you see my very first interviews from
when I was nineteen, twenty years old,

464
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:12,615
I said I'm gonna retire when I'm thirty.

465
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:15,224
And people would laugh and say oh
you've got it all planned out.

466
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:17,043
There really wasn't any question about it.

467
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:21,167
I had, gotten married, and, then divorced.

468
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:25,432
And I met someone who had adult bookstores.

469
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:28,104
So I basically got my introduction

470
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:32,182
to the adult entertainment world
through working in adult bookstores,

471
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:37,285
and then consequently owning adult
bookstores and I saw the women

472
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:41,612
that were doing movies at the time and,
I was just,

473
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:45,831
amazed, because,
they had pimples on their rear-ends,

474
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,782
they had on no makeup,
their feet were dirty,

475
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:51,707
their hair was dirty, and I thought my god,

476
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:54,411
this is not a really good
representation of women.

477
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:56,089
I wanna do that.

478
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:03,795
I mean I had done, um, a few magazines
and a few uh, like, 8 mm loops,

479
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:08,469
and then I came to California, and I
picked up one of the free papers and,

480
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:09,965
there was an ad.

481
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:14,067
My family was very, very okay
with what I did because

482
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:19,273
I did tell them what I was about to
do before I actually did anything.

483
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:24,916
I mean I'd done a couple of photo shoots,
and decided that I needed to tell my family

484
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:28,304
before it got out there
because I didn't want

485
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,537
them finding out from someone else.

486
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:34,234
And they're like well do, you
think you can make money at it?

487
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:36,766
You think you can have a good career
and be happy doing this?

488
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:40,072
And I said yes I do, and they said good,
go do it.

489
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,564
We had a very small community of people,

490
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:48,303
of players, that we all worked with.

491
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,916
And we all worked with
each other quite a bit.

492
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:56,626
So the community was small, we were
familiar with one another, and, we actu...

493
00:28:56,628 --> 00:29:01,719
it's like when you, have a, a new boyfriend
or new girlfriend or a new husband or wife,

494
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:04,599
it takes a little while
before you know what

495
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:06,734
pushes their buttons, what turns them on

496
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:10,543
what makes them feel good,
and then it starts

497
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:16,001
to become very intimate,
and, you can actually,

498
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:20,056
have an intimate relationship with the
person you're working with on screen,

499
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:22,682
and be fond of them
after the movie is over.

500
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:27,767
Um, but they're just
generally sweet nice people.

501
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:35,073
I was being offered parts in movies,
in, or photo shoots or what have you,

502
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:39,274
and they didn't want to pay me
the amount of money I wanted,

503
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:42,452
and I said no. I just, I held out.

504
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:47,612
So, um, and subsequently
I started stripping,

505
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:51,651
going across the,
basically across the world stripping.

506
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:55,948
And uh, doing photo shoots
with Club Magazine predominantly.

507
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:59,256
And um, so they didn't see me in front,

508
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:02,530
people didn't see me in front of the camera
so they thought okay, she's retired.

509
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,619
I've been retired and come back
so many times

510
00:30:05,662 --> 00:30:09,223
I can't keep track anymore. I've
also been dead a few times.

511
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:14,906
I saw an add in the paper it said
"Nude fun, big bucks."

512
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:17,709
and uh, it was an audition
for an X-rated movie.

513
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:19,826
Two days later I get a call
from the producer,

514
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:21,701
they wanna give me a part in the movie.

515
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:23,678
I hadn't planned on that.

516
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:29,925
At the time, I had applied to the
Hebrew Union Seminary in Cincinnati,

517
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:33,070
where they uh, train
people to become Rabbis.

518
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,028
So I'm trying to measure,
do I wanna do this,

519
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,955
or do I wanna be in a porn movie
because it seems

520
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:40,923
if I take the part in the porn
movie I maybe,

521
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:45,241
um, cutting some of my options off,
for future life.

522
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:50,255
And the uh, seminary in Cincinnati
said we'll take you

523
00:30:50,257 --> 00:30:55,079
but the first two years you have to go to
Jerusalem and study Aramaic, which,

524
00:30:55,081 --> 00:30:58,910
I would rather go to Cleveland
and study their sewer system.

525
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:01,122
Um, no interest there.

526
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:03,560
So I decided I would make the porn movie.

527
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:07,078
And, in any case the kind of Rabbi
I would become,

528
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,489
would be the kind that
could've made a porn movie.

529
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:12,310
And uh, I went ahead and did the job.

530
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:16,775
I think I had to become a sex
star just to come back to normal!

531
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:20,751
Cause I'd been so humiliated
by being the fat kid!

532
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,391
I had the largest breasts
in the seventh grade!

533
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:27,087
The guys would make fun of me
and point at me and tease me!

534
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:30,761
Do you know how deep those scars go?!
That's ugly shit!

535
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,552
Those are the people that
become centerfolds!

536
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:35,209
Cause they got something to prove.

537
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:39,599
I was lucky enough to uh,
be in the era when they were

538
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:42,260
actually trying to make movies where
you needed to remember lines.

539
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,598
And I had the, I was good at that.

540
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,002
So, I got hired for my acting ability,
which being a good actor in porn,

541
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:53,665
is like being the wisest man
in the kingdom of the fools.

542
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,441
He promised that I could fuck you next.
- He what?!

543
00:31:57,545 --> 00:32:00,001
Gah!
Ow!

544
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,956
Let him alone! I
said let him alone!

545
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,556
Ow! Ah, oh uh!

546
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:10,884
Get the fuck outta here!
- My ankle! Ow, my ankle!

547
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,117
I was terrible at the sex.

548
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,831
Just rotten!
I was just so traumatized by it.

549
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:19,976
But I eventually did learn
how to have sex on camera.

550
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:23,571
I was on the beach in San Diego
and uh, I was by myself.

551
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,397
And I'm sitting there, and I notice
there's a really beautiful woman,

552
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:33,694
laying on a towel and so my gaze drifts
over to her and her boyfriend looks at me

553
00:32:33,696 --> 00:32:35,894
and sees her... and I look away.

554
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:38,508
And then eventually I'd drift back
and I'm looking at her again

555
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:41,147
and the boyfriend sees me looking
at her again and I'm like shit.

556
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:45,101
Well the guy gets up, and he starts
walkin' over towards me

557
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:48,149
and I'm going Oh no! Here we go.

558
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:49,620
You know, this is gonna get ugly.

559
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:54,263
And he gets close to me and I, I'm just
clenching my fist ready to defend myself.

560
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:58,875
The guy's a monster, I'm gonna get killed,
I know it, and he leans in and he says

561
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:03,623
"Were you in Insatiable?"
And I went YES! YES!

562
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,558
I was so happy that's what it was,
he recognized me from the movie

563
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,610
business and he wasn't gonna kick
my ass it was a true delight.

564
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,095
A true delight.
We became friends at that point.

565
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,222
I hadn't told my parents that
I was doing this.

566
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:19,369
I told them I had, was doing commercials
and low-budget nothing, and,

567
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:24,207
well, that I,
I knew that they weren't gonna be.

568
00:33:24,325 --> 00:33:27,326
I didn't suspect they would be very
approving of this kinda stuff.

569
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:32,590
I made the original call prepared to
become the black sheep of the family.

570
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:37,107
It didn't happen.
I'm sure they were less than thrilled.

571
00:33:37,903 --> 00:33:41,541
When my mother would be at the grocery
store the next day and they say

572
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:43,648
"Good to see you, how you doing?

573
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:47,309
What's going on? " " Well! My son
the doctor's coming back from Israel,

574
00:33:47,311 --> 00:33:51,106
and my other son,
he makes shmackle movies in California!"

575
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,112
Well I think people may have a negative
reaction to someone who's a porn star

576
00:33:58,114 --> 00:34:01,391
for a combination of reasons.

577
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:06,388
One is, somebody who seems to indiscriminately
be willing to sleep with anyone,

578
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,389
whether it's on film or not,
is, no matter what people say,

579
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:15,043
still not somebody who's
particularly admired and,

580
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:19,277
again may pose a threat
to many relationships.

581
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:22,776
It is legal work, but it's fucking.

582
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:25,707
With pictures.

583
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:28,377
People say
"you should, should go into politics"

584
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,406
There's too many pictures
with dicks in my ass,

585
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:32,276
it's like, it's not going to happen.

586
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,675
It happened by happenstance.

587
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:38,342
I came up with some friends
and I went to a club

588
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:43,247
called The Rainbow, and,
I met there Althea Flint,

589
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:46,968
the wife of Larry Flint,
and a photographer that

590
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,781
she had in tow, and they approached me
and invited me

591
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:54,481
to their table, and asked me
if I wanted to go to a club

592
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,796
and have some drinks and I did.

593
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,123
And she was, doing an interview for Sting,

594
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,227
and we were up there looking
to meet some rockstars,

595
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:05,326
you know, we were just girls.
Doing our thing.

596
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:09,067
And she took us in her limo,
she had this black limo that

597
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:11,472
had this Think Pink
on the license plate and this,

598
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:13,743
I think it was a naked lady
on the side of it.

599
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,777
And I was so impressed by that.

600
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:19,309
She said what do you do and I said
I'm a model and she said -Wow!

601
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:23,508
I sh... you know, I, I own Hustler Magazine
and we're gonna put you in Hustler.

602
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:25,164
So, that was that!

603
00:35:25,554 --> 00:35:29,676
Um, I went into Hustler and um,
started doing magazines.

604
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:34,079
My brother found out and, he had tried
to talk me into it many times,

605
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:36,365
because everybody always said Hey Buck!

606
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,472
Can you get your sister to do a movie
oh my god!

607
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:42,085
And, um, you know,
we never worked together,

608
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:46,387
on set, but, we always
championed each other's careers.

609
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:50,619
And so my brother said to me,
um, I want you to do a movie.

610
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:52,672
And he set it up with Sin City,

611
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:56,146
it was actually done for Sin City
and it was called Babewatch,

612
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,637
and it was for my brother's
Babewatch series, cause he said

613
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:02,810
if you're gonna do movies for anybody, you
have to do, you have to do one for me, sis,

614
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:04,871
so I said okay I will.

615
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:07,195
And the sex was real, you know,

616
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:12,253
you'd say, how do you want the blow-job?
And he'd say, how do you like the blowjob?

617
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:15,834
And that would be it, you know and
that, we would build off of that.

618
00:36:15,836 --> 00:36:19,237
You know, I was the kinda person,
it, I lived a life of excess,

619
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:23,855
and people would invite me to
parties, and they would think Wow!

620
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:29,304
If I offer her some party tools, then,
I'm gonna have my night set up,

621
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:32,458
I'm gonna wind up getting laid all
night by this beautiful porn star.

622
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,494
And then as my addiction
went through another door,

623
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,476
they'd hand me the bag of coke and I'd
wind up in the bathroom all night

624
00:36:39,478 --> 00:36:42,144
you know, and you wouldn't be able
to drag me out of the bathroom

625
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,762
and I'd be like don't touch me!
And oh!

626
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:49,885
And all of my life
started to kind of spiral.

627
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:53,416
I wound up getting arrested, um,
on the highway,

628
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:58,486
and the police knew exactly
who I was, when I got arrested,

629
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:02,431
and, they wanted to make an
example of me with the court system.

630
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:07,727
They knew that I was, you know, a big
porn star, and um, the gig was up.

631
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,516
And I had to face it.

632
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,796
And it was the greatest thing that ever
happened to me when I look back on it now,

633
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:15,895
because it really brought me into reality.

634
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:20,360
For the women,
they're much more damned by society

635
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,780
because no matter how
sanctified they are,

636
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:26,857
they're still considered to be whores, and
it's getting worse and worse and worse

637
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:31,079
because a lot of them have turned to,
what I am vehemently opposed to,

638
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:33,791
the escort services,
to further their career.

639
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:38,103
In many ways,
it has a dehumanizing quality,

640
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:44,647
because what you're responding
to are a set of, physical cues.

641
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:47,565
You are responding to the body,

642
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,771
and you're responding
to the sexual acts per say

643
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:53,879
in a way that is quite animalistic.

644
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:59,804
And, having a more full depiction
of the person

645
00:37:59,806 --> 00:38:05,851
may even detract from the
ability to use it purely

646
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:09,417
as masturbatory or other
kind of sexual stimulation.

647
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:14,062
You can take every other category,
every other idea, every other thought.

648
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:17,536
Basically happiness and success in life
all boils down

649
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:20,054
to what are the quality of your bonds
with other people.

650
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:23,410
Having anything to do with the a
dult industry hacks away those bonds,

651
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:27,749
so you're isolated, alienated,
um, pushed away to the margins,

652
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:29,672
and not treated as a human being.

653
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:33,104
That's a recipe for disaster,
for me and for anyone else.

654
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:37,144
Um, when I was in college a couple of us
on the dance team worked at Hooters

655
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,635
so I was working at Hooters,
I love doing that,

656
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:43,161
a lot of the girls at Hooters were telling me
how I would make a lot of money stripping

657
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,082
and then I had a boyfriend in college
who brought me,

658
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:48,365
I went with him and his friends
to a strip club one night

659
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,417
because they always used to go
watch amateur night.

660
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,417


661
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:53,137
He's like I think you could win,
I think you could beat these girls

662
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:56,367
at amateur night. So I entered and I won,
I got first place out of twelve girls

663
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:56,627


664
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:58,929
in the amateur contest,
and I got $500.

665
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,929


666
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:03,406
So I was like this is a really cool job I
get to drink, and dance and make money.

667
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:05,726
This is way better than
anything else I can imagine.

668
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,986
When I was twenty-one I used to watch
a lot of those cinemaX movies

669
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,986


670
00:39:08,988 --> 00:39:12,847
and so I went to uh, Blockbuster
and I got the address off the box

671
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:16,207
of a cinemaX movie and I mailed
some Polaroids of myself

672
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:20,026
and a a few headshots I had taken, um,
like, and just pictures and I mailed it

673
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:23,199
and I wrote this letter about how I think
I'd really like to be in the movies.

674
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,107
And I heard nothing
and then three months later

675
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:26,626
I actually got a call from Playboy.

676
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:29,380
Coming to this industry I pretty much
came into it thinking okay

677
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:29,380


678
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:33,455
I'm going to somehow be one of the
most well-known pornstars of all time.

679
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,889
I wouldn't wanna come into it and just be
another girl that was around for two years

680
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:41,089
and then have to go be a hooker. You know.
After I did the Hus-the Playboy thing,

681
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:43,972
um, I shot for Hustler,
the next month I came out to LA,

682
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:46,524
um, within three weeks after
shooting for Hustler,

683
00:39:46,526 --> 00:39:49,584
um, his wife and his dau-uh his sister,

684
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:51,579
or, his daughter,
told me how much they loved me

685
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:53,998
and they ended up taking me
on the Larry Flint Freedom Tour.

686
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:56,291
They chose four girls to go
with Larry Flint

687
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:59,293
to like different Hustler stores
on the freedom tour and they chose me

688
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:02,262
and then Hustler had me, my very
first day being on the show um,

689
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:04,047
a Hustler chose me to sign at their booth,

690
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:06,249
cause they don't have contract
girls they pick girls.

691
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:08,308
And then a month later there was
a Magic Convention

692
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,909
which is a clothing convention
and Hustler was launching

693
00:40:10,923 --> 00:40:14,275
their clothing and Hustler had chosen me
to be the model of their clothing

694
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:16,408
and they made, you know,
pictures of me modeling it.

695
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,348
So I really didn't think about
life after porn

696
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:21,734
because I just couldn't believe how
like, all these things kept happening.

697
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,641


698
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:23,979
I mean just the things that
happened to me as a new girl

699
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:27,193
in porn don't happen to most new
girls I mean, I met Larry Flint um,

700
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:29,606
pretty much my
second month in the business.

701
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,628
So I didn't think about life after.
I just said... I just always said

702
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,344
I'm gonna get married and have kids.
I used to say by twenty-seven.

703
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:38,507
Now I say I wanna get married by
thirty and have kids by thirty-two.

704
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:40,581
While I was married
I only did girl-girl.

705
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,424
I left my husband and did boy-girl.

706
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:42,424


707
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:46,675
Um, when I got back with my husband
at kickass I only did girl-girl again,

708
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,951
we split up,
I did boy-girl, heh!

709
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,660
Then I took like a hiatus for
about six-seven months

710
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:54,127
and didn't shoot anything. And
that's when I met this guy,

711
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:56,904
um, who's my, ended up becoming
my fiance, but we were dating,

712
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,109
and I didn't do boy-girl when I was
with him for the first six months,

713
00:41:00,111 --> 00:41:03,270
and then he was like, don't you think
you should go get a new porn contract

714
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:05,771
because that's extra income
we can have every month.

715
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:08,266
And I was like well, you want
me to have sex with other guys?

716
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,442
And he was like well,
it's only six times a year

717
00:41:10,444 --> 00:41:12,844
you're gonna do it, and it's with
a condom. I was like okay.

718
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:14,736
Then of course, like,
two days before the movie

719
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,109
my ex was like, I don't want you
having sex with other guys.

720
00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:18,954
Arrrrg! Arr!
- Let go of me!

721
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:19,054


722
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,828
Your derri`ere may be pretty,
but that don't mean

723
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,643
it's bull-worked from
a promiscuous lashing.

724
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:31,453
Every two-and-a-half months
I'd have to shoot a boy-girl scene

725
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:34,715
and er-usually about two days before
he would start being really mean to me,

726
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:36,124
and calling me names,

727
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,485
even though he was the one
who wanted me to do the movies.

728
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:40,334
Then, on the day when I'd go
to shoot the movie

729
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:42,423
he'd go out with his friends
and get really drunk,

730
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:44,746
then he usually would not kiss me
or anything for two days later

731
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,900
and then when my check would
come in he's like that's my check,

732
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:48,633
since I let you have
sex with other people.

733
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:49,133


734
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:49,928
And then when I would be asleep sometimes,

735
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,257
I'd be asleep and I'd hear
him watching my movies.

736
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,257


737
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,372
He'd go and put it in like slow motion

738
00:41:54,374 --> 00:41:56,938
and make sure the guy wore a condom
and I wasn't lying about it.

739
00:41:56,942 --> 00:41:58,457
Um, let's see.

740
00:41:58,459 --> 00:42:01,541
The most I ever made in a month was
probably when I was running for governor

741
00:42:01,543 --> 00:42:04,228
because my website was making
around twenty-thousand a month

742
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,419
and then my online store
selling t-shirts and buttons

743
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:08,690
made about ten-fifteen thousand a month,

744
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:11,424
and, I felt really bad cause I didn't
have time to mail'em all out

745
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,507
so I just ended up not
mailing people their orders.

746
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:14,872
I feel really bad about that.

747
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:17,367
Um, and then my contract was
six thousand a month

748
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:17,467


749
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:20,577
and I was feature dancing, at that time
feature dancing used to pay a lot more.

750
00:42:20,757 --> 00:42:23,159
That was like, six thousand for like,
three weeks.

751
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:25,887
I dunno how much that is, maybe
like 50, 60 thousand in a month.

752
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:27,133
That's probably the most.

753
00:42:27,135 --> 00:42:29,149
And then I won a game show
around that same time.

754
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:31,494
I won a game show Who Wants to be
Governor of California?

755
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,978
I won another twenty-one thousand.
Um, that was great.

756
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:37,414
Um, I guess the most in the year would
probably be around 300 thousand.

757
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:39,420
I mean I don't think I thought
I was set for life

758
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:41,363
I always used to joke
with everyone that um,

759
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:41,763


760
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,557
I'm either going to,
just make a lot of money

761
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,557


762
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:47,393
or I might worst case scenario
I'll marry a rich person.

763
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:49,059
That's what I always said.

764
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:55,433
No one comes into this business to
wanna be normal on the back end of it.

765
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:57,387
Nobody thinks that it's gonna end.

766
00:42:57,389 --> 00:43:00,171
You jump on a merry-go-round
you hope the ride never ends.

767
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:02,687
I don't think many of them can spell
the word future.

768
00:43:02,689 --> 00:43:05,882
I don't think they did this as a short
term investment in their own future,

769
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,459
but they burned out.

770
00:43:07,722 --> 00:43:08,862
Hookers are hookers.

771
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:12,091
I mean hookers are people
who are looking for a quick buck

772
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,949
with the least amount of effort
so they turn tricks.

773
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:18,473
And, uh, being a porn star is just like,

774
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:21,073
uh, you know the,
the world's oldest profession

775
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:25,515
so, it's, it's not that complicated,

776
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,422
uh, reality is hard.

777
00:43:28,424 --> 00:43:31,297
A lot of people blame,
blame the industry for their problems

778
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:34,263
but, uh, then they get out
in the real world and find,

779
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,783
lots of problems in the real world too.

780
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,450
I grew up in Pensilvania, um,

781
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,033
in the steel-mill towns.

782
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:46,089
Worked in the steel-mills, I drove cabs,

783
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,602
it was sorta typical things, uh, people do.

784
00:43:48,604 --> 00:43:51,049
There I did some
illustrations for magazines,

785
00:43:51,404 --> 00:43:55,550
in New York and eventually,
started playing uh, music.

786
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,717


787
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,338
Did that for a while.

788
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:01,831
And then I came out to California and
end up getting into dirty movies.

789
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:04,196
Just met some people.

790
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:06,822
Actually I was gonna do a uh,
a photo spread,

791
00:44:06,868 --> 00:44:09,792
I was gonna do some photography of
some girls who were in the business.

792
00:44:09,841 --> 00:44:12,936
I had an idea I would do a photo shoot
of them and then a little interview.

793
00:44:13,604 --> 00:44:17,418
And, some people I knew from
illustrating magazines in New York said

794
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:20,668
yeah, we'll see what you come up with,
if it's good we'll pay you and everything

795
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,097
so I met the... these two girls,
and, before I knew it, uh,

796
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,390
I was, in the movies!

797
00:44:27,607 --> 00:44:29,623
So that's sorta how that started.

798
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,633
But you know when I was working it was,
it wasn't like it is today, it was,

799
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:37,915
I'd maybe work forty days a year and
maybe 15 to 20 days were sex days.

800
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:41,389
And today they work every day of the week.
Maybe twice a day.

801
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:44,875
You know, viagra shootin' up their cocks
and stuff like that

802
00:44:44,877 --> 00:44:48,499
I mean it's just they're
ruining their sex life

803
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:50,649
for the rest of their lives,
I'm telling ya!

804
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:52,802
I just think there's too much going on,

805
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:55,079
I mean just your personal appetite of it.

806
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:57,758
I mean, if you're working as a performer

807
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,843
and you're working that much I mean,
sex loses it's mystery in it's sense

808
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:05,413
and it's, I mean I remember being turned on
to a point some times, certain situations

809
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,442
where I would actually shake.

810
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:09,742
I mean I'm sure everybody's
been in that situation

811
00:45:09,744 --> 00:45:12,327
and now that, I hate to see that go away.

812
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,757
I remember one time my dad
picked me up from the airport,

813
00:45:15,775 --> 00:45:19,086
and I was coming in for the holidays
and he's, and he-

814
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:21,740
I had, my pictures
were in Hustler magazine eh,

815
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:25,737
they were on, about a movie
and, and I think I was

816
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:28,500
I was giving some girl head!

817
00:45:29,577 --> 00:45:33,554
And my father says,
"I saw that picture in Hustler."

818
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:39,134
I said uh, yeah, picture, that,
wasn't so good of a picture.

819
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:44,395
And that's all was said!
They never wa... It was not something

820
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:48,642
I wanted to expose them to because it wa...
you know it it, it's embarrassing for them.

821
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:52,031
We were so proud of what we did in
some of these movies we did that were...

822
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:54,755
that were, that got really big play,

823
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:56,928
that I actually took her to screenings.

824
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,923
We had these screenings in these theaters.

825
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:02,534
And I'm taking my wife there watching
me have sex with these people

826
00:46:02,983 --> 00:46:09,418
And, she was, it was difficult
for her but, she appreciated

827
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,448
the work we were doing,
but after one or two times

828
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:16,440
it was like... or we did that, I
said hey we don't do this no more!

829
00:46:16,453 --> 00:46:18,965
She didn't wanna see any
pictures of me or anything.

830
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:21,058
Although she understood what
I was doing and knew

831
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,471
it was the thing that was not gonna be,
a situation.

832
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:29,366
Can I ask you something? Those cops,
they're hung pretty good, huh?

833
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:32,611
Bet they ain't got what I got.

834
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:38,501
Nobody's got what I got.

835
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,593
So, yeah, I'd like to retire and paint.

836
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:46,793
If I had a game plan. I saved some
money but I wasn't that good.

837
00:46:46,795 --> 00:46:49,553
No... I didn't make
that much money though.

838
00:46:49,555 --> 00:46:51,833
Come on, what'd I make? I mean
I, didn't work that much.

839
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:54,635
You talking about when you were acting?
Save money when he was acting?!

840
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,774
He just didn't have any bills.
I didn't have any bills. See I told you

841
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:00,826
I didn't have any bills...
And then he got me! Ha ha...

842
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:03,752
Then she showed up!
- I'm a high maintenance, baby.

843
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,315
Then she showed up...

844
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,142
Even if it's not particularly
glamorous that day,

845
00:47:09,968 --> 00:47:13,006
you go to work and you get fussed over,

846
00:47:13,008 --> 00:47:16,508
and if it's a big enough production
there's a makeup artist there,

847
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,125
and there's, and there's attention,

848
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,111
for people who like attention, um,

849
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:26,383
and then they get paid! The
very same day! Woohoo!

850
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,653
Now, my great friend Lee Carol once said

851
00:47:29,655 --> 00:47:31,655
as long as you got a cunt,
you'll never starve.

852
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,958
But, as a danger to that,
because, it wears on your mind.

853
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,505
My parents didn't take,
really an interest in my life

854
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:43,167
and I was also sexually abused
at nine-years-old.

855
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:47,790
I had a teenaged boy and his sister
who was my classmate

856
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:50,963
introduce me to sexuality and uh,

857
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:53,773
for the first time in my life
and it horrified me.

858
00:47:54,046 --> 00:47:56,428
Yeah, as soon as I barely graduated
high school,

859
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,250
which, I had to cheat my way through,

860
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:00,739
my dad ended up coming to me
and saying listen,

861
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:03,344
you're outta the house, and literally
kicked me out on the street

862
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:04,860
with no food, no money.

863
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:06,816
And so I'm literally sitting out
on the curb,

864
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:11,530
on Sherman Way, that big tough rebellious
teenager was balling her eyes out.

865
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:15,086
And all of a sudden, this um,
beautiful black man

866
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:19,111
came over to me and says, are you alright?

867
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:22,055
What's wrong,
why are you crying sweetheart?

868
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,867
"I have no money and I have no
food and my dad kicked me out."

869
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:29,624
He put his arm around me and I-
I still to this day

870
00:48:29,626 --> 00:48:32,685
can tell you what that embrace felt like,

871
00:48:32,758 --> 00:48:34,977
and he just said baby I can help you

872
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,334
and I thought Jesus has come to rescue me.

873
00:48:38,897 --> 00:48:41,271
You know I really thought
he was gonna help me.

874
00:48:42,243 --> 00:48:44,887
And he said there's a man
in the apartment complex

875
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:47,285
who would love to make love to you.

876
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:50,498
He lured me in. I went...
You mean have sex?!

877
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,989
He goes yes, but he's really gentle,
really nice, and you'll get $35.

878
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,518
So, here I am a single mother,

879
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,446
I've done prostitution and stripping,
now for six years I've had, uh,

880
00:49:02,494 --> 00:49:07,021
I've been at gunpoint,
I've had stalkers try and kill me,

881
00:49:07,092 --> 00:49:11,652
cops try and bust me, I mean I've been
in the mafia basically for six years.

882
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:16,486
So, someone came to me says,
girl, why don't you do porn?

883
00:49:16,948 --> 00:49:19,567
I said porn? What's that?

884
00:49:19,569 --> 00:49:23,932
It was a lot worse than prostitution,
like, there's a whole crew around,

885
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:26,393
they're all stroking themselves going...

886
00:49:26,395 --> 00:49:29,385
It was just totally degrading
and I went oh my gosh

887
00:49:29,387 --> 00:49:31,272
this is bad, this is really bad.

888
00:49:31,558 --> 00:49:33,320
And then all of a sudden like,

889
00:49:33,322 --> 00:49:37,576
I can't explain it but all the rage
I ever felt from,

890
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:40,842
what my parents did,
from childhood, from like,

891
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:44,359
all the things that men abused me
with in prostitution

892
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:47,091
I just like, let it out, on the screen.

893
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:52,126
He just said roll it and it's like here
I am the newbie

894
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:54,714
but I like, took over the entire scene,
it was weird.

895
00:49:54,716 --> 00:50:00,489
I just went-Rrrraw! I'm Roxy!
The porn star! Like I was pissed!

896
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:04,696
But at the end of the scene it just ended
and I had um,

897
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:09,379
bodily fluids on my face,
and they just kinda went

898
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:13,611
here's a rag and they just threw it and
me and I just grabbed the rag and went.

899
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:15,386
And I didn't want them to see me cry,

900
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,442
so I just kinda turned my face
and I was like,

901
00:50:17,444 --> 00:50:21,168
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, don't cry,
Shelley, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

902
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:25,030
Then now all of a sudden
I'm involved doing like anal, um,

903
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:29,547
gang-bangs with five or six different
performers and I'm thinking oh my god.

904
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:32,478
Now I'm bringing big jugs of vodka!

905
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,235
And everyone's egging you on telling you

906
00:50:34,237 --> 00:50:37,576
no, girl we love you, we're your
family now, you're awesome,

907
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,471
and then, and there is a family
atmosphere that they offer.

908
00:50:40,473 --> 00:50:44,194
Porn star karaoke, everybody hangs
out at the same parties, wooooo!

909
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:47,243
Girl, I love you!
Everyone's very affectionate,

910
00:50:47,259 --> 00:50:50,570
and the reason why they're so affectionate
is because that's their family.

911
00:50:51,205 --> 00:50:53,797
Um, they're out, especially in my day,
we're outcasts.

912
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,686
In fact I still have scars from
suicide attempts.

913
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,572
And I...

914
00:50:58,574 --> 00:51:00,719
I said I don't care,
I don't wanna live anymore.

915
00:51:00,848 --> 00:51:03,812
And I took like thirty prescription pills,
and uh,

916
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:07,662
I didn't die, but I knew I wanted out, bad,

917
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:12,008
and I remember crying to God,
drunk off my ass on Jack Daniels,

918
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,322
thinking if you get me outta this
I'll serve you with my whole life

919
00:51:15,324 --> 00:51:18,282
I swear to god I'll do whatever you want!
Just get me outta this.

920
00:51:19,403 --> 00:51:21,012
I mean, people who are well adjusted

921
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:23,809
and have good life skills
and who are doing something

922
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:26,129
meaningful and constructive
with their lives,

923
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:28,793
they're not
in the industry to begin with so,

924
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:32,615
the people who are in the industry
are really broken twisted souls

925
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:37,442
without a lot of great job skills and
uh, you know they're turbulent souls.

926
00:51:37,447 --> 00:51:41,079
So, they're always gonna be
twisting and turning in the wind.

927
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,056
We'd spent a lot of time in church.

928
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:47,858
I actually convinced my mom to send me to
Christian School when I was 14,

929
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,070
she found a way to gather up the funds,

930
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:56,909
and I went and I was very involved
in my church, without her.

931
00:51:57,193 --> 00:51:59,845
You know, it was just, it was me
and my friends and that was how

932
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:05,377
I grew up and you know, that all
changed when I was sixteen.

933
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:11,101
I spent the night at a girlfriend's house,
and she, was a teenaged mom, and married,

934
00:52:11,103 --> 00:52:15,682
and her husband, drugged me. With acid.

935
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:19,623
And I... At that time I had,
I hadn't even stayed up past ten.

936
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:22,996
So, uh, I didn't, I wasn't really
well versed in the drug world.

937
00:52:23,344 --> 00:52:25,999
And that changed everything for me.

938
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,474
I did the best I could to
graduate high school

939
00:52:28,476 --> 00:52:30,566
as fast as I could and, and move out.

940
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:32,277
I was outta the house by seventeen.

941
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:34,296
I knew some people in the adult industry

942
00:52:34,298 --> 00:52:36,893
and I hung out with them and
I'm still friends with them now,

943
00:52:36,895 --> 00:52:38,825
I don't blame them for hanging out with me

944
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:40,981
when I was young cause
they were young too, so...

945
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:46,921
Met a few porn stars, and,
just... Fell in love with them.

946
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:51,949
I hung out with them until I was
over eighteen, did my first movie,

947
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:55,796
and, you know, it
was on from there.

948
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,533
Well, the first year that I was
in the adult industry,

949
00:52:58,535 --> 00:53:02,536
and was doing movies I worked for
every company under the sun.

950
00:53:02,538 --> 00:53:05,385
You know the dirtiest of the
dirtiest kinds of companies,

951
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:07,252
that do crazy stuff.

952
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:12,104
I worked for anybody, I could,
to make a buck.

953
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,638
I told my mom and she flipped out.

954
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,444
She wasn't happy about it but eventually
when I, you know, formed a career,

955
00:53:20,647 --> 00:53:23,812
and I signed with Vivid, and
the pictures were prettier,

956
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:28,207
and the footage was less disgusting,
ha ha ha ha!

957
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:32,637
Um, she came to terms and you know,

958
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:35,202
what's she gonna do?
It is what it is.

959
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,961
Being a Vivid girl is, you know,

960
00:53:38,963 --> 00:53:43,013
it's what every adult industry actress
wants to be.

961
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:48,140
You know Vivid's the biggest best and
most well-known company in the world.

962
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:51,681
They have the most beautiful girls,
they have the best photographers.

963
00:53:51,683 --> 00:53:53,703
Um, they have the best press.

964
00:53:54,145 --> 00:53:59,618
And,..., it's yeah, it's,
it's a high class slew of girls.

965
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,124
I would think... I mean, of course you know,
it's as high class as it's gonna get.

966
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:08,249
Um, it's a steady income,
so I don't know if

967
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:11,046
I necessarily thought I was better
than anybody else,

968
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,739
but I knew I was getting
the press that I wanted,

969
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:17,635
so, I was happy. You know.

970
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:21,623
I took my movies very seriously.
I studied my scripts.

971
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:25,462
Half the time I wasn't stoned,
when I did the dialogue

972
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:29,070
but I took my acting very seriously
because it was the only time

973
00:54:29,072 --> 00:54:31,120
I was ever gonna get to do any acting.

974
00:54:31,122 --> 00:54:35,003
So, I took it seriously!
And I loved it!

975
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:39,404
And um, I thought I was good at it but,
you know...

976
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:42,716
It just sounds so cliche for me to say

977
00:54:42,718 --> 00:54:45,550
I took the acting
in my porno movie seriously.

978
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:46,965
But, but I did.

979
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:49,943
And that was my favorite part,
was the acting.

980
00:54:51,775 --> 00:54:53,767
And sometimes the sex.

981
00:54:57,512 --> 00:54:59,777
You can use drugs and party and drink,

982
00:54:59,779 --> 00:55:02,905
no matter what career choice you have, but,

983
00:55:03,777 --> 00:55:08,778
, yes, you're opened up
to the party lifestyle a lot more.

984
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:10,521
I mean, you hang out with rockstars, you,

985
00:55:10,523 --> 00:55:14,204
you know there's always
porn parties to go to, um...

986
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:22,131
Me, struggling as an addict, of course
took advantage of everything that was there

987
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:27,198
you know, all of the alcohol,
all of... all of the drugs, I did 'em all!

988
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,240
Um... It's not a safe business to
be in if you wanna stay clean.

989
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,241
It's not safe.

990
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:41,677
Um, and I'm not telling you this to
make you feel sorry for me or anything

991
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,810
but I had an extremely tough childhood,

992
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:46,570
and um, I think I got very lost
for many years.

993
00:55:46,608 --> 00:55:50,103
Um, I didn't know who I was,
like many people.

994
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:55,301
Um, I had a very warped understanding
of what love was.

995
00:55:56,137 --> 00:56:01,091
And um, I think because of
a lack of love in my life or a,

996
00:56:01,093 --> 00:56:03,848
an inability to determine
what love really is

997
00:56:04,288 --> 00:56:08,187
I saw sexual attention, as love.

998
00:56:08,189 --> 00:56:10,806
And when you've suffered a lot of
sexual abuse in your life

999
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:13,387
it's understandable I think
why you would feel that way.

1000
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:18,630
Trying to tell you... at what
point I made the decision

1001
00:56:18,632 --> 00:56:21,661
to be Tiffany Million is not something
I could answer really

1002
00:56:21,663 --> 00:56:25,334
in just one neat sentence.
It's kind of a combination of things.

1003
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:31,015
Essentially the whole reason that
I even got into that business

1004
00:56:31,136 --> 00:56:35,467
to begin with was because I was a single
mother, like many people, and um,

1005
00:56:35,469 --> 00:56:40,964
I was living in Southern California,
I had no family,

1006
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,391
I didn't know that many people, her
father wasn't helping me with her,

1007
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,125
and it was pretty scary being
a single parent honestly,

1008
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:50,173
and so, I mean I figured,
you know I had a choice:

1009
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,408
I could work eight hours a day,

1010
00:56:52,696 --> 00:56:55,649
and commute an hour or two
each way on the freeway,

1011
00:56:55,854 --> 00:57:00,726
to make, seven eight dollars an hour,
only to pay out half of that in taxes,

1012
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:05,288
and child care, and my daughter's with you
know heaven knows who during the day,

1013
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:09,040
or I could re-enter the
adult entertainment industry

1014
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,717
'cause I'd been a stripper years before.

1015
00:57:10,773 --> 00:57:14,228
And then I thought, cause I'd always
been kind of a fan of adult films,

1016
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,758
and I'd so many times I had looked at
those movies and uh, I'd thought

1017
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:21,500
man, you know what
I could do that and I could do it better.

1018
00:57:21,536 --> 00:57:24,083
You know. And so I thought
well heck, why not?

1019
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:25,973
I mean I didn't have
a man in my life anymore,

1020
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,637
I left her father, and uh,
I definitely needed the money,

1021
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:31,141
but really it just afforded me a way to,

1022
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:35,021
work as little as possible
to get as much money as I could

1023
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:37,280
to be with my daughter cause
that's all I really wanted

1024
00:57:37,445 --> 00:57:39,515
I wanted my daughter to have a great life,

1025
00:57:39,517 --> 00:57:41,921
and a safe home, in a good neighborhood,

1026
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:45,200
with good childcare, and I wanted to
spend as much time with her as I could.

1027
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:49,388
And working in the adult film industry
allowed me to work a day or two a week

1028
00:57:49,704 --> 00:57:52,672
and be with my daughter the rest
of the week and make more money

1029
00:57:52,674 --> 00:57:55,868
than people than worked, you know,
five days a week, eight hours a day.

1030
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,303
What you do in porn films is not sex.

1031
00:57:58,373 --> 00:58:01,254
I mean I know you're being penetrated,
but it's like this, you know.

1032
00:58:01,256 --> 00:58:03,250
It's like this. I mean
that's what it feels like.

1033
00:58:03,252 --> 00:58:07,767
It's just something occupying um,
a chasm in your body.

1034
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:10,048
Really... It's like this.

1035
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,234
It's like this that's
what it might as well be.

1036
00:58:12,236 --> 00:58:16,214
Uh, there uh, there's no emotion there,
there's no feeling, um, you know,

1037
00:58:16,216 --> 00:58:18,677
you know, I gotta tell you
this funny little story!

1038
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:21,866
I would have so many fans come up
to me at autograph signings

1039
00:58:21,868 --> 00:58:24,288
whatever and tell me that I
was their favorite porn star,

1040
00:58:24,378 --> 00:58:27,869
because all the other girls were faking
it and I was the one that they knew,

1041
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,056
man, that I was for real.

1042
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:34,143
And uh, and I can tell when a
woman's faking it and I'd be laughing!

1043
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:36,541
Watch my face. Watch my face.

1044
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,023
'Cause I'd be like...

1045
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:45,923
I'm the biggest damn faker you ever met!

1046
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:48,548
I mean I'm good, that's why
I get paid the big bucks.

1047
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,310
Even when I was in the business,

1048
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:54,244
I didn't partake of all of the
extraneous activities.

1049
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,587
Um, I think I went to several parties only
because there was free food and boozes,

1050
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,203
and I would go and I would eat and stuff

1051
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,028
and then everybody would go
to the after-parties and I'd be like nah,

1052
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,460
I'm going home and going to bed.

1053
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,372
I've always been early to bed,
early to rise.

1054
00:59:05,374 --> 00:59:07,498
I never wanted to be a part of
that scene and um,

1055
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,178
even when I was working in the movies I
always kinda felt like a fly on the wall.

1056
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,635
Like I know my body was involved,
because, obviously, I was there.

1057
00:59:14,655 --> 00:59:18,017
But I always had this strange feeling
this real feeling of disconnect.

1058
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:19,821
Like I was up here looking down.

1059
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:23,791
When my father died in 94, uh like I
said he left me a whole bunch of money,

1060
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,444
and I suddenly realized that I'm free.

1061
00:59:26,659 --> 00:59:30,003
I don't have to be her anymore. And
I walked away. And that was it.

1062
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:33,426
No one puts a gun to anybody's head
to do this.

1063
00:59:33,428 --> 00:59:35,432
If you're not warned about
what's gonna happen

1064
00:59:35,434 --> 00:59:37,978
then the person who didn't warn you
is the person who's guilty

1065
00:59:38,026 --> 00:59:41,774
in that respect, but they're doing it
for the one thing that they cannot deny.

1066
00:59:41,776 --> 00:59:46,363
That absolute death-wish, for the
recognition, validation, and credibility.

1067
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:48,800
And they're welcome to it, but eventually

1068
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:50,684
their past will catch up to them

1069
00:59:50,905 --> 00:59:54,803
and they have to be aware of the fact
that X is forever.

1070
00:59:55,563 --> 01:00:00,508
When I got into the business, um,
I, did have a goal.

1071
01:00:01,052 --> 01:00:03,086
It was my "cracked out" goal.

1072
01:00:03,088 --> 01:00:06,188
But I did have a goal to, be out,

1073
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:10,741
and retired, twenty-six,
at the latest twenty-seven.

1074
01:00:13,315 --> 01:00:15,465
And I was out, by twenty-four.

1075
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:21,914
I didn't leave the business because uh,
I wanted to.

1076
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:24,687
I left the business cause I felt I HAD to.

1077
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:26,663
That it was the right thing to do.

1078
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:32,244
On November fourth, 1984,
was the first headline,

1079
01:00:32,246 --> 01:00:34,385
in the San Francisco Chronicle,

1080
01:00:34,387 --> 01:00:38,223
regarding the heterosexua
transmission of AIDS.

1081
01:00:38,225 --> 01:00:41,140
A good friend of mine,
who was a mathematician

1082
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:43,101
had read the same article I did

1083
01:00:43,103 --> 01:00:45,478
and he came over to my house
in the afternoon and he said

1084
01:00:45,489 --> 01:00:48,674
"I've done some calculations
based on the numbers,

1085
01:00:48,676 --> 01:00:50,400
reported here in the story.

1086
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:53,378
And you're in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1087
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,877
I want you to stop."

1088
01:00:54,879 --> 01:00:58,139
I had three jobs lined up for December,
my wife said I don't want you to do them.

1089
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,346
And my thinking was look,
they're just trying to sell newspapers,

1090
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,791
that's what newspapers do, they scare
you, and so I don't think the danger is

1091
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:08,608
that real, and I'm gonna go ahead
and do these jobs.

1092
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,695
So I went off and I did the three jobs.

1093
01:01:10,697 --> 01:01:15,481
And when I came home, and we're about to
go to bed, that night, she said to me

1094
01:01:15,483 --> 01:01:17,171
"Do you think we should?"

1095
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:20,408
Should? Should what? Have sex?

1096
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:23,616
"Yeah, do you think we should have sex?"

1097
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:26,128
And I said, what are you talking about?

1098
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:29,651
And she said, and I can quote you verbatim,
I remembered this all this time.

1099
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:32,767
She said "Don't you think
it would be prudent,

1100
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:37,654
if one of us remained alive,
to raise the kids?"

1101
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,717
Pchew!

1102
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:43,982
That was the brick wall.

1103
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,720
Somebody had offered m
e a DVD deal, and I...

1104
01:01:47,722 --> 01:01:50,729
I knew CD-ROMS didn't do good, I
knew the laser disks didn't do good,

1105
01:01:50,731 --> 01:01:54,408
and I thought, uh, this DVD thing,
whatever it is, won't replace video,

1106
01:01:54,452 --> 01:01:57,648
so I signed it without having a
lawyer look at it or anything,

1107
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:01,893
and by the time DVDs
started taking over from videos,

1108
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,516
I looked at the contract and found out
now they have my DVD rights,

1109
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:10,150
also had internet rights, and
the company wasn't very good.

1110
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:14,012
And once I realized I wasn't gonna make
much money

1111
01:02:14,014 --> 01:02:16,684
I stayed with Evil Angel my distributor,

1112
01:02:16,686 --> 01:02:19,796
for as long as I could, then when they
stopped doing videos that was it.

1113
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:22,477
The ones that do well, are out
because they wanna be out,

1114
01:02:22,479 --> 01:02:24,188
not because they had to get out.

1115
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:27,532
And, they have made their peace
with what they did,

1116
01:02:27,534 --> 01:02:32,325
and that shows in their bearing, and
the way that they are, in the world.

1117
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:35,754
The money that I did save up
went really quick.

1118
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:40,139
Um, and then I was just, scraping by.

1119
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:44,925
And it was, um, it was
the Christian community that

1120
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,696
really came alongside me and helped me out.

1121
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:50,877
There would be times when I was, didn't
know how I was gonna pay my rent,

1122
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:54,806
and, somebody, it was just people
I don't even know,

1123
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:58,226
just people who've read my story,
who wanted to help.

1124
01:02:58,531 --> 01:03:02,046
When I left the business
I sold my house in Los Angeles,

1125
01:03:03,911 --> 01:03:10,456
um, I first-I retired, and then, um,
I decided, I need to get out of L.A.

1126
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:12,754
I needed to get out of L.A.

1127
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:18,150
I mean, everywhere I went,
McDonalds drive-thru,

1128
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:21,681
um, nightclubs,
the movie theatre, the park,

1129
01:03:21,683 --> 01:03:25,168
Universal Studios, I mean, you name it,

1130
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,773
I could not, go anywhere.

1131
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,433
I..., I don't know how these
big celebrities deal with it all.

1132
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:32,835
I mean they must ha... They have
to have bodyguards of course

1133
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:37,986
and stuff like that cause I did not have
bodyguards and I could not handle it.

1134
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:41,024
It's impossible to lead a normal life
after you get out of it.

1135
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,591
This is forever.
This is the scarlet letter.

1136
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:45,918
And it, it never goes away,
you'll be dealing with the,

1137
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:48,784
with the implications of this forever.

1138
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:52,842
What..., what tends to
happen is that it isolates you.

1139
01:03:53,697 --> 01:04:00,848
And so you, develop a, a fear of, being
rejected again and again and again

1140
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:04,107
and so you put up walls
between you and other people,

1141
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:06,788
and you isolate yourself
and you don't join communities,

1142
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:10,976
and, when you're isolated you're
less likely to suffer rejection.

1143
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:13,711
But you're also isolated and
living on the edge

1144
01:04:13,713 --> 01:04:17,656
so, um, you can never get away
from this, there's no solution.

1145
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,097
To go from being uh, a movie star,

1146
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:28,541
to zippo the pinhead overnight, was
just like, devastating to my ego.

1147
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:32,153
If you're looking for a long career
in the porn business

1148
01:04:32,155 --> 01:04:34,026
you're probably looking in the wrong place.

1149
01:04:35,345 --> 01:04:40,621
Uh, the average girl, might be good for,
two years?

1150
01:04:41,386 --> 01:04:44,212
Two to three years tops
for the average girl.

1151
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:48,435
If you're lucky and you're one of the
few superstars, not very many of those,

1152
01:04:48,437 --> 01:04:52,303
okay then you get uh, you know,
six seven years. Eight years.

1153
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:54,766
And if you play your cards right,

1154
01:04:54,768 --> 01:04:56,716
and do your financial thing right,

1155
01:04:56,828 --> 01:04:59,584
then you can, you know,
make some money and set yourself up.

1156
01:05:00,693 --> 01:05:02,573
Overall I guess I'm happy I did it.

1157
01:05:02,575 --> 01:05:04,507
I mean the only thing I don't like is
that, it,

1158
01:05:04,607 --> 01:05:08,686
the main thing I really wanted to do
is act and be in comedies and tv,

1159
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:10,308
and I feel like it holds me back.

1160
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,479
But I don't know if I would have just stuck

1161
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:15,369
with the normal route if I would've
uh, ended up making it to tv at all,

1162
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:18,219
who knows I'd probably, maybe still
be in Florida going to castings,

1163
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:20,065
maybe I never would have come out here.

1164
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:22,190
So, and I've gotten to do a lot
of Cinemax movies

1165
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:24,828
which are really fun too,
and all those things I've gotten to do

1166
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:28,509
because of probably the porn.
So overall I guess I'm happy I did it.

1167
01:05:28,687 --> 01:05:32,182
Uh, part of the reason we're here
in Utah is because porn is illegal here

1168
01:05:32,184 --> 01:05:35,129
so uh, it really helps keep me from
being recognized.

1169
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,600
That and the forty extra pounds I gained!

1170
01:05:37,692 --> 01:05:40,339
But um, now that I'm losing that weight,

1171
01:05:40,667 --> 01:05:43,610
well I also cut off my hair
so that helps too. But um.

1172
01:05:44,115 --> 01:05:47,973
Yeah, everyone's been really cool
about, when they find out who I am.

1173
01:05:47,975 --> 01:05:51,082
They've been really good about it.
When I took Katty to her new daycare

1174
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:54,238
and they asked, if I had um,
reference names for like,

1175
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,273
who to call if something happens to Katty
I said I don't know anybody here,

1176
01:05:57,275 --> 01:06:00,398
I have no references, sorry, and she
thought that was a little bit suspicious,

1177
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:02,130
and so she looked me up online,

1178
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,537
I had given her the name Asia Lemon, um,

1179
01:06:05,193 --> 01:06:07,605
and from that name she managed
to figure out who I was

1180
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:10,872
and so the next day she goes, uh, you
know I did a little Googling on you.

1181
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:12,668
And I was like Ugh!

1182
01:06:13,764 --> 01:06:17,544
Miss Mormon Mommy of four
who did a little Googling on Asia.

1183
01:06:17,546 --> 01:06:19,600
I was like, so,
you still gonna watch my kid?

1184
01:06:20,558 --> 01:06:22,526
Well you know, unfortunately like uh,

1185
01:06:22,528 --> 01:06:26,259
one of the reasons I like...
the fact that Vince Neal

1186
01:06:26,261 --> 01:06:28,490
has me playing his charity tournament
for his daughter

1187
01:06:28,492 --> 01:06:31,225
for children's cancer and stuff,
and I played in the Country uh,

1188
01:06:31,926 --> 01:06:34,927
Academy of Country Music Awards
charity tournament this year

1189
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:38,034
and a few other charity tournaments
cause it's one of the only ways,

1190
01:06:38,705 --> 01:06:43,779
that porn people can give to charities,
unfortunately in this hypocritical world,

1191
01:06:44,258 --> 01:06:46,777
a lot of charities
don't want to accept money

1192
01:06:46,779 --> 01:06:48,721
from people that are in the sex business.

1193
01:06:48,723 --> 01:06:50,865
"Eww, the sex business we can't do that."

1194
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:54,557
Politicians, on the other hand,
who make us look clean as hell,

1195
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,392
no problem taking their money.

1196
01:06:56,795 --> 01:07:00,747
Uh, unscrupulous business men who's
ripping everybody off, no problem!

1197
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:03,082
But because we have
a little sex once in a while, naw,

1198
01:07:03,334 --> 01:07:05,733
can't do you and that pissed me off.

1199
01:07:06,094 --> 01:07:09,499
I had one interesting moment in
baseball with my son in little league.

1200
01:07:09,501 --> 01:07:11,674
I had told nobody about my career,

1201
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:16,138
and uh, one day the manager,
who was this big black guy

1202
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,450
who was a Stanford graduate,
he comes up to me and he goes,

1203
01:07:19,521 --> 01:07:22,376
"Gonna be some trouble today."

1204
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,260
And I said what do you mean?

1205
01:07:24,262 --> 01:07:26,874
He says:
- One of the mothers knows who's you are.

1206
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,667
He looks at me and he's says

1207
01:07:28,743 --> 01:07:31,370
"You know I knew who you were
the minute you came on the field."

1208
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:33,110
And he said I'll tell you the truth.
He said

1209
01:07:33,114 --> 01:07:37,091
"Anybody that's been in Nina
Hartly's booty is okay with me."

1210
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:41,396
He says "I will take care
of this." And he did.

1211
01:07:41,675 --> 01:07:43,683
MENSA's a high IQ society.

1212
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:47,690
You have to have an IQ
in the top two percent, to get in.

1213
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:50,756
I got in, with a notarized copy
of my SAT scores.

1214
01:07:50,758 --> 01:07:53,388
MENSA didn't want link
to my website even though

1215
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:57,206
they linked all the member's websites,
because uh, of who I was, and adult star,

1216
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:00,612
um, so, that was their excuse,

1217
01:08:00,614 --> 01:08:03,391
and so I made them a special
little webpage of Asia

1218
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:06,953
just like, happy Asia,
college pictures and smiling Asia

1219
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:09,242
and, just innocent stuff
and it's two pages,

1220
01:08:09,346 --> 01:08:11,835
and that's,
so that's where MENSA links to now,

1221
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,264
instead of my regular site.

1222
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:17,018
And they finally acknowledged me in
their MENSA celebrity issue which was,

1223
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,572
a really big moment for me. That was cool.

1224
01:08:20,365 --> 01:08:22,133
Wait, how do you say it?

1225
01:08:22,438 --> 01:08:24,983
Unprecedented? Unprecedented?
It sounds weird. Okay.

1226
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:28,456
I've done something unprecedented that

1227
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:31,170
nobody else in the adult industry
has ever done.

1228
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:33,861
Um, and that was you know
running for Governor of California,

1229
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:35,136
actually two times.

1230
01:08:35,138 --> 01:08:37,803
And um, it was amazing,
when I first started out,

1231
01:08:38,388 --> 01:08:39,632
the owner of my company

1232
01:08:39,634 --> 01:08:42,176
and I thought that it was gonna be
just like a little fun joke,

1233
01:08:42,178 --> 01:08:44,611
see if I could get some press,
maybe get on the avn.com,

1234
01:08:44,783 --> 01:08:47,188
so when I went down to the
courthouse to get my paperwork

1235
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,066
when we said I was gonna do it,

1236
01:08:49,089 --> 01:08:52,522
um, Howard Stern Show sent a camera
crew down, Channel 7, Channel 5,

1237
01:08:52,566 --> 01:08:55,075
all the news shows showed up,
Associated Press, writers,

1238
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:57,759
and that's when him and I are like
Okay, I gotta get on that ballot

1239
01:08:57,761 --> 01:08:59,228
because this is gonna be huge.

1240
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:02,446
I'm going to get rid of the car tax and
put a tax on breast implants instead.

1241
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:05,328
I will legalize gay marriage.

1242
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,651
And I will make sure everyone who files
for unemployment gets jury duty.

1243
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:12,292
In other words, California,
I'll be a kickass governor,

1244
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:15,190
so vote for me, Mary Carey,
on October 7th.

1245
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:18,682
I mean, of course, some of my platforms
were very tongue in cheek,

1246
01:09:18,684 --> 01:09:21,819
and funny but, you know,
when I was getting towards the end of it

1247
01:09:21,821 --> 01:09:24,354
I realized that you know I really
wanted to make a difference

1248
01:09:24,422 --> 01:09:27,015
and I felt like I really was making a
difference because

1249
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:29,805
I was getting a lot of people
who normally wouldn't follow politics

1250
01:09:29,807 --> 01:09:33,308
to follow, because of me. And um, you know,

1251
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,870
and then I was like what if I win?

1252
01:09:34,872 --> 01:09:37,316
But, you know, coming
in tenth place is pretty amazing

1253
01:09:37,318 --> 01:09:38,881
out of a hundred and thirty-two people.

1254
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,640
When I was eighteen years old, um,

1255
01:09:40,642 --> 01:09:43,656
I went to uh,
real-estate school, just everything

1256
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:45,771
about real-estate just I really liked,

1257
01:09:45,773 --> 01:09:49,128
so I figured that I would always,
do something with that.

1258
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:54,607
I was working for a builder, uh, a, a
home builder, here, and,

1259
01:09:54,669 --> 01:10:00,375
corporate, came to my community
and shut the doors

1260
01:10:00,377 --> 01:10:01,711
and said we need to talk to you.

1261
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:05,360
Someone recognized you,
We know who you are,

1262
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:11,865
and you are too recognizable and it's
a, we're too conservative of a company,

1263
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:14,021
and we're gonna have to let you go.

1264
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:16,857
And so that was right before,

1265
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,659
that was a week before I got
diagnosed with cancer.

1266
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:22,158
And the ones that got out of this business

1267
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,305
and now are being blighted
by the society that jacked off to them.

1268
01:10:26,539 --> 01:10:29,193
Well the society are the ones
that's guilty for that.

1269
01:10:29,195 --> 01:10:32,293
They're damning them for something that
gave them pleasure, but they refuse

1270
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,096
to admit that they got
the pleasure from them.

1271
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:36,134
And that's a very very
sad state of affairs.

1272
01:10:36,136 --> 01:10:38,561
Now I was starting to direct,

1273
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:42,550
and I was hired, uh, a couple months later,

1274
01:10:42,552 --> 01:10:44,721
to go to Germany to work.

1275
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:47,769
I'd make about eight grand
or something like that.

1276
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:49,397
Work eight days or something.

1277
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:51,690
And I didn't wanna do this
any more at this time,

1278
01:10:51,692 --> 01:10:52,998
I didn't wanna do it any more.

1279
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,669
So I left, said goodbye to her,
stood in line for two hours,

1280
01:10:56,671 --> 01:11:00,543
and as I'm going I'm saying I don't wanna
go, I'm saying to myself I don't wanna go,

1281
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,254
And it just built up and built up until I
got, finally got to the point of where,

1282
01:11:06,242 --> 01:11:09,402
"May I help you?" they said,
you know, ticket counter,

1283
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:12,726
I said uh, no, I'm not going.

1284
01:11:12,953 --> 01:11:17,113
I took my bags, I call up Kathleen
and I said baby I'm coming home,

1285
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:19,064
I don't wanna go,
I don't wanna go to Europe.

1286
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,756
I'm thinking about the trip and
everything, I don't wanna do this,

1287
01:11:21,758 --> 01:11:25,805
I wanna stay home with her. So, that
was pretty much the last thing I did.

1288
01:11:26,092 --> 01:11:28,777
Really what got me out of
it was my husband.

1289
01:11:29,362 --> 01:11:36,808
Because, when I met Ron, he had no idea
who I used to be. Ron loved me, for me.

1290
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:39,774
And you know he could had
a much younger woman,

1291
01:11:39,897 --> 01:11:41,754
he could had a much better looking woman,

1292
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,657
he could had a woman with a lot more money.

1293
01:11:43,659 --> 01:11:45,029
But he fell in love with me.

1294
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:46,918
He didn't know anything
about that part of me.

1295
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,677
And the fact that he accepted me
for who I was

1296
01:11:49,784 --> 01:11:51,407
and loved me for who I was...

1297
01:11:54,322 --> 01:11:57,091
Taught me how to love me.
Really.

1298
01:11:57,093 --> 01:12:00,962
And his love for me has reconnected me

1299
01:12:00,964 --> 01:12:04,427
with the person that I was before
I EVER, did any of this crap.

1300
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:10,698
All of a sudden Mr. Right came
into my life, and I hated him.

1301
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:12,287
Ha! When I first met him.

1302
01:12:12,364 --> 01:12:14,372
His whole life he was raised
in Christian school

1303
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:17,001
from like, he went to the same school,
the same kids

1304
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:18,871
from like kindergarten
to like twelfth grade.

1305
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:21,751
He was like most valuable player,
he did sports,

1306
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,330
his mom had all these trophies.

1307
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:25,898
She has a book this thick just
on newspaper clippings on him.

1308
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:28,985
So I was like jealous already
I hated his guts.

1309
01:12:29,056 --> 01:12:31,716
He would like knock on my door
and I would answer

1310
01:12:31,718 --> 01:12:34,399
and go what do you want? and he
goes "I'm here to clean your house."

1311
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,141
And I'd be like, what are you doing?

1312
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,978
He goes "You're filthy."

1313
01:12:38,331 --> 01:12:40,875
Like, cause I didn't cook,
and I didn't clean

1314
01:12:40,877 --> 01:12:43,041
and I was, and I was,
I was falling apart.

1315
01:12:43,043 --> 01:12:45,570
So he literally cleaned my whole house.

1316
01:12:45,572 --> 01:12:49,068
With rags for me, and um,
I just stopped working.

1317
01:12:49,284 --> 01:12:51,434
Didn't wanna prostitute anymore
and lie anymore

1318
01:12:51,436 --> 01:12:53,502
and we just hit it off
and the next thing you know

1319
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:56,808
we're snorting meth, and next thing you
know we're reading the bible together.

1320
01:12:57,023 --> 01:12:59,000
And we're like.... dude!

1321
01:12:59,002 --> 01:13:03,498
Did you see like how like God used Joshua
like to conquer all those cities dude.

1322
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,915
And he'd be like...
yeah and (inaudible)...

1323
01:13:05,917 --> 01:13:08,284
and like I, I mean
we're were just like so into the Bible!

1324
01:13:08,286 --> 01:13:11,502
And we realized that
he had went to Christian school

1325
01:13:11,504 --> 01:13:14,174
his whole life and was
the pastor's son so he had

1326
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:16,185
a really great Christian foundation and,

1327
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:21,488
I didn't as much as him but,
he was so sweet

1328
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,406
and he never once pursued me sexually,
so, um,

1329
01:13:24,408 --> 01:13:28,663
we ended up getting married
on Valentine's Day, 1995.

1330
01:13:29,018 --> 01:13:32,574
I met my husband in a pool,
in Hollywood, Florida.

1331
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:37,930
At the Diplomat Hotel.
And he was married at the time

1332
01:13:37,932 --> 01:13:39,676
and I had a boyfriend at the time.

1333
01:13:39,678 --> 01:13:44,818
And, he was in the middle of splitting
up and I was kinda done with it.

1334
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,306
Little Trist.

1335
01:13:46,308 --> 01:13:49,450
And, I told him I was in the middle of uh,

1336
01:13:49,452 --> 01:13:53,327
putting a webpage together,
and, he said oh okay,

1337
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:57,856
and, it had to be maybe three months
after I got my first website up

1338
01:13:57,858 --> 01:13:59,870
that I got an email from him.

1339
01:13:59,872 --> 01:14:03,575
We went out once, that was it.
We haven't been apart since.

1340
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:07,156
Um, my husband died in a car accident
driving home from Las Vegas.

1341
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:09,858
I had asked him not to do
this whole gig actually,

1342
01:14:10,427 --> 01:14:13,505
um, I was eight months pregnant and I
didn't want him away from me that long,

1343
01:14:13,733 --> 01:14:17,491
and uh, he's like "I gotta do it honey",
but he tried, he cut it down to two days

1344
01:14:17,493 --> 01:14:20,946
so he was really happy coming home on the
second day that he was all done with this

1345
01:14:20,948 --> 01:14:23,124
and he came racing home to be
with his pregnant wife

1346
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,979
and he flipped the jeep
and didn't ever make it home.

1347
01:14:26,647 --> 01:14:30,472
Suddenly he's gone and now here I am, no
more income and all these bills to pay

1348
01:14:30,474 --> 01:14:32,522
and it was just like one thing
on top of another.

1349
01:14:32,524 --> 01:14:35,088
And so I, I just,
I put up a plea on my website

1350
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,888
asking, uh, for donations.

1351
01:14:37,648 --> 01:14:39,048
I didn't know what else to do.

1352
01:14:39,444 --> 01:14:45,571
No insurance, no money, bills, and my
fans donated, enormous amounts of money.

1353
01:14:45,573 --> 01:14:48,958
Um, the kids were completely spoiled,
they got toys and books and presents

1354
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,370
and stuff with pictures on it
and just it was, unbelievable

1355
01:14:52,372 --> 01:14:55,615
it would make me cry all the time I would
open all the mail from all these people

1356
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:58,217
I'd never met and it was just, it was
really wonderful having fans

1357
01:14:58,306 --> 01:15:01,104
turn out to help me. Because you know,
I'd been online for ten years,

1358
01:15:01,106 --> 01:15:03,263
they'd watched grow up
and I'd never asked for anything before

1359
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:05,343
and here I was I needed help.
And they helped me.

1360
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:08,487
I faced those up and,
up and downs many times.

1361
01:15:08,489 --> 01:15:11,231
Certainly with my real-estate practice

1362
01:15:11,233 --> 01:15:13,932
and the market and
when the market dropped in real-estate,

1363
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:18,084
and now that the market and, you know,
is dropping all the way across the board

1364
01:15:18,086 --> 01:15:20,791
I mean the country is in crisis.
Our whole country is in crisis.

1365
01:15:21,204 --> 01:15:24,930
It would be really easy for me right now,

1366
01:15:24,932 --> 01:15:30,091
to want to reinvestigate, you know, porn.

1367
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:32,161
I definitely wanna have kids.

1368
01:15:32,163 --> 01:15:34,994
That's something like, I was actually
very depressed recently because

1369
01:15:34,996 --> 01:15:37,711
I, I'm realizing that I'm twenty
years old and I'm not married

1370
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:40,233
and I have no kids.
And I really want kids.

1371
01:15:40,465 --> 01:15:42,689
And, I'd like to have at least two.
Maybe three.

1372
01:15:42,691 --> 01:15:45,457
Because being an only child I always
wished I had a brother or sister.

1373
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,247
I still wish I had a brother or sister.

1374
01:15:47,249 --> 01:15:50,551
Like, you know I just, that's
something I've always wanted so.

1375
01:15:50,901 --> 01:15:53,245
I have a gorgeous family.

1376
01:15:54,261 --> 01:15:56,577
My son is amazing. He's my angel.

1377
01:15:59,539 --> 01:16:01,752
My daughter is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1378
01:16:01,754 --> 01:16:02,758
She saved my life.

1379
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,214
I want my daughter to have
a completely different life.

1380
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:08,801
I want her to, go to college is number one.

1381
01:16:08,803 --> 01:16:11,013
She's a great student, she's a track star,

1382
01:16:11,015 --> 01:16:14,718
she's had to deal with my porn life.

1383
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:18,927
She, um, hates it.
She's embarrassed of it.

1384
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:22,571
And, um, she won't let me,
she doesn't want me

1385
01:16:22,573 --> 01:16:24,630
to go to her track meets, sh...

1386
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:27,018
because she feels
someone would recognize me.

1387
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:30,336
We're going to church now,
I go to church and I um,

1388
01:16:31,118 --> 01:16:35,138
have a strong faith,
and I have changed my life

1389
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:39,466
and I want for her everything that...

1390
01:16:39,468 --> 01:16:42,428
I, I don't want her to ever have
to experience what I experienced.

1391
01:16:42,816 --> 01:16:44,994
In the moment? Thank you!

1392
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,008
For being who you are.

1393
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,948
Cause you're a pretty cool dude.
- Oooo!

1394
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:53,822
Ooo, can I get that in writing?!
- Sure! I can give it to you in writing!

1395
01:16:54,621 --> 01:16:56,714
You're welcome.

1396
01:16:57,207 --> 01:16:59,834
It's interesting.
I mean, what I'm sitting here thinking is,

1397
01:16:59,879 --> 01:17:02,964
I wonder how many other people
out there can have this kind

1398
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:04,378
of conversation with their parents.

1399
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,643
I mean most people can't sit around and
think about their parents having sex, or,

1400
01:17:08,074 --> 01:17:10,698
especially fucking somebody other
than their mother.

1401
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:13,036
I mean that alone would I think
irritate a lot of children.

1402
01:17:13,038 --> 01:17:17,660
But, it's very, normalized, in that sex
is a goody that should be enjoyed.

1403
01:17:17,662 --> 01:17:20,442
Um, and when you can
differentiate between sex

1404
01:17:20,444 --> 01:17:23,727
and love and everything
that happens in between,

1405
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:26,334
um, it's a huge gift
that you can give yourself,

1406
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:29,576
and lovers and partners
and friends and family.

1407
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:33,179
And I'm grateful that that's,
that's my world.

1408
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:35,675
Wow.

1409
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:38,763
I'm impressed.

1410
01:17:39,903 --> 01:17:44,173
She, is my role model. She is my hero.

1411
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:47,649
And, I think I learned a lot from my mom.

1412
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:50,945
She's gone through a lot
and I even tell people that

1413
01:17:50,947 --> 01:17:53,201
she's my hero and she's my role model.

1414
01:17:53,203 --> 01:17:55,462
She's just like whatever,
I did it for my daughter

1415
01:17:55,464 --> 01:17:58,118
and now she's doing what she wants to
she owns her own business,

1416
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,829
and no matter how many people talk
down about her she's still does what

1417
01:18:01,831 --> 01:18:06,307
she wants to do and she's successful at it.
So, I guess she's just a good example of,

1418
01:18:06,309 --> 01:18:10,124
don't let other people bring you down,
just keep doing what you're doing

1419
01:18:10,126 --> 01:18:12,635
and you'll be successful
in what you wanna do.

1420
01:18:12,637 --> 01:18:16,274
So. I'm very proud of you!
Just so you know that!

1421
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:18,486
Please don't start crying
cause then I'll start crying!

1422
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:19,637
I'm not gonna cry!

1423
01:18:19,717 --> 01:18:21,109
I will start crying.

1424
01:18:21,354 --> 01:18:23,561
And since my husband died
there wasn't a lot

1425
01:18:23,563 --> 01:18:26,131
for me to look forward to
so it was kinda nice to have that.

1426
01:18:26,357 --> 01:18:29,831
Mom, your husband died?

1427
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:34,256
Daddy. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

1428
01:18:34,258 --> 01:18:36,142
Up in the clouds.

1429
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,795
There comes a point in our life
when family becomes first,

1430
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,526
the first thing and the question,

1431
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:45,334
the answer to the question,
it just doesn't even take a beat.

1432
01:18:45,336 --> 01:18:46,864
Sometimes...

1433
01:18:49,865 --> 01:18:52,613
And we have the opportunity to see
our friends and family.

1434
01:18:52,615 --> 01:18:57,090
I think Chuck would really
appreciate, that we're here today.

1435
01:18:58,235 --> 01:19:01,180
There was something uniquely
vital about Buck Adams that

1436
01:19:01,462 --> 01:19:03,203
could brighten up the darkest moment,

1437
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:06,342
and put a grin on the face
of the bleakest situation.

1438
01:19:06,344 --> 01:19:10,991
With a body that appeared to be hewn
from a granite block of cement,

1439
01:19:11,895 --> 01:19:16,125
and an intensity that provided his fans
with a vicarious sustenance,

1440
01:19:16,196 --> 01:19:20,137
Buck Adams will always be remembered as
the guy who got it up when it counted.

1441
01:19:20,777 --> 01:19:26,392
You know like I said,
if you knew it was gonna happen...

1442
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,582
what would you have said?

1443
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:32,559
And you don't always get that chance.

1444
01:19:33,832 --> 01:19:38,850
Um, but right now, in my life,
I, regret doing porn.

1445
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:45,066
I regret doing porn and I never thought,

1446
01:19:45,068 --> 01:19:50,886
ever, that I would be, who I became.
Houston.

1447
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:55,908
I never thought I would be so big
and so recognizable

1448
01:19:55,910 --> 01:20:00,440
and just, I just never thought that it
would turn into what it did, for me.

1449
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,147
And God just says, Shelley,

1450
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:06,138
I'm telling you, you need
to... you need to trust me,

1451
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,416
I've got something better for you.
I love you.

1452
01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:13,063
I didn't save your ass all these years
not to give you something better.

1453
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,927
Well, like, looking back, I didn't,

1454
01:20:16,929 --> 01:20:20,846
honestly I can't really like go,
on my computer and,

1455
01:20:20,848 --> 01:20:23,924
and look at stuff that I used to do anymore

1456
01:20:23,926 --> 01:20:26,791
it just makes me, I just, I'm so different.

1457
01:20:26,793 --> 01:20:29,623
I feel so different now like,
where I am in life.

1458
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:32,974
It's really hard for me to believe
that I was that girl.

1459
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:37,216
So yes, it has changed me.
For the better I believe.

1460
01:20:37,218 --> 01:20:41,394
The porn business has afforded me
a very comfortable life

1461
01:20:41,396 --> 01:20:45,204
it has allowed me to educate myself
in ways that I probably wouldn't

1462
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:47,143
have been able to do before.

1463
01:20:47,145 --> 01:20:50,064
It's enabled me to travel
all over the world and,

1464
01:20:50,066 --> 01:20:52,570
meet new and interesting people.

1465
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:59,553
And it's allowed me to, have the,
have the cajones, if you will,

1466
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:03,533
to try new and exciting things that I
probably wouldn't have done before.

1467
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:05,108
I would have been afraid to do.

1468
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,439
I have no fear, to do anything.

1469
01:21:08,441 --> 01:21:11,047
You know because as people we have to fully

1470
01:21:11,049 --> 01:21:13,759
and freely accept ourself for
everything we are

1471
01:21:13,761 --> 01:21:15,802
and everything we're not
cause if we have compar...

1472
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:20,332
If we compartmentalize,
we're never a whole self.

1473
01:21:20,662 --> 01:21:25,013
You know. Especially in like relationships,
we don't get to bring our whole self.

1474
01:21:25,758 --> 01:21:29,589
What I am afraid of the most is because
I've lasted so long

1475
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:31,983
and this industry is now heading
towards its fourth decade

1476
01:21:31,985 --> 01:21:36,002
of presence on this earth, that the
people who created this business,

1477
01:21:36,004 --> 01:21:38,754
the Eric Edwardses, the Jamie Guillesses,

1478
01:21:38,756 --> 01:21:41,694
the John Lesleys,
the great pioneers of this business,

1479
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,982
are not gonna be with us, forever, and,

1480
01:21:43,984 --> 01:21:47,473
I'd hoped to be around long enough
to honor them

1481
01:21:47,475 --> 01:21:49,842
but I don't wanna do it
fast and furiously because

1482
01:21:49,844 --> 01:21:53,536
when they start to fall by the wayside
somebody's gonna have to remember them.

1483
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:56,250
It's based on a line that,
"there is no future

1484
01:21:56,252 --> 01:21:59,152
if in the present we fail to pay
homage to the past."

1485
01:21:59,154 --> 01:22:02,185
But a lot of them are now
in their fifties and sixties,

1486
01:22:02,187 --> 01:22:05,104
some of them in their seventies,
and somebody is

1487
01:22:05,106 --> 01:22:07,623
going to have to be there
to tell their stories.

1488
01:22:08,018 --> 01:22:10,599
Eventually this woman is gonna like say,

1489
01:22:10,998 --> 01:22:12,653
wwheeeeuuuheehehehuh.

1490
01:22:12,758 --> 01:22:16,238
And then when you're eighty-five
and you can't walk no more

1491
01:22:16,294 --> 01:22:18,063
and you're in a wheelchair she's gonna say

1492
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:20,599
"You remember when you
wanted to have sex all day?

1493
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,222
Yeah, what do you mean, you want what?
Bap! What do you want? Bap!

1494
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,670
No no no, now I'm getting back at you."

1495
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:30,054
I miss many things about the business.

1496
01:22:31,403 --> 01:22:36,522
But, I guess the clearest way
to say it concisely would be,

1497
01:22:37,155 --> 01:22:39,150
the biblical phrase occurs to me,

1498
01:22:39,152 --> 01:22:41,772
"when I was a child I spake as a child,

1499
01:22:41,774 --> 01:22:44,626
and when I was a man,
I put away childish things."

1500
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:47,268
I'm trying to think of like Joe Nameth.

1501
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:50,172
Joe, do you miss football?
Sure he does.

1502
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,605
But he can't play like he used to play.

1503
01:22:52,607 --> 01:22:57,086
He's, sixty-five years old now.
I'm in the same place.

1504
01:22:57,559 --> 01:22:59,620
Am I happy I did porn? Uh, yeah,

1505
01:22:59,622 --> 01:23:02,319
I really don't have
too many regrets cause I,

1506
01:23:02,321 --> 01:23:05,066
it's so much stuff came out of it
that was positive.

1507
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:06,904
I got to travel around the world, uh,

1508
01:23:06,906 --> 01:23:08,915
I met a lot of interesting people,

1509
01:23:09,723 --> 01:23:14,529
I'm way over my quota sexually, uh,
I think uh, people ask me and I,

1510
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:18,328
I guess the estimate's, I've been with
like 3000 women or something like that,

1511
01:23:18,642 --> 01:23:24,432
most of them were awesome to work with,
still friends with a lot of 'em, so uh,

1512
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:26,723
yeah, overall it was
a hell of an experience.

1513
01:23:26,725 --> 01:23:29,128
Essentially I am living my life right now

1514
01:23:29,263 --> 01:23:31,762
the way I wanna live it for the rest
of my life, and I wanna,

1515
01:23:31,871 --> 01:23:33,805
I wanna die doing what I'm doing right now.

1516
01:23:34,048 --> 01:23:35,859
How many people can say that?

1517
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:39,104
Well I am, that I live here
and I have a place that I love this much

1518
01:23:39,106 --> 01:23:41,405
I think I'm as lucky as
anybody could be on earth.

1519
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,910
Far as, I mean,
I dunno what the hell t'ask for.

1520
01:23:45,001 --> 01:23:46,952
I'm happy.

1521
01:23:47,467 --> 01:23:52,863
I'm not in a dark place,
I'm not suicidal, I'm not doing drugs.

1522
01:23:53,616 --> 01:23:56,177
You know I'm not self-destructive.

1523
01:23:56,179 --> 01:23:58,984
Um, but the last two years
has been a journey,

1524
01:23:58,986 --> 01:24:01,573
cause I was very
self-destructive before and,

1525
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:04,242
I'm not saying it changed overnight,

1526
01:24:04,244 --> 01:24:06,931
I still have self-destructive thoughts,

1527
01:24:07,181 --> 01:24:13,328
but, um, I'm just in an,
healthier place all around.

1528
01:24:13,714 --> 01:24:17,099
You hear some people we talk to
who are leading normal lives,

1529
01:24:17,113 --> 01:24:19,831
and are doing pretty good, like how
the hell would you really know,

1530
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:23,595
like, how would you know what really
goes on in their life at two a.m.?

1531
01:24:23,597 --> 01:24:26,833
The torment, the, you know,
how would you know that

1532
01:24:26,835 --> 01:24:30,132
they're gonna tell you about all the times
they've been rejected and isolated and,

1533
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:32,833
and the horror and the shame that,

1534
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:38,586
that their children confront and that,
their spouses confront, and the shame that

1535
01:24:38,588 --> 01:24:40,336
they've put their families through and,

1536
01:24:40,338 --> 01:24:43,420
and the relationships that have been
permanently broken.

1537
01:24:43,422 --> 01:24:46,282
I mean all the,
all the burned bridges behind them

1538
01:24:46,284 --> 01:24:47,757
because they've done sex work.

1539
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:50,728
You know most families aren't proud
when their daughters become hookers.

1540
01:24:51,062 --> 01:24:56,947
I think the difference between me
and the other girls in the industry

1541
01:24:56,949 --> 01:25:03,306
was that I've really, enjoyed being there
and um, not just the sex

1542
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:06,544
I mean I, used it to better myself
as a person.

1543
01:25:06,546 --> 01:25:09,410
I never let the industry
take advantage of me in any way.

1544
01:25:09,412 --> 01:25:11,536
I always took advantage of the industry.

1545
01:25:11,538 --> 01:25:14,533
I made phenomenal amounts of money
I've produced movies, I wrote movies,

1546
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:17,186
I starred in them, hell people
were paying me

1547
01:25:17,188 --> 01:25:19,452
hundreds of dollars an hour
to sign autographs?

1548
01:25:19,454 --> 01:25:21,856
Woo hoo! I'm up, I'm with this!

1549
01:25:21,858 --> 01:25:23,559
Um, I just, I-I...

1550
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:25,673
The other girls leave with a bad taste
in their mouth

1551
01:25:26,318 --> 01:25:29,484
and they-and I just, I have nothing
but good memories when I look back.

1552
01:25:29,584 --> 01:25:31,434
And right now
if I wanted to go back into porn

1553
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,650
I could probably go get a contract
almost at any company

1554
01:25:33,686 --> 01:25:35,419
and still just do straight boy-girl scenes.

1555
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:37,969
And if I really wanted to when I'm 32
if I wanna go back to porn

1556
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:40,820
and because I'm really broke maybe
let's say, hopefully it won't happen,

1557
01:25:40,821 --> 01:25:42,614
I would tell a porn company guess what,

1558
01:25:42,616 --> 01:25:44,593
I'm gonna come back and do
two guys and do anal.

1559
01:25:44,595 --> 01:25:46,683
If I'm thirty-five and really poor
I need to do porn,

1560
01:25:46,685 --> 01:25:49,384
I'll tell 'em I'll do, you know,
a black guy. Heh!

1561
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:51,534
There isn't that much of a future

1562
01:25:51,536 --> 01:25:54,558
after the x-rated industry because somehow,

1563
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,474
somewhere, somebody will find you.

1564
01:25:56,476 --> 01:25:58,368
The famous line I used to say to anybody

1565
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,537
walking into my office
when I ran the biggest agency,

1566
01:26:00,539 --> 01:26:03,629
what are you gonna do ten years from now
when your kid brings home a magazine

1567
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:06,356
with you laying in the middle of it
with a candle shoved up your ass?

1568
01:26:06,357 --> 01:26:08,928
You gonna tell'em you were playing
the part of a birthday cake?

1569
01:26:08,933 --> 01:26:11,400
It doesn't go away.

1570
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:14,664
My husband and my son changed my life.

1571
01:26:16,991 --> 01:26:19,026
And my son saved my life.

1572
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,508
And looking at him every day,

1573
01:26:24,968 --> 01:26:28,015
reminds me how precious life is.

1574
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:33,278
And how throwing it away
on drugs and alcohol,

1575
01:26:34,287 --> 01:26:37,609
just this stupid crap that's out there,

1576
01:26:39,008 --> 01:26:41,810
god, it's just so not worth it. You know?

1577
