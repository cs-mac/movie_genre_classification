Synced and corrected by R3V0LV3R.

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,974
Michael, uh, you remember me
from the last time you and I talked?

3
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:32,909
About a week ago?

4
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:36,039
You see this camera?
You're going to have to say "yes"...

5
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:38,277
so that camera can take down
everything you say.

6
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:42,379
Because that camera can't take down
something when you shake your head.

7
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:46,256
Can you say "yes" for us?
Let me hear you say, "yes." "Yes."

8
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:49,523
That's pretty good. How about a
little bit louder than that? "Yes."

9
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:53,726
And we talked about what happened
on the 13th of May?

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,132
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:56,203 --> 00:01:02,039
Now, Michael, do you know what it is to,
uh-to tell the truth about things?

12
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:05,243
You're gonna have to say "yes."
You can't shake your head. "Yes."

13
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:10,341
Okay. What does it mean when you
have to tell the truth about things?

14
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,919
- Don't lie.
- Don't lie. That's right.

15
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:17,286
And do you know what happens
to people who lie?

16
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,851
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:21,985
- What happens to them?
- They get hurt.

18
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,087
They get hurt.

19
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,412
Yes, the big story on Action News tonight
is the effort to evict MOVE...

20
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:47,419
from its house
on the 6200 block of Osage Avenue.

21
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,580
The effort has turned into a disaster.

22
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:54,025
The fire is now five-alarm,
still raging out of control as you can see.

23
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:57,427
An unknown number of heavily-armed
MOVE members continue at large,

24
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,431
possibly roaming the alleyways.

25
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:03,731
Going in, everybody knew
that MOVE would resist anything.

26
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:07,501
While the police will say that
they come here to arrest people,

27
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,098
we have done nothing wrong.

28
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,770
We do not want policemen killed.
We do not want people in the house killed.

29
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:14,541
Fellow officer, James Ramp,
was killed seven years ago.

30
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,104
They will never forget that.

31
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,947
Okay. This is unconfirmed.
We've got to emphasize this is unconfirmed.

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,750
But Channel 10 technician,
Fran Hardy reports-

33
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:25,951
An incendiary device
was dropped out of that helicopter.

34
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,221
Nobody around here has ever
seen anything like this.

35
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:33,559
We expect that maybe 60, perhaps more,
homes have gone up in flames.

36
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:37,535
I stand fully accountable
for the actions that took place tonight.

37
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:43,371
How did an attempt to arrest MOVE members
become an inferno that killed 11 people...

38
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:45,240
and destroyed 61 homes?

39
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:50,249
You can call the group reactionists,
revolutionaries, terrorists.

40
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:55,755
That was a decision...
to let the fire burn.

41
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,417
On May 13, 1985,

42
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,929
years of conflict between
the city of Philadelphia...

43
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:40,228
and a small, urban group
known as MOVE...

44
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,168
ended in a violent,
daylong encounter...

45
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,297
between the groups' members
and the Philadelphia police.

46
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:54,475
It was one of the most devastating days
in the modern history of the city.

47
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:58,674
Before we call the first witness...

48
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:01,414
I want to tell you
about this special commission.

49
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,888
We are men and women,
black and white,

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,588
guided by our own attitudes
and beliefs.

51
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:15,325
What we hope to accomplish
is to begin healing the wounds...

52
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:20,965
caused by the failure to resolve
conflicting lifestyles in a peaceful way.

53
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:41,918
Six, five, four, three...

54
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:49,096
This is MOVE, the people in an organization
that admits to being totally revolutionary.

55
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,307
For the past four years,
they have lived in the

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,469
Powelton Village area
of West Philadelphia,

57
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,634
often running into conflicts with police.

58
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,133
Their personal appearance
has brought stares and

59
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:01,579
some expressions of disapproval
from the community.

60
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:04,446
But it what they do that counts,
not how they look.

61
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:08,544
In everything from work habits to
child raising, MOVE is revolutionary.

62
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:11,352
Uh, I was indoctrinated with a philosophy
in the Panthers...

63
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:15,383
that revolution only meant picking up a
gun and going out and murdering somebody.

64
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:19,728
I never thought that revolution
consisted of revolutionizing myself...

65
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,791
to get away from the things
that caused me to wanna revolt.

66
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:28,201
MOVE does not believe in technology.
They use a wood-burning stove for heat,

67
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,139
and they have no electricity.

68
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,145
But they do have cars,
and they have a telephone. Why?

69
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:37,479
All the answers are in the guidelines,
their bible left by John Africa.

70
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:45,587
Miss Sims, can you describe for me
what the philosophy of MOVE was?

71
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:48,514
What did John Africa
teach with regard to the

72
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:51,393
society in which you
found yourself living?

73
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:53,557
You're asking what was being taught?

74
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:54,622
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:58,660
Okay. Um, the absolute truth.

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,703
We were being taught
about this system.

77
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,908
The corruption in this system.

78
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:14,042
But mainly, it was...
just the absolute truth.

79
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,787
What John Africa did was...
expose the lie in the system.

80
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,350
Uncover it.

81
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:25,296
Could you describe what you mean
by the word "the system", please?

82
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,299
The system.
The establishment. You.

83
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,900
Philadelphia is a tortured city.

84
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,533
Trash piles up at the curbline.

85
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:39,203
Kids are afraid to walk to school.

86
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,043
Abandoned homes
pockmark the ghetto.

87
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:46,711
Philadelphia needs a strong man
for a tough job.

88
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,550
Philadelphia needs
Frank Rizzo as mayor.

89
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:54,920
A small, vocal minority among us...

90
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:59,158
seeks to destroy
the heritage of 1776.

91
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:05,193
We must be ever-vigilant that this minority
does not impose its philosophy...

92
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,604
on the unwilling majority of Americans.

93
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,412
In their vigilant effort to maintain
close contact with mother Earth,

94
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:18,679
the MOVE members are breaking up the cement
of the sidewalk around their property.

95
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,758
Yeah, life.

96
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:31,060
But you are not animals. I mean...

97
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,826
- Why not?
- I don't want to be personal.

98
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,163
- Wait a minute. Why not?
- Yes, we are.

99
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:39,899
We are animals, because our reference is no
different than the reference of animals.

100
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,693
There's only one reference,
and that's life.

101
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,610
That's what MOVE is about.
Life. Truth. That's our religion.

102
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:53,679
We see John Africa in the same way
that people saw Jesus Christ...

103
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:58,850
because of his carpentry, because of his
simple way of living, and so forth.

104
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:04,659
Now, we know that John Africa is a man
who can explain Jesus Christ.

105
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,194
When Reverend Audrey Bronson wants to
practice her religion, nobody beats her up.

106
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:18,341
But when MOVE wanted to practice their
religion, people started talking about, uh,

107
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,073
"it's not done that way."

108
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:27,108
There are Catholics and Methodists,
evangelists, theologians, you name it.

109
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,747
We were the religion of life.

110
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:34,385
Where is it written that we could not
have a religion of our own?

111
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,429
Your brother, Vincent Leapheart
was John Africa, is that correct?

112
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:42,127
My brother, Vincent Leapheart,
was my brother.

113
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:45,899
John Africa was the founder
of the MOVE organization.

114
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,668
And they were one and the same?

115
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,904
I said my brother was my brother.

116
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:56,312
And I said John Africa was
the founder of the MOVE organization.

117
00:08:56,382 --> 00:09:00,250
John-Vincent Leapheart
is my brother.

118
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:12,059
When Michael was about two years of age,
he was taken by his mother...

119
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:17,091
to a residence occupied by members
of an organization called MOVE.

120
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,606
And Michael was subsequently
given the name of Birdie Africa.

121
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:25,406
Michael Ward was, of course,
no more a member of MOVE...

122
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:29,073
than a child of Republican
or Democratic parents...

123
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,616
would be styled by
a particular party label.

124
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:35,245
He was throughout,
an absolutely innocent,

125
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:39,690
guiltless, and under the circumstances,
vulnerable child and youngster.

126
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:31,300
Now, when you go to school
and you embrace that education,

127
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:35,279
the very first thing you are
taught in school is separation...

128
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:38,943
is categorization,
alienation, conflict.

129
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,919
You're taught black, white,
blue, green.

130
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:46,118
Up, down, back, forth.
Taught, uh, Protestant, Catholic.

131
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:49,684
Taught Yale, Harvard.
Conflict. War.

132
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:55,029
You know, if a child does not know
that he is black and I am white,

133
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,864
if he is not taught
that categorization,

134
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,528
if he is not taught
that separation,

135
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,801
In the place of that,
all he can gravitate to,

136
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:04,968
all he can know is harmony,
is unity, is love.

137
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,987
Life! Life!

138
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:28,175
- Did you like raw food?
- Some of it.

139
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,466
Some of it?
What did you like particularly?

140
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,874
Watermelon, mangoes...

141
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,240
and sweet potatoes and onions.

142
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:41,109
And onions.
Did you all eat any meat at all?

143
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,375
Only one time
we ate raw chicken.

144
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,586
Why would the adults eat
cooked food and the

145
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,646
children not eat cooked food?
Do you know?

146
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,985
They said they wasn't
used to raw food.

147
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:54,515
They weren't used to raw food
and the children were used to raw food.

148
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:14,344
Were you all ever punished
for taking the food or anything?

149
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,675
Yeah. Did they punish you
when you...

150
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,311
- They had meetings on us.
- They had meetings?

151
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,617
Would they ever hit the children?

152
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:28,250
Uh, so you didn't get any spankings
or anything like that?

153
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,592
- They didn't believe in spanking.
- They didn't believe in spankings.

154
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:37,125
I see. Did you, uh-When they holler at
the children, what would the children do?

155
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:38,966
- Cry.
- They would cry?

156
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,268
- Did they ever holler at you?
- Yes.

157
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,831
- Did you cry when you were hollered at?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:50,445
- Did they-Did they say they loved you?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,416
Did you love them?

160
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:13,537
I came in contact with MOVE
back in 1974.

161
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,399
We had a number of rap sessions
with youngsters...

162
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:19,604
in terms of trying to offer
a different point of view.

163
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,773
Did they appear to you
to be violent at all?

164
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:28,515
No, it basically appeared to be a
progressive, uh, political organization...

165
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,182
pretty much concerned
about the issues...

166
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,555
that impacted
on the black community.

167
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:39,027
Officer Cresse, was there any indication
that you were aware of...

168
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:42,659
that, uh, the MOVE members
were potentially violent?

169
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:47,838
Other than being, uh, vocal,
no, sir.

170
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,304
They can put out weird things
like you can hear me use profanity.

171
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:59,477
But is it possible to describe a maniac,
a profane, obscene, pornographic freak...

172
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,315
without using profane words?

173
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,254
Motherfuckers!

174
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:13,730
Do you have information concerning how
many arrests occurred involving MOVE?

175
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,495
There was 141 demonstrations.

176
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,434
There was 97 court cases.

177
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:27,070
There was eight meetings,
and there was 193 arrests.

178
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,873
I have as just as much right...

179
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,714
and my brother got just
as much right to speak as you.

180
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:36,755
So what you doin' arrogantly
gaveling us down?

181
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:39,518
- This is not a forum for your political views.
- What is it?

182
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:43,050
- Do you understand that?
- Do you understand that I was brought here...

183
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,962
because of my beliefs,
because of my views?

184
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,967
I object. I think the witness,
at this point,

185
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,265
is badgering the judge.

186
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:55,368
They were, in fact,
telling the truth in the courtroom,

187
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,739
and because the judge
could not dispute it,

188
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,372
because the judge had went
to Harvard and Yale and Cornell...

189
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:05,611
to learn what law was.

190
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,813
They could not understand
how a people could stand there,

191
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:13,257
looking as they did, but yet knowing
more, in fact, than they did.

192
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:19,128
And this called for many contempts,
many beatings in the courtroom.

193
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,497
And it was like a repeat
over and over again.

194
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,898
Officer Cresse, directing your attention
to approximately March 30 of 1976,

195
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:34,777
what, if anything occurred during
that time period with regard to MOVE.

196
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:39,751
Twenty-four-hour surveillance was
established at the MOVE compound...

197
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:42,083
at 309 North 33rd Street.

198
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:46,648
Around the same time,
was there any, um,

199
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:49,695
situation that arose
with regard to an infant?

200
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,696
Yes, sir.
Could you describe that, sir?

201
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:52,753
Okay.

202
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,506
Just bear with me, please.

203
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:18,455
On March 28 of this year,
at about 4:00 in the morning,

204
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:22,893
some MOVE members were returning from
one of many sentences in the city jail.

205
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,294
The MOVE people say
they weren't making a lot of noise.

206
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,855
But someone in the neighborhood
complained to the police.

207
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,838
What happened next is
the beginning of a

208
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:32,966
controversy that has yet
to be investigated.

209
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:36,072
Somehow an argument
led to a scuffle.

210
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,702
Police reinforcements
were quickly on the scene,

211
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,076
and MOVE put up resistance.

212
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:44,139
By the time it was over,
six policemen reported injuries,

213
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:46,116
six members of MOVE were arrested,

214
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,983
and later, it was found that
three-week-old Life Africa,

215
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,285
one of the MOVE babies, was dead.

216
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:03,162
We went upstairs
to inquire reporters there.

217
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:07,033
And we saw-
We were led into a dark room,

218
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:11,372
and we saw what appeared to be
the remains of a baby.

219
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:15,279
And it was their contention
that this baby had been killed...

220
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:16,872
in a police raid.

221
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,612
Subsequent to that, I introduced
the resolution to the city council,

222
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:24,622
calling for an investigation.

223
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:30,287
It never took place and I felt at that time
that the MOVE people were being harassed...

224
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,354
and that it was a racial problem.

225
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:37,396
Shortly thereafter,
I received some letters...

226
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,664
from the people who live
on 32nd and Pearl Street.

227
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,995
And they indicated that
they were displeased

228
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:46,140
with MOVE, and they
wanted to meet me.

229
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,714
And I went to the meeting
expecting to see...

230
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:57,311
mostly Caucasian people
complaining about MOVE.

231
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,951
And I was surprised
when I entered the home...

232
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:06,157
that most of the people there were-were
black people, just ordinary black people.

233
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:11,765
And for the first time I realized
that it was not a racial problem with MOVE.

234
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:16,672
But that it was something else
that I just did not understand.

235
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:22,044
And then I learned that unless you did
everything that they wanted you to do,

236
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:25,613
uh, you were an enemy.

237
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:39,360
On May 20, 1977,
MOVE brandished weapons...

238
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,764
from their Powelton Village
headquarters platform...

239
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:45,099
saying, "No longer will we be beaten
or intimidated by the police...

240
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:47,105
without a like response."

241
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,118
To your knowledge, did any
of the members of the

242
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,950
MOVE organization ever
possess any weapons?

243
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:57,338
- Not to my knowledge.
- Nor mine.

244
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:01,182
Have you ever seen the pictures
of May 20, 1977, at Powelton Village,

245
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,188
where people are carrying what appear,
at least, to be weapons?

246
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:04,255
Yes, I have.

247
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,541
Were those members of
the MOVE organization?

248
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,850
Yes, they were.

249
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:08,621
Were they weapons?
I don't know.

250
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:12,962
I don't want anyone to think
that I'm insulting their intelligence,

251
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:16,991
but when you have anything like that,

252
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:20,095
regardless to what it looks like,

253
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:23,243
if it is found inside of
the house or not found

254
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:26,338
inside the house and
it is brought out...

255
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,108
and it is found to be inoperable,

256
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:31,115
it is found not to work at all,

257
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:35,552
as far as I'm concerned,
it's not a weapon.

258
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,816
But let me be clear.

259
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,154
This can be a weapon.

260
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:44,822
But I'm talking about to the point
of a weapon that can fire.

261
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,030
It's just like you said.
What appeared to be weapons.

262
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:15,018
In my view, it seemed
to suggest a turning point.

263
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:18,029
It was the point
which it became clear...

264
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:23,262
that MOVE, in fact,
could become a violent organization.

265
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,702
Uh, would, in fact, fight,

266
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:30,936
would, in fact, use weapons
in order to accomplish their mission.

267
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:37,378
They named the game.
And I assure you, they lose.

268
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:38,939
We'll do what's necessary.

269
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:41,043
- What is that?
- The strategy of John Africa.

270
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,815
- What is that?
- Our only defense.

271
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:45,220
- What is that?
- The strategy of John Africa.

272
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,885
You aren't tellin' me anything. You're just
saying "the strategy of John Africa."

273
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,987
Hey, I wouldn't tell my strategy to you.

274
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,231
We ain't talkin' about hurtin'
nobody's religion.

275
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:09,376
We ain't talkin' about killin'
off nobody's religion.

276
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,473
Rizzo is talkin' about
religious persecution.

277
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,353
Don't question the person
tellin' the truth.

278
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,179
Question the person
that's tellin' the lie.

279
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,585
All right!

280
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:29,333
Only in a democracy could they get away
with what they're getting away with.

281
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:58,887
People are people regardless
of their color, their skin,

282
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,488
their religion, their race or nothin'.

283
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:03,057
They're still people.
They can bleed. They can die.

284
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:06,070
They can catch diseases.
We can all go through the same situations.

285
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:10,632
It's unnecessary for all of that.
I really think it's unnecessary.

286
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,633
And it's all going to
boil down to a bunch of

287
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:17,778
people getting hurt and
killed over nothin'.

288
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,216
Over nothin' that doesn't really
make any sense.

289
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,022
At 6:10 a.m., Mayor Rizzo finally,
after 15 months of confrontation,

290
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,654
used the force he threatened all along.

291
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,097
The police will be in there to drag
them out by the backs of their necks.

292
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:39,570
They're going to be taken by force
if they resist.

293
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:42,004
If police come in there with their hands,
we'll use our hands.

294
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:44,736
If they come in here with clubs,
we'll use clubs.

295
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,836
But if they come in here shootin' and
killin' our women and children and our men,

296
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:50,609
we will shoot back
in defense of our lives.

297
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:55,177
I've learned one thing as a policeman.
You never underestimate your opponent.

298
00:22:55,254 --> 00:23:00,920
You always get in there faster with more
than is necessary, and you overpower them.

299
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:20,239
Stakeout personnel, using body shields,

300
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:26,376
cover fireman as they position a portable
deluge gun closer to the compound.

301
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,898
Shots have been fired!

302
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:44,402
Officers and firemen are
wounded by gunfire.

303
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,598
First deluge gun goes out of control.

304
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:58,115
Other officers and firemen
move in to pull the wounded personnel...

305
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,378
out of the line of fire.

306
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:04,222
Officer Ramp, shown here
lying on his back,

307
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,655
has now been mortally wounded.

308
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:08,659
Officer Hesson, also wounded,

309
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:11,924
crawls over and attempts
to shield officer Ramp.

310
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:44,619
Mr. Rendell, um,

311
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:48,223
did you consider the MOVE organization
to be a terrorist group?

312
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,827
They had demonstrated
a past history of violence.

313
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:56,932
Uh, they had demonstrated
a willingness to use violence, force...

314
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:01,105
or the threat of violence or force
to achieve their objectives.

315
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,775
It was almost difficult,
if not well nigh impossible,

316
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,148
to deal with them
in any rational basis...

317
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:10,108
that their stated goals
as a group that was a

318
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:13,021
back-to-nature group were,
frankly, a bunch of bull.

319
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:17,319
People who have killed one person,

320
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,957
injured several others, people who
threaten to blow up people's houses,

321
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:24,992
people who threaten to shoot and kill
neighbors, police, elected officials-

322
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,166
I think that's a pretty adequate
description of the word "terrorist."

323
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:09,240
With every step of the way,
including the final act today,

324
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:14,013
the police used commendable restraint,
uh, and it was done for many reasons.

325
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:17,214
Most of all because of the children
who are present today.

326
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:20,156
There had been much concern
on the part of many people...

327
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:23,820
that the police would make
a violent assault on the MOVE members.

328
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:27,332
As it turned out, the police
acted with precision and restraint.

329
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,572
When one of the MOVE
members came out of the

330
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:31,768
window with a cartridge
case in one hand,

331
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:34,431
a clip and with a knife in the other,

332
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:37,441
he was hit on the top of the head
with a steel helmet...

333
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,443
and was taken into custody.

334
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:41,604
That's what you're referring to.

335
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:53,016
He's hittin' him. He's hittin' him.

336
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:55,753
Hittin' him on the head.
Kickin' him on the head!

337
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,031
I have no idea. I couldn't see.

338
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:03,261
- Cops, you're makin' a mistake doin' that.
- Your ass they are.

339
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:09,697
The police probably would have been
legally within their rights...

340
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,938
to have killed all of the 12 people
in that basement.

341
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:16,781
Do you believe
this is a symbolic gesture,

342
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:20,443
tearing their house down at this point,
the very day of the shootout?

343
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,454
I think behind it is
the question we gotta ask is why.

344
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:37,467
There's a suspicion that some shots
had come from elsewhere.

345
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:40,038
Walt Hunter from WCAU,
by the way, swears that

346
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:42,564
a shot was fired going
in this direction.

347
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:55,782
People who know us
know that we're not terrorists.

348
00:27:55,854 --> 00:28:00,052
We fight cops because they're dirty.
They're filthy. They're criminal.

349
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:05,757
The sad part of it is
that this incident is not yet over.

350
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:09,392
There will still be misguided voices
in the community...

351
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,960
seeking clemency
for these criminals.

352
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,030
Long live MOVE!
Long live revolution!

353
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:20,602
Long live John Africa!
it's the MOVE organization.

354
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,596
What they should have done
is shot that goddamn bum,

355
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:45,067
and then there would have been
no trouble today.

356
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:54,070
This police department in Philadelphia
could invade Cuba and win.

357
00:28:54,646 --> 00:29:00,551
What I'm saying, Tom Snyder, is that we are
now trained and equipped to fight wars.

358
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:05,852
Four more years, hell no!
No more Rizzo! Got to go!

359
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:10,691
Four more years, hell no!
No more Rizzo! Got to go!

360
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:13,094
Four more years, hell no!

361
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:26,243
All of us, from all neighborhoods,
from all walks of life...

362
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,776
can solve the problem
facing our city.

363
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,593
Leapheart was asked how he felt
when the verdict was read.

364
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,590
What are your plans in
terms of staying in

365
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,036
Philadelphia and trying to
continue the MOVE cult?

366
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,438
It's not a cult.
It's an organization.

367
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:11,945
When you appear to be different...

368
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:15,123
you become angry,

369
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:19,027
and you will do things
out of the norm.

370
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,577
Did you ever think about leaving MOVE?

371
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:47,151
Yeah.

372
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:50,592
- Uh, when was that?
- A long time ago.

373
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:53,756
A long time ago?
Why did you want to leave MOVE?

374
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:02,932
'Cause we couldn't do
what other kids do.

375
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:05,568
You couldn't do
what the other kids did?

376
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:10,166
Uh, what were the other
children allowed to do

377
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:13,011
who were outside of MOVE
that you couldn't do?

378
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:17,350
Uh, play with toys and stuff
and ride bikes and watch TV.

379
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:21,916
Did you tell anyone
that you wanted to leave?

380
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:25,055
Who'd you tell?

381
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,793
Oh, we told-
We told each other.

382
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:52,055
This is a blue-collar neighborhood.

383
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:59,354
And any given summer day
you have the children,

384
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:01,899
uh, playing in the streets.

385
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:08,533
You have a mother
maybe sitting on the steps.

386
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:11,565
Neighbors talking to each other.

387
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:17,308
And all of a sudden
on their loudspeaker,

388
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:21,079
you'd hear a voice
would come out and say,

389
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:24,849
"You motherfuckers.
What the fuck are you doin' out here now?"

390
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:28,083
Do you know
what's going on here?

391
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,153
You son of a bitches around here
fuckin' everybody up.

392
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,823
"What the fuck is goin' on?"

393
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:41,334
Anything that was vile,
they would go into it.

394
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:55,010
The filth-it was-it was...

395
00:32:55,086 --> 00:33:00,080
unbelievable that something like this
could be in someone's mind.

396
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:03,786
It's one thing to be two blocks away
and hear it.

397
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:09,528
But to live right next door,
full blast in our bedroom.

398
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:12,798
I watched my wife many nights
lay there in that bed and cry.

399
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:14,805
Wasn't nothin' else she could do.

400
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:18,036
I think that, uh,
what we really hoped for...

401
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:20,043
was that some kind of way...

402
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:23,774
the city would find a way
to deal with the situation.

403
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:35,923
The only thing that was happening
is that MOVE was taking a stand...

404
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:40,397
against the injustice that has
been dropped on them...

405
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:45,164
by this administration
and the Rizzo administration.

406
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:49,297
MOVE'S principle has never changed.

407
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:55,207
MOVE'S mood,
I'm talking about bitterness now,

408
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,770
did change.

409
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:04,346
They made, in my view,
a conscious decision...

410
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:11,228
to aggravate residents to the point
was that the residents would, in fact,

411
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:15,960
demand for the city to take actions
to provide them with relief.

412
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:20,634
And in that regard, the city would be
forced into doing one of two things,

413
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:25,672
to engage in confrontation
or to engage in compromise.

414
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:30,071
There was a lot of hostility
between those two entities.

415
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:33,049
I think it must be researched
why the hostility was there.

416
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:35,052
Which two entities, Mr. Bond?

417
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,452
Uh, the city of Philadelphia
and the MOVE organization.

418
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:40,582
And as a pawn,
we were caught in-between.

419
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:43,252
And nobody, frankly, gave a damn.

420
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:59,238
I met with 15 residents,
uh, of Osage Avenue...

421
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,746
on Memorial Day, 1984.

422
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:05,942
At that meeting, I said to them...

423
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:11,683
that I will research as to whether or not
there is a legal basis,

424
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:18,087
uh, for the city to do something about
the problem that you have brought to us.

425
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:21,497
But also pointed out to them...

426
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:24,535
that the mayor does not
have the authority...

427
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:29,039
because he does not like,
or the neighbors do not like,

428
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:31,598
the way someone live...

429
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:34,167
to simply go in and evict the people
from their house.

430
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:38,147
We don't have those kinds of options
in this democracy.

431
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:46,891
Today, more than three dozen Philadelphia
policemen surrounded the building...

432
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,381
after a MOVE member was
spotted on the roof

433
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:51,827
wearing a hooded mask
and carrying a shotgun.

434
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:53,989
That standoff
lasted less than two hours.

435
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:57,057
Police did not enter the house,
and no arrests were made.

436
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:59,154
In the last several
weeks, their actions have

437
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:01,196
escalated tensions in
the neighborhood...

438
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:03,900
leading to tonight's situation.

439
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:07,877
When the individual was on the roof
with the mask and the shotgun,

440
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:10,540
my daughter was in our picture window.

441
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:15,516
And she said, "Daddy, what is the man
doing on top of the roof with a gun?"

442
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,256
And I didn't have an answer.

443
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,394
She asked, "isn't that against the law?"

444
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:27,931
And I said yes.

445
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,942
Well, I don't know how
you can say that for

446
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:35,673
a certain group of people,
the law applies...

447
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,573
and then another group of people,
that same law doesn't apply.

448
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:43,680
I think we were in the law
on an equal basis, if I'm correct.

449
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:51,881
You would see them dragging logs
from the park up the street.

450
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:55,392
You could see that the line
in the street...

451
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,521
from, I guess, the oil out of the trees
that they would drag up.

452
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:05,035
Wood would be stacked up
in front of the house at 6221.

453
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:10,871
There was so much of it
that we requested that they...

454
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:12,204
do something with it.

455
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,302
What was the response
to that request?

456
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:18,440
They responded
and put it on top of the roof.

457
00:37:23,788 --> 00:37:27,280
- We used to play on the roof.
- You used to play on the roof a lot?

458
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:29,952
A lot of times.

459
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:33,964
- Now, you said something about a bunker.
- Mm-hmm.

460
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,933
How many bunkers were there
on the roof?

461
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,491
- Two.
- Two?

462
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,937
And do you know
what they were made of?

463
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:53,310
What kind of holes
did they have in the bunkers?

464
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:58,344
Like the bunker was halfway over the
roof like this, and you could look down.

465
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:01,824
You could see up the street
in the-all over.

466
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,150
Do you know what
those holes were for?

467
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:29,444
That bunker you see there
is kind of a toyish-looking thing,

468
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,890
and I will tell you on Osage Avenue,
it commanded the scene.

469
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:39,456
It overlooked and overpowered anything
you may-you can imagine.

470
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,464
It was awesome.

471
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:45,197
There's been talk that there
are explosives in this house.

472
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:47,533
Uh, is there any truth to that?

473
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:50,472
That's only people's,
you know, hallucination...

474
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,338
because they have
not been inside this house.

475
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,344
So they would not know
what is in this house.

476
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:58,940
What is in this house is the strategy
of John Africa that is very explosive.

477
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:02,943
Is it a confrontation?
It most certainly is a confrontation,

478
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:06,923
one strategized by John Africa
years and years and years ago.

479
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:13,592
Commissioner, could you tell us
what the lessons were...

480
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:18,693
that you felt were learned in the 1978
confrontation from your point of view?

481
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:25,175
From my point of view, sir,
was that MOVE was a group...

482
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:30,146
who was bent by virtue of their dogma
and by their actions...

483
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:35,618
of destroying civilized activity...

484
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:39,521
and ability to live in
a neighborhood peacefully.

485
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:45,389
Tonight, there are growing concerns
about the controversial group, MOVE.

486
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:48,728
City officials met today for the second
straight day to discuss strategy.

487
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,463
Sources reveal that Philadelphia's District
Attorney has now prepared the warrants...

488
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:56,132
that are legally necessary to evict
MOVE members from their home.

489
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,402
Once those warrants are signed by a judge,

490
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:02,879
action by police to evict MOVE
could come at pretty much any time.

491
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,054
Do you know a police officer
by the name of Delores Thompson?

492
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,621
Yes, I do.

493
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:26,160
Do you recall telling her that your
son Frank was ordered to attack you,

494
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:30,034
that you were beaten until
you started to vomit violently,

495
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:32,668
that Frank then placed a pillow
over your face...

496
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:37,306
and asked John Africa
if he wanted you to be cycled or killed...

497
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:40,839
and that John Africa replied,
"Not at this time?"

498
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:42,783
Did she tell you that I said that?

499
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:46,620
- I have her report of that conversation, Mrs. James.
- Okay.

500
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,091
Well, if she-Were you satisfied
with what she said?

501
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,594
- I'm asking you.
- Okay.

502
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:54,460
I heard rumors to the effect
that my son had beaten me.

503
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,767
I've also heard rumors
to the effect that

504
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,026
Wilson Goode put his
wife's jaw on a pulley,

505
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,730
that he beat the hell out of her.

506
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:04,741
Will you ask Mayor Goode that when he comes
in here if he in fact beat his wife?

507
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:06,640
And if not, why not?

508
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:11,171
If it is relevant that my son beat me
or whether or not he did beat me,

509
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,370
then I would say it is
just as relevant for you

510
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:15,515
to ask Wilson Goode
when he comes in here,

511
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:16,917
"Did he beat his wife?"

512
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:19,013
I don't think you're gonna
ask him that.

513
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:24,357
I really don't. But you should,
if you feel that it is relevant.

514
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:33,865
Mr. Lytton, I just want to make it
clear in my mind so that I understand.

515
00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:38,375
Am I to assume that the bomb
was dropped on MOVE people...

516
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:41,206
because Frank beat his mother?

517
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:42,746
Ma'am, we're trying
to find out what happened,

518
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:45,647
- and we'll continue asking questions.
- Oh. Okay.

519
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:09,336
Of course, on Mother's Day,
the evacuation has been slow.

520
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:10,897
People had plans for today.

521
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:14,274
A few had decided that
they'd stay and not evacuate.

522
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:16,614
But police have now
apparently advised those

523
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:18,907
people that they think
it's best that they leave.

524
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:23,113
I hope that it's resolved quickly...

525
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:26,147
and have all confidence that the mayor's
going to be doing the right thing.

526
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,353
I wouldn't mind staying myself, you see.

527
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:30,826
But I was told to leave...

528
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:34,194
just 'cause he don't know what the
extent of this is going to be, you know.

529
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:35,562
What do you think?

530
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:40,593
I think-Believe it or not,
I think you'll have to kill all of them.

531
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:46,035
And neighbors have been told by police not
to return to their homes for 24 hours.

532
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,169
That is 22:00 tomorrow night.

533
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:52,012
Now, what will happen between now
and then remains to be seen, Charles.

534
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,984
And, Casey, some of the neighbors,
as they were leaving, said to me...

535
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,020
that as they were going,
leaving the neighborhood,

536
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,488
the MOVE people were sitting out
in front of the MOVE house,

537
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:01,115
the children in hand.

538
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:06,095
Perhaps that was a subtle or not-so-subtle
indication of what's happening here.

539
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:10,195
Did you consider, sir,
that at least in 1978,

540
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:14,295
the members of the MOVE organization
who were at the Powelton Village house...

541
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:19,901
had used their children, uh,
as if they were hostages?

542
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:21,706
No, sir, I did not.

543
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:25,010
You've said they came out
holding their children up as shields.

544
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:27,312
Uh, I'm not an expert
in police science,

545
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:29,785
but I think to the layman,

546
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:32,721
that might suggest that they were
using their children as a hostage.

547
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,987
That's why I'm asking you
why you did not consider that.

548
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,757
They were using them simply as a ploy...

549
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:43,897
and using that philosophy,

550
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:47,699
that feeling that we had
for the sanctity of children...

551
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:51,572
and everyone else,
to our disadvantage.

552
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:57,606
I do not want to wake up tomorrow morning
and find myself short one son...

553
00:43:57,682 --> 00:44:00,088
because if this thing
kicks off, you're going

554
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:02,517
to have bodies strewn
every which way.

555
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:06,215
You're going to have children killed,
and you're going to have adults killed.

556
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:11,227
I am very much afraid you're
going to have blood-soaked streets.

557
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:15,665
Every one of us knew that there
was an extraordinarily high likelihood...

558
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:17,223
that someone was going to die.

559
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:19,701
We didn't know whether
it was going to be a policeman.

560
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,533
We didn't know whether
it was going to be a fireman.

561
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:23,806
We didn't know whether it was
going to be a MOVE member.

562
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:26,280
The worse dread of all
was that it was going

563
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:28,709
to be a child or a
neighbor or a bystander.

564
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,307
I don't know if anyone on this panel
has ever had the responsibility...

565
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:38,447
of saying "go" to a plan that you know
is going to cost human lives.

566
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:41,616
Until you've done that,
it's very difficult to gauge...

567
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:44,820
whether the city officials
were right or wrong in what they did.

568
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:51,160
Did you all have meetings where you would
discuss what to do if the police came?

569
00:44:51,836 --> 00:44:54,737
Mm-mmm. Not us.

570
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:57,672
Not the children?
How about the adults?

571
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,733
How about the grown-ups?

572
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:03,143
They were to be upstairs by their self
when they had their meetings.

573
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:05,148
When they had their meetings?

574
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,548
How often
would they have their meetings?

575
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:09,813
- A lot of times.
- A lot of times?

576
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:14,847
Did you ever sit in on-Were you
ever in any of their meetings?

577
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:17,587
Do you ever know what
went on in those meetings?

578
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:19,128
Mm-mmm.

579
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:22,530
What is a confrontation?
Do you know?

580
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:24,731
Like it was.

581
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:27,362
But what happens
when you have a confrontation?

582
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:29,736
When the cops come and stuff.

583
00:45:57,535 --> 00:46:02,199
What did you believe they might have
had by way of firearms in that house?

584
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:05,333
We were led to believe that
they had automatic firearms.

585
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:09,140
Shotguns.

586
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:11,374
I guess just as well
as equipped as we were.

587
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,349
Mm-hmm.

588
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:19,185
And so based on what you believed they
had, then you went prepared to match?

589
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,417
- To match or better than.
- Or to have superior?

590
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:25,223
That's correct, sir.

591
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:30,432
We interrupt regular programming
for this special report.

592
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:33,959
I'm Dennis Woltering
with Harvey Clarke at 62nd and Vine...

593
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:37,024
where authorities continue
preparations for an

594
00:46:37,037 --> 00:46:40,034
apparent confrontation with
the radical group, MOVE.

595
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,443
Let me tell you what's happened
so far this morning.

596
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,311
About two hours ago,
3:30 a.m.,

597
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:48,818
utility crews moved into the area,
shut off gas and electricity.

598
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:52,014
SWAT teams have been
converging on the area.

599
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:56,492
You can see a fire truck behind me with
a deluge gun pointed back that way.

600
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,687
It's aimed, apparently,
at the MOVE house.

601
00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:00,992
It looks like the scene is set.

602
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,045
I got on my stomach,

603
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:21,778
and with the bullhorn,
I read the message.

604
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:24,878
And to be quite frank,
I was sweating it out.

605
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:27,917
What did Commissioner Sambor
say, do you know?

606
00:47:27,992 --> 00:47:30,017
He was telling them to come out.

607
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:32,221
Did you hear him saying that?

608
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:45,842
What was the response
of the MOVE organization...

609
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,845
when you read the arrest warrant
that they vacate the premises?

610
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:51,347
That they would not surrender.

611
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:54,748
- Can you tell us what else they said?
- That they would kill us all.

612
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:56,342
And what else did they say?

613
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,981
Uh, they said that, uh,

614
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:02,525
that all of our wives would be widows.

615
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:05,187
And what else did they say
about your wives?

616
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:12,896
They said that our wives would be sleeping
with other men before the end of the day.

617
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,666
- Did they describe what other kind of men?
- Yes, sir.

618
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:17,229
Would you tell us?

619
00:48:17,308 --> 00:48:21,972
They said that our wives would be sleeping
with black men before the end of the day.

620
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:25,277
Do you recall what your reaction was
to those statements?

621
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:30,685
I accepted it, sir,
as some of their rhetoric...

622
00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:36,158
and attempts to incite the police
and myself to precipitous action.

623
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:54,300
The police went in
about five minutes to 6:00.

624
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:56,346
Just four minutes ago,
they pumped tear gas in...

625
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:58,313
which ls in the area.

626
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:02,978
The police began a deluge,
which you can see here.

627
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:04,816
That water's actually
being pumped in...

628
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:09,416
about, probably, 50 yards
into the MOVE compound.

629
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:13,888
As you can see up the street,
Tom, if you just pan up there,

630
00:49:13,964 --> 00:49:18,367
it's a very surreal kind of scene.

631
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:20,801
Very calm men standing around...

632
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:25,433
as the cloud of tear gas,
the haze, kind of begins to lift.

633
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:28,239
Here comes some more tear gas
down Addison Street.

634
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:31,406
This apparently has expanded...

635
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:35,848
to include the entire square block.

636
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:39,650
Perhaps when the cloud clears,
we'll know a little bit more.

637
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:47,530
What was the plan
for May 13, 1985?

638
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:51,659
The tactical plan, as I understood it,

639
00:49:51,735 --> 00:49:56,695
was to remove the MOVE people,
all the people,

640
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:58,435
from the house safely.

641
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,568
That was the objective.

642
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:06,879
It was to be done by causing
a diversion on the roof,

643
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,647
inserting the insertion teams
on either side of the properties...

644
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:17,360
and by then inducing
an amount of C.S. gas...

645
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:19,089
in a sufficient concentration...

646
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:23,800
to make those people
come out of the house.

647
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:30,198
The police presence here
is not like it was the last time.

648
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:33,175
This is being handled
almost entirely by the stakeout unit.

649
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:35,541
There may have just been a gunshot.

650
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:37,739
The gunshots are starting right now.

651
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:41,114
It sounds like automatic fire, Steve.
There's quite a bit of it.

652
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:44,225
We can't tell, Steve, at this point
exactly where the gunfire is coming from.

653
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:50,226
Okay. Steve, at this point we're
being forced to leave our position.

654
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:52,421
- We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
- Let's go.

655
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:54,464
The police
are now moving Harvey Clarke.

656
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,863
- Who shot first?
- They did.

657
00:50:56,934 --> 00:51:00,028
- How do you know?
- Because I was there.

658
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:02,595
I understand that.
Did you see muzzle fire?

659
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:05,870
- I'm just trying to determine how you have that knowledge.
 - No, sir, I did not.

660
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:11,575
But one of the other teams reported
that they were receiving hostile fire.

661
00:51:11,648 --> 00:51:14,776
- Did it sound like automatic fire to you?
- It did. Yes, sir.

662
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:18,151
And I take it you're familiar
with the sound of automatic weapons fire.

663
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:19,985
I've heard automatic-
Yes, sir.

664
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:25,386
Pat, as you can see, we have
reestablished our live signal.

665
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:29,057
Tremendous bursts of gunfire
have rang out...

666
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,795
in the area
of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue.

667
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,804
Walt Hunter has joined me.
And, Walter, what have you learned?

668
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:36,863
We have heard
several popping sounds here...

669
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,431
indicating that gunfire
is getting much, much closer.

670
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,398
But we don't know if the
guns you're hearing

671
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:43,310
are police guns, MOVE
guns or other guns.

672
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,644
About the only thing
we can confirm for you at this point...

673
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:49,174
is that clearly, based on the nature of the
shoot-out we're seeing here this morning,

674
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:52,745
MOVE did have some weaponry
either in the house or nearby.

675
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:05,291
As you know, Commissioner,

676
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:08,770
there were no automatic weapons
found in the MOVE house.

677
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:11,774
Do you know whether or not
the automatic weapons fire you heard...

678
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:14,037
was in fact from police officers?

679
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:21,647
The firing, as initiated by MOVE,

680
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:23,879
uh, was...

681
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:30,225
apparently automatic fire,

682
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,626
and I cannot explain it.

683
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:37,690
But I do not believe for one minute...

684
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:41,727
that it was the police
that were firing at that time.

685
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:46,166
Once the MOVE members started firing,

686
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:48,803
their status changed radically
in the eyes of the law.

687
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,313
They at that point
became forcible felons,

688
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,713
and there's a whole
different set of laws...

689
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:56,685
as to the apprehension
and the amount of force that can be used...

690
00:52:56,753 --> 00:53:01,349
in the apprehension of and the prevention
of the escape of forcible felons.

691
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:04,155
- Including the children?
- No.

692
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:05,923
That's as to the adults.

693
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,759
We went downstairs.

694
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:12,268
Did the adults tell you
to go downstairs?

695
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,600
And where did you go
when you went downstairs?

696
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:16,536
- The garage.
- Into the garage?

697
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,872
- But where were the men?
- They were upstairs.

698
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:21,934
Do you know
what they were doing?

699
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:35,856
Now, we know that the children
wasn't doing any shooting.

700
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:39,127
- Do you feel that their rights-
- I did not know that the children were not shooting.

701
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:42,893
What-Would you say that if we had children
in there four, five, six years old...

702
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:45,093
that they would have been using
any type of weapons?

703
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:48,535
To my knowledge,
there was only one that young.

704
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:53,394
We would like to tell you
that the shoot-out is over.

705
00:53:53,407 --> 00:53:54,970
We cannot say that definitively.

706
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:57,912
We can say there's been at least a 15-
or 20-minute break in the gunfights.

707
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:01,439
Here comes a police car
racing in right now at this moment.

708
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:04,851
This is a highway patrol car
racing into the scene.

709
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:06,617
We don't know
what this signifies.

710
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,057
We'd like to tell you it's over. We really
can't right now. There has been a pause.

711
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:13,187
There are indications that what has been
a tremendous gunfight is over.

712
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:15,163
Looking in the trunk of this car
right here.

713
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:18,065
There's more gunfire right now.
We're gonna crouch down.

714
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:21,366
As you were about to say, the police are
unloading, as you can see right now.

715
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:24,430
The police are unloading
Winchester cartridge shells...

716
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:27,170
from the back
of a highway patrol car.

717
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:31,771
Do you know how many rounds
were fired that day?

718
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:33,645
No, sir.

719
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:38,313
But I will say that, uh-
uh, we ran out.

720
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:44,582
Uh, we did not anticipate,

721
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:51,123
uh, the extent
of the confrontation,

722
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,032
uh, and ran out.

723
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:57,563
Uh, I don't know what time it was,
but it was some time in the morning.

724
00:55:01,945 --> 00:55:04,277
What's happening is,
it's a shoot-out.

725
00:55:04,348 --> 00:55:08,751
Oh, man, and those kids and all that-

726
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:21,290
The gunfire is as close as it's been since
the shoot-out happened this morning.

727
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:22,889
Let's-Let's come closer.

728
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:27,528
Let's come closer and use-and crouch
down behind the Eyewitness News truck.

729
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:34,905
Oh, my God!

730
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:48,748
Get down, lady. Get down. Yeah.

731
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:55,321
Stay in the house.
Stay inside.

732
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,091
I heard shots being fired,
and cops was in the alleyway.

733
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:00,966
They was like,
"Get in the house. Don't come out."

734
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:02,733
I was very, very frightened.

735
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,296
You supposed
to nip something in the bud.

736
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:05,813
If you see something's
coming, you're supposed

737
00:56:05,826 --> 00:56:07,275
to sit down and try
to iron it out...

738
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:09,744
before something like this
comes to this stage.

739
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:12,281
It's war. This is war.

740
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:14,389
I've never seen it,
but I've lived through it today.

741
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:30,159
This woman-We can't determine...

742
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:34,670
whether she is a relative of one
of the MOVE members or not.

743
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:37,366
It appeared that things
had gotten calm.

744
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:41,935
And then as you heard, about a minute and
a half ago, another burst of gunfire.

745
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:44,503
This woman is now being taken
into police custody.

746
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,015
You're watching it live.
They are restraining her.

747
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:51,453
She is hysterical and is clearly upset
about what's going on in there.

748
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:54,888
Just trying to get her out of the danger
area where we are on the fringes right now.

749
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:58,161
Did you have a concern...

750
00:56:58,228 --> 00:57:00,992
that the people
inside of that house...

751
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:04,329
might be in physical danger
or that their lives might be in danger?

752
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,961
Concern?
We knew it.

753
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:08,527
- Miss-
- We-Excuse me.

754
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:13,065
We had-
You had 200 boot-kicking,

755
00:57:13,143 --> 00:57:17,375
Gestapo-oriented cops
out there that day.

756
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:23,147
You had, that day, a police officer
by the name of Mulvihill...

757
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:29,750
who was in the 1978, uh, tragedy...

758
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:35,787
who was, in fact, one of the
officers who stomped and kicked...

759
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:38,596
and beat and bludgeoned...

760
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:43,105
and shot and helmeted
and kicked some more...

761
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:45,767
my brother, Delbert Africa.

762
00:57:45,842 --> 00:57:48,538
So as I understand
your testimony,

763
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:50,477
you were concerned
that there may be physical harm...

764
00:57:50,547 --> 00:57:52,777
to the people inside that house,
is that correct?

765
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,612
Would you turn up
your hearing aid, please?

766
00:57:54,684 --> 00:57:56,345
I can hear you fine, Mrs. James.

767
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:58,046
- My question is-
- Well, then if you can hear me fine,

768
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:00,783
if you don't have a hearing aid,
I suggest you get one.

769
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:02,347
- Well, because-
- Excuse me!

770
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:03,517
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:05,754
To ask me...

772
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:11,358
"were we concerned"
is complete insanity.

773
00:58:21,411 --> 00:58:26,747
By virtue of the fact that MOVE
had construction on the roof...

774
00:58:26,817 --> 00:58:29,718
that was commonly
referred to as the bunker,

775
00:58:29,786 --> 00:58:35,816
that gave them complete command
of the Osage Avenue,

776
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:38,827
access over the roofs...

777
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:43,664
they were in an enviable tactical position.

778
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:47,161
The water cannon used
during the MOVE standoff today...

779
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:50,900
shoots an estimated
1,000 gallons of water a minute.

780
00:58:50,974 --> 00:58:53,875
Sources say the purpose
of the water is threefold.

781
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:56,845
First, to disorient
the people inside the house.

782
00:58:56,913 --> 00:59:01,748
Secondly, the water increases humidity,
which makes tear gas more effective.

783
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:06,482
Thirdly, the powerful water pressure
could cause the house to collapse.

784
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:13,987
If that plan relied solely on the ability
of our equipment to knock the bunker off,

785
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:18,228
they knew very clearly up front
that we could not guarantee that, sir.

786
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,546
Chris, I saw Police Commissioner
Gregore Sambor about 45 minutes ago,

787
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:37,712
and he described his men
as, quote, "taking a break now."

788
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:40,557
They're obviously somewhat
startled by the way that

789
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:43,350
MOVE'S building at 62 and
Osage was fortified...

790
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:47,920
and able to take the water barrage and the
bullets that flew in there this morning.

791
00:59:47,998 --> 00:59:49,590
Thousands of rounds spun off.

792
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:52,635
Larry, for the first time,
it's been quiet for several hours here.

793
00:59:52,702 --> 00:59:54,789
The police helicopter did
go back up, and I guess

794
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:56,900
they wanted to take a look
at the top of the bunker.

795
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:59,430
We had reports-What you
see in front there,

796
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:01,910
the yellow tarp is the front
of that building,

797
01:00:01,978 --> 01:00:04,310
and we were told
that that bunker was destroyed.

798
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:05,973
But it appears that it's still there.

799
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:08,745
Okay, Harvey.
They stopped the snorkel gun now.

800
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:13,255
- There's no water on that roof.
- For some time, the water has been turned off.

801
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:15,188
At City Hall this afternoon,

802
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:17,590
Mayor Goode appeared publicly for the
first time since the siege began.

803
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:21,529
Goode said he's committed
to removing MOVE from the structure.

804
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:23,793
We intend to evict from the house.

805
01:00:23,867 --> 01:00:27,667
We intend to evacuate from the house, and
we intend to seize control of the house.

806
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:32,470
- How will you do that?
- We will do it by any means necessary.

807
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:43,275
Something is starting to happen.

808
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:46,686
There is a big-
The fire engine has fired up again.

809
01:00:46,756 --> 01:00:49,281
Its engine is on
for the first time all afternoon.

810
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,886
We just saw some police officers behind
us have their hands over their ears.

811
01:00:52,963 --> 01:00:55,693
We don't know why.
We can't hear anything at this point.

812
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:58,290
I must say that this
tiny little flurry of activity...

813
01:00:58,368 --> 01:01:01,303
is really the first bit of activity
that there's been here all afternoon.

814
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:02,861
It's been very quiet.

815
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:06,170
Police say that they have a plan.
They say it will be implemented shortly.

816
01:01:06,242 --> 01:01:08,073
We will tell you what
it is when it happens.

817
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:12,706
Reporting live from 62nd and Delancey, this
is Chris Wagner, Channel 6 Action News.

818
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:32,800
This device that was used-
You're calling it a device.

819
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:35,736
I'm calling it a bomb.
But did it ever occur to you...

820
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:38,575
that this might have
been a dangerous device

821
01:01:38,588 --> 01:01:41,368
to use in a residential
neighborhood?

822
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:43,105
Yes, ma'am.

823
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:46,342
- It did occur to you?
- Yes, ma'am.

824
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:50,509
By not vetoing it,

825
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:53,852
did you approve the plan
to use an explosive on the roof?

826
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:58,519
I think that I was fully aware
that it would, in fact, be used,

827
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:02,497
and it is my view
that you can regard that...

828
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:05,864
as an approval of using
the explosive on the roof, yes.

829
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:25,518
...right there in a 10-15 foot hover
above the roof.

830
01:02:25,588 --> 01:02:29,854
And I was right on the left-hand side
of the helicopter right here.

831
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:33,225
Onto this corner
is where I finally came to a stop.

832
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,298
You were down in the garage,
is that right?

833
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:14,325
We was down there for a while,
and then everybody came down.

834
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:18,704
- All the men came down?
- That's when the big bomb went off.

835
01:03:29,953 --> 01:03:32,217
It shook the whole house up.

836
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:38,854
Police say there has just been
a huge explosion here.

837
01:03:38,928 --> 01:03:41,829
We don't know what it means,
but it just shook the whole place.

838
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:45,459
Debris flew all over the place.
I don't know what that explosion was.

839
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:48,231
All I can tell you
is that it was a huge blast.

840
01:03:48,304 --> 01:03:49,896
Get a shot with me.
Get a sh-

841
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:52,893
- Harvey, can you hear us?
- At this point, I really can't tell you very much.

842
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:56,400
There was about a 15-second delay,
then an explosion.

843
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:58,999
Perhaps the most frightening thing here
is that police do say...

844
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:01,696
that six to eight children are believed
to be inside the MOVE house.

845
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:04,549
As soon as we find out what the
explosion is, we will try to tell you.

846
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:06,555
At this point, I simply do not know.

847
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:12,158
After the explosion, you saw that the
bunker was still there.

848
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:13,228
Yes, sir.

849
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:15,185
Did you observe any smoke
or fire on the roof?

850
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:17,165
I did not.

851
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:20,862
And-I did hear over the
radio that there was none.

852
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:50,459
It's easy to equate explosions
and explosive materials with fire.

853
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:52,023
But that's not necessarily so.

854
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:53,829
'Cause I think we've
all seen buildings

855
01:04:53,842 --> 01:04:55,581
demolished, and it's used
all the time in mining.

856
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:58,802
So I don't think you
can just logically conclude...

857
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:02,606
if you're going to have an explosion,
you're going to have a fire.

858
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:05,910
There's no more smoke. And at this
point, looking over my shoulder,

859
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:10,043
the water barrage appears
to have ended again.

860
01:05:29,038 --> 01:05:32,565
Okay, there is a new development
at the MOVE building, 62nd and Osage.

861
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:34,940
We'll go live right away
to Harvey Clarke at the scene.

862
01:05:35,011 --> 01:05:37,741
- What's going on, Harvey?
- Larry, behind me you can probably see right now-

863
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:39,577
We'll push and try
to get a little tighter shot of it-

864
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:43,608
that the satchel charge, or whatever-
the explosive or bomb...

865
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:46,211
that was dropped on the MOVE compound
just a few minutes ago...

866
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:48,519
has apparently started
a serious fire.

867
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:52,493
But the two deluge guns or sprinklers...

868
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:56,726
that they've been pumping water in
from Pine Street are not active now.

869
01:05:58,067 --> 01:06:01,559
I wanted to get the bunker.

870
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:07,474
I wanted to be able to
somehow have tactical superiority...

871
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:12,606
without sacrificing any lives,
if it were at all possible.

872
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:17,344
Commissioner Sambor said to me.

873
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:20,788
He said let's let the bunker burn...

874
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:24,759
to eliminate that high ground advantage
and the tactical advantage of the bunker.

875
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:26,317
And I said, "Yeah, okay."

876
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:28,694
it was not an order.

877
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:31,063
In essence, in communication-

878
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:35,628
I communicated to him
that I would like to let the fire burn.

879
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:51,660
Larry, this is becoming
a very emotional scene.

880
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:53,348
With me is Janice Walker.

881
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:55,948
She lives at 6217 Osage,

882
01:06:56,025 --> 01:06:58,823
- just two doors from the MOVE house.
- Yes.

883
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:00,954
And you're afraid
that your house may be on fire.

884
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,965
I'm sure it's just destroyed,
and it's just not fair.

885
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:07,560
We've been there over 20 years, and we
didn't have to have to go through this.

886
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:11,073
We only left with a few odds
and ends, you know, for the night.

887
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,007
We had no idea it was
gonna be this devastating.

888
01:07:14,077 --> 01:07:17,046
You've got innocent people that
live around there on Osage Avenue,

889
01:07:17,113 --> 01:07:18,910
and they just, you know-

890
01:07:18,981 --> 01:07:21,779
Their properties have just
gone up in smoke.

891
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:37,122
I saw initially a small fire on the roof.

892
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,169
I saw what appeared...

893
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:44,366
to be some water coming in.

894
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,000
I determined later
that that was not water at all...

895
01:07:47,076 --> 01:07:52,810
but was basically the kind of snow
on my television screen.

896
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:55,476
And after about five minutes
of watching that,

897
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:59,487
I gave what was
my first order of the day,

898
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:01,546
which was "put the fire out."

899
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:07,286
You are aware that
the mayor has testified...

900
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:12,630
that at approximately 6:00
on the evening of May 13,

901
01:08:12,702 --> 01:08:16,160
he ordered that the fire be put out.

902
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:19,072
I heard the testimony, yes, sir.

903
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:24,771
Do you know whether or not...

904
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:29,147
there had been any order
to put the fire out?

905
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:33,813
Yes, sir.

906
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:37,587
- Did you convey that order to anyone else?
- Yes, sir.

907
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,653
- To whom?
- The fire commissioner was still there.

908
01:08:42,698 --> 01:08:44,461
To whom?

909
01:08:44,534 --> 01:08:47,867
The fire commissioner was still there.

910
01:08:48,871 --> 01:08:52,363
- Those responses were Commissioner Sambor, sir?
- Yes, sir.

911
01:08:52,442 --> 01:08:53,932
I categorically deny that.

912
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:57,002
I had no knowledge
of an order to extinguish that fire.

913
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:47,194
Was there any smoke or tear gas
in the garage when you were down there?

914
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:49,754
- Or was there tear gas?
- It was smoke and tear gas.

915
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:51,322
Smoke and tear gas?

916
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,234
Did it bother you? Did it burn
your eyes or anything?

917
01:09:55,304 --> 01:09:57,033
And what did you all do?

918
01:09:57,106 --> 01:09:59,734
We was under the blanket
with our heads.

919
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:02,004
- Were all the kids under blankets?
- Mm-hmm.

920
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:04,876
- Where were the women?
- Under blankets.

921
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:08,007
They were under blankets?
Now, you said the blankets were wet.

922
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:09,073
Mm-hmm.

923
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:13,178
- How did the blankets get wet?
- 'Cause we had 'em in the bucket.

924
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:14,848
Bucket of water.

925
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:25,496
Isn't it true, Commissioner Sambor
and fire Commissioner Richmond,

926
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:32,235
that you in effect made a decision
to use fire as a weapon in this instance?

927
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:34,776
Absolutely not, sir.

928
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:42,815
Well, you made a decision to let that
fire burn until the bunker was destroyed.

929
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:44,819
- Isn't that right?
- When you talk about a weapon,

930
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:48,687
you talk about a weapon as being
used against probably individuals,

931
01:10:48,758 --> 01:10:53,354
and that was never a consideration
nor would I ever use it as a consideration.

932
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:55,659
Well, fire Commissioner Richmond,

933
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:58,700
what did you understand the police
commissioner was asking you to do?

934
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:01,236
I would respond in the same way,
Justice Kaufmann.

935
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:03,224
There is no one that I know
in city government...

936
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:06,834
that would intentionally go out there
to burn those people like that.

937
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:08,900
There's no one that I know of
could do that.

938
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:37,198
You were aware in 1978, I assume,

939
01:11:37,273 --> 01:11:40,265
that a situation had developed...

940
01:11:40,343 --> 01:11:44,507
involving certain police officers
and Delbert Africa?

941
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,172
Yes, sir.

942
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:47,738
Did you give any instructions...

943
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:50,405
as to whether or not
the officers who were

944
01:11:50,418 --> 01:11:53,016
specifically involved
in that altercation...

945
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:58,550
should or should not be included
in the operation for May 13, 1985?

946
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:00,493
I did not.

947
01:12:00,563 --> 01:12:07,332
Weren't you concerned that there
might be some revenge motive...

948
01:12:07,403 --> 01:12:11,863
which may take the police action
beyond the legal limits?

949
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,926
I think there's no question
there was, at least

950
01:12:13,939 --> 01:12:15,934
on the part of some
policemen, residual anger...

951
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:19,641
towards MOVE organization
or members thereof.

952
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,205
No question about that.

953
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,948
Would the court reporter
please swear in the witnesses?

954
01:12:27,023 --> 01:12:28,291
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth, the

955
01:12:28,304 --> 01:12:29,583
whole truth and nothing
but the truth...

956
01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:32,150
- so help you God?
- I do.

957
01:12:32,228 --> 01:12:38,030
Officer D'Ulisse, I understand that in
1978, you were present on August 8...

958
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:42,764
during an altercation
that occurred with Delbert Africa.

959
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:44,396
Yes.

960
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:46,065
And officer Mulvihill?

961
01:12:46,142 --> 01:12:49,407
What does that have to do
with May the 13th?

962
01:12:49,478 --> 01:12:51,639
The officer was tried and found
not guilty of that offense.

963
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,376
That was going to be
my next statement, Mr. Mozenter.

964
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:58,546
Officer, we understand that you were
charged in connection with that case,

965
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:01,590
and also we understand
that there was a direct

966
01:13:01,603 --> 01:13:04,582
verdict by Judge Dibona of
not guilty in that case.

967
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:06,787
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.

968
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:10,515
Stakeout police have just
taken position.

969
01:13:10,528 --> 01:13:12,757
There must be movement
somewhere in the Osage,

970
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:19,399
and they're all scattering
between 62nd and Osage and 63rd.

971
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:22,171
They're running around like
something's going on around here.

972
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:25,736
These are live pictures.
They are looking for something there.

973
01:13:25,815 --> 01:13:29,307
You can hear hollering. Where it was
coming from, Larry, I don't know.

974
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:33,277
When the fire got real heavy,

975
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:35,619
when we smelled all that smoke,
and we couldn't breathe,

976
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:39,218
then that's when we started
yelling that "kids coming out,"

977
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:45,996
and then they opened the garage door
and opened the cellar window.

978
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:47,899
What did you say?
What did you yell?

979
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,905
We were saying,
"We wanna come out!"

980
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,998
"We wanna come out?"

981
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:55,771
And what did the other children do?
Did they do the same thing?

982
01:13:55,845 --> 01:13:57,176
Yeah.

983
01:13:57,246 --> 01:14:01,683
- Were any of the children crying?
- Yeah. We all was.

984
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:07,815
- Why had you all gone to the back alley?
- To prevent the escape of MOVE members.

985
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,085
Well, what did you expect
to find in that alley,

986
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,457
the reason why you took
a machine gun back there?

987
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:16,923
I had no idea what to expect in the alley.

988
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:24,963
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...

989
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,440
- and nothing but the truth so help you God?
- I do.

990
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:35,445
Your vantage point
was to the back of 6221.

991
01:14:35,518 --> 01:14:37,145
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

992
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:39,949
All right.
Was there any time...

993
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:43,788
that you observed
either with your eyes or your ears...

994
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,350
people attempting
to come out of that house?

995
01:14:47,163 --> 01:14:51,998
I heard a female scream,
"Don't shoot. We're coming out."

996
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:55,230
At that time officer Trudel
who was at the rear window.

997
01:14:55,304 --> 01:14:57,795
Officer Trudel said,
"They're coming out."

998
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:02,581
if you look carefully,
by the way, if you can

999
01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:04,510
take a look so I can point
to the monitor here,

1000
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:08,448
right here is a line
of stakeout squad officers,

1001
01:15:08,517 --> 01:15:11,884
and they seem to be lined up at the
ready waiting for something to happen.

1002
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:15,219
They seem to be waiting for something
to come out of that house.

1003
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:18,055
You said that Rad
tried to take Tomaso out?

1004
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:19,651
Mm-hmm.

1005
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:24,597
He was on his knees, and he had
Tomaso around his stomach like that.

1006
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:27,659
On his knees?
Was he crawling along the garage floor?

1007
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:29,328
Rad was.

1008
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:45,086
Now, when they did come out,
I see the smaller child come out,

1009
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:47,019
and then an adult male
come out right behind them.

1010
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:48,351
Yeah.

1011
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:53,862
And he stood up and aimed a rifle up in the
direction of officer Bariana's position...

1012
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:56,796
and fired, like,
four or five quick shots.

1013
01:15:56,866 --> 01:15:59,164
Did Conrad
have a rifle or a gun...

1014
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:02,727
when he went out the garage door?

1015
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:04,102
Mm-mmm.

1016
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:06,232
What did he use
to open the bolt on the door?

1017
01:16:06,308 --> 01:16:07,900
A big monkey wrench.

1018
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:09,535
A big monkey wrench?

1019
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:12,638
Are you certain it was a rifle and not a
monkey wrench or something of that nature?

1020
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:16,151
No, sir. When this-
I know a rifle, believe me.

1021
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:18,550
And when this male
pointed this rifle up,

1022
01:16:18,621 --> 01:16:23,285
I- in other words, I could hear sound
and see muzzle flashes.

1023
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:27,295
Now, you say that some shooting started.
Did you hear shooting?

1024
01:16:27,363 --> 01:16:29,593
It was a-

1025
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,565
Like it was just going after-

1026
01:16:31,634 --> 01:16:35,195
Like it was going-Bullets were
going after each other. Like-

1027
01:16:35,271 --> 01:16:37,364
Bullets were going
one right after the other.

1028
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:39,464
- Something like that?
- Yeah.

1029
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:42,339
Sergeant Griffiths, could you
just by rapping on the table...

1030
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:46,279
indicate the sound the best
you can recall of those shots?

1031
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:48,373
It was not automatic fire,
if that's what you're asking.

1032
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:51,180
Okay, could you just try and indicate
for me what it sounded like?

1033
01:16:54,723 --> 01:16:58,159
Did you ever fire your weapons after the
bomb was dropped, officer Mulvihill?

1034
01:16:58,227 --> 01:16:59,717
No, sir.

1035
01:16:59,795 --> 01:17:02,821
- Officer D'Ulisse?
- No, sir.

1036
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:06,800
He had two officers taking him out,
and then they started shooting again,

1037
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:11,431
and then they brought him back in,
and then they locked the thing back up.

1038
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:18,443
Did you see the child
actually go back into the house?

1039
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:20,539
I believe the child
went back into the house.

1040
01:17:20,616 --> 01:17:22,447
All right.

1041
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:31,850
Do you have any idea why that person
may have gone back into the fire?

1042
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:34,418
My own idea? What I think?

1043
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:35,986
Yes.

1044
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:40,297
I just think
they went back into that fire...

1045
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:42,269
sort of to regroup.

1046
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:45,031
Well,

1047
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:47,507
just as a human being myself...

1048
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:52,941
I'm just trying to imagine myself
in that situation...

1049
01:17:53,015 --> 01:17:57,349
and behind me
there's a raging inferno...

1050
01:17:57,419 --> 01:18:01,788
and in front of me there are people
who are saying "come on out."

1051
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:05,250
I'm trying to imagine...

1052
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:08,990
what would cause me
to turn back and run into the fire.

1053
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:16,731
I don't think we said anything
other than come down to us.

1054
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:18,295
Come on down
with your hands up-

1055
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:24,904
the normal police jargon
for calling the suspects to come down.

1056
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,743
Mm-hmm.

1057
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,978
I'm just saying that I'm trying to
put myself in that person's skin.

1058
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:33,180
Sir, I don't think you ever could.
These were MOVE members.

1059
01:18:34,056 --> 01:18:37,890
Well, you see,

1060
01:18:38,861 --> 01:18:43,059
I knew a lot of those people...

1061
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:45,692
as individuals
and as human beings.

1062
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:48,965
A lot of people know MOVE
from what they may have seen.

1063
01:18:49,805 --> 01:18:51,932
But I had a lot of dealings with them,

1064
01:18:52,007 --> 01:18:54,805
and I knew them to be more
than MOVE people.

1065
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:59,473
I knew many of them by name,
as human beings.

1066
01:19:01,984 --> 01:19:03,645
It's probably
a rhetorical question.

1067
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,453
I don't think you, from
the way you've

1068
01:19:05,466 --> 01:19:07,226
responded, I don't think
you can answer that.

1069
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:08,779
No, sir.

1070
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,931
And then
what happened to Tomaso?

1071
01:19:22,004 --> 01:19:25,667
Rhonda was going like this on his back.

1072
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:29,035
- Rhonda had Tomaso?
- Mm-hmm.

1073
01:19:29,111 --> 01:19:32,706
And she was hitting him
on his back?

1074
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:34,715
Was he crying then?

1075
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:37,649
He had stopped crying?

1076
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:39,687
Did you hear him cry anymore...

1077
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:42,349
after she was trying to pat him
and hit him on his back?

1078
01:19:42,424 --> 01:19:44,153
Only one time.

1079
01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:46,353
- And then what happened?
- He stopped.

1080
01:19:46,428 --> 01:19:47,918
He stopped?

1081
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:56,003
And then what happened?

1082
01:19:56,071 --> 01:20:00,235
I didn't hear nobody,
and I just ran out of there.

1083
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:08,543
Oh, my goodness.

1084
01:20:09,785 --> 01:20:11,275
Well, Larry,

1085
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:15,915
the flames are probably
now leaping, um,

1086
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:18,391
uh, 10 stories high.

1087
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,297
It just looked like something
was completely engulfed.

1088
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:22,157
What you're seeing now-

1089
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:25,098
You're telling me that the flames
are now leaping high?

1090
01:20:39,148 --> 01:20:44,916
I remember Ramona coming from the rear of
the MOVE yard over the fence and down.

1091
01:20:44,987 --> 01:20:47,421
She had started
to walk down, stopped.

1092
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:49,548
And she would wave
with her hand like this.

1093
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,485
And then I see Birdie.

1094
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:56,793
The way I describe it, it looked like
he literally came through the fire.

1095
01:20:58,066 --> 01:20:59,761
There was a board on fire there,

1096
01:20:59,835 --> 01:21:03,430
and he hopped over that
and he started coming down.

1097
01:21:03,505 --> 01:21:07,202
What did you see
when you first ran out of the house?

1098
01:21:07,276 --> 01:21:08,834
I saw fire and stuff.

1099
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:10,879
You saw fire?
Where did you see the fire?

1100
01:21:10,946 --> 01:21:13,540
The tree was on fire,
and the house was.

1101
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:15,634
And the house was on fire?
How about on the ground?

1102
01:21:15,647 --> 01:21:17,676
Was anything on the
ground on fire?

1103
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:20,313
The pieces of the tree
was falling down.

1104
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:23,324
Pieces of fire from the tree
were falling down?

1105
01:21:25,894 --> 01:21:29,955
Did the adults tell you what to do
if you all got out of the house?

1106
01:21:30,032 --> 01:21:32,592
They told us to stay together.

1107
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:35,793
Ramona's up top.

1108
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:37,805
- She's on the walkway, the elevated walkway?
- That's right.

1109
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:39,602
Birdie's in the driveway.

1110
01:21:39,675 --> 01:21:43,076
Now, as they're coming down,
Ramona's a little bit in the front.

1111
01:21:43,145 --> 01:21:47,172
But at one time
does Ramona stop...

1112
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:52,881
and she goes over to the railing and
reached over and tried to pick Birdie up.

1113
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:55,685
He got I believe one foot,
maybe two, I don't know,

1114
01:21:55,757 --> 01:22:00,023
on the bottom of the concrete wall
where the fence meets.

1115
01:22:00,095 --> 01:22:01,255
Okay?

1116
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:03,525
And she either let go
or slipped or whatever.

1117
01:22:03,599 --> 01:22:05,624
But Birdie fell back.
He went back.

1118
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:09,102
And I remember he didn't get a chance
to put his hands down to break his fall.

1119
01:22:09,171 --> 01:22:11,901
The impression I was left with-
He landed square on his head.

1120
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:18,601
If you're watching somebody
or somebody falls...

1121
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,046
and you hear a thud,

1122
01:22:21,116 --> 01:22:23,175
you can almost feel it.

1123
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:25,777
That's the same sensation
I think we all got,

1124
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:28,823
that we knew Birdie
was hurt at this time.

1125
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,950
It was an actual feeling.
We could all feel it.

1126
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,704
I remember Birdie just laying there,
not doing anything.

1127
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:50,609
I said, "Tommy, here. Take my shotgun."
I said, "I'm gonna go get the kid."

1128
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,239
And I remember him saying to me,
"I'll cover you."

1129
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:55,943
- Officer Mellor saying that?
- That's right.

1130
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,254
At one point
did I start out to get Birdie,

1131
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:06,488
and that's the first time
I realized officer Tursi was behind me.

1132
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:10,520
He grabbed my left shoulder. He said,"
Don't go out there, Jim. It's a trap."

1133
01:23:10,599 --> 01:23:12,226
What was your concern, officer?

1134
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:14,599
I don't know how to explain it
other than a sixth sense or something...

1135
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:18,037
that there was something wrong
in the way Ramona went down.

1136
01:23:18,774 --> 01:23:22,335
I just felt something was incorrect
or not right about that situation.

1137
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:26,643
I stopped him from going out
right at that time. That's all.

1138
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:29,715
I was scared to death. I just didn't
wanna let that kid lay there like that.

1139
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:35,180
So what did you do?

1140
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:37,885
My priorities at that time were the kid.

1141
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:41,795
We're trying to say to him,
"Son, come over here. Come over here."

1142
01:23:41,863 --> 01:23:43,888
We're trying to get him to come to us.

1143
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:46,593
This is the result
of officer Tursi saying be careful.

1144
01:23:46,668 --> 01:23:48,323
"It's not right" or
something to that effect.

1145
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:50,001
"It doesn't feel right."

1146
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:52,097
inadvertently, Birdie gets up.

1147
01:23:53,475 --> 01:23:56,376
I remember him taking a few steps
and went down in the water.

1148
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:57,935
He fell?

1149
01:23:58,013 --> 01:23:59,952
I interpreted it as a fall
or stumble or whatever.

1150
01:23:59,965 --> 01:24:01,915
As soon as he went
down in the water,

1151
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:05,009
at the same time that I seen that,
officer Tursi's right with me.

1152
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:07,214
I said,
"Mike, I'm getting the kid,"

1153
01:24:07,289 --> 01:24:09,257
and he said,
"I got you covered."

1154
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:12,951
I remember I went in
underneath with my right hand,

1155
01:24:13,028 --> 01:24:15,758
and I scooped him
underneath his left arm.

1156
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:18,299
Was his head
submerged under the water?

1157
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:20,767
I don't remember.
As soon as he hit the water, I went.

1158
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:41,488
I remember as soon
as I scooped him up,

1159
01:24:41,556 --> 01:24:44,957
he said to me,
"Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me."

1160
01:24:56,138 --> 01:25:00,666
When the police got you
after you finally got out,

1161
01:25:00,742 --> 01:25:02,812
did they ask you anything
about whether or not

1162
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:04,906
there were any kids
still in the house...

1163
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,971
or were there any other
grown-ups still in the house?

1164
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:08,379
Yeah.

1165
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:10,884
- You said there were other kids still there?
- Mm-hmm.

1166
01:25:10,952 --> 01:25:13,887
Do you remember who it was
who was still in the house?

1167
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:16,219
Tree,

1168
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:18,122
Netta,

1169
01:25:18,193 --> 01:25:19,785
Tomaso and Melissa,

1170
01:25:19,861 --> 01:25:21,556
Phil,

1171
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:25,122
and the big people
were Theresa, Rhonda,

1172
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,168
Paul,

1173
01:25:27,235 --> 01:25:29,669
Nick...

1174
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:31,706
and Rad and C.K.

1175
01:26:08,143 --> 01:26:12,807
Ramona Africa, the MOVE spokesperson in
recent weeks, is in police custody tonight.

1176
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:15,145
She was captured
outside the MOVE compound...

1177
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:18,709
sometime after the massive fire
broke out there this afternoon.

1178
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:20,778
The child being treated
here at Children's...

1179
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:23,984
is suffering from second-and
third-degree burns on his arms and legs.

1180
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:27,379
All officials know at this point about his
identity is that his last name is Africa.

1181
01:26:28,363 --> 01:26:30,490
All night long,
an increasing number of firemen...

1182
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:33,295
have been trying to battle
what is now a six-alarm blaze.

1183
01:26:33,368 --> 01:26:36,166
There's a lot more water
being trained on it,

1184
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:39,435
but it looks as though this is going
to burn for a long, long time.

1185
01:27:05,267 --> 01:27:07,258
We had a difficult problem.

1186
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:10,203
We made a difficult decision.

1187
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:15,042
It did not turn out as we intended.

1188
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,102
As we face the coming days,

1189
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:21,580
I ask your prayers for our city,

1190
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,619
for the homeless families...

1191
01:27:24,686 --> 01:27:29,316
and for the families
of those who've lost lives.

1192
01:27:54,115 --> 01:27:56,879
In the beginning, MOVE people...

1193
01:27:56,952 --> 01:28:01,582
were the most happiest bunch
of people you could ever know.

1194
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:07,458
We were a family, peaceful, loving.

1195
01:28:07,529 --> 01:28:10,020
And in the beginning,

1196
01:28:10,098 --> 01:28:12,896
MOVE was harassed a great deal.

1197
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:19,032
We were beat many, many times.

1198
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:25,374
We were jailed
many, many times.

1199
01:28:26,681 --> 01:28:30,014
And I'm talking about a people...

1200
01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:33,680
who had feelings,

1201
01:28:33,755 --> 01:28:36,189
who are no different than you or I.

1202
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,500
If the system can convict me
of riot and conspiracy...

1203
01:28:57,579 --> 01:28:59,809
in a blatant situation like that...

1204
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:05,046
where it's obvious to everybody,
the whole world, that I did not riot,

1205
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,578
then it should not be hard
to imagine at all...

1206
01:29:08,657 --> 01:29:14,186
why and how this system convicted
nine people of murdering one cop.

1207
01:29:14,262 --> 01:29:16,059
It's the same thing,

1208
01:29:16,131 --> 01:29:19,862
that the system had one intention
in both confrontations,

1209
01:29:19,934 --> 01:29:25,031
to either kill MOVE people
or to put us in prison as long as possible.

1210
01:29:25,106 --> 01:29:26,937
It's just that simple.

1211
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:39,450
Was it like being in a war?

1212
01:29:40,588 --> 01:29:44,490
There's just too many things are going on,
to sit here and just say how you felt.

1213
01:29:44,559 --> 01:29:46,231
We felt-l thought about
the kids in the house.

1214
01:29:46,244 --> 01:29:47,926
I thought about my kids.

1215
01:29:47,996 --> 01:29:52,092
I thought about a lot of things.
But to sit here-l don't know.

1216
01:29:52,167 --> 01:29:54,158
- I couldn't answer that.
- Mm-hmm.

1217
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:58,461
I am, uh-

1218
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:03,239
I've, uh, been sitting here
listening for many days...

1219
01:30:04,746 --> 01:30:11,174
and I've read scores of pages
of reports and testimony.

1220
01:30:11,252 --> 01:30:15,086
And it has all been. All of it.

1221
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:17,681
Uh, very depressing...

1222
01:30:17,759 --> 01:30:20,023
and very discouraging...

1223
01:30:20,095 --> 01:30:23,223
except what I've read
about officer Berghaier...

1224
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:26,290
and what I've heard
from officer Berghaier.

1225
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:31,168
And if there's any hope
in this whole sorry situation,

1226
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:32,973
it's because of that officer,
and I wanna thank him.

1227
01:30:32,986 --> 01:30:34,731
Thank you, sir.

1228
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,100
I think you've done
such a good job.

1229
01:31:01,169 --> 01:31:03,160
I'm gonna stop
my questions now,

1230
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:07,299
and I wanna thank you for taking all this
time to come in here and chat with us.

1231
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:09,605
That will bring a smile
to your face, won't it?

1232
01:31:09,677 --> 01:31:11,668
And I wanna thank
your dad, Mr. Ward.

1233
01:31:11,746 --> 01:31:13,941
- Thank you very much for your cooperation.
- You're quite welcome.

1234
01:31:14,015 --> 01:31:15,983
- And Mr. Shrager, of course.
- Thank you.

1235
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:20,987
This will conclude
this deposition of testimony...

1236
01:31:21,055 --> 01:31:24,149
of Michael, uh, Ward.

1237
01:31:48,483 --> 01:31:50,474
As of today,

1238
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:54,147
you the people,
have all the principal facts...

1239
01:31:55,056 --> 01:31:57,991
which tell the story
of the Osage Avenue tragedy.

1240
01:31:59,227 --> 01:32:03,220
Rarely has any community
ever subjected itself...

1241
01:32:03,298 --> 01:32:06,096
to a public self-appraisal...

1242
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:10,433
as painful and necessary
as this has been.

1243
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:14,902
But we believe that this process
is absolutely necessary...

1244
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:19,242
to prevent such a terrible thing
from ever happening again.

1245
01:32:20,615 --> 01:32:24,415
And now I declare
these public hearings...

1246
01:32:24,485 --> 01:32:27,613
to be in recess until further notice.
