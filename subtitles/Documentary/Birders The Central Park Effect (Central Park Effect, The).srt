1
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:17,649
'If anyone finds this,
it means that my plan didn't work ...

2
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,368
... and I'm already dead.

3
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,887
- Evan?
- I think he's in here.

4
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:27,366
If I can somehow
go back to the beginning ...

5
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:30,205
... of all of this, I might be able ...
- Evan!

6
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,204
... to save her.'

7
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:36,323
Evan!

8
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,950
Evan!

9
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,788
We're gonna be
late again.

10
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:30,947
When did you ever care
about getting to school on time?

11
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,387
We're putting up pictures
for parents' night.

12
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:36,026
Don't worry,
you'll have plenty of time.

13
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:39,745
Is Dad gonna come?

14
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,585
You know the answer to that.

15
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:43,943
Can't he just
come out for one day?

16
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:45,903
We've been over this 100 times.

17
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:47,583
It's too dangerous for him.

18
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:49,742
But Lenny said
his dad's coming,

19
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,661
and Tommy
and Kayleigh's dad ...

20
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:54,220
Okay, I get the point.

21
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,140
But I'm not so bad, am I?

22
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,819
No.

23
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,096
Okay, have a great day.

24
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:15,375
I love you.
I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.

25
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,974
Bye.

26
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,412
Bye!

27
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,611
Mrs. Treborn, I need
to speak with you.

28
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,890
Can it wait till tonight?
I'm late for work and ...

29
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,490
I think you really
need to see this.

30
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,288
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.

31
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:38,447
Don't make me send you
to Mr. Voytek's office.

32
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,807
I was gonna show this
to the principal,

33
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:43,607
but I thought I should
talk to you first.

34
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:44,806
What is it?

35
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:46,805
Yesterday I had all the children
make drawings

36
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:48,645
of what they wanted to be
when they grew up.

37
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:51,004
Most of them made drawings
of what their parents did.

38
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:52,684
But this ...

39
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,041
I don't understand.

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,080
Evan did this?

41
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:11,038
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.

42
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,918
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs. Treborn,

43
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:15,957
- I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?

44
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:17,837
When I asked Evan
about the drawing,

45
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,436
well, he couldn't
remember doing it.

46
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:31,513
I don't wanna go.

47
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,031
I don't like this place, Mum.

48
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:36,951
I think it's creepy.

49
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,390
I promise I won't
make any bad pictures.

50
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,670
You're gonna be fine, okay?

51
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,148
He just wants to do
a couple tests, that's all.

52
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,348
- Oh.
- You'll like him.

53
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:53,067
That's good.
You're doing great.

54
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:56,145
Just tell me he hasn't inherited
his father's illness.

55
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,505
I'm sure the test results
will come back negative.

56
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:01,104
But there's something else you can do
to monitor his memory.

57
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:03,823
- Anything.
- A journal.

58
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,183
Just have him write down
everything that he does.

59
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,902
- And what will that do?
- It could help jog his memory.

60
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:11,661
See if he remembers
anything new the next day.

61
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,060
These test results
will come back in a few days

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
- and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.

63
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,579
'Today Mummy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

64
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:23,578
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

65
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,456
Great, see you soon.

66
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,413
Evan ...

67
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:44,412
Evan, what are you doing
with that knife?

68
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,369
What happened?

69
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:56,608
Honey ...

70
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,808
what were you doing
with that knife?

71
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,566
I don't remember.

72
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:15,962
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.

73
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,001
Hello, little man.

74
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:20,121
Watch your step.

75
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,760
Thanks, George.

76
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,558
- Not a problem.
- Here's my work number

77
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,279
in case there are
any problems.

78
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,718
And please keep
an eye on him 'cause ...

79
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,197
What, are you kidding?

80
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:36,476
We're going to have
a great time today, right, sport?

81
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:38,996
Okay, be good, kiddo.

82
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:40,355
I love you.

83
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:41,795
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.

84
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,034
Go long. Go on.
Right in the backyard.

85
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,434
Here it comes.

86
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:51,352
Evan, Evan, guess what?
Dad got a new video camera

87
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,232
and we're all going
to be in a movie.

88
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,271
That's right, Evan.

89
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:58,550
And you get to be the star.

90
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,150
I thought I was the star.

91
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,429
Hey, what did I tell you?

92
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,468
Now, Evan ...

93
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,747
You have to promise

94
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:10,306
your bestest,
super-duper promise

95
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,586
that this will be
our little secret.

96
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,745
- You think you can do that?
- Um-hmm.

97
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,185
I'm r ...

98
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,822
Where am I?

99
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,542
Where did we all go?

100
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,501
Calm down, kid, stand still.

101
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,221
I was just somewhere else.

102
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:32,741
How did I get here?

103
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,779
Quit acting like some damn retard,
or I'll call your mother

104
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:38,739
and tell her what a naughty
little shit you've been.

105
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:42,138
Kayleigh ...

106
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,257
Kayleigh ...

107
00:07:44,337 --> 00:07:46,616
what happened?

108
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:58,853
The good news is
the results are negative.

109
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,772
I found no evidence of lesions,

110
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:02,132
haemorrhaging, tumours.

111
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,451
But you must have
something you can go on.

112
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:07,330
If I was to guess, I'd say
the blackouts are stress related.

113
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,370
But he's seven years old.

114
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,969
What kind of stress
can a seven-year-old have?

115
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:14,808
Plenty. Maybe he has
severe coping problems

116
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,447
about not having a father.

117
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,687
You said the last time
the blackouts occurred

118
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,527
he was visiting
his friend's dad.

119
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:25,685
Well, he has been pushing me
to meet his father

120
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:29,084
- and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.

121
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,323
We can arrange
a controlled meeting.

122
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:34,682
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security,

123
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,682
Evan comes in
for a quick visit,

124
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,322
and with a little luck,

125
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,720
no more
missing father complex.

126
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
'April 15th.

127
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,518
Today I get to meet my father.

128
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:51,397
His name is Jason
and he's crazy.

129
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:53,637
I hope he lets me
call him Dad.'

130
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,436
You mean Dad lives here?

131
00:08:58,515 --> 00:09:00,395
Not in this wing, actually, no.

132
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,275
Now if your dad seems
a little sleepy,

133
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:04,434
it's because
of the medicine, okay?

134
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:05,753
Okay.

135
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:10,352
It'll just be a moment, okay?

136
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:42,462
It's okay. I won't bite.

137
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:46,142
You've seen pictures
of me, right?

138
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:49,261
Uh-huh. Mum says
I have your smile

139
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,660
and your hair.

140
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,339
Nooo!

141
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:59,418
He has to die!
It's the only way!

142
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,897
Jason, stop!

143
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,377
No!

144
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:08,016
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.

145
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:10,855
He's hurt bad.
Get a stretcher.

146
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,214
- Come on, let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

147
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:16,533
In sure and certain hope

148
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,932
of the resurrection
to eternal life,

149
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:22,012
we commend to almighty God,
our brother Jason.

150
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,370
The Lord bless him
and keep him,

151
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,090
the Lord make his face
to shine upon him,

152
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,289
and be gracious unto him

153
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:32,208
and give him peace. Amen.

154
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:12,677
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.

155
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,116
Tommy, I'm bored shitless
over here. What's up already?

156
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,036
Yeah, what are you
looking for, anyway?

157
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:20,234
Shut up, lard arse. And you,
hold your fucking horses.

158
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:22,314
You know,
it's here somewhere.

159
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:24,513
We should go soon.

160
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:27,153
If dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

161
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:29,512
So let's go.

162
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,191
I knew Dad had
a blockbuster down here!

163
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,150
Let's blow the shit
out of something.

164
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,467
Here you go, buddy.

165
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,026
What? No freaking way.

166
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:51,905
- I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

167
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:54,624
Any of us does it and you're gonna
puss out and nark for sure.

168
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:57,344
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.

169
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,743
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

170
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,942
There you go.

171
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,381
It should buy you
two minutes at least.

172
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,981
Gee thanks, friend.

173
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:20,417
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.

174
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,733
- Thanks.
- You got balls, man.

175
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:36,652
Shit took you long enough.

176
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,245
What the hell? Come on!

177
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:07,203
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up!

178
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:09,443
Evan, get your arse back here
and help me get him up.

179
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,123
What the hell happened?
Where are we?

180
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,122
Oh my God.
What did we do?

181
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:15,681
Evan, come on. Help me.

182
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,841
Oh my God, how could we?

183
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:20,400
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?

184
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,080
He's fine.
He's gonna be okay.

185
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,919
Everything's gonna be fine.

186
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:26,118
What's wrong with him?
Why isn't he speaking?

187
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:27,918
He's in shock, ma'am.

188
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,836
What is it?
What happened?

189
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,916
We were just in the woods
building a fort

190
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,115
when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay,

191
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:40,315
and then he just froze up.
Right, guys?

192
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:42,594
What happened, Evan?
The truth.

193
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,633
I don't know.
I don't remember.

194
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:47,672
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.

195
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,951
I blacked it out.

196
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,871
Don't try to use your blackouts
to get out of this one.

197
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,348
You're not making it up?

198
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,746
I don't know.

199
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:12,625
They're keeping him
overnight for observation.

200
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,225
Uh-huh.

201
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,984
I just don't know
what to do with him.

202
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:23,982
'The last thing
I remember before the blackout

203
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,741
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

204
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,781
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

205
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,060
than the mailbox
across the street.

206
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,059
Mum thinks that hypnosis
might be a good way to remember.'

207
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,254
Damn it.

208
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:49,717
Breathe in and breathe out.

209
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:51,396
And relax.

210
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:54,516
You are completely asleep.

211
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:56,155
Relaxed.

212
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,035
I want you to take me
to the time

213
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:01,393
you were in the woods
with Lenny.

214
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,673
Think of it like a movie.

215
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:06,112
You can pause, rewind,

216
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:09,511
or slow down
any details you wish.

217
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,911
Understand?

218
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,470
Yes.

219
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,469
Where are you now?

220
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:19,828
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.

221
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:22,347
My hands are over her ears.

222
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:23,947
Are you hurting her?

223
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:26,746
No, I'm protecting her.

224
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:28,746
Okay.

225
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:32,624
Now let's move forward in time.
What do you see?

226
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,903
I see a car.

227
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,462
Yes, Evan,
tell me about the car.

228
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,381
Go on.

229
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:47,740
Nothing can hurt you.

230
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,898
Remember, it's only a movie.
You are completely safe.

231
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,298
I can't ...

232
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:57,338
The car vanishes
and all of a sudden

233
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,217
I'm on the ground
in the woods.

234
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:00,617
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.

235
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:03,616
The movie in your head
is broken, that's all.

236
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:05,695
Now tell me about the car.

237
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,294
I can't!

238
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,734
It's coming ...

239
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,773
Fight it, Evan, hurry.

240
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,692
It's coming!

241
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,612
- Oh my God!
- On the count of 10,

242
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,411
- you'll wake up feeling refreshed ...
- What are you doing?

243
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:20,970
... and remembering everything
that we talked about.

244
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,451
What is happening?
Make it stop!

245
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,089
One, you're feeling awake. Two,
your eyes are not feeling as heavy.

246
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,449
- Five, six.
- Wake up!

247
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:30,368
- Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10.
- Wake up!

248
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,287
Oh God.

249
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:38,886
What happened?

250
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,325
Did it work?

251
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,362
Alright, thanks, Mum.
See you later.

252
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,560
Wipe that sad-arse look
off your face

253
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,279
before you get us busted.

254
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,519
Did you see the way Evan's mum
was looking at you?

255
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,358
Sorry.

256
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:10,876
Alright, will someone
tell me already

257
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,756
what the hell happened
with the mailbox?

258
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,315
Don't you ever
bring that shit up again.

259
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,474
Not ever!

260
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,792
Let's go.

261
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,311
Are you okay?

262
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,306
Holy shit!

263
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,266
Look at that fat fuck!

264
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:50,425
He's got bigger titties
than Lenny's mum.

265
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,304
- Shhh!
- Shut up, faggot.

266
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,743
No one's talking to you.

267
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:20,856
I'm sorry, Kayleigh,
this was a bad idea.

268
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:24,135
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

269
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:27,374
You're so lucky.

270
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:29,094
Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

271
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:32,213
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.

272
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:34,972
Sorry.

273
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,211
It's not your fault.
Mrs. Kagan called Dad

274
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,051
and blamed us
for what happened to Lenny.

275
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,130
Your dad did that?

276
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,969
- I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?

277
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,088
What you deserve is
a better father and brother.

278
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,407
All they do is
make you feel like shit.

279
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,486
You really have no clue
how beautiful you are, do you?

280
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,323
What the fuck are you doing?!

281
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:10,002
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?

282
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:13,201
- Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.

283
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:16,320
- He's a little punk.
- Why are you being such a dick?

284
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,238
I can't believe
what you just did.

285
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:29,756
Stop it!

286
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:31,156
Stop hitting him.

287
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,115
What's wrong with you?

288
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:37,394
Somebody, please help us.

289
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:40,194
Alright, that's it, kid.
You're out of here.

290
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:47,191
Get him away! Get him away!

291
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:50,550
Now in another story,
the peaceful town of Briarville

292
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,230
was rocked this afternoon

293
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,709
in the wake of a horrible
act of vandalism.

294
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:57,268
While police officials
in upstate New York believe

295
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,987
this was a simple act
of criminal mischief gone awry,

296
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:03,147
the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.

297
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:06,665
Now this was the grisly aftermath
of a powerful explosion

298
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:10,185
believed to have been caused
by an unknown quantity of dynamite.

299
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:14,024
The police have no leads,
no suspects and no motive ...

300
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,658
Good night.

301
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:44,015
We're moving.

302
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,089
I can't believe
Tommy's still pissed at me.

303
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,408
He knows
I'm moving away, right?

304
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,808
He's been acting
real strange lately.

305
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:10,367
He won't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

306
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,287
Duck, here they come!

307
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:20,565
Did your mum say
if Lenny was okay?

308
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:25,603
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

309
00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:50,035
Welcome home.

310
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:52,595
I thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.

311
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:56,634
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

312
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:08,310
So, what'd you do in there?

313
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,589
It was awful.
You can't sleep because

314
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,669
everybody's screaming
all night long.

315
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:16,309
I never want to go back.

316
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:17,748
Do you see that?

317
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,787
Yeah, what's up
with the smoke?

318
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,940
Crockett!

319
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,620
What are you doing
with my dog?!

320
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:53,057
- Look what you made me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?!

321
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:10,533
Kayleigh. Oh, God, come on,
please wake up.

322
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:13,212
Wake up, please!
Wake up!

323
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:15,931
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

324
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:28,807
Ow.

325
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,366
How long was I out?

326
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:37,645
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

327
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,522
Oh shit.

328
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:35,388
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,860
Aced it.

330
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,299
And time.
Put your pencils down

331
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,658
and place your bluebooks
on my desk before you leave.

332
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:13,337
You too, Mr. Nelson. We're all
in the same time-zone, here.

333
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,177
So how'd you do, Evan?

334
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,816
I don't know. I might have got
some of the stories mixed up.

335
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:21,135
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

336
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:25,974
Typical psych major,
a complete wise-arse.

337
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:27,613
And how's your project coming?

338
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:30,332
Are you still planning to change
the way we humble scientists

339
00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:33,691
- view memory assimilation?
- Don't really have a choice.

340
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:04,682
Oh, jeez, it smells like
patchouli and arse in here.

341
00:27:04,762 --> 00:27:08,041
Cricket, this is my well-mannered
roommate, Evan.

342
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:09,641
Yeah ...

343
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,760
you're the one
that fucked up the bell curve

344
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:13,640
on my anthropology final.

345
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,599
- Later, Thumper.
- Bye.

346
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,798
Fucking dick.

347
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:20,398
- Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro'.

348
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,397
Oh, you sick fuck.

349
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:28,236
Alright, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

350
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,555
Why, what'd you do,
ace another midterm?

351
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:32,314
No.

352
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,233
Better than that,
seven years, no blackouts.

353
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:40,432
Fuck yeah, bro',
let's do this!

354
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:42,392
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Come and get it.

355
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:45,631
Be gentle with me! Be gentle!
I'm postcoital. I'm tender.

356
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,870
Did she cradle the balls
and work the shaft?

357
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,828
Nice.

358
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:57,947
Look at this fucking guy.

359
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:01,146
Get the fuck out of my bar.

360
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:03,385
So, which one of you
has the pet worm?

361
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:05,945
Worms, plural!

362
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:08,824
Ah. That's so gross.

363
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,863
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.

364
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:14,422
Watch it.
It's a psych project actually.

365
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:16,182
It's a study on memory loss.

366
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,341
Better explain before all this excitement
gives me a heart attack.

367
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,779
10 bucks says he
eats it off the floor.

368
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,218
Well, if I can figure out

369
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,498
how the memories
in a simple worm function,

370
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:31,897
it should help me to understand
the complexities ...

371
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:35,416
of the human brain.

372
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,816
Let me get this shot.

373
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:48,093
- What the fuck, weirdo?!
- Fuck this ...

374
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,329
Well, I guess
that's your game.

375
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,729
Go, you go.

376
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,206
It smells like sex in here.

377
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:14,765
Yeah, Thumper had
a busy afternoon.

378
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:18,804
You're kidding?
He's so big.

379
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:20,683
Yeah.

380
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:24,362
Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

381
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:28,201
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

382
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,839
You got any incense or scented candles
or something?

383
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,398
Okay.

384
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,478
Whoa, no.

385
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,277
Let me put this away.

386
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:44,557
Most guys usually tuck porn
under their bed.

387
00:29:44,636 --> 00:29:46,436
All you've got
are comp books?

388
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,155
Yeah, they're my journals.

389
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:50,395
I've been keeping them
since I was seven.

390
00:29:50,474 --> 00:29:51,554
Wow.

391
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:56,873
Read me something.

392
00:29:56,953 --> 00:29:59,232
I ought to be getting
something out of this.

393
00:29:59,312 --> 00:30:01,151
That's all I've got to say.

394
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,350
Here we go.

395
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,510
'It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing.'

396
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:17,387
' ... Hearing Crockett
make those awful screams.

397
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:26,304
Just writing about it
gives me the shivers.'

398
00:30:28,423 --> 00:30:31,183
Come on. Go on.

399
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:38,700
'It was like Tommy
was possessed or something.

400
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,140
There was a hate
in his eyes that ... '

401
00:30:48,658 --> 00:30:50,018
Are you okay?

402
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,015
Where am I?

403
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,934
What the hell's going on?

404
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:14,010
I can't get it open!

405
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:17,650
Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep.

406
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:24,768
Uhh! I got him, Lenny.
Save Crockett!

407
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:34,844
Listen to me, Evan,
and you listen to me good.

408
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:37,124
There's a million
other sisters in the world,

409
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:39,563
so why'd you have
to fuck with mine?

410
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,721
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

411
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:48,960
Uh-huh ...

412
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,839
it didn't feel like a dream.

413
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,639
Maybe because
they never do.

414
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,518
So, Don Juan, you pass out
on all your dates?

415
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:32,467
Lenny ...

416
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:34,387
hey, I've got a surprise for you.

417
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,466
You're never gonna
guess who's here.

418
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:39,986
Hey, it's me ... Evan.

419
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:17,175
What are you working on there?
A model?

420
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:21,574
Look, uh ...

421
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:23,173
I can see that you're busy,

422
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:25,492
so I'll try to make this quick.

423
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:28,252
Remember, uh ...

424
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:30,171
that day at the junkyard

425
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:32,450
when we were kids?

426
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:35,530
I was just hoping that you
could help me remember.

427
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,568
Like, just any details about it or ...

428
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:46,527
I couldn't cut the rope.

429
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:48,846
Yeah ...

430
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,605
that's good. Um ...

431
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:54,364
anything else?

432
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:01,362
'Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep! '

433
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:06,161
Uh ...

434
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,839
Jesus Christ.

435
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:17,998
It really happened.

436
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:20,477
Wow, uh ...

437
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:22,516
Wow, Lenny, l ...

438
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:27,035
'Make one peep

439
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:30,874
and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker.'

440
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:06,143
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

441
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:08,343
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

442
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:10,862
I think I was more
focused on her hands

443
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,261
on mine
than on the mailbox ...

444
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:17,660
across the street.'

445
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:31,336
Maybe it went out,
should someone check it?

446
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,496
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

447
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:44,892
You make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

448
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:51,251
Ugh!

449
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,410
Fuck!

450
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,888
What's this?
Huh? What's this?

451
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,247
Want to get the mail?

452
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:09,165
How's my sweet girl?

453
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:11,245
How's my sweet girl?

454
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:13,484
You need a change,
don't you, honey?

455
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:15,244
You wanna open it?

456
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:17,483
You wanna open it?

457
00:36:19,282 --> 00:36:21,282
- Oh my God!
- Holy shit!

458
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:23,401
Run!

459
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,601
Fuck, Lenny, come on!

460
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:27,720
Lenny, come on!

461
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,679
Come on, Lenny, let's go!

462
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:37,557
No, baby. That's my finger
in your arse.

463
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:45,995
Christ, man.

464
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:48,034
Fuckin' brutal!

465
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,434
What the ... ?

466
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,592
- Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?

467
00:36:57,671 --> 00:37:00,790
Mrs. Kagan, um,
it's Evan ... Treborn.

468
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,270
I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.

469
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:07,029
Yeah, I'm ... look,
I'm really sorry about that.

470
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:09,588
It took me over an hour
to clean up the mess you made.

471
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:12,027
Can I just talk to Lenny?

472
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:14,227
Don't call here.

473
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:23,744
Mum.

474
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,303
I can't help it.
I'm just so proud of you.

475
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:29,582
Hey, did ... did Dad ...

476
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:32,141
Did Jason get good grades?

477
00:37:32,222 --> 00:37:34,941
Please, he got straight As
without ever touching a book.

478
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,380
It was the one area
his memory never failed him.

479
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,819
Did he ever say that he, like ...

480
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,858
figured out a way to recall
his lost memories

481
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:46,897
like years after he blacked them out
in the first place?

482
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:50,216
- Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being

483
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:51,816
you know, such a brain and all

484
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,415
it's like, you would think
that he would figure out

485
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:56,735
a way to remember
stuff that he forgot.

486
00:37:56,814 --> 00:37:58,894
Well, when he was your age ...

487
00:37:58,973 --> 00:38:01,293
almost exactly your age
come to think of it,

488
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:05,012
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

489
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:07,211
I couldn't tell
if they were real memories

490
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,291
or just his imagination.

491
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,529
Then, just before
it got so bad, he ...

492
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:16,648
had to be institutionalised,

493
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,928
he said he could ...

494
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:22,567
What?

495
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:24,407
What?

496
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,566
What ... what did he do?

497
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:29,645
Forget it.

498
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:32,844
It's nothing.
He was far too sick by then.

499
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:40,642
Come on, Mum, what did he
say that he could do?

500
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:44,720
What do you say, as a goof?

501
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,160
No, Mum, come on.

502
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,520
Come on, yourself ...
it'll be fun.

503
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,399
Alright, it's your dime.

504
00:39:01,476 --> 00:39:03,036
Give me your hand, young man.

505
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:05,315
- This is supposed to be your trick.
- Uh-uh.

506
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:11,873
- Evan!
- What?

507
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:14,752
Have you ever had
your palm read before?

508
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:18,071
No, this is the first time,
so be gentle please.

509
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,711
What?

510
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,750
You have no lifeline.

511
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,909
You don't belong here.

512
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:29,067
For an extra five bucks
she'll spit in your face, Mum.

513
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:33,506
- No, really, what's his future?
- He has no soul!

514
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,305
You were never meant to be.

515
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:43,944
Psychic, huh?

516
00:39:44,023 --> 00:39:46,823
This won't come as much
of a shock to you.

517
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,660
Thank you.

518
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,577
When did you start
smoking again?

519
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,296
Lay off, Evan.

520
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,335
Hey?

521
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:14,814
What ...

522
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:19,813
You're not gonna let that old hag
ruin the rest of our time together?

523
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:22,573
She's nuts, she's a lunatic.

524
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,212
That's like an act.

525
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:26,051
- They just do that ...
- I know.

526
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,891
I'm sorry,
she just hit a nerve.

527
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,609
Well ... why?

528
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:38,048
I don't get it.

529
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,767
Before you were born,
I was pregnant twice,

530
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:43,247
and they were both stillbirths.

531
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:52,124
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

532
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:57,762
It's not something
I like to remember.

533
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:01,721
And then when I was
pregnant with you,

534
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:05,759
I was terrified.
I had to expect the worst.

535
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:12,838
- And?
- And you came out fine.

536
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,996
And ever since then, I've considered you
my little miracle baby.

537
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:27,953
Don't cry.

538
00:41:28,034 --> 00:41:29,953
Come on, let's go.
It's late.

539
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,029
'I never wanted to be
in the movie, anyway.

540
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:47,268
I was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

541
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:49,268
Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

542
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:51,187
What the fuck are you doing?

543
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:53,746
Shhh, I need quiet for this.

544
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:56,266
Are you stupid or what, man?

545
00:41:56,345 --> 00:41:58,944
Maybe there's a reason
you repressed the day

546
00:41:59,024 --> 00:42:01,384
some pervert had you
in your tighty whities.

547
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:06,263
I'd think twice
about what you're doing.

548
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:08,702
You could wake up a lot more
fucked up than you are now.

549
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:11,181
- More fucked up than I already am?
- No, l ...

550
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:13,221
You think you know me?
I don't know me!

551
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,889
Whoa!

552
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,688
I'm sorry.

553
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:55,768
No, it's my fault.

554
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:57,967
Can we get through
one damn day

555
00:42:58,047 --> 00:42:59,647
without you
breaking something?

556
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,159
Hey.

557
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:32,358
Evan.

558
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:37,036
Oh my God.
It's been a long time.

559
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,715
How you been?

560
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:43,274
Same old, same old,
you know?

561
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:46,034
No, I don't know.
Fill me in.

562
00:43:46,113 --> 00:43:48,873
Uhh, well ...

563
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:51,272
I'm going to State now.

564
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:53,592
It's going good.
My Mum's good.

565
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:56,791
- I don't know.
- You want a smoke?

566
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:59,110
- No, not since we were kids.
- No?

567
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,870
I've quit like 100 times.

568
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:07,868
- Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.

569
00:44:07,947 --> 00:44:10,147
- Can I walk you?
- Sure.

570
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:14,986
- Oh my God.
- So ...

571
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:19,704
how's Tommy?

572
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,622
Well, they kept him
in juvie for a few years,

573
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,461
but now he's working
over at Dale's Auto Body.

574
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,500
That's good.

575
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,860
Still living with your dad?

576
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,979
No.

577
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:38,659
I emancipated myself at 15.

578
00:44:40,698 --> 00:44:42,537
Must've taken a lot of courage.

579
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:44,977
Not if you remember my dad.

580
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:50,935
Well, couldn't you have just
moved in with your mum?

581
00:44:51,975 --> 00:44:53,774
No, she had a new family.

582
00:44:53,854 --> 00:44:55,733
Wasn't enough room.

583
00:44:55,814 --> 00:44:57,413
Whatever.

584
00:44:57,493 --> 00:45:00,132
Well look, the reason
I came back to town

585
00:45:00,212 --> 00:45:01,772
was to talk to you.

586
00:45:01,851 --> 00:45:03,931
To me? Why?

587
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,970
Well ...

588
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,249
remember when we were kids

589
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,889
and I used to have
those blackouts?

590
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:14,728
Yeah, of course.

591
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:18,527
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

592
00:45:18,607 --> 00:45:21,127
And I just ...
I wanted to talk to you

593
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:23,245
about one of them in particular.

594
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:25,485
Well, I'll try to remember.

595
00:45:29,404 --> 00:45:31,684
When we were kids, uh ...

596
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,843
your dad was making a movie

597
00:45:33,922 --> 00:45:36,842
about Robin Hood ... something.

598
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:39,161
What do you want
to know, Evan?!

599
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,240
Is ... did he ...

600
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:49,158
What happened
in the basement?

601
00:45:49,238 --> 00:45:51,118
Look, it was a long time ago.

602
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,756
I know.

603
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:57,156
Is that why you came
all the way back here?

604
00:45:57,236 --> 00:45:59,955
To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?

605
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:02,434
No, l ...

606
00:46:02,514 --> 00:46:05,713
I just think that something really bad
might have happened.

607
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:08,073
Is there a point
to any of this?

608
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:12,632
Look, whatever happened
it wasn't our fault.

609
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:15,670
We were kids. I mean, there was nothing
that we could do to deserve ...

610
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,870
Just shut up, Evan!

611
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,909
You're wasting your breath.

612
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:22,749
You can't hate yourself 'cause
your dad's a twisted freak.

613
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:26,347
Who are you trying
to convince, Evan?

614
00:46:26,428 --> 00:46:28,587
You come all the way back here
to stir up my shit

615
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,826
just because you have
a bad memory?

616
00:46:30,906 --> 00:46:33,306
What, do you want me to just cry
on your shoulder

617
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:35,585
and tell you everything's
all better now?

618
00:46:35,664 --> 00:46:37,744
Well, fuck you, Evan!

619
00:46:37,824 --> 00:46:40,183
Nothing's all better, okay?

620
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,183
Nothing ever gets better.

621
00:46:45,582 --> 00:46:48,261
You know, if I was
so wonderful, Evan,

622
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:50,141
why didn't you call me?

623
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,580
Why did you just
leave me here to rot?

624
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:11,375
When he was your age ... almost exactly
your age, come to think of it ...

625
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,494
he said he figured out a way
to remember his past.

626
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:20,052
Some dude left
a message for you.

627
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,451
You can smell that all the way
to the bathroom.

628
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,450
Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.

629
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,449
I just wondered why you didn't
hand in your essay this afternoon.

630
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:33,168
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.

631
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,926
What'd you say
to my sister, motherfucker?

632
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,965
Last night she cried on the phone
for over an hour to me.

633
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:44,964
She said you came
and saw her last night.

634
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:46,684
She ...

635
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,564
she fucking
killed herself tonight.

636
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:51,563
She's dead ...

637
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:54,362
and so are you!

638
00:49:09,141 --> 00:49:11,060
'If the scar on my stomach

639
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,139
didn't just come out of nowhere,

640
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,739
maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as everyone thought.

641
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:20,977
If I can make scars, do I have
the power to heal them?

642
00:49:23,016 --> 00:49:25,296
What about Kayleigh's scars? '

643
00:49:30,574 --> 00:49:33,613
'I never wanted
to be in the movie, anyway.

644
00:49:33,693 --> 00:49:38,292
It was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

645
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:44,211
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

646
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:57,526
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.

647
00:49:57,607 --> 00:50:00,006
It'll look more like
a dungeon down there.

648
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,644
A little light here.

649
00:50:04,725 --> 00:50:06,804
Huh?

650
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:11,163
Hey, now what did I tell you
about keeping that door shut?

651
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,762
But I wanna see.

652
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,321
You're going to see the back of my fist
in about two seconds

653
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:17,201
if you don't do what I tell you.

654
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,680
Now, in this part of the story,

655
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:24,999
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian

656
00:50:25,078 --> 00:50:28,118
and they have to kiss and stuff,

657
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:30,157
like the grown-ups do.

658
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:32,557
So, take off
your clothes, Kayleigh.

659
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:38,355
Come on, just like
when we take a bath.

660
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,754
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.

661
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:45,913
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.

662
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:48,352
Put your hands on your ears.

663
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:53,030
What time is it?

664
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:57,269
It's time for you to do
what I tell you to do.

665
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,308
Wrong answer, fuckbag!

666
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,028
This is the very moment
of your reckoning.

667
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:05,147
In the next 30 seconds, you're going
to open up one of two doors.

668
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:08,706
The first door will forever
traumatise your own flesh and blood.

669
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:11,385
What ... what's happening?

670
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:13,585
How are you doing this?

671
00:51:13,664 --> 00:51:15,744
It'll change your daughter

672
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,623
from a beautiful child

673
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:19,863
into an empty shell

674
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,742
whose only concept of trust

675
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:25,101
was betrayed by her own
sick paedophile father!

676
00:51:25,181 --> 00:51:26,981
Ultimately ...

677
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:28,740
it'll lead to her suicide.

678
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,300
- Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?

679
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,819
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George!

680
00:51:34,898 --> 00:51:37,818
Your other option is
to treat Kayleigh like ...

681
00:51:37,897 --> 00:51:40,177
say like a loving father
treats his daughter.

682
00:51:41,456 --> 00:51:43,376
Sound okay to you, Papa?

683
00:51:44,576 --> 00:51:45,615
Yes.

684
00:51:45,696 --> 00:51:48,295
Listen close then, fuckbag.

685
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,094
You screw this up again,

686
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:52,814
I'll flat out castrate you.

687
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:57,492
What you need to do
is discipline your son Tommy,

688
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,171
because the kid
is one sadistic pup.

689
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:02,690
One last thing.

690
00:52:09,568 --> 00:52:11,447
Don't ever touch me again!

691
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:14,807
L ... I won't.

692
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:35,521
Ahhh!

693
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,400
Faster, faster!

694
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,599
Crockett!

695
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:44,238
Kayleigh, I can't believe
you came!

696
00:52:45,518 --> 00:52:47,118
I think you got one.

697
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,917
Check out our new house.

698
00:52:50,997 --> 00:52:53,075
- Forever.
- Hell or high water.

699
00:52:57,795 --> 00:52:59,434
Honey, are you alright?

700
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:04,353
Oh my god, Evan,
you're bleeding.

701
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:06,911
Kayleigh, you're still ... You ...

702
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,190
Incredible.

703
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,749
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up
and come back to bed.

704
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:20,388
Ohh. Where are my clothes?

705
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:22,547
Those are your clothes, silly.

706
00:53:29,145 --> 00:53:30,505
The bathroom is ...

707
00:53:36,024 --> 00:53:38,863
Hurry up. I want a quickie
before school.

708
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,372
What?

709
00:54:18,971 --> 00:54:20,571
Unfucking believable.

710
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:22,970
Alright.

711
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:25,289
I wish I could get as excited
over a nosebleed.

712
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,728
Sorry, uh, I didn't
see you there.

713
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:33,887
What?

714
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,886
You're the girl that
was with those arseholes

715
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:38,965
throwing popcorn at Thumper.

716
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:40,965
What?

717
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:43,724
And your name is Gwen.

718
00:54:43,804 --> 00:54:45,243
I know you.

719
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:49,562
Seriously, Evan,
lay off the blow.

720
00:54:53,601 --> 00:54:55,361
- Hi.
- Hi.

721
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:02,678
Hey, um ...

722
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:05,358
don't freak out
when I ask you this, but ...

723
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:09,956
do you remember when your dad
got that video camera?

724
00:55:10,036 --> 00:55:11,356
What's up, man?

725
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:13,875
Yeah, um ...

726
00:55:13,956 --> 00:55:16,435
I think he had it like
the first day

727
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:18,474
and then he gave it away
or something.

728
00:55:18,554 --> 00:55:20,473
Why would that freak me out?

729
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:23,273
I don't know.

730
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:25,432
Just being weird.

731
00:55:25,512 --> 00:55:27,591
You are such a goofus.

732
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:32,150
So I'll see you tonight.

733
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,950
Okay.

734
00:55:54,744 --> 00:55:56,143
- Andrea ...
- Evan ...

735
00:55:56,223 --> 00:55:58,463
- and Chuck ...
- aren't home right now.

736
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:00,382
You know what to do.

737
00:56:00,462 --> 00:56:02,182
Uh, hey, Mum.

738
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:05,260
It's me. And hey, Chuck.

739
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:08,300
Ah, I'm just calling
to say hi, I guess.

740
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:10,179
Give me a call back.

741
00:56:13,618 --> 00:56:16,578
Hey, Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

742
00:56:16,657 --> 00:56:18,936
What's the matter,
you lost your Rolex?

743
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,776
Fuck you, frat boy!

744
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:27,255
Remember, everyone,
there's only two more weeks

745
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:29,653
until your psych projects
are due.

746
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:32,612
Uh, about that essay
I missed last week,

747
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:34,972
we're still okay
with the extension, right?

748
00:56:35,052 --> 00:56:36,812
And you are?

749
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:39,291
Evan ... Treborn.

750
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:41,170
Well, the answer's no, Mr. Treborn.

751
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,769
Now please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.

752
00:56:49,088 --> 00:56:51,167
Alright, settle down, everyone.

753
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:53,767
The exam will begin
in one minute.

754
00:56:57,965 --> 00:56:59,645
Get off me, arsehole.

755
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:02,004
You guys started that shit.

756
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:04,563
Evan, you're hysterical.

757
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:08,323
Did you study for this?

758
00:57:10,162 --> 00:57:11,882
Oh, uh ...

759
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,921
we'll find out.

760
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,840
Me neither.

761
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,676
Holy shit!
Are these the answers?

762
00:57:28,756 --> 00:57:30,356
Damn, Evan,
keep it on the dl.

763
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,674
Hey, uh ...

764
00:57:38,753 --> 00:57:42,233
I want to do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night.

765
00:57:42,312 --> 00:57:45,631
Uh, so if I said that I needed

766
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,951
some help from you
and the brothers ...

767
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,430
I'd say, 'blow me.'

768
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,589
Get the pledges to do it.

769
00:57:54,669 --> 00:57:57,229
- Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.

770
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:59,828
You may begin now.

771
00:58:15,983 --> 00:58:18,582
Oh, that was so good.

772
00:58:19,782 --> 00:58:21,661
Oh my God.

773
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:24,900
Where'd you learn
those new tricks?

774
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,099
Why?

775
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,139
It ... it wasn't weird, was it?

776
00:58:32,698 --> 00:58:35,377
Yeah, if you call
multiple orgasms weird.

777
00:58:44,335 --> 00:58:45,774
Hello?

778
00:58:47,773 --> 00:58:49,773
- Fuck 'em.
- Hello?

779
00:58:55,252 --> 00:58:56,491
Oh.

780
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,489
What do you think
it is about us

781
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:07,528
that makes us so perfect?

782
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:12,087
I mean ...

783
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,526
why did you sneak out

784
00:59:14,606 --> 00:59:17,365
to visit me
after I moved away?

785
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:19,205
'Cause I missed you.

786
00:59:21,564 --> 00:59:24,243
What, do you think my dad could have
stopped me from seeing you?

787
00:59:25,403 --> 00:59:26,802
What's he gonna do?

788
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,601
Oh, my gosh.
My toes are numb.

789
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,520
Do you think that we'll
be together forever?

790
00:59:40,278 --> 00:59:42,158
That is the plan, isn't it?

791
00:59:43,878 --> 00:59:45,877
'Hell or high water'?

792
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,717
Yeah.

793
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,756
Yeah, that's ...

794
00:59:49,835 --> 00:59:51,515
I was just making sure.

795
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:56,793
Yeah, that's the plan!

796
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:10,312
Alright, uh ...

797
01:00:10,392 --> 01:00:14,230
all you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

798
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,070
Pledges, uh ...

799
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,910
we're pledges, sir.

800
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,829
Uh, brother Evan, sir.

801
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:24,228
Are you kidding me?

802
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:29,866
What?
What did you say to me?

803
01:00:29,947 --> 01:00:32,426
You know what, give me the Greek
alphabet. Give it to me!

804
01:00:32,506 --> 01:00:33,905
- Uhh-uhh.
- Uhh-uhh.

805
01:00:33,985 --> 01:00:35,665
- Alpha, beta ...
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta ...

806
01:00:35,744 --> 01:00:37,904
epsilon, zeta, eta, theta,
iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi,

807
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:40,624
omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau,
upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, Sir.

808
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:43,542
Maybe that's what it is.
Don't fucking look at me, look down.

809
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:49,501
Uh ...

810
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,259
alright, um ...

811
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:57,418
so, you ... you pledges

812
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:00,298
you guys know what
you need to do for me.

813
01:01:00,377 --> 01:01:02,097
And you guys take a shower

814
01:01:02,177 --> 01:01:04,256
and if anyone
gives you any trouble,

815
01:01:04,337 --> 01:01:05,936
you tell 'em I said it was okay.

816
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:11,135
What?

817
01:01:14,694 --> 01:01:16,812
Shower that, bitch.

818
01:01:20,892 --> 01:01:23,451
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?

819
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:25,691
I'm not telling.

820
01:01:34,648 --> 01:01:36,967
Oh my God!

821
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:44,925
Wow, it's beautiful.

822
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:47,724
Go on, sit down.

823
01:01:48,844 --> 01:01:50,443
Thank you.

824
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,360
Why are you doing this for me?

825
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,479
When I woke up this morning ...

826
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,118
I saw your smile.

827
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:11,837
That smile.

828
01:02:13,037 --> 01:02:14,516
And I knew

829
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,555
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life

830
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:19,394
with you.

831
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:34,230
I've been looking
all over for you, man.

832
01:02:34,311 --> 01:02:35,670
Someone trashed your car.

833
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,627
What the ...

834
01:02:45,827 --> 01:02:47,626
Who did this?!

835
01:02:47,707 --> 01:02:49,706
Who did it?!

836
01:02:49,786 --> 01:02:51,986
It was probably
those Beta fuckers.

837
01:02:52,065 --> 01:02:54,025
No, no, no.

838
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,264
How did somebody
get away with this

839
01:02:56,344 --> 01:02:58,264
right in front
of the frat house?

840
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,742
- Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

841
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:07,941
Don't.

842
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,660
He might be watching.

843
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,219
It's my fault.

844
01:03:13,299 --> 01:03:15,779
I should have told you
he was released a few weeks ago.

845
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,538
Yeah, it might have been nice.

846
01:03:21,617 --> 01:03:22,856
God.

847
01:03:28,215 --> 01:03:30,455
Like this is gonna
do any good.

848
01:03:30,534 --> 01:03:32,693
Maybe one of the frat guys
has got a gun.

849
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:34,693
Evan, don't even joke!

850
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:36,413
He's not going
to hurt you, okay?

851
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:38,452
He's just trying to scare you
away from me.

852
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:40,811
He killed my dog.

853
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:43,731
- You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

854
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:46,250
You know how bad he had it
when we were kids.

855
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,889
Oh no, don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

856
01:03:49,969 --> 01:03:51,529
You turned out just fine.

857
01:03:51,608 --> 01:03:53,767
My father never
laid a hand on me.

858
01:03:53,848 --> 01:03:57,127
It's like that prick
saved it all up for Tommy.

859
01:04:01,806 --> 01:04:05,684
Okay. Alright. Uh ...

860
01:04:07,684 --> 01:04:11,322
We'll let campus security
deal with it. Okay?

861
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:15,041
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.

862
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:19,481
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

863
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,680
Evan, I just ... I don't want Tommy

864
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,279
to see us together right now.

865
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,518
No, I lost you once
and I'm not losing you again.

866
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:28,198
What do you mean
you lost me once?

867
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:31,037
Evan, you've never lost me.
What are you talking about?

868
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,036
God, you've been
acting so weird lately.

869
01:04:34,116 --> 01:04:37,635
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.

870
01:04:37,715 --> 01:04:40,234
I know that, but ...

871
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:41,874
your accent's changed.

872
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:44,993
- You don't even walk the same.
- What, I walk differently?

873
01:04:45,073 --> 01:04:47,032
I mean, that dinner tonight,

874
01:04:47,112 --> 01:04:48,912
it was so beautiful.
It was gorgeous.

875
01:04:48,992 --> 01:04:50,911
But it just wasn't you.

876
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:53,510
I can't do
something nice for you?

877
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,789
Wait ...

878
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,709
isn't that your jacket?

879
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:09,905
Tommy!

880
01:05:10,946 --> 01:05:13,025
You stay away from us,
you sick fuck.

881
01:05:13,105 --> 01:05:15,304
Oh, get this 'us' shit.

882
01:05:15,384 --> 01:05:17,743
Like I'd ever lay a hand
on my own sister.

883
01:05:17,824 --> 01:05:20,182
You're doing real nice
for yourself, Evan.

884
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:22,222
You've got a nice life,

885
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:24,021
you got nice friends,

886
01:05:24,102 --> 01:05:26,221
not to mention
you're fucking my sister.

887
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,781
Not a bad piece of arse
if I say so myself.

888
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,660
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.

889
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:33,539
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck?

890
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:36,418
Oh, it's not good enough that
the whole fucking world loves you?

891
01:05:36,498 --> 01:05:38,577
But you've got to take
the only thing on this Earth

892
01:05:38,657 --> 01:05:40,537
that doesn't think
that I'm a piece of shit?

893
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:42,016
You know I love you.

894
01:05:42,096 --> 01:05:44,256
No one thinks that
you're a piece of shit, Tom.

895
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:47,455
What was it you said?
I think I believe it was, 'sick fuck'!

896
01:05:47,535 --> 01:05:49,414
Don't! Tommy!

897
01:05:52,093 --> 01:05:53,413
Stop!

898
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:55,013
Stop!

899
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,772
Stop! Oh my God!

900
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:02,451
Stop!

901
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,410
Oh my God!

902
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,130
Oh!

903
01:06:07,649 --> 01:06:09,409
No, Evan!

904
01:06:09,488 --> 01:06:10,648
Stop!

905
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:11,768
Stop it!

906
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:14,887
- You're gonna kill him!
- He's a fuckin' maniac!

907
01:06:16,046 --> 01:06:17,886
Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

908
01:06:17,966 --> 01:06:19,645
You ruined Lenny's life!

909
01:06:21,285 --> 01:06:22,644
You killed Crockett!

910
01:06:22,725 --> 01:06:24,564
You killed
that woman and her baby!

911
01:06:25,804 --> 01:06:28,003
Now you're trying to kill me.

912
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,683
Just tryin' to fucking kill me!

913
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,678
Oh my God!

914
01:06:44,759 --> 01:06:47,157
Oh my God,
what did you do?

915
01:06:48,317 --> 01:06:50,556
Oh my God!

916
01:07:20,188 --> 01:07:21,828
You right there, faggot!

917
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,819
First time?

918
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:52,419
Yeah.

919
01:07:53,898 --> 01:07:55,818
You'd better not
bitch up, man.

920
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:58,297
You'll wind up someone's
luggage that way.

921
01:08:04,015 --> 01:08:05,615
Can you protect me?

922
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:07,335
Jesus himself

923
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:09,853
couldn't make me stand up
against the brotherhood.

924
01:08:20,771 --> 01:08:22,730
Look, man ...

925
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:26,089
when they come,

926
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:29,129
you go someplace else
in your head, man.

927
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,448
Be somewhere else.

928
01:08:47,922 --> 01:08:49,803
Back your arse up.

929
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:03,558
Yo, gimme that.

930
01:09:19,314 --> 01:09:22,353
I spoke to your lawyer.

931
01:09:22,432 --> 01:09:24,672
And he says he's sure

932
01:09:24,752 --> 01:09:26,632
he can get you off
on self-defence.

933
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:28,671
So if you're just patient ...

934
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:31,510
Mum ...

935
01:09:31,591 --> 01:09:33,269
How long am I gonna
be in here?

936
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,430
I don't know.

937
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:38,388
These things take time.

938
01:09:38,468 --> 01:09:40,107
What about the journals?

939
01:09:40,188 --> 01:09:42,147
Did you bring the ones
I asked you to bring?

940
01:09:42,227 --> 01:09:45,267
I found these two.

941
01:09:45,346 --> 01:09:47,225
The others are still in storage.

942
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:51,344
Mum! L ...

943
01:09:55,104 --> 01:09:56,384
I need them all,

944
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:58,062
all of them.

945
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,062
And I'm going
to get them to you,

946
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:04,181
but right now, you need
to concentrate on the case.

947
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,940
Please.

948
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:13,178
Alright.

949
01:10:13,258 --> 01:10:15,098
You're right.

950
01:10:19,016 --> 01:10:21,336
What about Kayleigh?

951
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:23,375
Is she alright?

952
01:10:27,614 --> 01:10:29,494
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

953
01:10:32,132 --> 01:10:34,212
Time's up.

954
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:35,892
I'm not going
to lose you, kiddo.

955
01:10:35,971 --> 01:10:37,851
Promise me you'll hang on.

956
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:55,127
Shit on my dick
or blood on my knife.

957
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:05,124
They're mine ...

958
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:20,159
Come on!

959
01:11:21,959 --> 01:11:25,078
Back the fuck off!

960
01:11:25,157 --> 01:11:26,597
Show's over, ladies!

961
01:11:29,637 --> 01:11:31,155
Put this maggot
back in his cell.

962
01:11:31,236 --> 01:11:33,955
Move it!
Come on, let's go!

963
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,670
We'll be seeing you
later on tonight, little sister.

964
01:12:40,976 --> 01:12:43,255
'Today, I found

965
01:12:43,335 --> 01:12:45,414
my grandfather's
death certificate.

966
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:48,533
He died in a nut house
just like my father.

967
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:53,052
Mum denies it, but she thinks
I'm going to end up the same way.'

968
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:55,971
Boo-hoo-hoo.

969
01:13:07,088 --> 01:13:09,127
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

970
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:11,607
Come on, Reese.

971
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,285
You're religious, Carlos,

972
01:13:19,364 --> 01:13:21,164
you believe in that whole bit,

973
01:13:21,244 --> 01:13:23,643
the Lord works
in mysterious ways?

974
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:25,922
Straight up, man.

975
01:13:26,003 --> 01:13:29,521
'Cause I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

976
01:13:29,602 --> 01:13:32,001
For you to help me.

977
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:35,919
Shit.

978
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,759
I knew you were crazy, man.

979
01:13:37,839 --> 01:13:39,159
I ain't bullshitting you.

980
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:41,118
Jesus speaks to me
in my dreams.

981
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:43,358
Oh, yeah?

982
01:13:43,438 --> 01:13:46,077
That's cool. Great.

983
01:13:46,157 --> 01:13:49,156
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.

984
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:56,434
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

985
01:13:57,713 --> 01:14:00,273
You need to see
the prison shrink, man.

986
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,832
Just tell me if you see
anything just ... weird.

987
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,831
Weirder than this?

988
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:07,631
It could be marks.
It could be scars.

989
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,310
It could be anything,
I don't know.

990
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:14,708
'On Wednesday, I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.

991
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:16,868
Mummy won't let me see it.

992
01:14:30,984 --> 01:14:34,583
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

993
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:39,822
That's great, everyone.

994
01:14:39,901 --> 01:14:41,821
Just imagine
what you want to be.

995
01:14:41,901 --> 01:14:43,580
There's no limits.

996
01:14:52,938 --> 01:14:55,297
Oh, Mrs. Boswell.

997
01:14:58,496 --> 01:15:00,695
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

998
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:03,014
Look, it's stigmata, man!

999
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:04,974
What'd you see?
What'd it look like?

1000
01:15:05,054 --> 01:15:08,333
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.

1001
01:15:08,413 --> 01:15:10,333
Man, I thought you were ...

1002
01:15:10,412 --> 01:15:12,532
I though you were
fucking crazy, man.

1003
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:15,691
So now you believe me.

1004
01:15:17,091 --> 01:15:18,690
Straight up, man.

1005
01:15:30,247 --> 01:15:32,046
Wanna make a deal?

1006
01:15:34,685 --> 01:15:37,085
Alright, look. I'm new here,

1007
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,924
but I think I get
how things work.

1008
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,643
You either join a gang
or you're dead.

1009
01:15:44,883 --> 01:15:47,681
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up with no
spics or niggers.

1010
01:15:49,562 --> 01:15:51,800
And I don't want to die.

1011
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,000
So ...

1012
01:15:56,519 --> 01:15:58,078
what do I gotta do?

1013
01:15:59,438 --> 01:16:02,678
I'm the new guy.
I've got to work my way up, so ...

1014
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:05,916
should I ...

1015
01:16:05,997 --> 01:16:07,756
suck your dick now ...

1016
01:16:09,035 --> 01:16:10,915
or ...

1017
01:16:14,394 --> 01:16:17,313
Is your blood pure?

1018
01:16:17,393 --> 01:16:19,673
Well, I ain't no fucking kike,

1019
01:16:19,752 --> 01:16:21,152
if that's what you're asking me.

1020
01:16:21,232 --> 01:16:23,951
Well then, let's see
what you got, honey.

1021
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:26,911
Watch the fucking teeth
or you'll be leaving without 'em.

1022
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,390
Yes, Sir.

1023
01:16:36,987 --> 01:16:38,747
Come to daddy.

1024
01:16:43,586 --> 01:16:44,665
Carlos!

1025
01:16:50,504 --> 01:16:52,383
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

1026
01:16:52,463 --> 01:16:54,502
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy!

1027
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:57,101
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

1028
01:16:57,182 --> 01:16:58,941
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

1029
01:16:59,021 --> 01:17:00,781
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

1030
01:17:00,861 --> 01:17:02,900
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy.

1031
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,700
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

1032
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:10,618
Rot in hell,
you fucking animals!

1033
01:17:12,217 --> 01:17:14,697
Wait, before we ...

1034
01:17:14,776 --> 01:17:17,136
we need something
that could open the sack.

1035
01:17:27,573 --> 01:17:29,332
I want you to take this, Lenny.

1036
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:31,372
Today's your day of atonement.

1037
01:17:31,452 --> 01:17:34,052
I know how guilty you feel
about that woman and her baby.

1038
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:36,251
Evan, stop it.
It's not the time.

1039
01:17:36,331 --> 01:17:39,370
Now's the only time! Today you get
a chance to redeem yourself,

1040
01:17:39,449 --> 01:17:41,329
to start all over with a clean slate.

1041
01:17:41,409 --> 01:17:44,049
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

1042
01:17:44,128 --> 01:17:47,328
Please, if you've ever trusted me before,
trust me on this one.

1043
01:17:51,006 --> 01:17:52,606
Cut the rope.

1044
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:57,564
Come on.

1045
01:17:59,444 --> 01:18:02,243
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.

1046
01:18:02,323 --> 01:18:04,762
You don't want me to see
Kayleigh ever again, fine.

1047
01:18:04,842 --> 01:18:06,482
Just let Crockett go.

1048
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,361
Besides, if you kill him now,

1049
01:18:08,441 --> 01:18:10,281
they'll stick you
in juvie for sure.

1050
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,200
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

1051
01:18:23,677 --> 01:18:25,036
Lenny, no!

1052
01:18:28,315 --> 01:18:29,635
Oh God.

1053
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:33,913
Oh God, Lenny.

1054
01:18:33,994 --> 01:18:35,833
I said cut the rope.

1055
01:18:58,306 --> 01:19:00,626
It's all backwards.

1056
01:19:07,544 --> 01:19:11,863
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1057
01:19:11,943 --> 01:19:13,303
Evan ...

1058
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:18,821
What the fuck?

1059
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:24,539
Lenny, no!

1060
01:19:26,619 --> 01:19:28,139
Want a ride?

1061
01:19:29,338 --> 01:19:31,017
Lenny!

1062
01:19:34,776 --> 01:19:37,296
Somebody call 911!

1063
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:40,055
Evan! Evan!
Fuck! Evan!

1064
01:19:46,772 --> 01:19:48,373
Hey, doc.

1065
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,452
What's the damage?

1066
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:52,931
- How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.

1067
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:56,930
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen
results like these before.

1068
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,809
Not even with my father?

1069
01:19:59,889 --> 01:20:03,528
Well, actually, they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

1070
01:20:03,608 --> 01:20:05,287
So, what did you find?

1071
01:20:05,368 --> 01:20:08,127
We're finding most of
the haemorrhaging is coming from here,

1072
01:20:08,207 --> 01:20:10,166
the outer layer
of the cerebral cortex.

1073
01:20:10,246 --> 01:20:11,965
That's where
the memories are stored.

1074
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:13,365
- Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.

1075
01:20:13,445 --> 01:20:14,844
I've never seen
anything like it.

1076
01:20:14,925 --> 01:20:17,564
We compared these
to the ones taken last year.

1077
01:20:17,644 --> 01:20:20,603
We found severe haemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

1078
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:22,122
What does that mean for Evan?

1079
01:20:22,203 --> 01:20:24,042
What he's saying, Mum,
is that I've jammed

1080
01:20:24,122 --> 01:20:26,481
40 years worth of memories
into my head in the last year.

1081
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:29,161
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain.

1082
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,160
- That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.

1083
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,518
Alright, I'm going
to go wait in the car.

1084
01:20:37,598 --> 01:20:39,998
The light in here is kind
of bugging my eyes, so ...

1085
01:20:40,077 --> 01:20:42,557
It was good seeing you, doc.
It really was.

1086
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:45,476
It was very ... very informative.

1087
01:20:45,556 --> 01:20:47,875
But, you know,
I got people to see

1088
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:50,594
and things to read.

1089
01:20:50,675 --> 01:20:52,474
Alright, see ya.

1090
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:24,304
Hey.

1091
01:21:27,064 --> 01:21:28,543
It's me ...

1092
01:21:28,624 --> 01:21:30,503
Evan.

1093
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:33,142
Can I get you anything?

1094
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:37,341
What about ...
what about some of those

1095
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:39,461
model airplanes you like, huh?

1096
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,020
I bet I can get a shitload

1097
01:21:42,099 --> 01:21:44,419
of those model airplanes up in here.

1098
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:48,058
Lenny.

1099
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,775
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

1100
01:22:00,614 --> 01:22:04,893
When you put that shard
in my hand ...

1101
01:22:07,133 --> 01:22:10,171
you knew something big
was going to happen.

1102
01:22:10,252 --> 01:22:12,611
Didn't you?

1103
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:16,130
Yeah ...

1104
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:19,289
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

1105
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:25,647
You should be

1106
01:22:25,727 --> 01:22:27,566
where I am.

1107
01:22:45,921 --> 01:22:48,881
'Today I get to meet my father.

1108
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,760
His name is Jason ...

1109
01:22:52,919 --> 01:22:54,639
and he's crazy.

1110
01:22:56,398 --> 01:22:58,478
I hope he let's me
call him "Dad."'

1111
01:23:00,117 --> 01:23:02,396
You okay?
'Cause you look like

1112
01:23:02,476 --> 01:23:04,476
you went somewhere else
there for a second.

1113
01:23:04,556 --> 01:23:07,315
Look, Jason, I need some
fast answers from you

1114
01:23:07,395 --> 01:23:10,115
if I'm ever gonna fix
what I've done.

1115
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,714
I was praying this curse
would have ended with me.

1116
01:23:12,793 --> 01:23:14,273
Yeah, but it didn't.

1117
01:23:14,353 --> 01:23:16,632
So now I need information
to make things right again

1118
01:23:16,712 --> 01:23:18,672
and you're the only one
that can give it to me.

1119
01:23:18,752 --> 01:23:19,911
There is no right.

1120
01:23:19,992 --> 01:23:23,111
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

1121
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:25,590
Who says you can't
make things better?

1122
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:28,469
You can't play God, son.

1123
01:23:29,748 --> 01:23:31,468
It must end with me.

1124
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:34,667
Just by being here you may
be killing your mother.

1125
01:23:34,747 --> 01:23:36,787
That's bullshit, you know?

1126
01:23:36,866 --> 01:23:39,946
I'll send you a postcard when
I made everything perfect again.

1127
01:23:41,385 --> 01:23:43,265
Ahh! No, no!

1128
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:05,938
Just get out, did ya?

1129
01:24:06,018 --> 01:24:07,977
Hmm?

1130
01:24:08,058 --> 01:24:11,256
Oh, nothing, just that my brother
did a stint in the pen

1131
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:13,016
and he used to eat like that.

1132
01:24:14,056 --> 01:24:16,775
I come from a big family.

1133
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:18,614
Well, I meant no offence.

1134
01:24:20,214 --> 01:24:21,373
None taken.

1135
01:24:21,454 --> 01:24:23,693
Hey, uh ...

1136
01:24:23,773 --> 01:24:25,693
Does Kayleigh Miller
still work here?

1137
01:24:27,172 --> 01:24:29,092
I'm sorry.
I never heard of her.

1138
01:24:46,046 --> 01:24:50,125
God! Can't a man get a little
goddamned peace in his own house?!

1139
01:24:53,724 --> 01:24:56,244
I don't suppose
you're here to sell cookies?

1140
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,044
Good guess, fuckbag.

1141
01:24:59,603 --> 01:25:01,522
Remember me, huh?

1142
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:03,762
We had a nice chat once
when I was seven.

1143
01:25:05,761 --> 01:25:07,800
I got one question for you.

1144
01:25:07,881 --> 01:25:09,719
Where can I find
your daughter?

1145
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:44,430
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

1146
01:25:48,908 --> 01:25:51,028
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.

1147
01:25:53,228 --> 01:25:56,227
Hey. It's good to see you.

1148
01:25:57,506 --> 01:25:59,025
Can I come in?

1149
01:25:59,106 --> 01:26:00,865
If I knew you were coming,

1150
01:26:00,945 --> 01:26:03,184
I would have cleaned
the stains off the sheets.

1151
01:26:09,903 --> 01:26:11,982
What do you want?

1152
01:26:12,062 --> 01:26:14,462
I just needed to see
a friendly face.

1153
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:17,260
Well, time is money, Evan.

1154
01:26:19,259 --> 01:26:20,899
Money.

1155
01:26:20,979 --> 01:26:25,338
I guess I can spare 10 minutes
for an old friend, right?

1156
01:26:25,418 --> 01:26:28,297
So, how's tricks?

1157
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:30,577
Sorry, occupational humour.

1158
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,216
I got it.

1159
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:35,335
You can stop now.

1160
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,494
Oh, sorry.

1161
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:41,213
Does my line of work
make you uncomfortable, precious?

1162
01:26:41,294 --> 01:26:44,853
No, just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

1163
01:26:48,132 --> 01:26:50,210
I've been where you've been.

1164
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:51,730
Ha!

1165
01:26:51,811 --> 01:26:53,210
Where is that?

1166
01:26:54,769 --> 01:26:57,648
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1167
01:26:57,729 --> 01:26:59,328
I know people always say that,

1168
01:26:59,408 --> 01:27:01,088
that you wouldn't believe me,

1169
01:27:01,167 --> 01:27:03,367
but in this case
it's not even worth trying, so ...

1170
01:27:07,325 --> 01:27:09,565
I knew I needed to find you,

1171
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,405
so I went over to your dad's

1172
01:27:11,485 --> 01:27:13,404
and made him tell me
where you were.

1173
01:27:13,485 --> 01:27:15,484
Then I came here
and the rest you know.

1174
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:17,602
You're right, Evan,
I don't believe you.

1175
01:27:17,683 --> 01:27:19,962
I never thought you would.

1176
01:27:20,043 --> 01:27:22,281
That's why I never bothered
to tell a soul until now

1177
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,441
and I never will again.

1178
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:26,360
I'm the only person you've told?

1179
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,920
That's a great line.

1180
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:31,599
Does that make other girls wet?

1181
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,238
Do they actually
eat up that bullshit?

1182
01:27:36,797 --> 01:27:40,796
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

1183
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:43,755
Frankly, I'm too tired
to prove it to you ...

1184
01:27:43,835 --> 01:27:45,795
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

1185
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:50,113
How else would I know you have
twin moles on your inner thigh?

1186
01:27:50,193 --> 01:27:52,833
Anyone with 50 bucks
could tell you that.

1187
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:54,632
Okay.

1188
01:27:54,712 --> 01:27:56,791
Forget that.

1189
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:58,991
How about the fact
that you prefer

1190
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:01,430
the smell of skunk to flowers?

1191
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,870
Or that you hate cilantro

1192
01:28:03,949 --> 01:28:05,989
because for some reason
unknown to you

1193
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:07,949
it reminds you
of your stepsister?

1194
01:28:08,028 --> 01:28:11,548
Or that when you have an orgasm,
your toes go numb?

1195
01:28:11,627 --> 01:28:14,346
I'm sure all of your clientele
are privy to that.

1196
01:28:17,386 --> 01:28:20,744
You know? Look, I just
thought you should know.

1197
01:28:20,825 --> 01:28:22,744
Know what?

1198
01:28:22,824 --> 01:28:25,663
That you were happy once ...

1199
01:28:27,023 --> 01:28:28,702
with me.

1200
01:28:30,142 --> 01:28:32,581
You know there's one
major hole in your story.

1201
01:28:32,661 --> 01:28:35,101
There's no fucking way
on this planet

1202
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:38,220
or any other, I would ever be
in some fucking sorority!

1203
01:28:42,378 --> 01:28:43,858
You were happy there.

1204
01:28:43,938 --> 01:28:45,778
Oh, you're crying?

1205
01:28:45,857 --> 01:28:48,536
You sure you don't
want your wallet?

1206
01:28:48,617 --> 01:28:50,297
No, I don't need it
where I'm going.

1207
01:28:50,376 --> 01:28:53,415
What, are you off to change
everyone else's life again? Is that it?

1208
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,974
Maybe next time you'll pop up
in some mansion

1209
01:28:56,055 --> 01:28:58,533
while I end up in Tijuana
doing some donkey act.

1210
01:28:58,614 --> 01:29:01,053
You know what? I'm over it.

1211
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:03,372
Every time
I try to help someone

1212
01:29:03,453 --> 01:29:04,932
everything just goes to shit.

1213
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:07,371
Well, don't give up now, slick.

1214
01:29:07,451 --> 01:29:09,650
Hell, you've already
done so much for me.

1215
01:29:09,731 --> 01:29:11,970
Why don't you go back in time

1216
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:14,849
and save Mrs. Halpern
and her baby?

1217
01:29:14,929 --> 01:29:19,528
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family.

1218
01:29:19,608 --> 01:29:22,207
No, go back
to when I was seven

1219
01:29:22,287 --> 01:29:25,766
and fuck me in front
of my daddy's video camera.

1220
01:29:27,045 --> 01:29:29,885
Straighten me out a bit.

1221
01:29:42,921 --> 01:29:45,081
You're on my bed.
Get out!

1222
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,959
Buddy, I thought it would be okay
what with you being sick and all.

1223
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:00,556
I'm not going to say it again.

1224
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:10,273
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

1225
01:30:10,353 --> 01:30:12,433
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

1226
01:30:12,512 --> 01:30:15,192
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

1227
01:30:15,272 --> 01:30:16,951
than on the mailbox
across the street.'

1228
01:30:23,789 --> 01:30:25,829
Lady, stay back!
Don't go near the mailbox!

1229
01:30:25,908 --> 01:30:28,748
- Idiots!
- I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

1230
01:30:28,828 --> 01:30:31,027
I'll save you, lady!

1231
01:30:38,705 --> 01:30:41,424
God damn it, I thought
I told you two to get out.

1232
01:30:43,023 --> 01:30:44,863
Oh, sorry, man.
Did we wake you?

1233
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:49,062
No, it's cool.

1234
01:30:49,142 --> 01:30:51,021
Okay.

1235
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,180
It's really cool.

1236
01:31:15,414 --> 01:31:17,054
What the fuck is this?

1237
01:31:23,372 --> 01:31:25,891
- Please save his arm!
- Can you open up my locker?

1238
01:31:25,971 --> 01:31:28,731
- Happy Birthday!
- Can I come too?

1239
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:30,370
Do you want me
to hold your popcorn?

1240
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:34,489
Evan? Get a towel!
Get a towel!

1241
01:31:34,569 --> 01:31:36,488
Evan! Oh my God!

1242
01:31:36,568 --> 01:31:38,688
Evan! Evan!
Evan!

1243
01:31:40,007 --> 01:31:41,646
Hey, where you going?

1244
01:31:41,727 --> 01:31:44,046
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.

1245
01:31:44,126 --> 01:31:46,045
Lenny's the best.

1246
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,925
You guys make a great couple.

1247
01:31:48,005 --> 01:31:49,924
You ever think
that I'll find someone?

1248
01:31:51,604 --> 01:31:52,684
Evan!

1249
01:31:55,602 --> 01:31:58,042
Where are we going?

1250
01:31:58,122 --> 01:32:00,041
We're taking you
to the hospital, Evan.

1251
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:03,000
- No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mum would kill me.

1252
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,080
- Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny!

1253
01:32:08,119 --> 01:32:10,718
You owe me that much.

1254
01:32:15,557 --> 01:32:17,077
What are you geeks
looking at?

1255
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:19,476
It must be nice to be
so goddamed perfect, huh?

1256
01:32:19,556 --> 01:32:22,795
Fucking losers!
Lenny, help me!

1257
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:24,954
Here, get him over.
Get him over.

1258
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:29,273
Hey, Brian, how's
your head feeling, buddy?

1259
01:32:29,353 --> 01:32:31,112
I saw that girl
you went home with.

1260
01:32:31,193 --> 01:32:33,192
Did she borrow
your razor this morning?

1261
01:32:33,271 --> 01:32:34,951
You're so bad.

1262
01:32:36,111 --> 01:32:39,110
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy!

1263
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:41,870
Hey, what's up, guys?

1264
01:32:42,989 --> 01:32:44,989
Hey, man,
I did what you said.

1265
01:32:45,068 --> 01:32:47,667
We're pooling our student funds
with the Hillel house

1266
01:32:47,748 --> 01:32:49,747
and we're having
an awareness dance.

1267
01:32:49,828 --> 01:32:52,267
Oh, awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around

1268
01:32:52,346 --> 01:32:54,466
to a techno remix
of 'Hava Nagila' till I puke.

1269
01:32:55,986 --> 01:32:57,784
Maybe we should be
getting to class now.

1270
01:32:57,865 --> 01:32:59,504
What's the point
of psych class now?

1271
01:32:59,584 --> 01:33:02,264
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

1272
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:05,023
Let's go for a stroll.

1273
01:33:06,142 --> 01:33:07,422
Bye, babe.

1274
01:33:07,502 --> 01:33:09,341
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis.

1275
01:33:09,421 --> 01:33:10,782
What's up with him?

1276
01:33:10,861 --> 01:33:13,580
So Tommy's really
into this Jesus freak thing, huh?

1277
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:15,619
You know how spiritual
he's gotten

1278
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,979
ever since he saved
Mrs. Halpern and Katie.

1279
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:21,938
He saved Mrs. Halpern?

1280
01:33:22,017 --> 01:33:24,017
Please. The twisted fuck.

1281
01:33:25,337 --> 01:33:27,576
Here, why don't we sit right here?

1282
01:33:35,174 --> 01:33:36,693
Want a granola bar?

1283
01:33:39,253 --> 01:33:40,692
Here, just ...

1284
01:33:44,732 --> 01:33:47,011
Yeah, I gotta fix
these things or something.

1285
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,729
Kayleigh ...

1286
01:33:51,809 --> 01:33:53,569
do you ever think about us?

1287
01:33:53,648 --> 01:33:56,488
I mean, do you ever wonder

1288
01:33:56,568 --> 01:33:59,207
if things might have been
different between us?

1289
01:33:59,287 --> 01:34:00,926
Sure, Evan.

1290
01:34:03,366 --> 01:34:05,885
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

1291
01:34:07,804 --> 01:34:10,124
- I was?
- Yeah.

1292
01:34:11,404 --> 01:34:14,323
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

1293
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:17,562
I don't get it.

1294
01:34:17,641 --> 01:34:19,761
When ... when my folks split up,

1295
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:22,720
they gave me and Tommy a choice
of who we wanted to live with.

1296
01:34:22,801 --> 01:34:25,400
And I couldn't stand my dad.

1297
01:34:25,479 --> 01:34:28,399
But I knew that if I went
to move with my mum,

1298
01:34:28,478 --> 01:34:30,878
I'd never see you again.

1299
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:32,638
I didn't know that.

1300
01:34:34,237 --> 01:34:37,276
So you still think about us ...

1301
01:34:37,356 --> 01:34:39,036
together?

1302
01:34:40,635 --> 01:34:43,954
Well, it's crossed my mind
from time to time.

1303
01:34:44,035 --> 01:34:46,113
And?

1304
01:34:46,194 --> 01:34:48,793
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind, Ev.

1305
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:53,111
I mean, I could play out the entire movie of
our lives in one second.

1306
01:34:53,192 --> 01:34:55,071
Boom, we fall in love.
We get married.

1307
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:58,790
We have kids.
Our kids grow old, as do we.

1308
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:01,309
Matching burial plots.
The whole thing.

1309
01:35:02,749 --> 01:35:05,628
Plah, it took a lot longer
to spit out than to imagine.

1310
01:35:07,588 --> 01:35:09,827
Things like that usually do.

1311
01:35:11,986 --> 01:35:13,665
So ...

1312
01:35:13,746 --> 01:35:15,665
do you think that
it might have worked?

1313
01:35:15,745 --> 01:35:17,744
Yeah.

1314
01:35:19,704 --> 01:35:21,743
I mean, but that's
not how things wound up.

1315
01:35:24,103 --> 01:35:26,062
I'm with Lenny.

1316
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:29,181
Lenny is your friend

1317
01:35:29,261 --> 01:35:31,460
and ...

1318
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:33,180
and that's where it ends.

1319
01:35:35,859 --> 01:35:37,618
Well ...

1320
01:35:38,779 --> 01:35:41,617
would it make a difference
if I told you that

1321
01:35:41,697 --> 01:35:45,617
no one could possibly ever
love anyone as much as I love you?

1322
01:35:54,254 --> 01:35:57,613
I'm not saying that. I ...

1323
01:35:57,693 --> 01:36:01,052
- Yeah.
- I'm not ... I'm just saying it like

1324
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:04,091
if you were a girl,
would that be something

1325
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:05,931
that you would want to hear?

1326
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:11,449
Hold on one second.
Lenny's calling.

1327
01:36:11,529 --> 01:36:13,408
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

1328
01:36:19,327 --> 01:36:21,206
He's a little down ...

1329
01:36:22,245 --> 01:36:23,925
I love you.

1330
01:37:18,109 --> 01:37:19,949
You forgot to put
the toaster on the ledge.

1331
01:37:21,389 --> 01:37:24,468
Lenny likes Pop Tarts.

1332
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:26,667
You guys are all
that matter now.

1333
01:37:28,987 --> 01:37:31,586
Man, I know it's hard,
but you can't give up.

1334
01:37:31,665 --> 01:37:34,465
I can't even
fucking kill myself.

1335
01:37:34,545 --> 01:37:36,305
Don't talk like that.

1336
01:37:45,542 --> 01:37:47,741
Alright, I've got
to get you out of here.

1337
01:37:47,822 --> 01:37:50,020
Visiting hours
are almost over.

1338
01:37:54,059 --> 01:37:56,338
Did Mum
get transferred again?

1339
01:37:56,419 --> 01:37:59,337
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

1340
01:38:06,536 --> 01:38:10,135
Looking ... good, kiddo.

1341
01:38:15,573 --> 01:38:16,813
Lung cancer.

1342
01:38:18,572 --> 01:38:21,212
Lung cancer?

1343
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:24,410
You started chain smoking
when I blew myself up.

1344
01:38:24,491 --> 01:38:27,250
Sorry, Mrs. T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

1345
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:30,209
- I think I could fix this.
- Fix?

1346
01:38:30,289 --> 01:38:33,168
I just need the journal entry
about the blockbuster.

1347
01:38:35,448 --> 01:38:38,086
Shit, no arms.

1348
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:39,966
I never wrote it.

1349
01:38:40,046 --> 01:38:43,885
You're ... acting ... different.

1350
01:38:43,965 --> 01:38:47,004
No, he's just going through
tough times right now.

1351
01:38:47,084 --> 01:38:48,884
Mum ...

1352
01:38:48,963 --> 01:38:50,684
you're going to be okay.

1353
01:38:50,763 --> 01:38:52,403
I can change it.

1354
01:38:52,482 --> 01:38:54,682
Um, maybe ... I wanna go
down to the chapel.

1355
01:38:55,722 --> 01:39:00,280
You're ... acting ...

1356
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,639
just like your father.

1357
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:07,118
Just 'cause he went crazy
when he was my age,

1358
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:09,597
doesn't mean
I'm gonna go crazy, Mum.

1359
01:39:10,837 --> 01:39:14,316
How ... did ...

1360
01:39:14,396 --> 01:39:17,076
you ... know that?

1361
01:39:17,155 --> 01:39:19,555
You told me ...

1362
01:39:19,635 --> 01:39:21,634
on parent's weekend,
remember?

1363
01:39:25,473 --> 01:39:27,513
It wasn't me ...

1364
01:39:28,592 --> 01:39:30,672
- Just ...
... or you.

1365
01:39:30,752 --> 01:39:33,751
Like ... Jason.

1366
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:35,470
You don't worry, Mum,

1367
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:38,269
I'm going to get you
out of here. Okay?

1368
01:39:38,349 --> 01:39:39,229
No.

1369
01:39:40,109 --> 01:39:41,708
You're not going
to hurt anymore.

1370
01:39:41,788 --> 01:39:43,668
I'm going to fix it.

1371
01:39:43,748 --> 01:39:44,748
No.

1372
01:39:46,187 --> 01:39:48,187
No, no.

1373
01:39:51,186 --> 01:39:52,585
Are you sure
you even packed it?

1374
01:39:52,665 --> 01:39:54,345
My mum packed it.

1375
01:39:54,425 --> 01:39:56,424
I think she sent
everything I ever owned.

1376
01:39:56,504 --> 01:39:58,543
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

1377
01:39:58,623 --> 01:40:00,623
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.

1378
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,222
Duly noted.

1379
01:40:05,302 --> 01:40:06,981
Okay, I have to ask you
one last favour.

1380
01:40:07,061 --> 01:40:09,020
- What?
- I need you to be quiet.

1381
01:40:09,101 --> 01:40:11,860
I have to concentrate
if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.

1382
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:15,738
- What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms,

1383
01:40:15,819 --> 01:40:18,698
my mum would've never started
smoking in the first place.

1384
01:40:18,777 --> 01:40:20,617
Never mind. Just open it.

1385
01:40:22,657 --> 01:40:24,256
Turn it.

1386
01:40:24,336 --> 01:40:26,575
There.

1387
01:40:30,174 --> 01:40:32,173
'Today Mummy
is taking me to play

1388
01:40:32,254 --> 01:40:34,013
with Kayleigh and Tommy.

1389
01:40:34,093 --> 01:40:37,292
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

1390
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:42,570
Now, how do I destroy
the blockbuster?

1391
01:40:57,167 --> 01:41:00,565
Evan, what are you
doing with that knife?

1392
01:41:03,845 --> 01:41:07,844
Well, that didn't work.
Go on, turn it.

1393
01:41:09,003 --> 01:41:10,522
Turn it. There.

1394
01:41:12,082 --> 01:41:14,602
'I never wanted
to be in the movie anyway.

1395
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:17,041
It was cold so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

1396
01:41:17,121 --> 01:41:19,040
But Mr. Miller made me
take my shirt off.'

1397
01:41:19,121 --> 01:41:20,799
In this part of the story,

1398
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,358
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian.

1399
01:41:24,439 --> 01:41:27,758
And they have
to kiss and stuff,

1400
01:41:27,838 --> 01:41:29,357
like grown-ups do.

1401
01:41:29,437 --> 01:41:31,277
Wait, I need my belt.

1402
01:41:37,995 --> 01:41:40,674
Hey, don't even
bother about a belt.

1403
01:41:40,754 --> 01:41:44,193
- Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.

1404
01:41:44,273 --> 01:41:47,193
Amazing that word never fails
to make an impression with you.

1405
01:41:47,272 --> 01:41:49,672
Easy does it, Evan.

1406
01:41:49,751 --> 01:41:52,631
Don't be a bad boy
or I'll tell your mother

1407
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:54,590
what a naughty
little shit you are.

1408
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:56,549
And I'll tell
Child Protective Services

1409
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:58,749
about your little
kiddie porn endeavours.

1410
01:41:58,829 --> 01:42:00,948
One step closer
and I'll shove this up your arse.

1411
01:42:01,029 --> 01:42:03,267
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hand.

1412
01:42:03,348 --> 01:42:05,387
Been there, done that.

1413
01:42:07,786 --> 01:42:08,906
Hey!

1414
01:42:12,745 --> 01:42:14,624
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!

1415
01:42:14,704 --> 01:42:17,263
No! Kayleigh, no!

1416
01:42:24,781 --> 01:42:26,021
Hey, man.

1417
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:29,340
... good, kiddo.

1418
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:32,179
I've got no choice but to commit you
to Sunnyvale Institution ...

1419
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,618
You're gonna have to live
somewhere else for a while.

1420
01:42:34,699 --> 01:42:36,698
- A squashed butterfly.
- I want my mummy!

1421
01:42:36,778 --> 01:42:38,098
I'm so sick of this!

1422
01:42:38,177 --> 01:42:40,097
I think we should
up your medication.

1423
01:43:08,369 --> 01:43:10,128
Where are
my goddamn books?

1424
01:43:10,208 --> 01:43:13,168
Hey, Evan, we're not supposed
to meet for another hour.

1425
01:43:13,247 --> 01:43:15,487
Where are
my goddamn books?

1426
01:43:15,566 --> 01:43:18,005
Books?

1427
01:43:18,086 --> 01:43:19,965
My journals.

1428
01:43:20,046 --> 01:43:21,925
L ... I need them.

1429
01:43:22,005 --> 01:43:25,804
So, if you'd give 'em to me,
it'd help a lot.

1430
01:43:25,884 --> 01:43:27,963
It really hurts me
to go through this again.

1431
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:30,922
There are no journals.

1432
01:43:31,003 --> 01:43:32,961
There never were.

1433
01:43:33,042 --> 01:43:35,721
It's part of the fantasy world
that your mind created

1434
01:43:35,801 --> 01:43:39,040
to cope with the guilt
of killing Kayleigh Miller.

1435
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:41,999
Think, Evan, think.

1436
01:43:42,079 --> 01:43:44,478
You've created a disease
that does not exist ...

1437
01:43:45,558 --> 01:43:47,558
alternate universes with colleges

1438
01:43:47,637 --> 01:43:49,916
and prisons and paraplegia.

1439
01:43:49,997 --> 01:43:52,836
I want my journals
and I want 'em now!

1440
01:43:52,916 --> 01:43:55,715
And I know that you got 'em
and you're gonna give 'em to me!

1441
01:43:55,795 --> 01:43:58,074
You're not going to hide them
from me. I want them!

1442
01:43:59,954 --> 01:44:02,353
You're reminding me
of your father.

1443
01:44:02,433 --> 01:44:04,592
He was always screaming
for a photo album

1444
01:44:04,673 --> 01:44:06,592
even though
he never had one.

1445
01:44:08,112 --> 01:44:09,751
I'm so sorry.

1446
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:15,549
A photo album?

1447
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:18,229
- Photos.
- Evan?

1448
01:44:20,268 --> 01:44:23,467
The damage is irreparable.

1449
01:44:28,586 --> 01:44:31,785
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

1450
01:44:41,502 --> 01:44:43,781
Mum?

1451
01:44:43,862 --> 01:44:46,900
Um, did you remember to bring

1452
01:44:46,981 --> 01:44:49,060
those home movies
that we used to make?

1453
01:44:50,099 --> 01:44:51,899
Yeah, they're right here.

1454
01:44:53,338 --> 01:44:57,258
Good, because I really like
to watch them.

1455
01:45:00,936 --> 01:45:02,456
So that's good.

1456
01:45:06,975 --> 01:45:09,454
I think it's best we
transfer him to Bellevue

1457
01:45:09,534 --> 01:45:10,974
first thing in the morning.

1458
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:54,680
'If anyone finds this,

1459
01:45:54,761 --> 01:45:59,199
... it means that my plan
didn't work ...

1460
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,599
... and I'm already dead.'

1461
01:46:03,159 --> 01:46:05,957
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds.

1462
01:46:06,038 --> 01:46:09,157
'If I can somehow go back ...

1463
01:46:09,236 --> 01:46:11,556
... to the beginning of all of this ...

1464
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:16,115
... I might be able to save her.'

1465
01:46:27,871 --> 01:46:30,190
I'm trying to have a baby.

1466
01:46:41,068 --> 01:46:42,147
Go away.

1467
01:46:56,383 --> 01:46:57,903
Something's wrong!

1468
01:46:57,982 --> 01:46:59,622
It's killing me!

1469
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:04,061
Make it stop! Oh!

1470
01:47:04,141 --> 01:47:05,940
Heart rate is decelerating.

1471
01:47:06,021 --> 01:47:08,020
What's happening?!

1472
01:47:08,099 --> 01:47:11,658
You have no lifeline, no soul.
You were never meant to be.

1473
01:47:11,739 --> 01:47:13,139
He's choking himself!

1474
01:47:13,218 --> 01:47:14,858
No!

1475
01:47:14,937 --> 01:47:18,816
Okay, let's do a rapid sequence
intubation for a c-section, stat!

1476
01:47:18,896 --> 01:47:22,215
- Save him!
- Not getting enough oxygen!

1477
01:47:22,296 --> 01:47:25,214
- We're losing him, we're losing him!
- No!

1478
01:47:25,295 --> 01:47:27,294
Before you were born,

1479
01:47:27,374 --> 01:47:29,814
I was pregnant three times,

1480
01:47:29,893 --> 01:47:32,093
but they were all stillbirths.

1481
01:47:32,173 --> 01:47:35,252
I've kind of thought of you
as my miracle baby ever since.

1482
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:38,731
Not again!

1483
01:47:38,811 --> 01:47:41,810
No!

1484
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:45,689
I couldn't stand my dad,

1485
01:47:45,769 --> 01:47:49,607
but I knew that if I went
to live with my mum,

1486
01:47:49,688 --> 01:47:52,167
I would never see you again.

1487
01:48:17,839 --> 01:48:20,118
Kayleigh and Tommy!

1488
01:48:22,598 --> 01:48:24,878
I missed you!

1489
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:27,916
I'll never let you guys
out of my sight again.

1490
01:48:39,073 --> 01:48:41,792
Yeah!

1491
01:48:45,272 --> 01:48:47,711
True happiness can only
be achieved through sacrifice,

1492
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:49,870
like the sacrifices
our parents have made.

1493
01:48:49,951 --> 01:48:52,390
Whoo-hoo! Great! Tommy!
