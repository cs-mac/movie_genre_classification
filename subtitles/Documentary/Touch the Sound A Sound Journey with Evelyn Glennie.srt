1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,700
Marta.

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,600
Curtain!

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,300
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,900
Loud was the voice
Of the lonely goatherd

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,500
Folks in a town
That was quite remote heard

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,100
Lusty and clear
From the goatherd's throat heard

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,900
Marta. Marta!

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,100
Gretl, the prince!

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,100
A prince on the bridge
Of a castle moat heard

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,700
Men on a road
With a load to tote heard

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,300
Men in the midst
Of a table d'hôte heard

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,700
Men drinking beer
With the foam afloat heard

13
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,300
One little girl
ln a pale pink coat heard

14
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,100
She yodeled back
To the lonely goatherd

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,500
Soon her mama
With a gleaming gloat heard

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,100
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,900
One little girl
ln a pale pink coat heard

18
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,500
She yodeled back
To the lonely goatherd

19
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,100
Soon her mama
With a gleaming gloat heard

20
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

21
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,700
Happy are they

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,700
Soon the duet will become a trio

23
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,700
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

24
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,300
Very good!

25
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,900
Wonderful!

26
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
-Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max?
-Yes, can we?

27
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Of course you may, my darlings.

28
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner
to send the bill to your father?

29
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,100
Well done, fräulein.

30
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,300
I really am very much impressed.

31
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,500
They're your children, captain.

32
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,600
My dear, is there anything
you can't do?

33
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,100
Well, I'm not sure
I'll make a good nun.

34
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,300
If you have any problems,
I'd be happy to help you.

35
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,700
Attention, everyone!

36
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,100
I have an announcement to make.
Surprise! Surprise!

37
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,600
Today, after a long
and desperate search. . .

38
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,700
. . .I have found a most exciting
entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

39
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,600
Congratulations, Max.

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,700
And who will you
be exploiting this time?

41
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,500
-The Saint lgnatius Choir?
-Guess again.

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,900
Well, let me see now.
The Klopmann Choir?

43
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,400
-No, no, no, no.
-No, no?

44
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,800
Tell us.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,300
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,300
What a charming idea!

47
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,300
Whose family?

48
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,700
Yours.

49
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,100
They'll be the talk of the festival.

50
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,700
-Well, now, what's so funny?
-You are, Max.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're expensive, but very funny.

52
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,900
-They'll be a sensation!
-No, Max.

53
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,300
It's a wonderful idea.
Fresh, original.

54
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,100
Max! My children
do not sing in public.

55
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,600
You can't blame me for trying.

56
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,700
Children, who shall we hear
from next?

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,500
Who?

58
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Yes.

59
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,200
The vote is unanimous.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
You, captain.

61
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,900
Me?

62
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,900
-I don't understand.
-Please.

63
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
No, no, no, no.

64
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,100
I'm told that you were quite good.

65
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,500
-That was a very, very long time ago.
-I remember, Father.

66
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,500
-Play us something we know.
-Oh, please, Father.

67
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Well. . . .

68
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,200
-Why didn't you tell me?
-What?

69
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,700
To bring along my harmonica.

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,000
Edelweiss

71
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,200
Edelweiss

72
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,900
Edelweiss

73
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Every morning you greet me

74
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Small and white

75
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,100
Clean and bright

76
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,000
You look happy...

77
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,900
... to meet me

78
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,300
Blossom of snow

79
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,500
May you bloom and grow

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,900
Bloom and grow forever

81
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,300
Edelweiss

82
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,100
Edelweiss

83
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,600
Bless my homeland forever

84
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,900
-Edelweiss
-Edelweiss

85
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,500
-Edelweiss
-Edelweiss

86
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,900
Every morning you greet me

87
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,500
-Small and white
-Small and white

88
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,100
-Clean and bright
-Clean and bright

89
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,700
You look happy...

90
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,400
... to meet me

91
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Blossom of snow

92
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,100
May you bloom and grow

93
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:47,100
Bloom and grow forever

94
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,800
Edelweiss

95
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Edelweiss

96
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:03,700
Bless my homeland forever

97
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,100
Anytime you say the word, Georg,
you can be part of my new act:

98
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,700
The von Trapp Family Singers.

99
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,100
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

100
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,700
Let's really fill this house
with music.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,800
You must give a grand
and glorious party for me.

102
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,700
-A party?
-Yes, Father, please!

103
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,100
It's high time
I met all your friends. . .

104
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,800
. . .and they met me.
Don't you agree?

105
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,200
-I see what you mean.
-Oh, please!

106
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Children, it's bedtime.
Come now, say good night.

107
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,600
Good night, Father.

108
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,500
-Good night.
-Good night, Baroness Schraeder.

109
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,300
Good night, Father.

110
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,900
Good night, Uncle Max.

111
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,800
It'll be my first party, Father!

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,500
-Captain.
-Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

113
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,700
-Good evening, Herr Zeller.
-Baroness.

114
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,300
How do you do? Good evening.

115
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,400
Did you notice the obvious
display of the Austrian flag?

116
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,900
The women look so beautiful.

117
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,400
I think they look ugly.

118
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,400
You're just scared of them.

119
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

120
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,800
-I think the men look beautiful.
-How would you know?

121
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

122
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,100
Nobody.

123
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,700
Oh, yes, you are.

124
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,500
May I have this dance?

125
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,100
I'd be delighted, young man.

126
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,100
Why didn't you tell me
you could dance?

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,100
We feared you'd make us all dance.
The von Trapp Family Dancers.

128
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,000
What are they playing?

129
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,700
It's the Laendler.
An Austrian folk dance.

130
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
-Show me.
-I haven't danced since I was little.

131
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,000
You remember. Please?

132
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
-Well. . . .
-Please.

133
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,500
All right. Come on over here.

134
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,700
Now you bow and I curtsy.

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,400
-Like this?
-Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

136
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,200
One, two, three. One, two, three.

137
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,900
One, two, three, step together.
Now, step hop, step hop.

138
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,700
Now turn under. Not quite.

139
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,700
This way. Hop step, hop.
And under.

140
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,000
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

141
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
Do allow me, will you?

142
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
I don't remember anymore.

143
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,300
-Your face is all red.
-Is it?

144
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,600
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,100
Why, that was beautifully done.

146
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,200
What a lovely couple you make.

147
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
It's time the children
said good night.

148
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,900
We'll be in the hall.

149
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,900
-We have something special prepared.
-Right!

150
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,300
Yes, come on!

151
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,100
All that needless worrying, Georg.

152
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,300
You thought you wouldn't find
a friend at the party.

153
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,500
-A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?
-Oh, I don't know.

154
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
It seemed rather warm to me.

155
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,900
Ladies and gentlemen.

156
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,500
The children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.

157
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,800
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,600
And the bells in the steeple too

159
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,700
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

160
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,200
Is popping up to say "coo-coo"

161
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
Coo-coo

162
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,500
Coo-coo

163
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,800
Regretfully they tell us

164
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,300
But firmly they compel us

165
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
To say goodbye

166
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,800
To you

167
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,500
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

168
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,500
I hate to go
And leave this pretty sight

169
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,600
So long, farewell,
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

170
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,700
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

171
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,300
So long, farewell
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

172
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,400
I'd like to stay
And taste my first champagne

173
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,000
-Yes?
-No.

174
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,600
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

175
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,800
I leave and heave a sigh
And say goodbye

176
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,800
Goodbye

177
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,700
I'm glad to go

178
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,700
I cannot tell a lie

179
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,900
I flit, I float

180
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,500
I fleetly flee, I fly

181
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,600
The sun has gone to bed

182
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,400
And so must I

183
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,900
So long

184
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,600
Farewell

185
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,000
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

186
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,300
Goodbye

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,400
Goodbye

188
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,200
Goodbye

189
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:58,500
Goodbye

190
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,000
Extraordinary!
What they'd do at the festival.

191
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,600
Young lady,
I must have a word with you.

192
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,400
Georg, you won't let this girl
get away. She must join the party.

193
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,000
-No, really l--
-Stop. Stop it now.

194
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,100
-Georg, please.
-You can if you want to, fräulein.

195
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,600
I insist.
You will be my dinner partner.

196
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,700
This is business.
Franz. . .

197
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,000
. . .set another place next to mine
for Fräulein Maria.

198
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,700
-Whatever you say.
-It appears to be all arranged.

199
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
-It does.
-I'm not suitably dressed.

200
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,700
You can change. We'll wait.

201
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,000
Captain, you must be very proud
of your youngsters.

202
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,000
I am, thank you.

203
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,600
Is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in our country. . .

204
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,200
. . .than the innocent voices
of our children?

205
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,900
Oh, come now, baron.

206
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,700
Would you have us believe that Austria
holds a monopoly on virtue?

207
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song. . .

208
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,000
. . .to ugly German threats.

209
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,500
The ostrich buries his head
in the sand. . .

210
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,500
. . .and sometimes in the flag.

211
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Perhaps those who would warn you that
the Anschluss is coming, and it is. . .

212
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,900
. . .would get further with you by setting
their words to music.

213
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,500
If the Nazis take over Austria, you
will be the entire trumpet section.

214
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
You flatter me.

215
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.

216
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,400
It's very kind of you
to offer to help me, baroness.

217
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm delighted, Maria.

218
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,200
I really don't think I have anything
that would be appropriate.

219
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Now where is that lovely little thing
you were wearing the other evening?

220
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,000
When the captain couldn't keep
his eyes off you.

221
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

222
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,000
Come, my dear, we are women.

223
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

224
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,000
-Here we are.
-The captain notices everybody.

225
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,900
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

226
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,400
You are quite attractive, you know.

227
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,200
The captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.

228
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,000
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

229
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,600
Not at all.

230
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,400
I've never done a thing to--

231
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
You don't have to, my dear.

232
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,400
Nothing's more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.

233
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,000
-In love with him?
-Of course.

234
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,100
What makes it so nice is
he thinks he's in love with you.

235
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,300
But that's not true.

236
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,000
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

237
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,000
And you know, you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

238
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Don't take it to heart.

239
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,300
He'll get over it soon enough,
I think.

240
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,400
Men do, you know.

241
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Then I should go.

242
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,100
I mustn't stay here.

243
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,400
-Is there something I can do to help?
-No, nothing.

244
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,300
Yes.

245
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,200
Don't say a word to the captain.

246
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,200
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

247
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,200
Goodbye, Maria.

248
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,700
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

249
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,400
Champagne, darling.

250
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,600
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

251
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,600
-You know something.
-Perhaps.

252
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,200
If you're so clever, tell me how to
get fräulein to influence Georg.

253
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,000
I want those children in the festival.

254
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,600
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

255
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,500
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

256
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,200
I thought of that.

257
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Well, if it's a matter of influence. . .

258
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,800
. . .maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

259
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,000
-Two.
-Three.

260
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
-Four.
-Five.

261
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,800
-Six.
-Seven.

262
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,600
Eight.

263
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,600
-Four.
-Two.

264
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,400
-Seven.
-Five.

265
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,800
-Two.
-Six.

266
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Isn't this fun?

267
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,800
-Four.
-I'm number five.

268
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,100
-Oh, yes.
-Eight.

269
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,600
-Two.
-Four.

270
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
Six.

271
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,800
Two.

272
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,700
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind
if we stop now? We're tired.

273
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,800
Whatever you want, dear.

274
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,000
We'll do it again tomorrow.

275
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,800
The country's so restful, isn't it?

276
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Have some lemonade.

277
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,900
There must be an easier way.

278
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,400
I get a fiendish delight thinking
of you as the mother of seven.

279
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,100
How do you plan to do it?

280
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
Darling, haven't you ever heard. . .

281
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
. . .of a delightful little thing
called boarding school?

282
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
Baroness Machiavelli.

283
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,000
Uncle Max, where's Father?

284
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
I think he's in the house.

285
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,600
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pussies?

286
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,500
-Nothing.
-I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

287
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,600
What for?

288
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,200
Let's make believe we're on-stage
at the festival.

289
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,100
-I don't feel like singing.
-Not without Fräulein Maria.

290
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,600
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

291
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,700
Everybody into the group.
Get in your places.

292
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,600
Now be cheerful, right?
Give us the key, Liesl.

293
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Now, impress me.

294
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,100
Gretl, why don't you sing?

295
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,700
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

296
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,600
But you sang so beautifully
the night of the party.

297
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,100
Come on, all of you.
Try something you know.

298
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,800
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

299
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,600
All right, Liesl.

300
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,600
The hills are alive

301
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:22,200
With the sound of music

302
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,200
With songs they have sung

303
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:36,000
For a thousand years

304
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,800
The hills fill my heart

305
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:49,400
With the sound of music

306
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,300
They wanted to sing for me,
bless their hearts.

307
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,400
That's lovely, lovely.
Don't stop.

308
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,000
-Something long and cool, Georg?
-No, thank you, darling.

309
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,700
-Father?
-Yes, Brigitta?

310
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,300
Is it true Fräulein Maria
isn't coming back?

311
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,500
Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?

312
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,400
-Pink lemonade.
-Laced with lemonade.

313
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,500
I don't believe it, Father.

314
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,800
-What?
-About Fräulein Maria.

315
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,400
Oh, Fräulein Maria!

316
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
I'm sure I did.

317
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,100
She said she missed her life
at the abbey.

318
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,400
She had to leave us.

319
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,200
And that's all there is to it.

320
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
I think I'm brave enough to try
some of that.

321
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,200
-She didn't even say goodbye.
-She did in her note.

322
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,200
That isn't the same thing.

323
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,100
Not too sweet, not too sour.

324
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,700
Just too pink.

325
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Father, who is our new governess
going to be?

326
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Well. . .

327
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,700
. . .you're not going to have
a governess anymore.

328
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,600
-We're not?
-No.

329
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,800
You're going to have a new mother.

330
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
A new mother?

331
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,600
We talked about it last night.
It's all settled.

332
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,400
And we're all going to be very happy.

333
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,400
Well, all right, all right.
Run off and play.

334
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes, my children?

335
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,500
-My name is Liesl.
-Yes, Liesl?

336
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,700
We, my brothers and sisters,
want to see Fräulein Maria.

337
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,800
Fräulein Maria?

338
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,400
Oh, Maria.

339
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,000
Come in, please.

340
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,200
Wait here.

341
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you inquired about Maria.

342
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,400
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here?

343
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,100
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
-But you've got to!

344
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
-She's our governess.
-We want her back.

345
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,400
She didn't even say goodbye.

346
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,300
All we want to do is talk to her.

347
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,800
I'm very sorry,
but Maria is in seclusion.

348
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,000
-She hasn't been seeing anyone.
-She'll see us.

349
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,700
I want to show her my finger.

350
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,600
Some other time, dear.

351
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,200
I'll tell her you were here.

352
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
-It was sweet of you to call.
-We have to speak to her!

353
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Run along, children.
Run along home.

354
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,800
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

355
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Sister Margaretta, please.

356
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,000
-Goodbye, children.
-Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

357
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,300
What was that about, Sister?

358
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,600
The von Trapp children,
Reverend Mother.

359
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,200
They want to see Maria.

360
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,700
Has she spoken yet?
Has she told you anything?

361
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,800
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

362
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Poor child.

363
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,000
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here. . .

364
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,400
. . .and yet she's unhappy too.

365
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

366
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,400
Bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

367
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Yes, Reverend Mother.

368
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,900
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant
to the robing room.

369
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,000
God bless you, my daughter.

370
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,600
Yes, bring her in.

371
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,400
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

372
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,500
Reverend Mother.

373
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,400
Why did they send you back to us?

374
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,100
They didn't send me back.
I left.

375
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,000
Sit down, Maria.

376
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,200
Tell me what happened.

377
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,400
I was frightened.

378
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,000
-Frightened? Were they unkind to you.
-Oh, no!

379
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,800
No, I was confused. I felt. . . .

380
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I've never felt that way before.

381
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,000
I couldn't stay. I knew that here
I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

382
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,800
Maria, our abbey is not to be used
as an escape.

383
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,200
What is it you can't face?

384
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,400
I can't face him again.

385
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,700
Him?

386
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

387
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,000
Captain von Trapp?

388
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,800
-Are you in love with him?
-I don't know!

389
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
I don't know. I--

390
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,600
The baroness said I was.
She said that he was in love with me.

391
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,400
But I didn't want to believe it.

392
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,600
There were times we looked
at each other.

393
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,300
I could hardly breathe.

394
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,300
-Did you let him see your feelings?
-I don't know.

395
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,400
That's what's torturing me.
I was on God's errand.

396
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,400
To have asked for his love would have
been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

397
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,200
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

398
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
-Please help me.
-Maria.

399
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,000
The love of a man and a woman is holy.
You have a great capacity to love.

400
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,000
You must find out how God
wants you to spend your love.

401
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,000
But I pledged my life to God.
I pledged my life to his service.

402
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,400
My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.

403
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,800
No.

404
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
You must find out.

405
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,900
You must go back.

406
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,000
You can't ask me to do that.

407
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,600
-Please let me stay. I beg--
-Maria.

408
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,600
These walls were not built
to shut out problems.

409
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,300
You have to face them.

410
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,000
You have to live the life
you were born to live.

411
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,800
Climb every mountain

412
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,600
Search high and low

413
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,400
Follow every byway

414
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,700
Every path you know

415
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,400
Climb every mountain

416
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,800
Ford every stream

417
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,300
Follow every rainbow

418
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,600
Till you find your dream

419
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,800
A dream that will need

420
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,700
All the love you can give

421
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,700
Every day of your life

422
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,100
For as long as you live

423
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,500
Climb every mountain

424
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,900
Ford every stream

425
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,500
Follow every rainbow

426
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:30,800
Till you find your dream

427
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,200
A dream that will need

428
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,800
All the love you can give

429
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,400
Every day of your life

430
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:50,800
For as long as you live

431
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,300
Climb every mountain

432
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,300
Ford every stream

433
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,400
Follow every rainbow

434
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,700
Till you find...

435
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:18,500
... your dream

436
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Now, it's not like my children
to be secretive.

437
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
We're not being secretive, Father.

438
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,400
And it's not like my children
to be late for dinner.

439
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,000
-We lost track of the time.
-I see.

440
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,000
Who's going to be the first one
to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

441
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,200
Brigitta. Liesl.

442
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,700
Where do you think we were, Father?

443
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,800
If you don't believe us, you must have
some idea of where you think we were.

444
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,000
-Marta.
-Yes, Father.

445
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,400
You tell me.

446
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,100
Friedrich told you, Father.
We were berry picking.

447
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,400
-I forgot! You were berry picking.
-Yes, we love berry picking.

448
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,700
All afternoon?

449
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,600
-We picked thousands.
-Thousands?

450
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,600
-They were all over the place.
-What kind of berries?

451
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,000
-Blueberries, sir.
-Blueberries.

452
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,100
It's too early for blueberries.

453
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
-They were strawberries.
-Strawberries?

454
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,800
It's been so cold lately,
they turned blue.

455
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,500
Very well. Show me the berries.

456
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,800
-We. . . .
-Well. . . .

457
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,700
-Show me the berries you picked.
-We don't have them.

458
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,100
You don't have them?
What happened to them?

459
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,000
-We. . . .
-We ate them.

460
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,700
-You ate them?
-Yes!

461
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,400
-They were so good.
-Delicious.

462
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,800
Very well.

463
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:02,000
Since you've obviously stuffed
yourselves on thousands of berries. . .

464
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,000
. . .you can't be hungry anymore,
so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt. . .

465
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,000
. . .to skip your dinner.

466
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,400
It's your fault.
We should have told him the truth.

467
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,600
And made him boiling mad at us?

468
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,600
It's better than starving to death.

469
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,600
We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

470
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,900
My stomach's making noises.

471
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,000
The least they could have done
was to let us say hello.

472
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,800
-I wonder what grass tastes like.
-I feel awful.

473
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,300
When Fräulein Maria wanted to feel
better she used to sing that song.

474
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,300
Let's try it.

475
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,100
Raindrops on roses

476
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,300
And whiskers on kittens

477
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,500
Bright copper kettles

478
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,700
And warm woolen mittens

479
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,700
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

480
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,700
These are a few of my favorite things

481
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Why don't I feel better?

482
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,200
Girls in white dresses

483
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,400
With blue satin sashes

484
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,100
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

485
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,500
-Silver white winters...
-Fräulein Maria's back!

486
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,900
... that melt into springs

487
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,400
These are a few of my favorite things

488
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,600
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

489
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,900
When I'm feeling sad

490
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,200
I simply remember my favorite things

491
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,600
And then I don 't feel

492
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:53,300
So bad

493
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,500
-Children, I'm so glad to see you.
-We missed you.

494
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
I missed you.

495
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,000
-Kurt, how are you?
-Hungry.

496
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,000
-What happened to your finger?
-It got caught.

497
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,300
-Caught in what?
-Friedrich's teeth.

498
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,600
-Liesl, you all right?
-Just fair.

499
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,600
-Any telegrams been delivered lately?
-None at all.

500
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,200
But I'm learning to accept it.
I'll be glad when school begins.

501
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,000
Liesl, you can't use school to escape
your problems. You have to face them.

502
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,600
I have so much to tell you.

503
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,700
We have things to tell you too.

504
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,600
The most important thing is
that Father is going to be married.

505
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Married?

506
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

507
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,200
Oh, I see.

508
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,200
Father, look!
Fräulein Maria's back!

509
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Good evening, captain.

510
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,200
Good evening.

511
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,400
Everyone inside for dinner.

512
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,200
Dinner!

513
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,600
You left without saying goodbye.
Even to the children.

514
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,100
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

515
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,200
Why did you?

516
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,100
Please don't ask me.
The reason no longer exists.

517
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Fräulein Maria, you've returned.

518
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,100
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

519
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,400
I wish you every happiness,
baroness.

520
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,200
You too, captain.
The children say you're to marry.

521
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Thank you, my dear.

522
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,400
You are back to stay?

523
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,600
Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.

524
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,500
There you are.

525
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,700
I must speak to cook
about the schnitzel.

526
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,100
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

527
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,400
And it makes you much too quiet
at the dinner table.

528
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,500
Or was it the wine?

529
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,500
Undoubtedly the wine.

530
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,200
You have no idea
the trouble I'm having. . .

531
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,100
. . .trying to decide on
a wedding present for you.

532
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,400
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

533
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,100
But I do want you to have
some little trifle for the occasion.

534
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,600
At first I thought
of a fountain pen. . .

535
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,000
. . .but you've already got one.

536
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,100
Then I thought perhaps a villa
in the south of France. . .

537
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,900
. . .but they are so difficult
to gift-wrap.

538
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,400
Oh, Georg, how do you
feel about yachts?

539
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,900
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean. . .

540
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,700
. . .or a tiny one
for your bathtub, huh?

541
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
-Elsa.
-Where to go on our honeymoon?

542
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,500
Now, that's a real problem.

543
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,000
A trip around the world
would be lovely. And then I said:

544
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,000
"Oh, Elsa, there must be
someplace better to go. "

545
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,500
-But don't worry, darling, I'll--
-Elsa.

546
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,400
Yes, Georg.

547
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,600
It's no use. . .

548
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,100
. . .you and l.

549
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,700
I'm being dishonest to both of us. . .

550
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,600
. . .and utterly unfair to you.

551
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,300
-When two people talk of marriage--
-No, don't.

552
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,100
Don't say another word, please.

553
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,100
You see, there are other things
I've been thinking of.

554
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,500
Fond as I am of you, I really don't
think you're the right man for me.

555
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,300
You're much too independent.

556
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,200
And I need someone
who needs me desperately. . .

557
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,300
. . .or at least needs
my money desperately.

558
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,100
I've enjoyed every moment we've had
together and I do thank you for that.

559
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,600
Now, if you'll forgive me. . .

560
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
. . .I'll go inside,
pack my little bags. . .

561
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,400
. . .and return to Vienna
where I belong.

562
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,300
And somewhere out there. . .

563
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,800
. . .is a young lady who, I think. . .

564
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,300
. . .will never be a nun.

565
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,100
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

566
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,900
Hello.

567
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,900
I thought I just might find you here.

568
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,100
Was there something you wanted?

569
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

570
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,700
Please.

571
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,900
May l?

572
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,300
You know, I was thinking
and I was wondering two things:

573
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,500
Why did you run away to the abbey?

574
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,800
And what was it
that made you come back?

575
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,700
Well, I had an obligation
to fulfill. . .

576
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,900
. . .and I came back to fulfill it.

577
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,900
Is that all?

578
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,300
And I missed the children.

579
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,700
Yes.

580
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,700
-Only the children?
-No. Yes.

581
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,600
-Isn't it right that I missed them?
-Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

582
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,300
I was only hoping that perhaps you. . . .

583
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,100
Perhaps you might. . . .

584
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,900
Yes?

585
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,700
Well, nothing was the same
when you were away. . .

586
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,500
. . .and it'll be all wrong again
after you leave. . .

587
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,300
. . .and I just thought perhaps
you might change your mind.

588
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,200
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be
able to make things fine for you.

589
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,700
Maria. . . .

590
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,100
-There isn't going to be any baroness.
-There isn't?

591
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,700
No.

592
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,700
I don't understand.

593
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Well, we've called off our engagement,
you see, and--

594
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,500
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yes. You are?

595
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,700
-You did?
-Yes.

596
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,100
Well, you can't marry someone
when you're. . .

597
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
. . .in love with someone else. . .

598
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,200
. . .can you?

599
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,800
The Reverend Mother always says:

600
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,300
"When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere He opens a window. "

601
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,300
What else does
the Reverend Mother say?

602
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,500
That you have to look for your life.

603
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,500
Is that why you came back?

604
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,900
And have you found it. . .

605
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,900
. . .Maria?

606
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,500
I think I have.

607
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,500
I know I have.

608
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,500
I love you.

609
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,700
Oh, can this be happening to me?

610
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,500
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

611
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

612
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:07,500
But somewhere
ln my wicked, miserable past

613
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,500
There must have been a moment of truth

614
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,900
For here you are
Standing there loving me

615
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:27,400
Whether or not you should

616
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,500
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

617
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:42,700
I must have done something good

618
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,700
Nothing comes from nothing

619
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,500
Nothing ever could

620
00:51:52,300 --> 00:52:00,900
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

621
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:11,400
I must have done something good

622
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,900
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

623
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,100
That night at dinner, when you sat
on that ridiculous pine cone.

624
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,500
What?

625
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,100
I knew the first time you blew
that silly whistle.

626
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,900
Oh, my love.

627
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:41,100
For here you are
Standing there loving me

628
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,600
Whether or not you should

629
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:56,700
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

630
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:04,900
I must have done something good

631
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,300
Nothing comes from nothing

632
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,900
Nothing ever could

633
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,700
So somewhere in my youth...

634
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,100
...or childhood

635
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:30,400
I must have done something

636
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:44,500
Something good

637
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,300
Maria.

638
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,500
Is there anyone I should go to,
to ask permission to marry you?

639
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,700
-Why don't we ask--
-The children?

640
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,700
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

641
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,000
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

642
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,900
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

643
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,300
A flibbertigibbet

644
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,700
A will-o '-the-wisp
A clown

645
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,200
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

646
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,500
Many a thing she ought to understand

647
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,300
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

648
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,500
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

649
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,600
Oh, how do you solve
A problem like Maria?

650
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:36,300
How do you hold a moonbeam
ln your hand?

651
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,700
Herr Detweiler!

652
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,800
-Heil Hitler.
-Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

653
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,200
Perhaps you've not heard.
I am now the Gauleiter.

654
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,900
Heil Hitler.

655
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,900
Heil Hitler.

656
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,400
I've come from
Captain von Trapp's house.

657
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,300
The only one in the area
not flying the Third Reich flag. . .

658
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,700
. . .since the Anschluss.

659
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,000
-But we have dealt with that.
-I don't--

660
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,100
The housekeeper told me
that I would find you here.

661
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,900
The only thing she'd tell me.

662
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,900
What kind of information
are you looking for?

663
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,900
When will the captain return?

664
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,200
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
He's not been in touch with us.

665
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,100
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated
with his children in over a month?

666
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,100
How many men do you know. . .

667
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,500
. . .who communicate with their children
while honeymooning?

668
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,000
Upon his return, he'll fill
his proper position in the new order.

669
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,500
Naturally.
And may I congratulate you. . .

670
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,200
. . .and your people in allowing the
festival to go on tonight as planned.

671
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,100
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.

672
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,500
Singing and music will
show this to the world.

673
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,300
Austria is the same.

674
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,500
Heil Hitler.

675
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,100
Heil Hitler.

676
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,900
Come, let's go home.

677
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,500
-Why was he so cross?
-Everybody's cross these days.

678
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,900
Maybe the flag with the black spider
makes people nervous.

679
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,900
-Will Father be in trouble?
-He doesn't have to be.

680
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,800
The thing to do
is to get along with everybody.

681
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,100
Remember that tonight at the concert.

682
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,100
Are we really going to sing
before a lot of people?

683
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,300
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:

684
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,900
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,
Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

685
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,300
-Why am I always last?
-Because you are the most important.

686
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,500
There we go.

687
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,500
Are you sure Father will approve
of our singing in public?

688
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,900
He'll be pleased and proud.

689
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,700
-Liesl, do you think so?
-Don't you trust me?

690
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,900
No.

691
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,100
You're a very intelligent girl.

692
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,700
Liesl. Liesl!

693
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,800
Rolf!

694
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,700
I'm so glad to see you.
It's been su--

695
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,900
Good afternoon.

696
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,100
Give this to your father
as soon as he's home.

697
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,600
-He's on his honeymoon.
-I know.

698
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,000
-You do?
-We make it our business to know all.

699
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,100
-Who's "we"?
-See that he gets it.

700
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,500
-What is it?
-It's a telegram from Berlin.

701
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,800
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

702
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,700
I'm occupied
with more important matters.

703
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,300
And your father had better be too.

704
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,000
But, Rolf!

705
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,800
Father!

706
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,600
-We didn't expect you so soon.
-Hello, hello!

707
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,500
We didn't expect you home
until next week!

708
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:52,900
-Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?
-Hello! How are you?

709
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,200
Why didn't you call us?

710
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,300
We couldn't get through.

711
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,400
I had nothing to do with that.

712
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,600
We came back as fast as we could.

713
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,000
Well, well, well! We missed you!

714
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,500
-We missed you!
-We missed kissing you.

715
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,500
We missed all the noise
in the morning.

716
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,700
-Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
-Oh, you came back just in time.

717
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,600
Look, Fräulein Maria--

718
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,300
I mean Mother.

719
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,200
We're going to sing
in the festival tonight.

720
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
We've been having a lovely time!

721
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,600
We've been rehearsing all--

722
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,300
Surprise! Surprise!

723
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,300
Surprises for you on the terrace.

724
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,600
We'll talk about this.

725
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,900
I would've told you but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.

726
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,600
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

727
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,300
They'll be the talk of the festival.
Imagine, seven children in one family!

728
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,100
Max!

729
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,400
Somehow I recall having made it
quite clear to you. . .

730
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,300
. . .how I feel about my family
singing in public!

731
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,100
The committee was enchanted.

732
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,400
-What did they say?
-I have never heard such enthusiasm.

733
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,700
-Don't you think just this once--?
-Absolutely out of the question.

734
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,900
-Georg, this is for Austria.
-For Austria?

735
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,400
-There is no Austria!
-But the Anschluss was peaceful.

736
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,000
-Let's at least be grateful for that.
-Grateful?

737
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,300
You know, Max. . .

738
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,300
. . .sometimes I don't believe
I know you.

739
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,200
Father, I forgot.

740
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,500
This is for you.

741
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,800
Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.

742
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,500
You must convince him.

743
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,300
Max, I can't ask him
to be less than he is.

744
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,700
Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing, well. . .

745
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,100
. . .it will be a reflection
on Austria.

746
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,100
Oh, I know.
It wouldn't do me any good either.

747
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,700
Mother? That sounds so nice.

748
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,500
-I like calling you "Mother. "
-I like hearing it.

749
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:11,300
You love Father very much.
I can tell you do.

750
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,300
Very much.

751
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,700
Mother, what do you do when you
think you love someone?

752
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:21,400
I mean, when you stop loving someone
or he stops loving you?

753
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
Well, you cry a little.

754
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,400
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

755
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,900
It always does.

756
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,600
There are so many things I think
I should know but I don't.

757
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,700
-I really don't.
-How can you?

758
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,100
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

759
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,300
-Then you feel it's just beginning?
-Yes!

760
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,700
It was that way with me. And for you
it will be just as wonderful.

761
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,100
Do you really think so?

762
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,800
When you're 16 going on 17

763
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,500
Waiting for life to start

764
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,800
Somebody kind
Who touches your mind

765
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,100
Will suddenly touch your heart

766
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,200
When that happens

767
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,500
After it happens

768
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:13,400
Nothing is quite the same

769
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,100
Somehow I know

770
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,500
I'll jump up and go

771
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,800
If ever he calls my name

772
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,800
Gone are your old ideas of life

773
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,100
The old ideas grow dim

774
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,500
Lo and behold
You're someone's wife

775
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,200
And you belong to him

776
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,500
You may think this kind of adventure

777
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,500
Never may come to you

778
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,700
Darling, 16 going on 17

779
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Wait a year...

780
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,300
-I'll wait a year
-...or two

781
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:13,700
Just wait a year...

782
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:22,800
...or two

783
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,600
Liesl.

784
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,700
What is it?

785
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,900
Berlin.

786
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,200
They've offered me a commission.

787
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,900
I've been requested
to accept immediately. . .

788
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,900
. . .and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

789
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,300
I knew this would happen.
I didn't think it would be so soon.

790
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,900
To refuse them would be fatal
for all of us.

791
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,700
And joining them would be unthinkable.

792
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,300
Get the children all together.

793
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,700
Don't say anything to worry them.
Just get them ready.

794
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,900
We've got to get out of Austria. . .

795
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,100
. . .and this house. . .

796
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,700
. . .tonight.

797
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,200
This strains my back
and breaks my heart. . .

798
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,100
. . .when I think of the children
missing the festival.

799
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,000
By your announcement
we'll be over the border.

800
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,500
Do you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making?

801
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,000
You have no choice.

802
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,900
I know. That's why I'm making it.

803
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,700
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

804
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:32,100
Because he doesn't want anyone
to hear us.

805
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,000
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

806
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,600
They'll be able to answer honestly
they didn't know anything.

807
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,900
-Will we be coming back here?
-Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

808
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,800
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push
the car all the way to Switzerland?

809
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,800
Something wrong
with your car, captain?

810
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,300
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

811
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,100
Karl.

812
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,300
Fix Captain von Trapp's car
so that it will start.

813
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,300
Excellent, Karl.

814
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,600
I've not asked you where you
and your family are going.

815
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,100
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

816
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,900
Apparently we both suffer
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

817
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,100
You never answered the telegram. . .

818
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,500
. . .from the Admiral of the Navy
of the Third Reich.

819
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,100
I was under the impression,
Herr Zeller. . .

820
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,700
. . .that the contents of telegrams
in Austria are private!

821
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,800
At least, the Austria I know.

822
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,500
I have my orders. . .

823
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,800
. . .to take you
to Bremerhaven tonight. . .

824
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,100
. . .where you will accept
your commission.

825
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,400
I'm afraid that's going to be
quite impossible.

826
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,700
You see, we. . .

827
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,900
. . .all of us, the entire family,
will be. . .

828
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,900
. . .singing in the festival tonight.

829
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,500
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

830
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,900
We couldn't possibly
let them down now.

831
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,000
-I just hope we're not too late.
-Yes.

832
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,000
You ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp. . .

833
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,600
. . .are singing in a concert?

834
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

835
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,800
Like you, Herr Zeller,
l, too, am a man of hidden talents.

836
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,700
Yes.

837
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,300
Here, program.

838
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,400
It says only the names
of the children.

839
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,800
It says
the von Trapp Family Singers. . .

840
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,900
. . .and I am the head of
the von Trapp family, am I not?

841
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,800
And these travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

842
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,100
Our costumes, naturally.

843
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,500
This night air is not good
for the children's voices.

844
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,900
Well, a slight delay in my orders
will not be serious.

845
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,500
Therefore. . .

846
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,900
. . .you will sing.

847
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,700
You will all sing.

848
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,500
But only because that's what I want.

849
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,700
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

850
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,500
And when you have finished singing. . .

851
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,900
. . .you, Captain von Trapp, will be
taken to Bremerhaven.

852
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,700
Now, if you will all get
into your car. . .

853
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,600
. . .we will escort the von Trapp Family
Singers to the festival.

854
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,500
No escort will be necessary.

855
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,100
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

856
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,700
After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds.

857
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,300
Would we?

858
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,100
No.

859
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,700
Sew, a needle pulling thread

860
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,000
La, a note to follow sew

861
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,500
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

862
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,400
A drink with jam and bread

863
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,600
Tea with jam
Jam and bread

864
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,500
-With jam
-A, B, C

865
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,800
-With jam
-Do-re-mi

866
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,500
Tea with jam and bread

867
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,000
With jam and bread

868
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,700
With jam
With jam...

869
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:40,300
...and bread

870
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,400
My fellow Austrians. . .

871
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:10,000
. . .I shall not be seeing you again,
perhaps for a very long time.

872
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,100
I would like to sing for you now. . .

873
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,000
. . .a love song.

874
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,000
I know you share this love.

875
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,800
I pray that you will never let it die.

876
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,400
Edelweiss

877
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,700
Edelweiss

878
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,500
Every morning you greet me

879
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,800
Small and white

880
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,700
Clean and bright

881
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:01,200
You look happy to meet me

882
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,900
Blossom of snow

883
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,500
May you bloom and grow

884
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:13,200
Bloom and grow forever

885
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,100
Edelweiss

886
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,800
Edelweiss

887
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,800
Bless my homeland forever

888
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,100
Edelweiss

889
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,600
Edel....

890
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,600
Small and white

891
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,500
Clean and bright

892
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,900
You look happy to meet me

893
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,600
Blossom of snow

894
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,100
May you bloom and grow

895
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:05,400
Bloom and grow forever

896
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,700
Edelweiss

897
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,600
Edelweiss

898
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:20,100
Bless my homeland forever

899
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,600
I think it'll work.

900
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,000
I shall miss all of you.

901
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,800
I shall miss the money
I could have made with you.

902
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,500
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

903
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,900
The competition has come
to its conclusion. . .

904
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:55,100
. . .except, we don't know
yet what that conclusion will be.

905
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,500
And while the judges
arrive at their decision. . .

906
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,600
. . .I have been given permission
to offer you an encore.

907
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,900
This will be the last opportunity
the von Trapps will have. . .

908
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,500
. . .of singing together
for a long, long time.

909
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:12,300
Even now, officials are waiting
in this auditorium. . .

910
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,200
. . .to escort Captain von Trapp
to his new command. . .

911
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,800
. . .in the naval forces
of the Third Reich.

912
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:27,600
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
the family von Trapp again. . .

913
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,500
. . .to bid you farewell.

914
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,900
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

915
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,300
And the bells in the steeple too

916
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,500
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

917
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,000
Is popping out to say "coo-coo"

918
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,800
Coo-coo

919
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,000
Coo-coo

920
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,800
Regretfully they tell us

921
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,700
But firmly they compel us

922
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,600
To say goodbye

923
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,800
To you

924
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,000
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

925
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,900
We hate to go
And miss this pretty sight

926
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,200
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

927
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,900
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

928
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,400
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

929
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,200
We flit, we float

930
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,100
We fleetly flee, we fly

931
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,800
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

932
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,300
The sun has gone to bed
And so must I

933
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,100
Goodbye

934
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,900
Goodbye

935
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:10,100
Goodbye

936
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:17,200
Goodbye

937
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,600
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the
decision of our distinguished judges.

938
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,300
We will start with the award
for third prize.

939
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,100
For this honor,
the judges have named. . .

940
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,800
. . .the first soloist of the choir
of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.

941
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,200
Fräulein Schweiger.

942
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,400
Second prize
to The Toby Reiser Quintet.

943
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,200
And the first prize,
the highest honor in all Austria. . .

944
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,400
. . .the von Trapp Family Singers.

945
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,900
The family von Trapp.

946
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,900
They're gone!

947
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,200
Come with me.

948
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,800
Quickly, quickly.

949
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,800
I have a place you can hide.

950
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,600
Slowly, slowly.

951
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,800
Open this gate.

952
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,400
Good evening.

953
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,200
Hurry up, woman.

954
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,400
Two men in there.

955
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,400
Six of you cover the yard.

956
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,800
You two, cover the corridor.

957
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:18,100
Reverend Mother, we didn't realize
we put the abbey in this danger.

958
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,800
No, Maria, it was right for you
to come here.

959
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,800
We thought we might borrow
your car.

960
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,900
I'm afraid our car will do you
no good now.

961
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,000
I've been listening to the wires.

962
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,600
The borders have just been closed.

963
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,400
All right,
if the borders are closed. . .

964
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,900
. . .then we'll drive up into the hills
and go over the mountains on foot.

965
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,300
-The children--
-We'll help them.

966
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,700
We can do it without help, Father.

967
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,000
Maria.

968
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,200
You will not be alone.
Remember:

969
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,400
"I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help. "

970
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,400
Yes, Mother.

971
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,800
-I'm scared.
-Me too.

972
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,500
God be with you.

973
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,600
-Mother.
-Yes?

974
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,900
Would it help if we sang
about our favorite things?

975
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,100
No, darling.
This is one time it would not help.

976
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:31,400
You must be very quiet.
Hold tight to me.

977
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,700
Let's try the roof.

978
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,800
Rolf, please.

979
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,100
No, wait.

980
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,800
Maria.

981
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,200
Children.

982
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,000
It's you we want, not them.

983
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,000
Put that down.

984
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,200
Not another move,
or I'll shoot.

985
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,800
You're only a boy.

986
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:20,200
-You don't really belong to them.
-Stay where you are.

987
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,800
Come away with us.

988
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,100
Before it's too late.

989
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,900
Not another step.
I'll kill you.

990
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:34,300
-You give that to me, Rolf.
-Did you hear me?

991
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,800
I'll kill you.

992
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,000
Rolf.

993
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,900
You'll never be one of them.

994
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,200
Lieutenant!

995
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,500
They're here!

996
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,200
They're here, lieutenant!

997
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,400
Reverend Mother.

998
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,400
I have sinned.

999
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,600
I too, Reverend Mother.

1000
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,400
What is this sin, my children?

1001
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:50,300
