1
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:38,476
Hey there!

2
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,158
Grandma!

3
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:00,948
Dwana! Oh, how
you've grown!

4
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

5
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:04,018
Mikey!

6
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:04,967
Grandpa!

7
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,046
Oh, Dwana,
how are you?

8
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:09,090
Grandma! How are you?

9
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,095
Oh, that's my boy.

10
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:16,931
How are you?
You...

11
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,049
Pauline.

12
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,102
Grandpa. Oh.

13
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,940
Papa! How are you?

14
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:29,492
Hey, you're looking good.

15
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,779
Grandpa, we're getting
a house that doesn't move!

16
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:33,647
A regular house
with a solid foundation.

17
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:34,997
Where?

18
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,283
Well, right around
here somewhere

19
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:37,535
if you think you
can tolerate us.

20
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:39,537
Oh, Pauline, is it true?

21
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:40,738
It is, Grandma

22
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:44,433
Are you trying to tell me
that you've given up wresting?

23
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:47,628
Yes, Grandpa, Buford the Bull is
officially retired.

24
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:50,045
Oh, Son,
that makes me so happy.

25
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,299
Pauline, I'll bet you had
something to do with this.

26
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:55,136
Mmm-mmm. It was Buford's
decision as always.

27
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,472
I just agreed immediately.

28
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,677
It was a one-way street
leading nowhere, Dad.

29
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,179
It was organized dishonesty.

30
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:07,146
It was a system.

31
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,182
You know, you win
when they let you win,

32
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:09,648
you climb the ladder
when they let you,

33
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,151
you breathe when they feel like
giving you air.

34
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,772
I just got fed up with other people
running my life their way.

35
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,233
Buford, it's all over now.
Don't relive it.

36
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:19,625
It weren't worth it.
Yeah, you're right.

37
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,662
Now, see what you did
with your fool questions?

38
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:23,164
They've come home.

39
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,499
Nothing else is important.

40
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,036
Oh, don't worry, Mama. I'm not
gonna fight with anybody anymore.

41
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,252
Buford's word.

42
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,789
By God,
this calls for a drink

43
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,541
With you, just about everything
calls for a drink.

44
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,794
Oh, well, anytime a man's son
returns to his senses,

45
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,429
it's celebrating time.

46
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,264
I wanna go see the cows.

47
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:41,730
That's for first graders.

48
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,717
I wanna see Dad's
solid gold football.

49
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,745
My granddaddy gave me
this gun when I was 9 years old.

50
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,889
And when you're 9 years old, Mike,
we just might talk about it.

51
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,925
Gee, I'm almost nine.

52
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,312
Grandma's making
cookies downstairs.

53
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:29,313
I get the bowl!

54
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:30,814
I get the scraper!

55
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,603
Thank you.

56
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,606
Nothing wrong with guns,
in the right hands.

57
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,355
You wondering
why you ever left this place?

58
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:17,227
We all make mistakes.

59
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,195
Of course,
the smart fella,

60
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,232
he don't make
the same mistake twice.

61
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,035
Now you take
Parker Forsythe.

62
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,430
You remember Parker?

63
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:29,790
He had 300 acres.

64
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,294
Only trouble was, he never did
learn that gasoline

65
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,297
and white lightning
just don't mix.

66
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:37,763
God reminded him one night,

67
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:42,303
right up there where state highway
meets Route 7...

68
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:45,089
Now old Parker's
allotted land is

69
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:50,060
back on the open market.
$6,000 down.

70
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,096
House, nice house,
almost new.

71
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,597
Furnished.

72
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,233
Got two catfish ponds on it.

73
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:01,129
The state even has
a timber lease.

74
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:03,991
Now if a fellow was
to get a partner,

75
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:09,663
and the partner had
some logging gear.

76
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:13,000
Dad, what time did you tell the
bank we'd come look at the place?

77
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,038
That does call for a drink.

78
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:19,873
Yeah.

79
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,101
There it is!

80
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,274
Oh, Buford

81
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,495
Look, I see them coming up!
Do you?

82
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,167
The first thing we do

83
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:40,671
is sell the trailer so we won't
ever be tempted.

84
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:42,638
Knew you were
gonna say that.

85
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,425
That's why I sold
it this morning.

86
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,629
For me?
No, it's for us.

87
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,433
Oh, Buford! Oh.

88
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:57,438
I might just cry. Oh!

89
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,080
Watch the steps.

90
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:32,089
Honey, here's the deed and
the mortgage to your home.

91
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:33,090
You happy?

92
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,512
Buford! It's Lutie

93
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:39,812
Oh.

94
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,313
It's Lutie McVeigh!

95
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,350
He played end on our
football team. Remember, Mama?

96
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:44,818
I sure do.

97
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,159
Are you crazy, Lutie?

98
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,696
He drives them all fast
and he's never caught,

99
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:57,781
but he's always
good for laughs.

100
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,249
He's gonna stop.

101
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,250
Yeah.

102
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,040
Grandma and I have
a lot of shopping to do.

103
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,507
You'd just be in the way.

104
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,043
Take your time.
I'll go home with her.

105
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:11,353
You sure?
Positive.

106
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:12,594
Come on, Grandma.

107
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:15,097
One thing, Buford.
What?

108
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:18,635
If you look around town,
you might see some changes

109
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,603
But pay them no mind.

110
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,640
They've got nothin
g to do with us.

111
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:25,142
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,196
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

113
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:31,163
"The old Forsythe place,"
they said.

114
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,200
"Nonsense," I said.
"Buford Pusser," they said.

115
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:35,167
"Must be another
Buford Pusser," I said.

116
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,704
"Nobody's gonna tame that
wild bull dog. " No, sir.

117
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:38,705
Hey, Lutie!

118
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,672
Why, a man would have to be
crazy to give up

119
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,709
all them faraway places with them
strange-sounding dames.

120
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:43,675
You didn't, did you?

121
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,712
Afraid I did.
I come home to roost.

122
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,714
The old lady,
and a pretty one she is,

123
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:48,983
kinda leaned on you, huh?

124
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:50,217
Settle down, grow roots.

125
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,719
Her daddy ain't gonna have
no more fun, she said.

126
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:54,555
Now, come on, you can level
with old Lutie.

127
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,021
Nah, it ain't
nothing like that.

128
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,559
I just got tired of being a
trained animal in somebody else's circus.

129
00:10:59,059 --> 00:10:59,725
Hey, come on,
let's get a beer.

130
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,261
Only refused
a drink once in my life

131
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:02,763
and that was offered
over the telephone.

132
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:04,264
Hey, remember Amy Dalton?
Yeah.

133
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:05,866
She's got seven kids now.

134
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:07,434
Two by her own husband.

135
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,405
Grady Coker,
he's deputy sheriff,

136
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:12,964
in case you want
a ticket fixed.

137
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,024
Where we going,
Chuck and Babe's?

138
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:15,490
Man, you really are
out of touch.

139
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,244
Why, that place is nothing
but an old museum.

140
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,710
Strictly senior citizens.

141
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,248
Why, they even play
checkers on the bar.

142
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:22,249
Buford, we're a big city.

143
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,543
We got our own sin, gambling,
crime, vice, 24 hours a day.

144
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:28,338
A man like you'd feel right
at home. Come on, let's go!

145
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,266
Look, Buford, look!

146
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:42,684
How about that, huh?

147
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,236
A shopping center
for sinners.

148
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,916
You can lay a bet or a broad
or a base for a three-day drunk.

149
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:51,561
Brought more business to town
than anything since the cotton gin.

150
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,230
Mabel, how are you, baby?

151
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,197
How are you?

152
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:58,035
Come on, let's go.
Come on, go, go!

153
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:25,095
Oasis for the weary traveler.

154
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,062
Home for the wicked.

155
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:29,808
Soothing balm
for the frustrated husband.

156
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:32,484
And some of the gals
even give trading stamps

157
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,239
to keep the old lady from waking up
the kids when you come home.

158
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:39,743
Sodom and Gomorrah,here comes
Buford, the Wild Bull!

159
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:41,578
No holds barred.

160
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:03,934
Mercy, mercy,
look at the motor on that!

161
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,650
Wanna break training, gents?

162
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:22,652
Just slightly.
Couple of beers.

163
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,686
Hiya, Lutie!

164
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:41,972
Hi, Margie Ann

165
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,240
Hello, baby!

166
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,474
What is this?

167
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,259
Tarzan?

168
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,512
Superman?

169
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:51,730
Or King Kong?

170
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,567
This here's
my bodyguard, Buford.

171
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:56,236
There's enough here
for three of us.

172
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:00,023
Only if he gets
group rates, Margie Ann.

173
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:02,025
Bozo,
these girls are tinder dry

174
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,026
Wet them down!

175
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,529
What's the matter, honey?
Come on, come on.

176
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:08,031
Come here, baby!
Oh, Lord!

177
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:39,196
A beer

178
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:40,697
That's on me, Bozo!

179
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:42,699
You got a light?

180
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,201
I don't smoke.

181
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,482
Looking's for free

182
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,319
What I mean is,
looking don't cost nothing.

183
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,189
Settle down, girls,
and drink your pacifiers.

184
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:23,655
I'll tell you when.

185
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,191
Now for the next
stop on our tour.

186
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,693
Bozo,
get the girls another drink.

187
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:30,197
Come on, Buford.
Come on, come on!

188
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:58,073
Ain't this something?

189
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,610
Watch me build this
into a big bundle!

190
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,115
Give me $10

191
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,618
There you go.

192
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,739
Once more.

193
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,608
That's it.
That's it, that's it.

194
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:25,835
Come on, come on.
Let it go!

195
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,595
Come on, come on!

196
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:45,855
Let's go! Come on, come on,
come on.

197
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,611
I sure could use $50
until we get back to town.

198
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:52,913
Come on, don't worry!

199
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,831
All right.
You're my partner.

200
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,333
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on.

201
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:57,834
Just a second.

202
00:16:57,869 --> 00:16:58,800
Come on!

203
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:01,087
That's good. That's good.

204
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,089
Pit call.

205
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:06,593
There you go.

206
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:27,447
Four. Four's the number.
Hard way open.

207
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:28,914
Place your bets, gentlemen.

208
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:30,550
Lady Luck is
spreading her legs.

209
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,117
Oh, that's all I gotta do.

210
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,653
Bring them out, hard way.
Hard way.

211
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,155
Hard way.
Hard way, you're on.

212
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:36,656
Two and two.

213
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:41,628
Oh, baby!
Ah, yeah, come on four!

214
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:46,681
Your point's 13.

215
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:48,168
You're not rolling, wise guy.

216
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,169
My money is!

217
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,637
Get the money
you lost, Lutie.

218
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,222
Give me my
thirty-five dollars.

219
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,506
Now, just a minute

220
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,810
Look out, Buford!

221
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:12,600
...three!

222
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:13,670
Let me have him!

223
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,517
All right, Augie, show this
bastard who runs things around here.

224
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,599
You should've called
a seamstress.

225
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:49,102
Took some 200
stitches in him.

226
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:55,275
Three years in
the Marine Corps,

227
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,243
five years in the ring.

228
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,506
He has to come home
to get half killed.

229
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,734
Ordinary man wouldn't have
made it through.

230
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:05,952
Where... Where can I wash up?

231
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,957
Pauline, did he mention
where it happened?

232
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,270
Some place called
the Lucky Spot.

233
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:19,047
I'd laugh if it
weren't so awful.

234
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:22,085
Pretty... Pretty obvious he was
all liquored up.

235
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,803
Dead drunk, huh, Doc?

236
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,771
Not obvious at all

237
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,642
The important thing to you
should be who did it to him?

238
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,560
Yeah, Thurman.

239
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,097
Who throwed him in
that ravine to die

240
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:36,641
And where's his
station wagon, huh

241
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,650
I'm looking into that,
Mr. Pusser.

242
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:40,687
Yeah, well, let's hope
you don't look into it

243
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,606
like you been
looking into all the other

244
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,455
funny things going
on in this county.

245
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,995
Now, Carl, you know that men
just naturally gotta let off steam.

246
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,828
I try and keep it in bounds.

247
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,866
You better be remembering
one thing before election time.

248
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,635
People in this county
give you that badge,

249
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,370
and they can damn well
take it away from you!

250
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,505
Grandpa.

251
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,342
Not like you to
threaten a man, Carl.

252
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:04,344
He speaks for
more than himself.

253
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,359
Lunch time.

254
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:39,344
Pauline.
Hello.

255
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:42,382
Buford,
you feeling a bit better?

256
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,850
Yeah, physically, Grady.

257
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:49,555
I can't find tire nor bolt
of your station wagon, Buford.

258
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,557
Neither can the state police.

259
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:52,558
It can't just vanish.

260
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,427
Oh, it happens
all the time.

261
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,394
Professionals,
most likely.

262
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,098
They repaint them, file off
the numbers, you know.

263
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,105
Say, as far as that fracas
you got into over at the Lucky Spot,

264
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,242
I can't find a single witness
that saw it your way.

265
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:10,326
We got Lutie.

266
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:15,448
Now, Buford,
you know Lutie.

267
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:17,415
Crazy Lutie McVeigh!

268
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,537
Can't tell where the truth ends off
and the tall stories begins.

269
00:25:21,572 --> 00:25:23,539
Nobody takes him serious.

270
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,089
I do.

271
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,877
Well, if that's your
whole case, you got none.

272
00:25:27,912 --> 00:25:29,427
Look, I got
a chest full of stitches!

273
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:32,098
Well, if that's all, count
your blessings and drop the case.

274
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,599
Like hell I will!

275
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:40,857
Your funeral.

276
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,908
Thurman,

277
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,279
Thurman, I've known you
since I was a kid.

278
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,613
I always thought
you walked tall.

279
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,234
Looks like you done learned
how to crawl!

280
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:54,702
Buford, you've got stitches,
remember?

281
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:57,121
How can I forget?
Hey, Grady, what about you

282
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,742
You just gonna let them throw me
in a hole and bury me?

283
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:02,245
Well, what am I supposed
to do, Buford?

284
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:04,212
He deals the cards.

285
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:06,791
I just play the hand I get.

286
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:10,374
Go find yourself
another game.

287
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:13,923
Grady!
Get over here and fast!

288
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,925
Oh, there it is again.

289
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,926
What?

290
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:18,893
The system.

291
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:21,430
You gotta live my way
or you don't live.

292
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:30,716
It's just like a clock

293
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:33,753
Every time we get started,

294
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,447
that damn boy in
that beat-up truck

295
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,641
of his comes around
looking for a job.

296
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:08,103
Obra?

297
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:09,171
Buford!

298
00:28:09,672 --> 00:28:10,923
Hey! You really filled out

299
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,174
Yeah, well, you did, too.

300
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:13,676
We made a great tag team, huh?

301
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,760
Well, maybe we still can.

302
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,947
Can you use
a man and his truck?

303
00:28:17,982 --> 00:28:20,099
I'm used to hard
work and low pay.

304
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:22,518
Well.

305
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:27,523
Can you get your
load in good shape?

306
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:29,023
Yeah, sure I can.

307
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:32,311
Well, we need men, and the pay's
the same for everybody.

308
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:33,911
You're on! Thanks.

309
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,364
Hey, I'll go tell the boss.

310
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,568
Pa!

311
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:43,572
Pa, you got
something against Obra?

312
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:47,576
I knowed him
since he was a pickaninny.

313
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:50,038
Hired his old daddy many times.

314
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:52,270
That doesn't
tell me anything.

315
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:54,432
Well, he got educated,
you see?

316
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:58,471
Then he come down with a raging case
of that new social disease

317
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,257
Black Power.

318
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:01,973
Is that all?

319
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,474
Now look,
hold on just a minute.

320
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,512
I believe in equality
just as much as anybody.

321
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:09,981
But I don't want it
forced on me, see?

322
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,519
Gonna be a lot of fun
working with the two of you.

323
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:32,371
Come on, man, give me a break,
will you? Slow down!

324
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:33,873
You say you want a job, huh?

325
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,341
Yeah!

326
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,346
That's lunch!

327
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:46,352
Oh!

328
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:55,528
Touchdown!

329
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:03,536
You know, if you push
that wood any faster, man,

330
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,037
I'm gonna need six arms.

331
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:08,040
You can take it.
I got faith in you

332
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,042
Yeah.

333
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:14,046
Walk softly and
carry a big stick, huh?

334
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:18,551
You planning on
trying that somewhere?

335
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:20,695
I was thinking about it.

336
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,805
When I get well enough.

337
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:26,475
How does it feel to be part of
the oppressed minority?

338
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:30,479
Well, that's something
you ought to know about.

339
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:31,230
Any suggestions?

340
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:32,697
Yep.

341
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,734
Do not beat your head
against the wall

342
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:37,312
cause it'll
probably fall on you.

343
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:39,855
Two, lone wolves
are easy prey.

344
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:42,858
Organize.
There's strength in unity.

345
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,362
And, three,
you are a damn fool, Buford,

346
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:48,748
for trying to do
what I know you're going to.

347
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:10,603
Margie Ann, lie down,
I wanna talk to you.

348
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:32,708
Hey, Bozo,
don't give me no crap!

349
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:40,833
Help me get this bum up.

350
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,363
What's up, Bozo?

351
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:58,577
Bozo!

352
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,973
Look, I'm, I'm just
the bookkeeper.

353
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,392
I didn't have
anything to do with it

354
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:06,394
Here's a receipt.

355
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:08,862
$3,630 you owe me.

356
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,899
3,300 for my station wagon,

357
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,866
280 for my and Lutie's money,

358
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,487
and about $50 for
the doctor's bill.

359
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:18,073
You sign it,
you give me my money.

360
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:25,914
No, just the $3,630
you owe me.

361
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:32,588
Sign it.

362
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,325
Mister,
your hands are shaking.

363
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,278
If you miss,
you'll never shoot again.

364
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,208
Pull.

365
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:16,298
Pull.

366
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:22,938
Pull.

367
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,874
Buford, you're under arrest.

368
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,340
What for?

369
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,411
Assault and battery
and armed robbery.

370
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:50,299
That dog moves, shoot him.

371
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:53,802
Shep, sit. Sit! Stay!

372
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,721
Cuff him.

373
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,258
Buford, I don't understand.

374
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:01,141
What happened?

375
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:02,644
He knocked over
the Lucky Spot.

376
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,610
I'll be all right, Pauline.

377
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:04,930
Just tell Daddy to
get me bail money.

378
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,767
My daddy wouldn't
rob anybody!

379
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,940
Looks like violence
runs in your family.

380
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,805
$50,000 for bail?

381
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,843
They don't set that much in
this state for premeditated murder!

382
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:37,561
What is this about only one day
to prepare for trial?

383
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,599
You're ignorant of the law, Pusser.
You refused to hire counsel,

384
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,103
so suffer the consequences
of your foolishness.

385
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:46,054
Do you have any
idea what you face?

386
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:50,058
Sure. Frame-up?

387
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,878
A possible sentence
of 30 years.

388
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:55,662
Now, whether
you want it or not,

389
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:58,200
I'm gonna give you the benefit of
my legal wisdom.

390
00:36:58,235 --> 00:36:59,616
Don't go to trial.

391
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:02,154
Plead guilty to
the assault charge.

392
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:04,121
Make financial restitution,

393
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:07,242
and I'll personally consider
some kind of lesser sentence.

394
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:10,094
How much lesser?

395
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:12,297
I'll work that out
with Sheriff Thurman.

396
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:19,972
In that case, I'll take my chances
with the McNairy County jury.

397
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,507
You're a damn fool, Buford!

398
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:26,762
But then we've already
established that, haven't we?

399
00:37:26,797 --> 00:37:28,764
All right, take him back.

400
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:58,877
People of the State of Tennessee
v. Buford Pusser.

401
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,680
Honorable Judge
R. W. Clarke presiding

402
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:05,600
Against my advice,
the defendant

403
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:08,068
desires to act as
his own counsel.

404
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:10,889
Therefore he cannot claim
a mistrial on that basis.

405
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:19,314
Will the defendant
please challenge the jury?

406
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,200
It's fine with me.

407
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:26,203
The prosecutor
may challenge.

408
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:30,242
If it please the court, the jury
is satisfactory with the state.

409
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:37,299
They just fished Lutie McVeigh
and his car out of the river.

410
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,843
Then you may call
your first witness.

411
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:49,895
Call Buel Jaggers.

412
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,065
Buel Jaggers.

413
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,181
Go on, Mr. Pusser.

414
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:33,272
This morning my only witness,
Lutie McVeigh,

415
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:34,773
he was fished
out of the river.

416
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:37,741
Well, they've had their say.

417
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:42,564
Seems like they've had that kind
of say around here for too long.

418
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,566
Look, I had to stand
up for myself alone.

419
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:47,844
And I didn't go in to rob any
gambling house with just a stick.

420
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:50,622
I went in there to remind them
that somewhere in this world,

421
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:52,824
there's still a little
law and order left.

422
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:55,327
To let them know
in the only kind of terms

423
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:57,294
that their kind
understand is

424
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,331
that they can't buy,
bribe or threaten

425
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,667
their way out of
what they did to me!

426
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,669
They did this!

427
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,673
Oh, now hold it!
You're out of order!

428
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,805
You're out of order!

429
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,524
Stop it right now!
Stop it!

430
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,392
Your Honor,
the state objects to it.

431
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:14,930
You let them do this to me
and get away with it,

432
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:16,657
then you give me
the eternal right to do

433
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:18,350
the same damn thing
to any one of you!

434
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:19,351
You're out of order, sir!

435
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:20,652
And put on your shirt!

436
00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:36,618
They've only been out
less than five minutes.

437
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:59,808
Mr. Foreman, have the jurors
reached a verdict?

438
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:04,946
Not guilty.

439
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:21,246
Congratulations, Buford.
Keep up the good work.

440
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,129
Thank you.
Hey, Buford!

441
00:41:22,164 --> 00:41:25,132
Congratulations.
Buford. Hey!

442
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,669
Man, you really know
how to play the crowd.

443
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,223
You had that
jury ready to walk

444
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:33,225
barefoot over
hot coals for you.

445
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:38,146
That's something
they'd never do for him.

446
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:40,614
Hey, Buford.

447
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:43,652
Buford, why don't you try
this job on for size?

448
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:51,660
No, Buford, no!

449
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:54,628
We'll go someplace else.

450
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:56,665
Find a decent
town to live in.

451
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,949
Where?

452
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,416
And how?

453
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,453
Everything we've got's
sunk in this place.

454
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:04,840
Besides, I never turned tail
and run from nobody.

455
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:05,922
I'm not gonna start
with these people.

456
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,960
Is your pride worth the safety
of those children?

457
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:10,677
Of all of us?

458
00:42:10,712 --> 00:42:11,678
Okay, then you leave.

459
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,215
You go to your mama's
and you take the kids

460
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,516
and you come
back when it's okay.

461
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:16,983
I don't want to leave you.

462
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:20,021
And I don't want you
to run for sheriff.

463
00:42:21,523 --> 00:42:23,525
"No more fighting,
" you said.

464
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,026
You gave your word.

465
00:42:25,527 --> 00:42:26,878
Wild Bull Buford's word.

466
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:28,195
On that you can bank.

467
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,031
I didn't know this
was gonna happen.

468
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:31,998
Oh, well, you're turning this

469
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:35,153
into some kind of senseless
life and death grudge fight.

470
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:36,655
It's not senseless, Pauline.

471
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,156
Listen to me.

472
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,158
Pauline,

473
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,544
this is my home.

474
00:42:43,545 --> 00:42:45,011
You made it yours.

475
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:47,549
And you want me and you and the
kids just to go run, hide,

476
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:49,050
afraid to come home?

477
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:52,053
Just for a little while.

478
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:54,422
Only until all this
violence blows over.

479
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:56,424
It's not gonna
blow over by itself.

480
00:42:56,459 --> 00:42:57,926
Now somebody's got
to huff and puff.

481
00:42:58,426 --> 00:42:59,928
Oh, Buford, grow up.

482
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:06,268
Dad,

483
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:10,322
what do you think
my chances are?

484
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,324
Fair. Fair.

485
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,326
I'll tell you something,
though, Buford.

486
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:17,846
You run against
these people and lose,

487
00:43:17,881 --> 00:43:20,332
you're gonna be
worse off than before.

488
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,798
'Cause you'll
never find anyone

489
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,702
to stand up against
them for you again.

490
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:25,670
Not ever.

491
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:35,347
Then we'll leave.
Only then.

492
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,690
Yeah, yeah

493
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:49,659
Punish me

494
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:52,496
Oh, make me feel the pain

495
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:57,536
So I'll know not to ever
do you wrong again

496
00:43:57,571 --> 00:43:59,988
Come on, punish me

497
00:44:00,488 --> 00:44:04,200
Make me crawl back
to your world

498
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:07,913
But don't go and find
another girl

499
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:10,380
Oh, no, no, baby

500
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:13,552
I said I just couldn't
stand it now

501
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:16,054
Take my life into your hands

502
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:18,021
Come on, punish me

503
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:21,474
Oh, but don't
take your love away

504
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:26,514
'Cause I couldn't make it
another single day

505
00:44:26,549 --> 00:44:28,982
Come on, punish me

506
00:44:29,017 --> 00:44:32,520
Make me crawl back
to your world

507
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:36,024
But don't go and find
another girl

508
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:39,292
Oh, come on, baby

509
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:42,330
Do what you want with me

510
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:45,333
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

511
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:46,800
Great.

512
00:44:46,835 --> 00:44:48,837
Don't forget to vote.

513
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,725
? Since you caught me,
feel so ashamed

514
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,932
? I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be down on my knees

515
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:05,637
? Begging you,
please, baby, please

516
00:45:05,672 --> 00:45:07,604
? Won't you punish me?

517
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:10,607
? Oh, just
take out your revenge

518
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:15,647
? So I'll know not to ever
do you wrong again

519
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:18,031
? Come on, punish me

520
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:21,251
? Make me crawl back
to your world

521
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:25,790
? But don't go and find
another girl?

522
00:45:25,825 --> 00:45:27,292
Hey, Buford.

523
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:33,273
How'd you like a nice,
plush job as my deputy?

524
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:37,552
No brains required,
just brute animal force.

525
00:45:38,053 --> 00:45:40,171
I ain't that desperate.

526
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:42,355
You will be, boy.

527
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,267
You sure as hell will be.

528
00:45:44,302 --> 00:45:46,144
The day after elections.

529
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:54,486
Last chance, Buford.

530
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:57,489
If you can't lick them,
join them.

531
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,204
Now, Grady,
that's what I call

532
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:16,172
a pure case of
reckless driving.

533
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:19,210
That boy has got no respect
for law and order.

534
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:21,678
Hey, Al, let him go!

535
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:24,215
God damn it, Grady, you act like
you're gonna vote for him!

536
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,218
Now get in or I'll
dock you a day's pay!

537
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,716
We'll get him!

538
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:03,555
We'll get him, Grady, and
we'll nail his ass to the cross!

539
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,772
"Pusser for Sheriff. "

540
00:48:57,919 --> 00:48:59,420
Now I got the bastard!

541
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,208
Hold it!

542
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:09,607
Damn it, Grady, that's more money
than you can make

543
00:50:09,642 --> 00:50:11,659
in 20 years as a deputy.

544
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,627
And all you gotta
do is testify that

545
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:17,699
Buford deliberately
ran you off the road.

546
00:50:17,734 --> 00:50:20,201
That's murder
and the end of him.

547
00:50:23,705 --> 00:50:25,506
I'll think it over.

548
00:50:26,507 --> 00:50:28,509
Don't give us
that crap, Grady.

549
00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:30,178
You'll do it or else!

550
00:50:36,184 --> 00:50:38,052
I'd be dead if it
weren't for Buford.

551
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,743
Christ, can you ever
figure people?

552
00:51:02,243 --> 00:51:05,997
Well, looks like our only
chance now is to elect a corpse

553
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:09,751
and gamble on getting our own man
appointed in his place.

554
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:13,720
We got only one
week before election.

555
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:17,258
We'll get us some big billboards,
radio, TV spots,

556
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:19,260
and call in all
favors owed us.

557
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:22,764
I swore that bastard
would have took a hot stove.

558
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:24,731
You're right, Callie.

559
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:26,768
We gotta throw everything
we can lay our hands on

560
00:51:26,803 --> 00:51:28,234
behind our dead sheriff.

561
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:31,272
Another 10,
20,000 should do it.

562
00:51:31,773 --> 00:51:34,025
My people just ain't got
that kind of money.

563
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,277
I ain't got but two girls
working for me

564
00:51:36,312 --> 00:51:38,279
and I can't carry any more freight.

565
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,749
You pay your end, Hassie,
or get your ass out!

566
00:51:42,784 --> 00:51:47,789
For God's sakes, Jaggers,
lay off the local suckers.

567
00:51:47,824 --> 00:51:49,791
Wouldn't it be a hell of a lot
easier, Callie,

568
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,759
just to run that yokel
out of town?

569
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:55,296
Next time you meet up
with him, Jaggers,

570
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:56,798
you have my permission.

571
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,632
Oh!

572
00:52:21,155 --> 00:52:23,958
Hey, Buford! Hey! Hey!

573
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:29,295
We won! We won!

574
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,416
Yeah, congratulations!

575
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:34,884
Where's Grandma?
Back there.

576
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:38,222
Hey, Mama! What they
got you arrested for, Mama?

577
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:41,190
Buford!

578
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:42,977
I won it, Ma! I won it.

579
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,336
Morning.

580
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:12,373
All right, there's two rules,
and that's all.

581
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:15,007
But don't ever forget them.

582
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:18,045
Number one,
we enforce the law equally.

583
00:53:19,547 --> 00:53:21,549
Number two,
any man who takes a bribe

584
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:24,218
is gonna get his head
knocked off by me.

585
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,472
Now Grady's gonna show me
the territory.

586
00:53:28,507 --> 00:53:30,690
This is 201 to 501.

587
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:34,228
201 to 501,
come in if you read me.

588
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,733
That's for you, Sheriff, 501.

589
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,286
501. Who are you?

590
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,823
This is Sheriff Tanner
over in Alcorn, Mississippi.

591
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:47,825
Welcome to
the shooting gallery.

592
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:49,710
First morning on the job,
I hate to give you a big one,

593
00:53:50,211 --> 00:53:51,212
but we got
a multiple death case

594
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:53,214
over here that
should interest you.

595
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:55,550
I'll be there in an hour,
Sheriff Tanner.

596
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:57,919
No rush.
We got them on ice. Over.

597
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:08,896
A civil rights picnic, all young,
in their early twenties.

598
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:11,916
We got a dozen more
over at County Hospital.

599
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:14,902
All of them drinking
poisoned white lightning.

600
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:23,793
This here is Sheriff Pusser
from McNairy County.

601
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:25,830
Now tell the man where you
picked up that lot of moonshine,

602
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:27,296
and don't you lie.

603
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,299
From Willie Rae's bar
over near Salem.

604
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,837
Okay, thank you, Sheriff.
We'll take care of it. Grady.

605
00:54:32,872 --> 00:54:34,303
Thanks, Sheriff.

606
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:35,840
Now get him out of here.

607
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,329
Good morning, Sheriff!
Obra.

608
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:02,616
My, my, my.
You sure do look the part.

609
00:55:02,651 --> 00:55:04,510
Hey, look, Obra,
your friend Willie Rae

610
00:55:04,545 --> 00:55:06,370
runs a still back
up here somewhere.

611
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,072
You know where it is?

612
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:15,545
You are some
kind of quick study.

613
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,748
You got the talk,
the official manner,

614
00:55:17,783 --> 00:55:19,882
and the coldness
down just like that.

615
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,884
Look, I just came
from the morgue at Alcorn.

616
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,421
They got eight dead niggers
stretched out over there,

617
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,423
all dead from
poisoned rotgut whiskey

618
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:27,390
made somewhere
up around here!

619
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:30,394
Let's not waste any time playing
these dumb word games.

620
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,268
Buford, don't you
talk to me like that.

621
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:42,738
You've been running around
all this county all the time

622
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:46,110
shooting your mouth off about
how you want to help your people.

623
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:48,613
Well, I'm trying to
give you a chance.

624
00:55:49,664 --> 00:55:51,130
You know that last sheriff,

625
00:55:51,165 --> 00:55:52,166
he wouldn't have given a damn
about those eight bodies,

626
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:54,133
they weren't
his favorite color.

627
00:55:54,168 --> 00:55:56,170
I care, and whether
you help me or not,

628
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:58,673
I'm gonna do
something about it.

629
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:08,049
All right.

630
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:22,029
About seven miles
from here up in them hills,

631
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,031
near an old logging road.

632
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:26,033
Some boys from Arkansas.

633
00:56:27,034 --> 00:56:28,536
I can show you.

634
00:56:29,537 --> 00:56:31,038
Thank you.

635
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,542
I got something for you.

636
00:56:37,545 --> 00:56:38,546
You got a new job.

637
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:41,514
You're Deputy Sheriff,
McNairy County.

638
00:56:41,549 --> 00:56:44,552
Oh, no. Buford, now you've
been away for too long.

639
00:56:44,587 --> 00:56:46,053
That just isn't done down here.

640
00:56:46,088 --> 00:56:48,020
Is that right?

641
00:56:48,055 --> 00:56:50,558
Well, it's okay for you to set up a
poor, white-trash ex-wrestler for sheriff,

642
00:56:50,593 --> 00:56:52,560
but it's not good enough
for you, huh?

643
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:11,839
You're all under arrest.

644
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:12,840
Stay where you are.

645
00:58:25,486 --> 00:58:27,488
Whose truck's this?

646
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:34,245
Jesus! Who
the hell's the son of a...

647
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,014
This truck is
hereby confiscated

648
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,748
for carrying
unlicensed liquor.

649
00:58:37,783 --> 00:58:38,749
Whose car is this?

650
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,751
I don't know.
Never saw it before.

651
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,263
Well, whoever it belongs to,
they lost it now.

652
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:54,282
Oh, I forgot
to tell you, Augie,

653
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:56,267
Willie Rae,
you're under arrest.

654
00:58:56,302 --> 00:58:58,269
Manslaughter. Eight counts.

655
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:02,106
I'll radio in and get
some deputies out here.

656
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:03,190
Take care of
this truck and car.

657
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:05,192
Don't lose anybody.

658
00:59:07,695 --> 00:59:08,813
Sit down!

659
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:13,200
That's right, yeah, put your
hands over your heads.

660
00:59:13,235 --> 00:59:14,702
Come on!

661
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:18,122
Sit down, Willie Rae.

662
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:21,124
You showed him up here,
didn't you, boy?

663
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:23,627
Sure hope you do
try something, Augie.

664
00:59:25,913 --> 00:59:27,880
If you live long enough,

665
00:59:27,915 --> 00:59:31,669
you're gonna wish this day
never happened, smart ass!

666
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:36,674
Sit down, smart ass!

667
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:37,975
Sit down!

668
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:05,786
Sheriff Pusser,the court orders
you to set the prisoners free.

669
01:00:07,288 --> 01:00:08,789
You don't mean that, Judge.

670
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:10,291
I do and I'm so ordering you.

671
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:12,424
Why?

672
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:13,761
Because you acted improperly.

673
01:00:14,128 --> 01:00:15,629
You failed to get
search and seizure warrants

674
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,230
before you invaded
their privacy.

675
01:00:18,265 --> 01:00:20,267
You failed to inform them
at the time of their arrest,

676
01:00:20,302 --> 01:00:22,887
of their legal
rights to counsel,

677
01:00:22,922 --> 01:00:25,437
to silence,
to access to a telephone.

678
01:00:25,472 --> 01:00:28,440
These people were responsible
for eight deaths, Judge.

679
01:00:28,475 --> 01:00:31,529
You can't just let them go because
of some little technicalities.

680
01:00:31,564 --> 01:00:34,532
The United States Supreme Court
does not consider them

681
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:36,534
little technicalities,
Sheriff Pusser.

682
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:39,285
They are the law of the land.

683
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,822
There's more to upholding the law
than swinging a big stick

684
01:00:41,857 --> 01:00:43,374
and kicking down doors.

685
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:46,877
Now you set them free,
or I'll hold you in contempt,

686
01:00:46,912 --> 01:00:48,128
which I do anyway.

687
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,753
Remove those handcuffs.

688
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,958
Buford, there's a man,

689
01:01:18,993 --> 01:01:21,495
Mr. Witter from Nashville
was here looking for you.

690
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,498
He's up there now,
talking to Judge Clarke.

691
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:29,003
Mr. Witter.

692
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:36,225
Sheriff, this is John Witter.

693
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,946
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, Sheriff.

694
01:01:38,981 --> 01:01:41,632
Judge Clarke's been
telling me all about you.

695
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:43,767
Well, that shouldn't
have taken him long.

696
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:47,054
I wonder if I can
talk to you in private?

697
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:53,360
I think it'd be
better in your office.

698
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:55,362
Oh, well, this is it.

699
01:02:24,164 --> 01:02:26,166
Pusser,
you're a local sheriff.

700
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:29,169
A brand new one at that.

701
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:33,138
Now, maybe nobody
told you,

702
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:37,761
but this is a lot more than
just a local operation.

703
01:02:38,261 --> 01:02:41,514
I mean, there are some important
people involved,

704
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,910
all the way up to the capital
and beyond, believe me.

705
01:02:44,945 --> 01:02:48,271
Well, the only important people
to me are down there.

706
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,108
They built the county.
They have to live in it.

707
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:53,860
You know,
one of the first things

708
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,112
you gotta learn
to do in this life

709
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,323
is to take care of number one.

710
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,388
If you don't,
nobody else will.

711
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:01,418
You don't have to
commit any sins.

712
01:03:01,918 --> 01:03:02,884
All you've gotta
do is let those

713
01:03:02,919 --> 01:03:05,637
who want to pay
for their fun, do it.

714
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:08,675
I got nothing against
a little drink, a little fun,

715
01:03:09,176 --> 01:03:12,144
but the law of the land
shouldn't be for sale.

716
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:14,681
Now if you let those people
that run those joints have an inch,

717
01:03:14,716 --> 01:03:15,981
they'll steal
the whole state.

718
01:03:16,016 --> 01:03:18,518
And it looks like they've already
got a leg up on it.

719
01:03:20,387 --> 01:03:23,390
Well, I suggest you think it over
for a day or two.

720
01:03:24,891 --> 01:03:27,394
Why don't you come
on up to Nashville

721
01:03:27,894 --> 01:03:28,895
and you meet
some of the fellas.

722
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,862
You'll like them.

723
01:03:30,897 --> 01:03:33,024
You'll find
them very generous.

724
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,117
Well, I already
thought it over,

725
01:03:35,152 --> 01:03:36,820
long before I went after
this job, Mr. Witter.

726
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,321
So I heard.

727
01:03:39,823 --> 01:03:44,711
You know, ideals and realities
are very far apart.

728
01:03:47,164 --> 01:03:49,598
One day you're
gonna see that, son.

729
01:03:49,633 --> 01:03:53,637
And if you don't,
someone's gonna point it out to you.

730
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:54,921
Clearly.

731
01:03:55,922 --> 01:03:58,391
You already have.
Thank you.

732
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:06,566
Enjoy yourselves, boys,
these are two of the best.

733
01:04:13,073 --> 01:04:15,075
Here comes that big stick.

734
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:22,032
Hi, Luan,
I see you moved your trailer.

735
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:27,537
And I see
you're still looking.

736
01:04:34,511 --> 01:04:38,515
Hi, Callie.
Hello, Prentiss.

737
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,848
You know, Callie,

738
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:42,886
you've got one of the sexiest
track teams I've ever seen.

739
01:04:43,386 --> 01:04:46,389
What's the record between
here and the trailer, huh?

740
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,391
Hmm?

741
01:04:57,901 --> 01:05:01,404
Hey, Callie,
wanna open the storeroom?

742
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,406
The one with
the illegal liquor?

743
01:05:05,408 --> 01:05:08,829
Prentiss, open the storeroom
for the sheriff.

744
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:10,879
Leave those there.

745
01:05:10,914 --> 01:05:12,332
Put those
against the back wall.

746
01:05:15,418 --> 01:05:16,919
All right,
if he won't buy off,

747
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,386
let's kill
the son of a bitch.

748
01:05:18,421 --> 01:05:21,091
You know what Witter said.
"Go easy. "

749
01:05:21,591 --> 01:05:23,593
The Nashville papers are
playing up that big stick of his

750
01:05:24,094 --> 01:05:26,194
like he was Sir
Lancelot or somebody.

751
01:05:26,229 --> 01:05:30,100
We ought to take Sir Lancelot's
big stick and shove it up his ass!

752
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:34,854
We ought to do
what we're told to do.

753
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,572
Find some way to
teach him a lesson.

754
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:40,744
Then maybe Witter can talk
some sense into him.

755
01:05:40,779 --> 01:05:43,246
You teach him
your kind of lesson.

756
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,749
I got a couple boys in Alabama
who'll teach him something

757
01:05:45,784 --> 01:05:47,367
he won't live to remember.

758
01:05:53,373 --> 01:05:54,374
Craps.

759
01:05:56,343 --> 01:06:01,313
? Made a mistake
long time ago

760
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:04,851
? 'Cause I wanted to see
the lights of the city

761
01:06:06,853 --> 01:06:10,957
? The big town called me
and I just had to go

762
01:06:10,992 --> 01:06:15,061
? But a fire behind the lights
is not too pretty

763
01:06:15,562 --> 01:06:17,112
? Hey, hey, hey

764
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:22,402
? 'Cause I'm coming home
on the very next train, yes

765
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:27,657
? I'm coming home
and I'll never leave again?

766
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:33,213
This is the third time today
you've rousted me over.

767
01:06:33,248 --> 01:06:35,715
Why the hell you working
to hurt me, brother?

768
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,182
I'm not working to
hurt you, Willie Rae.

769
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:39,886
I just wanna make sure
nobody else gets hurt.

770
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:44,391
Is that another way of saying
you wanna make a deal?

771
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:46,142
Okay.

772
01:06:47,644 --> 01:06:49,646
I'm just a little deputy,
Willie Rae.

773
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:51,932
I don't have authority
to make deals.

774
01:07:06,029 --> 01:07:07,495
Well, now,

775
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:11,499
we saw your car
parked outside,

776
01:07:11,534 --> 01:07:15,038
and we thought we'd come in to say
hello to our new deputy.

777
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,507
Hey, fellas,
would you look

778
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:24,512
at the solid gold badge
this here boogie's wearing

779
01:07:24,547 --> 01:07:30,553
Obra, Obra, now that you've got
yourself a steady job, you gonna,

780
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:33,407
you gonna buy us
all a beer, huh?

781
01:07:33,442 --> 01:07:36,191
Hold on.
Come over here, would you?

782
01:07:36,226 --> 01:07:38,228
Now why don't you get
the hell out of the way

783
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:40,730
and let some men do
some drinking, huh?

784
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:43,198
Now, look, oh,
I was talking to you, boy.

785
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:46,736
You gotta show some more respect
for your betters, huh?

786
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:55,545
Six beers!

787
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,552
I said give us six beers!

788
01:08:10,477 --> 01:08:13,813
Calling 501, 501.

789
01:08:14,314 --> 01:08:17,100
This is patrol car number three
calling Sheriff's car 501.

790
01:08:19,436 --> 01:08:21,905
Calling 501, 501!

791
01:08:23,406 --> 01:08:24,991
501, that's you, Obra?

792
01:08:25,026 --> 01:08:26,458
Yeah, Buford.

793
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:27,959
Look, I'm down
at Willie Rae's,

794
01:08:27,994 --> 01:08:29,679
and there's six
troublemakers down here.

795
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:31,815
Do you wanna come down
and pick them up?

796
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,917
No, you pick them up,
I haven't eaten yet.

797
01:08:33,952 --> 01:08:35,418
But they're
white men, Buford.

798
01:08:35,919 --> 01:08:37,203
Arno Purdy and
that bunch, you know?

799
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:41,875
Buford,
did you hear what I said?

800
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,341
I said they're white men!

801
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,378
Obra, now you're a deputy sheriff
for McNairy County,

802
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:46,379
not a shoeshine boy!

803
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,680
If they're out of line,
pick them up!

804
01:09:04,197 --> 01:09:06,199
Let me tell you
about Saturday night.

805
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:07,901
I was down at this place.

806
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:09,503
And if you ever do...

807
01:09:09,538 --> 01:09:11,071
You're under arrest.

808
01:09:39,232 --> 01:09:41,518
Don't make me
have to kill you!

809
01:09:54,864 --> 01:09:57,867
Well, now,that wasn't so hard now,
was it?

810
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,869
No, not from where
you were sitting.

811
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,956
Hi, Arno.
How's it hanging?

812
01:10:17,303 --> 01:10:18,805
$10 or ten days.

813
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:34,737
You take your life
in your hands for $10.

814
01:10:35,238 --> 01:10:37,490
It's not the fine
that's important.

815
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:39,885
It's the principle
of the thing.

816
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,210
You got public respect, Obra.

817
01:10:42,245 --> 01:10:45,748
Come over to my house tonight
with public respect.

818
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:46,583
Watch the bonfire.

819
01:11:07,854 --> 01:11:10,657
I've been thinking
this whole thing over.

820
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:15,662
Well, no use lying.

821
01:11:18,164 --> 01:11:20,833
I got drunk, and I made
a fool out of myself.

822
01:11:22,835 --> 01:11:24,837
I had no business
being at Willie Rae's.

823
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,792
Obra, I...

824
01:11:31,294 --> 01:11:33,296
I want you to know that...

825
01:11:34,797 --> 01:11:36,266
I want you to know
I'm damn sorry.

826
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:42,388
Believe me,
I mean it, Sheriff.

827
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:44,140
I am.

828
01:11:51,197 --> 01:11:52,532
Here's 20 bucks.

829
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:56,402
For the shirt.

830
01:11:59,405 --> 01:12:00,623
Best I can do.

831
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:05,745
Don't you just hate
somebody like that?

832
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,879
What do you mean?

833
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,383
Well, he ruined our bonfire.

834
01:12:16,806 --> 01:12:18,925
That fight yesterday
was for real.

835
01:12:19,425 --> 01:12:22,929
Obra could have been killed,
and all you did was levy a $10 fine.

836
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,347
My prerogative.

837
01:12:24,847 --> 01:12:26,665
You run the streets,
I run the courts.

838
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,593
If I bring them in
, you let them go,

839
01:12:28,628 --> 01:12:31,058
the whole thing just
becomes a big joke.

840
01:12:31,093 --> 01:12:33,475
And I don't care to
trade lies for lives.

841
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,858
From now on,
I want maximum penalties.

842
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,360
You want? You want?

843
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,362
Why,
you self-appointed dictator!

844
01:12:39,862 --> 01:12:41,364
All you know is
force and violence.

845
01:12:41,864 --> 01:12:44,350
You don't understand
the simplest things about the law.

846
01:12:44,385 --> 01:12:46,836
I understand the difference
between a poor, honest judge

847
01:12:46,871 --> 01:12:48,538
and a rich, dishonest one.

848
01:12:52,425 --> 01:12:54,927
Tomorrow morning I'll learn
what's in this criminal code book

849
01:12:54,962 --> 01:12:57,395
word for word.

850
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:59,390
And what you
gotta worry about, Your Honor,

851
01:12:59,425 --> 01:13:01,351
is what part of this
I can use against you.

852
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:27,126
What the hell's going on here?

853
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:29,093
Oh, I read the book,
Your Honor,

854
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:32,131
and it clearly
states on Page 53, paragraph six,

855
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:34,050
that the sheriff has
the right to assign

856
01:13:34,085 --> 01:13:35,968
courtrooms and
judges' chambers.

857
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:37,470
In view of your
past judgments,

858
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,806
I thought you'd feel
more at home here.

859
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:41,974
You have your own
choice of seats.

860
01:13:44,644 --> 01:13:46,145
Of course,
there's no telephone yet,

861
01:13:46,646 --> 01:13:48,648
but you won't
need one today.

862
01:13:49,148 --> 01:13:51,150
Here's a list
of search and seizure warrants

863
01:13:51,185 --> 01:13:53,561
that I want by 3:00 today.

864
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,903
I'll have your lunch sent in.

865
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:58,441
Oh, and by the way,
if any word of these warrants,

866
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:00,408
excuse the expression,
leaks out,

867
01:14:00,443 --> 01:14:02,829
well, your distinguished
career is over.

868
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:05,797
Page 92, section four.

869
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:09,702
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned!

870
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:24,148
Okay,
the preliminaries are over.

871
01:14:24,183 --> 01:14:26,018
We now all know each other,
we know the problem.

872
01:14:27,353 --> 01:14:28,354
I was elected
sheriff on one issue,

873
01:14:28,855 --> 01:14:30,356
that I bust every joint
in the whole county.

874
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:33,024
And we're gonna
start tomorrow.

875
01:14:33,059 --> 01:14:36,062
First off,
I don't want any car, truck,

876
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,522
or driver that
even looks like

877
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:38,948
a moonshiner to
move on our roads.

878
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:42,326
Lonnie, you and Chris,
you handle Highways 45 and 64.

879
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:45,169
Okay, and I hear
there's four new stills operating.

880
01:14:45,204 --> 01:14:48,708
Two of them up
near Big Mill Road, one in Donald Springs,

881
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:51,210
and one back up
in Pepper Hill.

882
01:14:51,245 --> 01:14:52,645
Grady, that's your job.

883
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,046
Knock them all flat.

884
01:14:54,547 --> 01:14:56,013
Alone?

885
01:14:56,048 --> 01:14:58,050
Well, now if you was to look
over your shoulders,

886
01:14:58,085 --> 01:15:00,052
it's just likely
you might see me

887
01:15:00,553 --> 01:15:02,889
and four or
five other loggers a-standing there.

888
01:15:04,807 --> 01:15:07,310
Okay, the rest of us wait until
the illegal liquor's flowing.

889
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,562
The girls are making
their trailer runs,

890
01:15:09,597 --> 01:15:11,314
and the suckers are
crowding the tables.

891
01:15:11,349 --> 01:15:13,564
And then we hit
fast and hard.

892
01:15:13,599 --> 01:15:17,235
Obra, you're in charge
of the east half.

893
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,772
Virgil, I want you to make
the west half run.

894
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:21,739
Big job.

895
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:23,443
Well, you're a big man.

896
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:25,445
This whole thing rests
on one element.

897
01:15:26,446 --> 01:15:27,747
Surprise.

898
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:57,727
? Nobody knows

899
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,730
? The trouble?

900
01:16:05,284 --> 01:16:07,203
I know. We heard.

901
01:16:11,707 --> 01:16:14,710
They knew.
God damn it, they knew!

902
01:16:15,711 --> 01:16:16,712
Somebody tipped them.

903
01:16:17,213 --> 01:16:18,679
We'll try again.
Tomorrow night.

904
01:16:18,714 --> 01:16:20,716
No, not till we find out
who and why.

905
01:16:21,217 --> 01:16:24,185
The why is simple, money.

906
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,223
Well, if I find him,
he won't live to spend it.

907
01:16:28,724 --> 01:16:30,726
Well, I'm going home.

908
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:32,693
Good night, Grady.

909
01:16:32,728 --> 01:16:34,730
Good night, Buford.
Go slow.

910
01:16:35,731 --> 01:16:37,233
Take care.

911
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:11,551
Look here, you dumb...

912
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:28,951
All right, just what the hell
do you think you're doing, huh?

913
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:53,392
We can't get
him on the radio.

914
01:17:53,427 --> 01:17:55,359
Every car is out.

915
01:17:55,394 --> 01:17:56,645
He was going straight home.

916
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,862
Well, have they checked 22?

917
01:17:57,897 --> 01:17:59,030
Sometimes he comes
home that way.

918
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:01,067
I'll double back.
I'm going with you

919
01:18:16,415 --> 01:18:17,416
Oh!

920
01:18:20,703 --> 01:18:22,204
Oh.

921
01:18:22,705 --> 01:18:23,706
Honey.

922
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,209
Oh, Buford.

923
01:18:29,178 --> 01:18:30,713
This is 505, emergency!

924
01:18:31,213 --> 01:18:33,157
You get me an ambulance
out to Highway 22

925
01:18:33,192 --> 01:18:35,101
near the old Carlson place.
Double quick.

926
01:18:37,603 --> 01:18:40,606
I'm all right. Don't cry.

927
01:18:53,536 --> 01:18:55,002
What's that for?

928
01:18:55,037 --> 01:18:56,372
Oh, just something
to make you relax.

929
01:18:58,324 --> 01:18:59,875
Help you get
your strength back.

930
01:19:01,877 --> 01:19:02,712
I don't wanna relax.

931
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:06,666
You're going to.

932
01:19:09,669 --> 01:19:12,136
And while you're doing it,

933
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:13,673
try to think of
a new profession.

934
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:18,227
You're not very
good at this one.

935
01:19:18,728 --> 01:19:20,596
I'm learning.

936
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:21,847
Doc, I'm learning.

937
01:19:23,983 --> 01:19:25,851
Just made a mistake.

938
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,772
Tried to fight clean.

939
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,782
Okay, thank you very much.

940
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,283
I appreciate that.

941
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:48,791
A man just doesn't know
how many friends he's got

942
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:50,176
until he's flat on his back.

943
01:19:52,128 --> 01:19:53,429
Or how many people
are glad that he is?

944
01:19:55,347 --> 01:19:58,315
See, Grady,
see these stacks of cards?

945
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:01,854
There's even one over there
from Augie McCullough.

946
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:04,271
I didn't know he could write.

947
01:20:04,306 --> 01:20:07,309
Yeah, I got these chocolates
from all the girls,

948
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,311
and Tennessee sipping whiskey
from Callie,

949
01:20:09,812 --> 01:20:11,313
and these dollar cigars
from Willie Rae.

950
01:20:11,814 --> 01:20:13,315
Look at that.
This is from the Lucky Spot.

951
01:20:15,818 --> 01:20:17,069
Rolls seven every time.

952
01:20:19,455 --> 01:20:20,956
You see these flowers?

953
01:20:20,991 --> 01:20:22,423
You see this big bunch?

954
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,960
You know where
that come from?

955
01:20:24,995 --> 01:20:27,463
Nashville.
Mr. Witter, no less.

956
01:20:28,964 --> 01:20:31,608
Grady, grab yourself
a big handful of cigars.

957
01:20:31,643 --> 01:20:34,253
Pauline, get him
a couple of those bottles

958
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,222
and mix him up
a big highball, huh?

959
01:20:36,722 --> 01:20:38,557
No, thanks,
I don't want anything!

960
01:20:40,009 --> 01:20:41,010
Why not?

961
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:45,980
Grady,
it's the fruit of our labor.

962
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:49,435
You're afraid you're gonna get
corrupted again.

963
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,520
Are you going on the take,
Buford?

964
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:54,356
I sure am.

965
01:20:55,274 --> 01:20:56,575
Well, in that case...

966
01:20:57,993 --> 01:21:00,496
Yes, sir, Grady.

967
01:21:00,996 --> 01:21:04,116
I'm gonna take
and take and take!

968
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:10,456
Till they ain't
got nothing to give but blood!

969
01:21:10,956 --> 01:21:13,459
And I'm gonna take that
one drop at a time.

970
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:20,049
And I'm gonna start
with that informer.

971
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:23,350
You know who he is?

972
01:21:23,385 --> 01:21:25,853
Yeah, a little bird
just told me.

973
01:21:25,888 --> 01:21:29,857
I'm gonna go after him
with my bare hands.

974
01:21:29,892 --> 01:21:32,228
Grady, we could have had
the whole county in one night

975
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,146
if he hadn't...

976
01:21:43,656 --> 01:21:46,624
I don't know, Grady.

977
01:21:46,659 --> 01:21:49,662
He's been like that
ever since the shooting.

978
01:21:51,163 --> 01:21:54,667
Smoking their cigars,
drinking their whiskey,

979
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:56,634
smelling the flowers.

980
01:21:56,669 --> 01:21:58,921
Just reminding himself
how much he hates them,

981
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,138
and then he works himself up
into that rage.

982
01:22:01,173 --> 01:22:03,842
Well, Pauline, he seems
like he's earned the right.

983
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,512
But it's gone beyond reason.
It's a kind of madness.

984
01:22:07,012 --> 01:22:08,514
Well, maybe that's gonna
be what's required,

985
01:22:09,014 --> 01:22:11,016
a kind of madness
to clean out that snake pit.

986
01:22:11,517 --> 01:22:13,402
That and this.

987
01:22:13,437 --> 01:22:14,737
No!

988
01:22:15,688 --> 01:22:17,690
You heard him, Pauline.

989
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,692
He said "bare hands. "

990
01:22:21,193 --> 01:22:23,744
They are no match for guns.

991
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:26,081
Grady, you know how
I feel about them.

992
01:22:26,949 --> 01:22:27,950
Mmm-hmm.

993
01:22:29,451 --> 01:22:31,669
So does Buford,

994
01:22:31,704 --> 01:22:34,707
well, he's just never gonna put
one on unless you say,

995
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,173
"It's all right. "

996
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:39,176
Well, you're just
gonna have to decide.

997
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:43,215
If you wanna spend your
old age with your fear,

998
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,217
or with your husband.

999
01:23:12,544 --> 01:23:15,130
I see we all had a nice,
long vacation with pay.

1000
01:23:16,632 --> 01:23:19,099
Now we're gonna
go back to the war.

1001
01:23:19,134 --> 01:23:21,470
We're gonna take up
exactly where we left off,

1002
01:23:21,505 --> 01:23:22,972
only this time we're
not gonna separate.

1003
01:23:23,472 --> 01:23:27,059
We're gonna hit them as a team,
everywhere in force.

1004
01:23:27,094 --> 01:23:28,060
Any questions?

1005
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,179
I'd like to call home
to tell them I'll be late.

1006
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:32,414
No calls,
no radio communications

1007
01:23:32,449 --> 01:23:34,149
and nobody gets
out of my sight.

1008
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:36,151
Okay,
we'll start with the stills.

1009
01:23:36,652 --> 01:23:37,603
Follow me.

1010
01:23:47,446 --> 01:23:48,913
Virgil?
Hmm?

1011
01:23:48,948 --> 01:23:50,950
I don't like the way the dynamite
charges are wired.

1012
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:52,952
They don't look
right to me.

1013
01:23:53,452 --> 01:23:54,418
I don't see nothing
wrong with them.

1014
01:23:54,453 --> 01:23:57,456
Well, you're new at this.
Come on, let's go check them.

1015
01:24:01,593 --> 01:24:03,095
Virgil?

1016
01:24:04,596 --> 01:24:05,514
Hey?

1017
01:24:06,015 --> 01:24:07,016
No!

1018
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:12,521
Buford,
what's wrong with you?

1019
01:24:18,027 --> 01:24:19,812
No! Don't!

1020
01:24:35,577 --> 01:24:36,877
Buford, no!

1021
01:24:36,912 --> 01:24:39,882
Get away from me!
I know what I'm doing!

1022
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,085
Buford,
don't, for God's sake!

1023
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,253
No, Buford, don't do it!
Don't!

1024
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:45,387
Tell them, Virgil.

1025
01:24:45,422 --> 01:24:47,389
Don't... No.

1026
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,859
No, Buford, don't do it!
Don't!

1027
01:24:51,894 --> 01:24:53,645
Don't run, Virgil,
you'll never make it.

1028
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,312
Don't do it!

1029
01:24:55,347 --> 01:24:56,849
For God's sake!
All right, tell them, Virgil.

1030
01:24:56,884 --> 01:24:58,315
No.

1031
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,852
Tell everybody
who tipped them off!

1032
01:25:00,853 --> 01:25:02,152
Tell them, Virgil!

1033
01:25:02,187 --> 01:25:04,189
Tell them how they knew
I took the back way home at night.

1034
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:06,108
No, Buford, don't.
You tell them!

1035
01:25:07,109 --> 01:25:09,076
Okay!

1036
01:25:09,111 --> 01:25:10,904
Okay, it was me, okay?

1037
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,698
But they made me do it.

1038
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:14,825
Get down on
your knees, Virgil.

1039
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,452
I didn't do it!
Get on your knees!

1040
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:17,584
Oh, no, Buford.

1041
01:25:17,619 --> 01:25:19,955
That's cold-blooded murderer,
you can't do it.

1042
01:25:20,372 --> 01:25:22,107
Buford, Buford, don't!

1043
01:25:22,142 --> 01:25:24,135
Come on, Virgil. Crawl.

1044
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:26,093
Oh, no, Buford, no!

1045
01:25:26,128 --> 01:25:28,463
Okay, Virgil, crawl to me!

1046
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,649
Crawl over here! Faster!

1047
01:25:30,684 --> 01:25:32,801
You ain't got much time!

1048
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,318
Come on, faster.

1049
01:25:34,353 --> 01:25:35,769
You ain't got
much time, Virgil!

1050
01:25:35,804 --> 01:25:37,306
Virgil, crawl,
you ain't got much time.

1051
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:38,974
Buford, don't!
Faster!

1052
01:25:49,151 --> 01:25:49,868
Stand up.

1053
01:25:54,373 --> 01:25:55,240
Get up!

1054
01:26:25,737 --> 01:26:27,239
You walk home.

1055
01:26:33,078 --> 01:26:34,580
Git!

1056
01:26:50,846 --> 01:26:51,847
Stick them up.
Outside.

1057
01:26:52,347 --> 01:26:53,814
Stick them up.

1058
01:26:53,849 --> 01:26:55,851
You're under arrest.

1059
01:26:58,353 --> 01:26:59,820
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

1060
01:26:59,855 --> 01:27:01,857
All right, Callie, let's go
for a walk. Come on.

1061
01:27:01,892 --> 01:27:03,859
I wanna talk to you.
Get your hands off her!

1062
01:27:06,361 --> 01:27:09,064
All right, come on,
come on, come on!

1063
01:27:13,368 --> 01:27:14,870
All right, Callie, you got the key.
Open it up.

1064
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:16,336
You got a warrant?

1065
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:17,873
Yeah, I keep it in my shoe.

1066
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:26,415
Get them in.
Get them all. Come on.

1067
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,887
He knew exactly where everything
was and when to hit.

1068
01:27:33,922 --> 01:27:36,758
I tell you, he's got someone
down here working from the inside.

1069
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,261
Yeah, but not from my group.

1070
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:40,861
My people are solid.

1071
01:27:40,896 --> 01:27:44,399
Oh, your people
are real solid!

1072
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,867
Like that bunch
you sent over from Alabama?

1073
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:49,771
Couldn't even put him away
when they were two feet from him.

1074
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,738
That really
started something.

1075
01:27:51,773 --> 01:27:54,109
What the hell help
you and Prentiss been?

1076
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:55,110
Those tramps and
that pimp of yours

1077
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:57,613
have been robbing everybody passed
through town.

1078
01:27:57,648 --> 01:27:58,614
You better get off it, Augie.

1079
01:28:01,116 --> 01:28:03,418
You run your store.
I'll run mine.

1080
01:28:05,837 --> 01:28:08,340
I talked to
Witter this morning.

1081
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,807
He said to put him away.

1082
01:28:10,842 --> 01:28:12,344
Believe me, I'll take care
of that son of a bitch.

1083
01:28:12,379 --> 01:28:14,311
I don't care what it costs.

1084
01:28:14,346 --> 01:28:16,348
And I wanna.
tell you something

1085
01:28:18,267 --> 01:28:20,734
I've operated down
here for 20 years.

1086
01:28:20,769 --> 01:28:23,153
Before you was even
one of the girls, Callie.

1087
01:28:23,188 --> 01:28:25,891
Now you get this straight,
you're not running my show.

1088
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,357
If I want to do any killing,

1089
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:30,395
I'll do it without
a board meeting!

1090
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,162
Count me out.

1091
01:28:32,197 --> 01:28:34,199
Augie...
Lay off, Jaggers!

1092
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:37,703
Why do you wanna bring in
an outsider to do a job

1093
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:40,170
I've done half a dozen times?

1094
01:28:40,205 --> 01:28:42,791
You also did four years
for the last one.

1095
01:28:43,292 --> 01:28:45,294
But the guy's still dead.

1096
01:28:54,469 --> 01:28:54,970
Pa!

1097
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,677
Just stay now.

1098
01:29:36,712 --> 01:29:39,214
Everybody just stay with me.
All right?

1099
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:42,050
Buford?

1100
01:29:45,854 --> 01:29:47,654
Dad!

1101
01:29:47,689 --> 01:29:51,193
They killed Shep! Oh!

1102
01:29:52,477 --> 01:29:53,443
It's all right.

1103
01:29:53,478 --> 01:29:55,981
Mama, they killed Shep!

1104
01:30:23,675 --> 01:30:26,178
Buford? Geez, I've been
trying to reach you for over an hour.

1105
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:29,181
Listen, Prentiss has Margie Ann
in Callie's trailer.

1106
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:31,183
She used to be
one of Grady's playmates,

1107
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:32,702
so they figure
she's your informer.

1108
01:30:32,737 --> 01:30:34,186
You gotta get over
there quick, Buford.

1109
01:30:34,313 --> 01:30:35,354
Please!

1110
01:31:16,978 --> 01:31:19,648
Go ahead!
Give me an excuse! Go on!

1111
01:31:21,566 --> 01:31:22,868
Sit!

1112
01:31:38,216 --> 01:31:39,718
Stay!

1113
01:31:54,232 --> 01:31:56,199
Get up, pretty boy.

1114
01:31:56,234 --> 01:31:59,738
Come on, get up.
Come on, get up!

1115
01:31:59,773 --> 01:32:01,323
Let's go. Come on!

1116
01:32:05,827 --> 01:32:08,830
Mister, you got
a right to a phone call.

1117
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,335
You hear me, mister?

1118
01:32:13,835 --> 01:32:14,801
Stop that!

1119
01:32:14,836 --> 01:32:17,147
You got a right to
make one phone call.

1120
01:32:17,182 --> 01:32:19,458
You bastard,
you're gonna kill him!

1121
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:24,463
You got a right not to make
a statement without a lawyer.

1122
01:32:24,498 --> 01:32:25,512
Stop it!

1123
01:32:25,547 --> 01:32:27,549
Buford!
I'll get you for this.

1124
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:28,683
Come on up.

1125
01:32:32,187 --> 01:32:34,689
You're under arrest
for white slavery,

1126
01:32:34,724 --> 01:32:37,434
for assault and battery,
for kidnapping

1127
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,145
and any other
goddamn thing I think of!

1128
01:32:42,063 --> 01:32:46,568
Get up. Get up. Get up!

1129
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:48,069
Come on, Callie!

1130
01:33:04,419 --> 01:33:05,837
It's payday.

1131
01:33:06,338 --> 01:33:07,923
Payday?

1132
01:33:12,427 --> 01:33:14,062
A gift from me to you.

1133
01:33:17,849 --> 01:33:19,351
All warrants and
charges against you

1134
01:33:19,851 --> 01:33:21,436
have been taken
off the books.

1135
01:33:25,574 --> 01:33:28,577
Luan, I don't know why you
risked your life to help me,

1136
01:33:28,612 --> 01:33:30,529
but I appreciate it.

1137
01:33:31,029 --> 01:33:33,497
Let's just say
I have a soft spot

1138
01:33:33,532 --> 01:33:37,536
for big, strong,
good-looking ex-Marines.

1139
01:33:38,537 --> 01:33:40,539
My husband would
have been an ex,

1140
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:43,124
but he didn't
live through Vietnam.

1141
01:33:47,128 --> 01:33:48,380
I'm sorry.

1142
01:33:52,551 --> 01:33:54,518
Luan, you gotta
get out of town now.

1143
01:33:54,553 --> 01:33:56,471
You gotta go far away
and get a new job...

1144
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:57,973
Not that kind of job.

1145
01:33:58,008 --> 01:33:58,974
With what?

1146
01:34:03,144 --> 01:34:05,338
Special funds account.

1147
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:07,497
From your piggy bank?

1148
01:34:07,532 --> 01:34:10,869
No, it's from the dice table
at the Lucky Spot.

1149
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:15,624
I wish I could
do more, but...

1150
01:34:15,659 --> 01:34:18,091
So do I,

1151
01:34:18,126 --> 01:34:22,380
but then you wouldn't be the kind
of man that you are, would you?

1152
01:34:41,516 --> 01:34:44,519
I think I better take you
to the bus station.

1153
01:34:46,021 --> 01:34:47,022
Thanks.

1154
01:35:10,345 --> 01:35:12,238
Michael, put it down.

1155
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:13,853
Wonder what it is.

1156
01:35:13,888 --> 01:35:15,433
Yes, I wonder.

1157
01:35:19,938 --> 01:35:22,440
Merry Christmas.

1158
01:35:23,942 --> 01:35:25,443
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1159
01:35:25,478 --> 01:35:27,729
Look in the basket!

1160
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,946
Grandma! A little dog!

1161
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:32,484
Yeah.
Santa Claus bring this, huh?

1162
01:35:33,985 --> 01:35:35,970
Yeah, what do you know?

1163
01:35:36,005 --> 01:35:37,873
Oh, thank you, Grandma.

1164
01:35:37,908 --> 01:35:39,741
You're very welcome.

1165
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:42,077
Son, go out in the car.

1166
01:35:42,577 --> 01:35:43,578
Bring in
the turkey and the pies.

1167
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:47,082
And, mind you, be sure you keep
the turkey covered.

1168
01:35:47,117 --> 01:35:49,084
Oh, my darling.
Oh, darling.

1169
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,086
Merry Christmas!

1170
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:52,052
Oh!

1171
01:35:52,087 --> 01:35:53,088
Do you like it?

1172
01:35:53,588 --> 01:35:55,055
Beautiful.

1173
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:57,392
It only took us two days.

1174
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,402
Merry Christmas! Hi.

1175
01:36:11,406 --> 01:36:13,373
Hi, George.

1176
01:36:13,408 --> 01:36:15,360
The place is swinging tonight.
Sure is.

1177
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:16,861
Hey, where's Prentiss?

1178
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,827
Oh, he's still in the can.

1179
01:36:17,862 --> 01:36:19,364
They're holding
him without bail.

1180
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:21,366
Oh, that's too bad.

1181
01:36:29,374 --> 01:36:32,126
Ho, ho, ho, and a Merry Christmas,
Callie.

1182
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:34,879
This watch was made
for a woman like you

1183
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:37,347
with elegance and good taste.

1184
01:36:37,382 --> 01:36:41,686
Haven't you heard, Sheldon,
we're in the middle of a depression.

1185
01:36:41,721 --> 01:36:44,270
Everybody needs
a good watch, Callie.

1186
01:36:44,305 --> 01:36:47,809
All it's good for is to remind me
I'm sitting here on my ass

1187
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:50,278
losing money
every time it ticks.

1188
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,783
And I'm getting
goddamned mad about it.

1189
01:36:57,285 --> 01:36:58,868
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1190
01:36:58,903 --> 01:37:01,406
George, set them up on me,
will you?

1191
01:37:01,906 --> 01:37:03,908
I'll be sitting over there.

1192
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,910
Girls, drinks are on Sheldon.

1193
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:07,412
Merry Christmas.

1194
01:37:07,912 --> 01:37:09,914
Cindy, how are you?

1195
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:13,376
I got some
beautiful things here.

1196
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:15,336
I can show you
a beautiful watch.

1197
01:37:17,338 --> 01:37:18,256
George.

1198
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:55,510
Buford, I've got a Mr. Sheldon Levine
down here, jewelry salesman.

1199
01:37:55,545 --> 01:37:57,905
He claims some
$60,000 in jewelry

1200
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,265
was heisted from
the trunk of his car

1201
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,600
over at the Pine Ridge Club.

1202
01:38:02,635 --> 01:38:04,102
Okay, I'll meet you.

1203
01:38:07,605 --> 01:38:10,775
Don't open
the presents till I get back.

1204
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:13,243
Oh, Buford,
not Christmas Eve.

1205
01:38:13,278 --> 01:38:16,147
Oh,it's just a little burglary.
It won't take long. Come on.

1206
01:38:16,648 --> 01:38:19,033
I'll be right back
. Don't worry, Mama.

1207
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,162
Yeah,
keep them coming, George.

1208
01:39:06,164 --> 01:39:08,116
Merry Christmas, Callie!

1209
01:39:08,616 --> 01:39:10,785
Santa Claus is on his way.

1210
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:19,294
Merry Christmas, Suzanne.
Merry Christmas, George.

1211
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:20,795
What do you want, honey?
It's from the house.

1212
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:22,547
Something strong.

1213
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,481
Merry Christmas.

1214
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:41,447
Yeah.

1215
01:39:41,482 --> 01:39:42,448
Sheriff Pusser.

1216
01:39:42,483 --> 01:39:44,535
Sheldon Levine, sir.

1217
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:16,661
I heard.

1218
01:41:23,167 --> 01:41:24,669
Merry Christmas.

1219
01:42:47,668 --> 01:42:49,769
Mike caught a fish already.

1220
01:42:49,804 --> 01:42:51,806
He always gets
everything first.

1221
01:42:51,841 --> 01:42:54,308
Patience, honey.
Patience.

1222
01:43:00,565 --> 01:43:05,570
We could have a lot more days like this
if you weren't the sheriff.

1223
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:09,073
Well, maybe in a small way
my being sheriff lets

1224
01:43:09,108 --> 01:43:11,025
a lot of people
have days like this.

1225
01:43:11,526 --> 01:43:12,527
Small way?

1226
01:43:14,529 --> 01:43:17,497
You gambled your life.

1227
01:43:17,532 --> 01:43:20,701
And no one has come
to say thank you.

1228
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,668
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

1229
01:43:22,703 --> 01:43:24,705
Maybe nobody really
does give a damn.

1230
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:29,652
You know,
I'm beginning to realize this job's

1231
01:43:29,687 --> 01:43:32,096
a lot more important
than I first thought.

1232
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,102
I'm proud of you, Buford.

1233
01:43:40,605 --> 01:43:42,690
And I'm not so
scared anymore.

1234
01:44:00,541 --> 01:44:02,543
I'm gonna drown them kids.

1235
01:44:02,578 --> 01:44:04,545
Buford, come on, don't!

1236
01:44:11,636 --> 01:44:13,137
Hello.

1237
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,141
Who's this?

1238
01:44:27,151 --> 01:44:30,620
Ellie Mae,
this is the sheriff.

1239
01:44:30,655 --> 01:44:34,158
You have any idea where that call
came from just now?

1240
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,945
How many parties
on that line?

1241
01:44:39,947 --> 01:44:41,449
Thank you.

1242
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:48,089
Who was that?

1243
01:44:52,093 --> 01:44:56,062
Oh. A party line
down at Donald Springs.

1244
01:44:56,097 --> 01:45:00,101
Some neighbor overheard of a plan
to set up a new still.

1245
01:45:00,136 --> 01:45:02,929
I gotta go down and read
the riot act to them.

1246
01:45:02,964 --> 01:45:05,723
It's gonna be a lot of work
tearing it down.

1247
01:45:06,224 --> 01:45:07,225
You go back to sleep.

1248
01:45:14,232 --> 01:45:15,733
Buford, I'm going with you.

1249
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:17,235
What'd you say?

1250
01:45:18,236 --> 01:45:19,202
I'm wide awake.

1251
01:45:19,237 --> 01:45:21,037
Grandma gets up early.

1252
01:45:21,072 --> 01:45:23,506
She'll take care of the kids.

1253
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:26,827
I think it's time I found out how
my husband earns his living.

1254
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,922
I'm hurrying!

1255
01:45:39,423 --> 01:45:41,926
You're like a breath of spring.

1256
01:45:56,857 --> 01:45:58,108
It's probably
just a false alarm.

1257
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,360
We'll probably
end up just taking

1258
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:01,827
a nice, long,
early morning drive.

1259
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:05,366
Good, you can buy me breakfast
on the way back.

1260
01:46:15,793 --> 01:46:18,796
Oh, Buford,
it's such a beautiful day!

1261
01:46:21,299 --> 01:46:23,517
Hey, thank you
for taking me along.

1262
01:46:26,137 --> 01:46:28,389
Come here,
I wanna talk to yo u a second.

1263
01:46:28,424 --> 01:46:31,392
No, you're driving.
Come here.

1264
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:33,361
I know where I'm going.

1265
01:46:44,288 --> 01:46:46,290
Come here, I want to give you a kiss.
No!

1266
01:46:46,325 --> 01:46:47,875
Give me a good kiss.
Come on.

1267
01:47:21,826 --> 01:47:23,327
Pauline?

1268
01:47:23,828 --> 01:47:25,795
501, it's an emergency!

1269
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:27,797
Yeah, Buford, Grady here.

1270
01:47:27,832 --> 01:47:29,834
Better get me an ambulance
about half a mile up Pike Creek Road

1271
01:47:30,334 --> 01:47:31,300
past the church.

1272
01:47:31,335 --> 01:47:33,587
Hurry up, it's an emergency!
I'm out in a field.

1273
01:47:33,622 --> 01:47:35,039
We're coming, Buford!

1274
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:36,040
Pauline.

1275
01:47:38,042 --> 01:47:39,043
Pauline.

1276
01:47:50,054 --> 01:47:54,558
Oh, please, God, no! No.

1277
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:56,853
Pauline, Pauline.

1278
01:47:56,888 --> 01:47:59,113
Don't let her die!

1279
01:48:02,116 --> 01:48:04,402
Pauline...

1280
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:00,541
Keep that road clear!

1281
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:02,693
Keep it clear!
Get that traffic back!

1282
01:49:02,728 --> 01:49:04,345
Hold the traffic!
Hold the traffic!

1283
01:49:04,845 --> 01:49:05,928
Hold the traffic down there!

1284
01:49:05,963 --> 01:49:09,266
For the love of God, get that
stretcher over here now, quick!

1285
01:50:57,074 --> 01:51:01,078
Obra, come on, let it go!

1286
01:51:04,665 --> 01:51:07,668
Dr. Ward, go to 561 west.

1287
01:51:08,669 --> 01:51:11,055
Dr. Ward, 561 west, please.

1288
01:51:24,485 --> 01:51:26,118
- Get out!
- Wait a minute.

1289
01:51:26,153 --> 01:51:27,921
Get out of here!
Keep those people out!

1290
01:51:27,956 --> 01:51:29,690
Let's go. Step back.
Move over, please.

1291
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:31,191
Let's go.

1292
01:51:35,195 --> 01:51:39,366
Grady, the governor has turned over
his entire investigating staff

1293
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:41,869
to work on this case.
Shall we start?

1294
01:51:42,369 --> 01:51:45,372
You're all a little late,
aren't you?

1295
01:51:47,875 --> 01:51:50,878
I'll take you out
to where he was ambushed.

1296
01:53:22,553 --> 01:53:26,056
We picked up over
125 shells on the road.

1297
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:28,192
How many men
were in the cars?

1298
01:53:32,112 --> 01:53:34,615
Surely you recognized one
or two of them.

1299
01:53:37,451 --> 01:53:39,870
Everybody in the capital
isn't on the take.

1300
01:53:40,871 --> 01:53:42,372
We only want to help.

1301
01:53:44,374 --> 01:53:46,076
Don't you trust us?

1302
01:54:01,225 --> 01:54:03,427
Do you know who
they are, Buford?

1303
01:56:51,561 --> 01:56:52,562
Dad.

1304
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,282
Mike...

1305
01:58:40,504 --> 01:58:42,506
Big stick.

1306
01:59:20,043 --> 01:59:21,545
Here you go.

1307
02:01:19,696 --> 02:01:23,583
Come on, Buford,
let's get on back to the hospital.

1308
02:01:25,368 --> 02:01:26,918
Please.

1309
02:01:26,953 --> 02:01:29,456
We'll get
the rest of them, Buford.

1310
02:01:30,957 --> 02:01:32,674
Every last one of them.

1311
02:01:32,709 --> 02:01:36,046
I swear we will, Buford.
Come on.

1312
02:02:32,068 --> 02:02:37,941
The world's begun
to look her age

1313
02:02:38,441 --> 02:02:43,446
I'll tell you why
she's lined and gray

1314
02:02:43,481 --> 02:02:49,035
We read of hate
on every page

1315
02:02:49,536 --> 02:02:54,424
Then turn our backs
and walk away

1316
02:02:55,258 --> 02:03:00,722
Why can't we stand

1317
02:03:00,757 --> 02:03:06,186
Joined hand to hand?

1318
02:03:06,686 --> 02:03:12,358
It's time to care

1319
02:03:12,393 --> 02:03:17,798
We dare not wait

1320
02:03:17,833 --> 02:03:22,953
And watch too long

1321
02:03:22,988 --> 02:03:28,074
Become too late

1322
02:03:28,575 --> 02:03:34,022
There's so much
hatred all around

1323
02:03:34,057 --> 02:03:39,434
Let's end it now
or it will roam

1324
02:03:39,469 --> 02:03:45,091
There's lots of heroes
in the ground

1325
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:51,181
But not enough
are in the home

1326
02:03:51,216 --> 02:03:56,812
Let's start again

1327
02:03:56,847 --> 02:04:02,881
Don't say, "Amen"

1328
02:04:02,916 --> 02:04:08,915
Open your eyes

1329
02:04:09,416 --> 02:04:14,254
And lift your head

1330
02:04:14,289 --> 02:04:19,526
Let's help to right

1331
02:04:19,561 --> 02:04:25,165
The wrongs we bred

1332
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:30,487
Let us pray loudly

1333
02:04:30,522 --> 02:04:36,126
Let us live proudly

1334
02:04:36,161 --> 02:04:42,391
And soon we'll all

1335
02:04:42,426 --> 02:04:48,621
Be walking tall
