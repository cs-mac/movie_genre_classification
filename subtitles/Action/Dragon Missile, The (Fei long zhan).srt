1
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,639
Master Li is here!

2
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,513
Shu Lien!

3
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,110
Li Mu Bai is here!

4
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,154
- How's everything?
- Fine. Please come in.

5
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,789
Mu Bai, it's been too long.

6
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,029
It has.

7
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,555
- How's business?
- Good.

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,472
- And how are you?
- Fine.

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,316
Monk Zheng said
you were at Wudan Mountain.

10
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,153
He said you were practicing
deep meditation.

11
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,359
The mountain must be so peaceful...

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,518
I envy you.

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,229
My work keeps me so busy,
I hardly get any rest.

14
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,518
I left the training early.

15
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,192
Why? You're a Wudan fighter.
Training is everything.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,915
During my meditation training...

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,719
I came to a place of deep silence...

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,990
I was surrounded by light...

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,075
Time and space disappeared.

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,678
I had come to a place my master
had never told me about.

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,553
You were enlightened?

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,199
No.

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,671
I didn't feel the bliss
of enlightenment.

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,119
Instead... I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,948
I couldn't bear it.

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,358
I broke off my meditation.

27
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,272
I couldn't go on.

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,555
There was something...
pulling me back.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,035
What was it?

30
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,471
Something I can't let go of.

31
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,595
You're leaving soon?

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,833
We're preparing a convoy
for a delivery

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,149
to Peking.

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,794
Perhaps I could ask you

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,432
to deliver something
to Sir Te for me.

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,558
The Green Destiny sword?
You're giving it to Sir Te?

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,030
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,998
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?

39
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,628
It has always been with you.

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,916
Too many men have died
at its edge.

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,789
It only looks pure because blood
washes so easily from its blade.

42
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,473
You use it justly,
you're worthy of it.

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,633
It's time for me
to leave it behind.

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,598
So what will you do now?

45
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,430
Come with me to Peking.

46
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,478
You can give the sword to Sir Te
yourself.

47
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,108
It'll be just like old times.

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,315
First I must visit
my master's grave.

49
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,711
It's been many years since...

50
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,277
Jade Fox murdered him.
I have yet to avenge his death.

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,352
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

52
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,239
I must pray for his forgiveness.

53
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,757
Join me
once you have finished.

54
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,150
I can wait for you in Peking.

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,673
Perhaps.

56
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,629
Ok. Pass.

57
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,310
Thanks.

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,311
Let's go into the city.

59
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,680
Everything got here safely.
I'm much obliged.

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,752
Just doing my job.

61
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,118
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,319
You're a credit to his memory.

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,515
Thank you.

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,636
I mean it.

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,712
This is Li Mu Bai's
personal sword,

66
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,157
a great hero's weapon.

67
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,395
He is the only one in the world
worthy of carrying it.

68
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,632
It's too fine a gift.
I cannot accept it.

69
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,869
Sir Te...

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,235
it has brought him
as much trouble as glory.

71
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,070
Help him to leave
these troubles behind.

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,879
Otherwise, he'll never be able
to start anew.

73
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,074
All right.

74
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,958
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

75
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,718
Governor Yu has arrived.

76
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,029
I must change.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,560
You've always been so good
to Li Mu Bai and me.

78
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,597
Please accept our thanks.

79
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,151
Please do not be such a stranger.
You'll stay the night as my guest.

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,990
Now, Shu Lien...

81
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,117
tell me something.

82
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,714
And forgive me for prying.

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,519
Your father
was a great friend to me,

84
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,752
and I think of you
as my own daughter.

85
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,911
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

86
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,317
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,755
and his warrior days...

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,798
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something?

89
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,549
I don't know...

90
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,952
Don't be coy. I've always known
about your feelings for each other.

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,236
All these years, it's a shame...

92
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,393
...neither of you is brave enough
to admit the truth to the other.

93
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,796
You're both wasting precious time.

94
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,188
I beg your pardon.
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

95
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,636
When it comes to emotions,

96
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,713
even great heroes can be idiots.

97
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,238
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more
open the next time you see him.

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,188
I'll give him an earful!

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,399
Sir Te said
to leave the sword in here.

100
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,354
Who are you?

101
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,071
I'm your guest today.

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,435
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

103
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,834
This is Sir Te's study.
You are here to?

104
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,712
I was just looking
for a quiet corner.

105
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,879
I am Sir Te's head servant.

106
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,837
And this is another of our guests.

107
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,516
It's heavy
for such a thin piece of metal!

108
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,274
The handle is heavy.
And the blade is no ordinary metal.

109
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,316
Still, the sword
is the lightest of weapons.

110
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,710
You're just not used
to handling it.

111
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,314
But, I have had much practice.

112
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,516
As a child in the West,
a platoon lived with us.

113
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,591
They'd let me play
with their weapons.

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,116
The scabbard is so beautiful.

115
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,676
Beautiful but dangerous.

116
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,310
Once you see it tainted with blood,
its beauty is hard to admire.

117
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,759
It's 400 years old.

118
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,599
Exquisite!

119
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,194
You said it belongs to...

120
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,389
My friend Li Mu Bai.
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

121
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,676
Li Mu Bai!

122
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,912
The famous warrior?

123
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,038
Why would he give his sword
to Sir Te?

124
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,510
You're too young to understand.

125
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,114
You're a sword fighter too?

126
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,156
Yes, I am.

127
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,072
But I prefer the machete.

128
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,392
Certain moves, however,
call for a sword.

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,875
Really?

130
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,033
It must be exciting to be
a fighter, to be totally free!

131
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,949
Fighters have rules too:
friendship, trust,

132
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,714
integrity... Without rules,

133
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,155
we wouldn't survive for long.

134
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,751
I've read
all about people like you.

135
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,639
Roaming wild, beating up anyone
who gets in your way!

136
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,633
Writers wouldn't sell many books
if they told how it really is.

137
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,234
But you're just like
the characters in the stories.

138
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,552
Sure. No place to bathe for days,
sleeping in flea-infested beds...

139
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,756
They tell you all about that
in those books?

140
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,876
You know what I mean.

141
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,029
I'm getting married soon, but
I haven't lived the life I want.

142
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,994
So I heard.
Congratulations.

143
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,275
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,274
You're not married, are you?

145
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,635
What do you think?

146
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,916
No! You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.

147
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,555
You're probably right.

148
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,915
Go ahead, Governor Yu.

149
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,152
2 feet 9 inches long.

150
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,273
1 inch wide.

151
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,679
The handle is 1 inch deep,
2.6 inches wide.

152
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,352
7 tenths of an inch thick.

153
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,031
With seven rubies missing
from the hilt.

154
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,711
You can tell the design

155
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,235
dates back
to before the Chin era.

156
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,278
Engraved with a technique lost
by the time of the Han Dynasty.

157
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,797
Your knowledge is remarkable,
Sir Te.

158
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,030
A sword by itself rules nothing.

159
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,395
It comes alive
only through skillful manipulation.

160
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,638
I see your point.
Please continue.

161
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,758
The Imperial Court
isn't the problem.

162
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,469
With royalty and officials
everywhere,

163
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,277
the Royal Guard
keeps security tight.

164
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,351
But Peking is not like the West.

165
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,672
Here, you'll find
all sorts of characters.

166
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,752
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.

167
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,036
Don't depend only on the court.

168
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,636
Contacts
in the Giang Hu underworld

169
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,439
can ensure your position.

170
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,476
Be strong yet supple.

171
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,596
This is the way to rule.

172
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,874
Governess...

173
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,708
Let me do it.

174
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,555
Please sit.

175
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,674
I've made you silk pajamas.
Do you want to change into them?

176
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,159
Put them down.

177
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,680
I heard you met Shu Lien today.

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,879
Do you know her?

179
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,268
She's one of those.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,798
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.

181
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,949
I'll socialize
with whomever I please.

182
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,119
Don't invite danger
into your father's house.

183
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,909
I'm tired now!

184
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,398
Go to bed then.

185
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,309
Miss has grown up,
and is getting married soon.

186
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,475
God knows
what the future will bring.

187
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,198
It'll be just the same.

188
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,514
Enough! I'm tired.

189
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,673
Autumn is coming.

190
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,910
I'll shut the windows for you.

191
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,630
- Chilly, eh?
- Yes, Master Bo.

192
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,875
Someone help!

193
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,473
Stop him!

194
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,993
He's on the roof!

195
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,879
The sword's been stolen!

196
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,316
Stop thief!

197
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,838
Stop him!

198
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,558
It's Jade Fox!

199
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,793
We must avenge Mother!

200
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,914
Do something!
He's getting away!

201
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,909
Return the sword
and I'll let you go.

202
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,593
You've been trained at Wudan?

203
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,192
You're mistaken.

204
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,954
We're just street performers.
We were rehearsing.

205
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,870
Father!

206
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,869
You were rehearsing?

207
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,712
Who are you trying to fool?

208
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,592
Where did that thief go?

209
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,152
Governor Yu's house!

210
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,308
Get down here!

211
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,309
Give back the sword!

212
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,636
Sir Te awaits you.

213
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,189
I'm sure the thief
is in the Yu household.

214
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,395
How dare you imply?

215
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,110
Enough!

216
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,350
Has Governor Yu
ever seen the sword?

217
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,548
Yes, though I doubt
he's involved in this.

218
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,473
But the sword
could be in his compound.

219
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,472
Then someone's trying
to set him up.

220
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,790
We should inform Li Mu Bai.

221
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,476
What is it?

222
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,596
Madam Yu,
someone's put up posters.

223
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,439
Let me see.

224
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,716
Someone is after a Jade Fox.

225
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,996
Preposterous, looking for her here!

226
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,389
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

227
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,353
I haven't seen them in two days.

228
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,750
There's a Miss Shu Lien here
to see you.

229
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,273
Miss is busy right now.

230
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,668
I'll tell her.

231
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,432
Show her in.

232
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,232
This spells trouble.

233
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,233
I have a guest.

234
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,388
This way please.

235
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,314
I've missed you.

236
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,276
How so?

237
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,032
I'm bored...

238
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,032
You're doing calligraphy?

239
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,438
I'll write your name.

240
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,909
Just for fun.

241
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,720
I never realized my name
looks like "sword".

242
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,512
You write gracefully. Calligraphy
is so similar to fencing.

243
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,872
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

244
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,476
Please.

245
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,957
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.

246
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,156
You must be overwhelmed
by the preparations.

247
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,949
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it the better.

248
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,875
My parents
are arranging everything.

249
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,999
The Gous are a very powerful family.

250
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,153
My marrying one will be good
for my father's career.

251
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,835
You are fortunate
to marry into such a noble family.

252
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,315
Am I?

253
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,552
I wish I were like the heroes
in the books I read.

254
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,153
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

255
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,678
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

256
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,752
But to be free
to live my own life,

257
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,036
to choose whom I love...

258
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,519
That is true happiness.

259
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,150
Do you think so?
Let me tell you a story...

260
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,839
About you and Li Mu Bai?

261
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,194
Yes.

262
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,397
Did you know I was once engaged
to be married?

263
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,950
No, really?

264
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,838
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

265
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,959
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai
by oath.

266
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,236
One day, while in battle,

267
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,234
he was killed by the sword
of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

268
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,836
After, Li Mu Bai and I
went through a lot together.

269
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,996
Our feelings for each other
grew stronger.

270
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,515
But how could we dishonor

271
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,238
Meng's memory?

272
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,153
So the freedom
you talk about, I too desire it.

273
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,470
But I have never tasted it.

274
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,998
Too bad for Meng, but it's not
your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

275
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,317
I am not an aristocrat,
as you are...

276
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,917
but I must still respect
a woman's duties.

277
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,118
Don't distance us.

278
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,273
From now on, let's be like sisters.

279
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,997
Then as a sister, let me wish you
happiness in your marriage.

280
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,480
What a godforsaken place!

281
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,279
Can't your father be appointed
closer to civilization?

282
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,074
Jen...

283
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,392
are you listening to me?

284
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,869
Let's go.

285
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,798
Who are you?

286
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,920
Wait! I'm a friend!

287
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,119
I don't care about your sword.

288
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,316
Why were you spying on the Yus?

289
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,199
I'm looking for someone.
Jade Fox.

290
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,636
I'm a police inspector
from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

291
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,910
Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

292
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,029
She must have come with them
when they transferred here.

293
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,432
But with Yu's reputation,
I can't just go in and accuse her.

294
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,517
- This Jade Fox is a woman?
- Yes.

295
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,558
Then leave her to me.

296
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,154
Pardon me,
but I doubt you can handle her.

297
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,754
My wife was
quite a martial arts expert.

298
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,239
Jade Fox killed her.

299
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,311
So you see,

300
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,472
this is personal.
Leave her to me.

301
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,513
It's ready.

302
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,110
I'm ready for anything!

303
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,591
Father gets first dip.

304
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,875
They're gone!

305
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,109
What does it say?

306
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,352
"We'll settle this at midnight
on Yellow Hill."

307
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,080
Good! The fox is out of her hole!

308
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,274
Shu Lien, look who's here.

309
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,115
Sir Te believes it's a ploy
to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

310
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,431
But something is going on
at the Yu household.

311
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,192
What have you discovered?

312
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,399
Jade Fox?

313
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,676
Impossible!

314
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,434
You'd always suspected
she'd fled to the West.

315
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,955
I didn't think she'd dare
come back to Peking!

316
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,954
Is there any place safer
than under the nose of Governor Yu?

317
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,109
So I shall avenge
my master's death after all.

318
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,592
Be careful.

319
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,228
Sir Te requires discretion.

320
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,550
Official business
is difficult enough.

321
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,110
Don't let personal feelings
make it worse.

322
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,353
And I don't know...
even this poster...

323
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,317
could be some sort of trap.

324
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,273
Did you see who posted it?

325
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,556
No.

326
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,836
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

327
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,958
On the night of the theft
there was a brawl near Yu's.

328
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,637
Were you involved?

329
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,711
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.

330
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,599
I hear he followed the thief
to the Yus'.

331
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,239
Have you questioned him yet?

332
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,631
No, not yet...

333
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,031
But your men are watching over
Yu's compound?

334
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,794
No, I'd already sent them home.

335
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,351
You can blame me
for losing the sword,

336
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,636
but please trust
that I'll get it back soon

337
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,711
using my own methods.

338
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,431
That's not what I meant.

339
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,238
I don't care about the sword.

340
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,190
What do you mean?
Didn't you come back here for it?

341
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,990
I didn't know it was stolen
until I got here.

342
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,071
Then, why did you come?

343
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,833
Well, we had talked...

344
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,792
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li,

345
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,678
your room is ready.

346
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,515
Thank you.

347
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,596
Please, lead the way.

348
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,354
The Fox doesn't care much
for punctuality.

349
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,590
Still no sign of her.

350
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,677
Enough! Show yourself!

351
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,115
Tsai...

352
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,759
You dog!

353
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,672
You will pay
for your stubbornness!

354
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,674
That's what you think, old witch!

355
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,752
If you surrender now,
you'll suffer less.

356
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,310
But if you resist,
I won't stop until you're dead.

357
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,916
Father!

358
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,152
Let me avenge my mother's death!

359
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,470
You'll soon end up like her,
you little whore!

360
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,870
You'll pay for that!

361
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,274
She's going to paralyze you!

362
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,915
May!

363
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,239
Tsai, you filthy mongrel!

364
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,591
An ambush!

365
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,233
Father, are you all right?

366
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,034
Wudan should have gotten
rid of you long ago.

367
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,551
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

368
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,473
You don't remember me...

369
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,476
But you should
remember my master.

370
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,710
You infiltrated Wudan
while I was away.

371
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,030
You stole our secret manual

372
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,156
and poisoned our master!

373
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,118
Now it's time for you to pay!

374
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,195
Your master
underestimated us women.

375
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,238
Sure, he'd sleep with me,
but he would never teach me.

376
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,079
He deserved to die
by a woman's hand!

377
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,199
You stole the secrets
of Wudan's highest martial arts.

378
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,193
But after ten years of training
your moves are still undisciplined.

379
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,759
And today,

380
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,514
under a Wudan sword...

381
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,351
you will die!

382
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,671
Disciple, we'll kill them all!

383
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,795
Let's go!

384
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,519
Another one!

385
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,916
I must get rid of Tsai!

386
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,990
Who are you?

387
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,191
Why is the Green Destiny
in your possession?

388
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,275
What's it to you?

389
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,919
My name is Li Mu Bai.

390
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,390
The Green Destiny is mine.

391
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,670
Jade Fox can't be your master.

392
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,671
Where did you learn
that "Xuan Piu" move?

393
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,636
I'm just playing around.

394
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,872
Tell me, who is your master?

395
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,197
- Let's go!
- We must kill them!

396
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,190
Father!

397
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,557
This is Tsai?

398
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,433
My father.

399
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,034
Police inspector from Shaan.

400
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,551
This should be reported
to Governor Yu.

401
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,790
The victim is an officer.

402
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,428
You believe the killer
is hiding out in his compound?

403
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,152
I'd bet my life on it!

404
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,074
Come with me.

405
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,230
This needs to be resolved,
and quickly.

406
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,473
I'll get into the Yu household
and get her.

407
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,358
I'll ferret out Fox and her gang.

408
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,714
We must be careful.

409
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,156
Yu is a court official,
and in charge of security.

410
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,278
Any disturbance
will cast suspicion on him.

411
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,112
It might get Sir Te in trouble.

412
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,313
This is a delicate matter.

413
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,519
Sir Te, can you find some excuse

414
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,478
to invite
Madam Yu and her daughter?

415
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,598
What do you have in mind?

416
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,156
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.

417
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,837
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
with these wedding gifts.

418
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,517
She's being so considerate.

419
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,474
I'm sorry she's not feeling
well enough to receive you today.

420
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,313
I heard Sir Te lost something.

421
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,552
And now Madam Te's
not feeling well...

422
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,951
We know who stole
the missing item.

423
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,755
If the thief returns it,
I'm sure Sir Te will pursue

424
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,751
the matter no further.

425
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,148
That's good.

426
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,279
Sometimes the help can't keep
their hands to themselves.

427
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,953
It's very embarrassing.

428
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,948
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people can make mistakes...

429
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,157
that can bring ruin to themselves
and their families.

430
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,318
But don't be too lenient.

431
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,438
No mercy will be shown
toward the murderer

432
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,999
who turned up in Peking.

433
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,871
A murderer?

434
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,870
Yes,

435
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,953
the very killer
of Li Mu Bai's own master.

436
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,916
Last night,

437
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,719
she killed a policeman
who had tracked her down.

438
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,599
A female criminal!
Now that's news!

439
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,672
You say she killed
a policeman?

440
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,399
Yes, from the West.

441
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,996
He went undercover,
and followed her here.

442
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,875
Maybe the murderer

443
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,508
and the thief are the same.

444
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,556
I doubt that.

445
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,197
This thief...

446
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,633
is very unusual.

447
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,952
And most likely smarter
than a mere killer.

448
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,669
Greetings, Sir Te.

449
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,354
Hello, Madam Yu.

450
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,635
This is Li Mu Bai,

451
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,155
the renowned swordsman.

452
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,833
Delighted to meet you.

453
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,556
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

454
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,031
Congratulations.

455
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,196
Why don't you come in?

456
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,918
I'm standing guard.

457
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,674
Come in. It's cold.

458
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,394
Come in.

459
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,438
We don't have to fear Jade Fox
if we're together.

460
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,152
Isn't it a bit late to be out?

461
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,959
You've brought me the sword?

462
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,030
I do as I please.

463
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,274
Where is your master?

464
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,556
What's it to you?

465
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,718
Had enough flying?

466
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,435
You've got potential.

467
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,673
You've studied the Wudan manual
but you don't understand it.

468
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,960
You need a real master.

469
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,396
Do you think
you are a real master?

470
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,189
Like most things,
I am nothing.

471
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,157
It's the same for this sword.

472
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,629
All of it is simply
a state of mind.

473
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,396
Stop talking like a monk!

474
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,470
Just fight!

475
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,278
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

476
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,077
On guard!

477
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,031
Real sharpness
comes without effort.

478
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,595
No growth.

479
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,869
Without assistance.

480
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,709
No action.

481
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,275
Without reaction.

482
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,279
No desire without restraint.

483
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,954
Now give yourself up
and find yourself again.

484
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,675
There is a lesson for you.

485
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,674
Go ahead.

486
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,436
Why should I?

487
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,559
You need practice. I can teach you
to fight with the Green Destiny,

488
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,518
but first you must learn
to hold it in stillness.

489
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,712
Why do you want to teach me?

490
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,111
I've always wanted a disciple

491
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,636
worthy of Wudan's secrets.

492
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,270
And if I use them
to kill you?

493
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,798
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

494
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,794
Deep down, you're good.
Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

495
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,716
Wudan is a whorehouse!

496
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,949
Keep your lessons!

497
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,559
You're home late...

498
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,073
or should I say early?

499
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,990
Why are you still here?
You killed a policeman.

500
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,833
You should leave!

501
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,354
You'll bring ruin
on my whole family.

502
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,671
They wouldn't have found me
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

503
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,431
Like a little girl,
you thought stealing would be fun?

504
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,078
You, too, are responsible
for that death. Come with me.

505
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,114
You don't want to waste your life
as the wife of some bureaucrat.

506
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,991
Denied your talent...

507
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,515
As master and disciple
we will rule.

508
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,749
I'll never live as a thief!

509
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,592
You're already a thief.

510
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,988
That was just for fun.

511
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,071
How can I leave?
Where would I go?

512
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,639
Wherever we want.

513
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,518
We'll get rid of anyone
in our way.

514
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,556
Even your father.

515
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,789
Shut up!

516
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,714
It's the Giang Hu fighter
lifestyle... kill or be killed.

517
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,552
Exciting, isn't it?

518
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,957
I owe you nothing.

519
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,111
Yes, you do!

520
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,477
You are still my disciple.

521
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,599
You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?

522
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,550
You couldn't even
decipher the symbols!

523
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,920
I studied the diagrams.

524
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,957
But you hid the details!

525
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,590
You wouldn't have understood,
even if I had tried to explain.

526
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,194
You know...

527
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,519
you've gone as far as you can go.

528
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,753
I hid my skills
so as not to hurt you.

529
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,996
If I hadn't seen you
fight with Li Mu Bai,

530
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,677
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.

531
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,873
Master...

532
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,472
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 10.

533
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,629
You enchanted me
with the world of Giang Hu.

534
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,949
But once I realized
I could surpass you,

535
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,678
I became so frightened!

536
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,151
Everything fell apart.

537
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,390
I had no one to guide me,

538
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,471
no one to learn from.

539
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,231
Believe me,

540
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,391
I've a lesson or two left
to teach you!

541
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,430
The sword is back...

542
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,598
Are you happy?

543
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,591
I admit...

544
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,194
getting it back makes me realize
how much I'd missed it.

545
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,230
But it's not your sword anymore.

546
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,470
You gave it to Sir Te.

547
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,029
True.

548
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,037
But I must borrow it
for one last mission.

549
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,108
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

550
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,194
Did you know what you were hiding
when you covered for that girl?

551
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,636
My job was to get the sword back,
without embarrassing anyone.

552
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,439
I wasn't about to ruin

553
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,875
her life, or her father's.

554
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,679
You did your job well.

555
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,354
But, this girl...

556
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,668
I saw her last night.

557
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,957
I knew she would intrigue you.

558
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,392
She needs direction...

559
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,518
and training.

560
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,592
She's an aristocrat's daughter.
She's not one of us.

561
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,796
In any case,
it will all be over soon.

562
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,509
You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.

563
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,958
That's not for her.

564
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,395
She should come to Wudan
and become a disciple.

565
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,038
But Wudan does not accept women.

566
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,189
For her, they might
make an exception.

567
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,114
If not, I'm afraid she'll become
a poisoned dragon.

568
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,359
It's not our affair.

569
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,116
Even if Wudan accepts her,
her husband might object.

570
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,117
I thought by giving away the sword,

571
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,157
I could escape the Giang Hu world.

572
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,793
But the cycle of bloodshed
continues.

573
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,070
I wish there were something more

574
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,356
I could do to help you.

575
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,635
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

576
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,509
Lo?

577
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,115
Jen!

578
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,271
You shouldn't have come.

579
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,830
With all the traffic
on your rooftop these days...

580
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,672
it took me a while
to get in here.

581
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,671
I can't wait any longer.

582
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,354
I was wrong to let you go.

583
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,029
Come back with me.

584
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,509
You'll be happy in the desert.

585
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,432
You'll be free there.

586
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,388
You've been looking for me
all this time?

587
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,635
Jen...

588
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,358
Stop playing with it.

589
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,836
I won't break it.

590
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,915
It's Dark Cloud!

591
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,431
Dark Cloud is coming!

592
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,675
Lower the shade,
don't let them see you!

593
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,236
Don't touch the women!

594
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,113
Let's go!

595
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,109
Come get your comb.

596
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,199
Hurry back to your mother.

597
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,558
She's mine!

598
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,675
Leave her to me!

599
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,239
Come and get it!

600
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,118
Give me back my comb!

601
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,999
Let's stop a moment.

602
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,752
Give it back!

603
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,430
You're tired. You need rest.

604
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,113
Your horse needs water.
There's a creek up here.

605
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,671
Well, there used to be!

606
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,790
What's your name?

607
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,869
I'm Lo.

608
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,076
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

609
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,992
I'm not that tall or big,

610
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,878
but I'm quick as lightning.

611
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,514
My comb!

612
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,398
If you like that arrow,
I can make you a bow.

613
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,755
Great for hunting wild chicken.

614
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,558
They're delicious.

615
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,195
You need to eat.
Understand?

616
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,153
Then you'll have
the strength to fight.

617
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,995
Understand?

618
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,396
You're eating too fast.

619
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,913
Slowly.

620
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,873
You've got quite a temper.

621
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,917
It's better this way...

622
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,599
You coward!

623
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,316
Still in a bad mood?

624
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,471
At least you're speaking.

625
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,149
What's your name?

626
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,070
I didn't think the Hans
had names like that.

627
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,076
Relax.

628
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,592
If I had wanted to, I would
already have done it.

629
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,955
You must be dying for a bath.

630
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,153
Fresh water's hard to get here.

631
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,955
But I managed to bring some up.

632
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,509
You can wear my clothes
when you're done.

633
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,599
They're clean.

634
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,154
Don't worry.

635
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,315
I'll sing,
so you'll know where I am.

636
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,475
After the bath,
you'll be calmer.

637
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,113
No more hitting on the head!

638
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,235
All this trouble for a comb?

639
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,639
It's mine.

640
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,678
It means a lot to me. A barbarian
like you wouldn't understand.

641
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,873
Not true. I can use it
to pick fleas from my horse.

642
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,356
By the way,
I'm a real Manchurian.

643
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,515
I'm sorry...

644
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,108
I guessed wrong.

645
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,952
I thought you were a Han.

646
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,077
Give me back my comb.

647
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,990
I don't take orders from anyone.

648
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,595
Give it back.

649
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,399
One night...

650
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,999
when I was a boy, I saw
a thousand shooting stars.

651
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,872
I thought,
"Where did they all go?"

652
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,199
I'm an orphan.
I used to look for stars alone.

653
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,069
I thought if I rode to the other
end of the desert, I'd find them.

654
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,752
I've been riding in the desert
ever since.

655
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,629
And so, the little boy
became a fearsome bandit.

656
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,758
He couldn't find the stars,
so he stole my comb.

657
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,629
Out here, you always fight
for survival.

658
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,315
You have to be part of a gang
to stand a chance.

659
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,552
Slowly,
your gang becomes your family.

660
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,437
All that Dark Cloud stuff
is just to scare people

661
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,750
and make my life easier.

662
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,994
So you are still that little boy

663
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,355
looking for shooting stars.

664
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,352
I am a man.

665
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,834
And now I've found
the brightest star of all.

666
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,991
Your father's men
are looking for you.

667
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,591
They're still out there,
circling closer.

668
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,792
Let them look.

669
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,190
It is trouble for me.

670
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,478
Don't send me back.

671
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,913
You must decide.

672
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,833
You might get tired of this life.

673
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,473
You might begin
to miss your family.

674
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,111
If it were our daughter,
we'd look for her too.

675
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,475
She would miss us.

676
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,355
Jen...

677
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,757
I want you to be mine forever.

678
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,313
I will make my mark
on the world.

679
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,835
I will earn your parents respect.

680
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,472
We have a legend.

681
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,915
Anyone who dares to jump
from the mountain,

682
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,116
God will grant his wish.

683
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,230
Long ago, a young man's parents
were ill, so he jumped.

684
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,879
He didn't die.

685
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,077
He wasn't even hurt.

686
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,079
He floated away,
far away, never to return.

687
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,474
He knew his wish had come true.

688
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,515
If you believe,
it will happen.

689
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,316
The elders say,

690
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,274
"A faithful heart
makes wishes come true".

691
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,518
Keep it safe.

692
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,433
Return it to me
when we are together again.

693
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,709
I will.

694
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,516
If you don't,
I'll come after you.

695
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,919
And I won't let you off so easy.

696
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,596
Wherever I went
someone always recognized me.

697
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,071
I really tried.

698
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,991
Later, I heard you came
to Peking.

699
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,390
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

700
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,597
So I came.

701
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,117
I can't let you marry.

702
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,149
Go.

703
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,229
Jen...

704
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,877
Don't ever come back.

705
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,553
So it's over?

706
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:48,990
Yes.

707
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,310
We heard noises.

708
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,038
It was just a cat.

709
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,150
You think Jade Fox will show up?

710
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,151
She's out there,

711
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,439
but I doubt she'll show herself.

712
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,079
We'll keep our eyes open.

713
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,036
Sooner or later,

714
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,278
she'll come for the girl.

715
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,150
Jen!

716
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,589
Come with me!

717
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,792
You're mine!
Come with me to the desert!

718
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,230
Jen!

719
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,756
Come with me to Xin Jiang!

720
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,637
Tell me.

721
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,028
Where is Jade Fox?

722
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,838
Come with me. Hurry!

723
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,039
You thought she'd give it all up
and go back West with you?

724
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,679
She's mine.

725
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,068
Either way,

726
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,710
you are no good to her dead.
With the Gou and Yu clans

727
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,599
hunting you,
you'll soon be in their hands.

728
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,194
I don't care anymore.

729
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,273
If you truly loved her,
you wouldn't say that.

730
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,199
Don't you want to see her again?

731
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,435
All right.

732
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,955
I'll write you an introduction.
Take it to Wudan.

733
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,951
Wait there for news from me.

734
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,390
All right.

735
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,120
When will this end?

736
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,033
They take it, they put it back,
they take it again.

737
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,034
My home is turning into
a warehouse.

738
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,076
Come in.

739
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,036
Speak!

740
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,519
Jen has run away!

741
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,910
Gou found
the wedding chamber empty.

742
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,719
Governor Yu requests
your assistance.

743
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,438
You know
the Giang Hu underworld.

744
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,195
He wants to find her,
and keep her from harm.

745
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,950
Sir Te, leave this to us.
Don't worry.

746
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,073
What can I serve you?

747
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,509
This cup is dirty.

748
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:46,910
Hello.

749
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,837
What's your name?

750
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,949
Long.

751
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,472
It's young Master Long.

752
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,755
My apologies!

753
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,639
I'm Iron Eagle Sung

754
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,279
and this is my brother in arms,

755
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,112
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

756
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,633
What brings you to Huai An,

757
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,075
and where are you headed,
Master Long?

758
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,519
Anywhere there's action.

759
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,070
In that case, perhaps
we could be of assistance.

760
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,833
Don't bother.

761
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,834
You don't seem to understand.

762
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,193
So what if I don't?

763
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,036
We have ways of helping you
to understand.

764
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,119
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

765
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,112
He is my defeated foe!

766
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,918
Have some tea.

767
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,068
Shu Lien...

768
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,513
The things we touch
have no permanence.

769
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,317
My master would say...

770
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,711
there is nothing
we can hold on to in this world.

771
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,628
Only by letting go
can we truly possess what is real.

772
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,152
Not everything
is an illusion.

773
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,992
My hand...

774
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,310
wasn't that real?

775
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:04,478
Your hand, rough and callused
from practice...

776
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,632
All this time, I've never had
the courage to touch it.

777
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,591
Giang Hu is a world
of tigers and dragons,

778
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,753
full of corruption...

779
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,554
I tried sincerely to give it up

780
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,870
but I have brought us only trouble.

781
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,508
To repress one's feelings
only makes them stronger.

782
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,913
You're right,
but I don't know what to do.

783
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,196
I want to be with you...

784
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,072
just like this.

785
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,554
It gives me a sense of peace.

786
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,794
Please follow me.

787
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,913
- I want a clean room.
- We have plenty.

788
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,555
Your order?

789
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,199
Steamed whole cod,
bite-size meatballs,

790
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,749
a little starchy,
but keep the sauce light,

791
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,912
shark fin soup, mixed vegetables,
and some warm wine.

792
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,069
I have to order
from a bigger restaurant.

793
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,275
Hurry then.

794
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,909
That's him.

795
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,552
I am Iron Arm Mi.

796
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,711
I heard a true master has arrived.
I have come to seek a lesson.

797
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,953
You asked for it!

798
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,232
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

799
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,593
You have amazing technique!

800
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,990
I am Flying Saber.

801
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,038
Are you related
to Southern Crane?

802
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,158
Southern Duck?
I don't eat anything with two feet.

803
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,436
Who could remember
such long-winded names?

804
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,832
Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,

805
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,639
and you don't know
his master Southern Crane?

806
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,914
Who are you?

807
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,794
I'm Shining Phoenix
Mountain Gou.

808
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,469
Gou?

809
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,678
I hate that name.

810
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,319
It makes me puke!

811
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,428
Too bad you're named Gou.

812
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,791
You'll be the first
to feel my sword today.

813
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,430
Hold it!

814
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,920
Don't you know Monk Jing?

815
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,548
A monk, in a place like this?
You need a lesson!

816
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,312
Who are you?

817
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,594
Who am I?

818
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,955
I am...

819
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,395
I am
the Invincible Sword Goddess.

820
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,797
Armed with the incredible...

821
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,393
Green Destiny.

822
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,555
Be you Li or Southern Crane...

823
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,638
lower your head...

824
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,949
and ask for mercy.

825
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,233
I am the desert dragon.

826
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,314
I leave no trace.

827
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,517
Today I fly over Eu-Mei.

828
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,675
Tomorrow...

829
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,236
I'll kick over
Wudan Mountain!

830
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,792
We politely asked for
a friendly match,

831
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,110
but she showed no respect,
and attacked us.

832
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,670
Everyone came by
to teach her a lesson.

833
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,990
Her sword was just too powerful.

834
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,354
I've traveled everywhere,

835
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,476
but never
met anyone so uncivilized.

836
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:58,679
She kept accusing me of being
Gou Jun Pei's brother.

837
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,673
Who is this Gou, anyway?

838
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,315
Her husband.

839
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,391
We're close
to your headquarters.

840
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,879
Go home and check in.

841
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,234
What about you?

842
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,595
I'll look around
and catch up later.

843
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,590
Not a bad idea.

844
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,514
Tonight we'll get a good night's
sleep at headquarters.

845
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,074
Mistress, you're back.

846
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,993
It's you!

847
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,439
How is everything here?

848
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,350
Fine.

849
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,112
You've been gone a while.

850
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,679
Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

851
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,751
- Your wife was due?
- Yeah, a baby girl.

852
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,636
Good!

853
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,439
I'll be happy if she's
half as strong as you.

854
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,155
Mrs. Wu...

855
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,108
You're back!

856
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,475
- How's the arm? Still sore?
- Much better.

857
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,239
You've been gone so long.

858
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,470
Li Mu Bai is coming
to stay the night.

859
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,471
I'll go and make up his room!

860
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,714
Sister Shu Lien...

861
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,680
Here you must be
in proper attire.

862
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:14,195
I'm just borrowing some
clean clothes. I'm not staying.

863
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,398
I'll give them to you.

864
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,633
I was just passing by
and wondered how you were.

865
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,630
You, sister...

866
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,519
Look at the trouble
you've caused.

867
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,319
Now you know what
Giang Hu life is really like.

868
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,074
If you think of me
as your sister,

869
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,677
let me give you
some sisterly advice.

870
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,798
You can run from marriage,
but not your parents.

871
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,353
They forced me to marry!

872
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,233
Go back to them first.

873
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,311
Then you can decide about Lo.

874
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,315
You know about Lo?

875
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,832
He really loves you.

876
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,399
Come back to Peking with me.
We'll find a solution.

877
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,674
Where is he now?

878
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,638
Li Mu Bai
has made arrangements.

879
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,351
He sent him
to Wudan Mountain.

880
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,834
You're working together
to set me up! I'm leaving!

881
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,430
How dare you accuse us!

882
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,795
I always knew
you had stolen the sword!

883
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,315
I've done nothing
but protect you and your family.

884
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,675
And you've repaid me
with nothing but contempt.

885
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,713
Li Mu Bai himself spared you,
and all you do is insult him.

886
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,917
We wanted some peace
and you've ruined it all!

887
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,877
You're no sister of mine!

888
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,588
What do I care?

889
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,675
You were never a real friend
anyway.

890
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,678
But I wonder...

891
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,831
how long could you last
as my enemy?

892
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,235
Put the sword down!

893
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:10,990
Jen!

894
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,636
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

895
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,669
Fine... the friendship is over.

896
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,709
Don't touch it!

897
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,873
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

898
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,112
Come and get it if you can.

899
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,832
Without the Green Destiny,
you are nothing.

900
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,471
Don't be a sore loser.

901
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,910
Go ahead. Take your pick.

902
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,595
I'll wait.

903
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,235
Go ahead.

904
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,319
Give me the sword.

905
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:57,311
Take it!

906
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,037
Stop it!

907
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,432
You don't deserve
the Green Destiny.

908
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,033
Not another lecture!

909
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:10,996
On guard!

910
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,070
Let's end this here.

911
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,158
Only the sword will settle this.

912
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,919
I only let you go because
I wanted to see the real you.

913
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,673
What do you know
about a true heart?

914
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,674
What do you want?

915
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,270
What I've always wanted,
to teach you.

916
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,389
All right.

917
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,508
If you can take back the sword
in three moves,

918
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,033
I'll go with you.

919
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,271
Give it back!

920
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,317
- Kneel!
- Never!

921
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,755
Then you have no use
for the sword.

922
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,913
Sooner or later
they'd drag you back to Peking.

923
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:50,911
Your parents
will never accept you again.

924
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,275
But why go home?

925
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:59,072
We've gone this far,
we won't stop now.

926
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,549
You'll always be my Lady.

927
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:06,959
At last, we'll be our own masters.

928
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,072
We'll be happy.
That's the most important thing.

929
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,515
All we have left is each other,
right?

930
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,073
Lie down and rest.

931
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,040
She's crazy.
You should have killed her.

932
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,997
I didn't have the heart.

933
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,914
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

934
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,035
Is it me
or the sword you want?

935
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,952
You've been drugged.

936
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,992
Where is Jade Fox?

937
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:21,909
What happened?

938
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:25,554
Jade Fox drugged her.

939
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,119
How did you get here?

940
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,635
We followed Jade Fox.

941
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,709
And so you die.

942
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,872
And so shall you!

943
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,592
A poisoned needle!

944
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,516
You deserve to die,

945
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,716
but the life
I was hoping to take...

946
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,270
was Jen's.

947
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,990
Ten years I devoted to you.

948
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,793
But you deceived me!

949
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,477
You hid
the manual's true meaning.

950
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,399
I never improved...

951
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,514
but your progress was limitless!

952
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,239
You know what poison is?

953
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,754
An eight-year-old girl,

954
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:51,912
full of deceit.
That's poison!

955
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,075
Jen!

956
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,837
My only family...

957
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,830
my only enemy...

958
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,395
You can't die!

959
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,790
Tell us what poison you used!

960
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,033
You can't die!

961
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,235
Tell us the antidote!

962
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,994
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

963
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,878
She used Purple Yin...

964
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:27,839
Purple Yin poison.

965
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,558
It goes straight to the heart.

966
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,829
It's the same poison she used
to kill my master.

967
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,710
My blood
will soon reverse its flow.

968
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,358
There is no antidote.

969
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,476
That can't be!
Everything has an antithesis!

970
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,676
Why not this?

971
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:51,070
The antidote exists.

972
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,636
She taught it to me.

973
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,270
The formula is simple,

974
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,510
but it takes time to prepare.

975
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,150
Trust me.

976
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:08,192
As you have helped me,

977
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,112
let me help him.

978
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:12,836
All right.

979
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,595
Hurry.
I will hold on as long as I can.

980
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,035
Take my horse
and go to the compound.

981
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,873
Give this to Mrs. Wu.
She'll help you. Hurry!

982
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,873
Spare your energy.
I'll be back!

983
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,715
Where is Mrs. Wu?

984
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,310
Stop it!

985
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:01,559
Shu Lien
told me to show you this.

986
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,959
Let her in.

987
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,994
Mu Bai, hold on.

988
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,837
Give me some hope.

989
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,709
Shu Lien...

990
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,038
Save your strength.

991
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,755
My life is departing.

992
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,990
I've only one breath left.

993
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,709
Use it to meditate.

994
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,715
Free yourself from this world

995
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:12,269
as you have been taught.

996
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:14,758
Let your soul rise to eternity

997
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,593
with your last breath.

998
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,839
Do not waste it...

999
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,797
for me.

1000
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,431
I've already wasted
my whole life.

1001
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,748
I want to tell you
with my last breath...

1002
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,836
I have always loved you.

1003
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:14,472
I would rather be a ghost,
drifting by your side...

1004
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,232
as a condemned soul...

1005
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:23,555
than enter heaven without you.

1006
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,793
Because of your love...

1007
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:34,073
I will never be a lonely spirit.

1008
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:28,869
He's gone?

1009
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,269
Bo...

1010
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,919
please take this sword
back to Sir Te.

1011
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,676
Now you must go
to Wudan Mountain.

1012
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:12,718
Lo awaits you there.

1013
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,719
Promise me one thing.

1014
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:18,959
Whatever path
you take in this life...

1015
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,430
be true to yourself.

1016
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:13,753
Do you remember the legend
of the young man?

1017
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:18,234
"A faithful heart
makes wishes come true."

1018
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,312
Make a wish, Lo.

1019
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,474
To be back in the desert,
together again.
