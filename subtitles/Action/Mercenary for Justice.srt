1
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:57,084
Understand, Chapel.
This is a very sensitive operation.

2
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:06,366
That island is considered a CIA asset.
I want those independent contractors...

3
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,925
believing they're liberating those people.

4
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:14,634
Did you think
that I was going to tell them...

5
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,405
that they're risking their lives
so we can get rich off diamonds and oil?

6
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:28,315
I need the best on this one
and I need plausible deniability.

7
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,325
I shall give you the best.

8
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,798
Kruger and Dekerk.

9
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,777
<i>Munitions experts,
South Africans.</i>

10
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,710
<i>More specifically, Afrikaners.</i>

11
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,943
There is not a gun or a bullet
they cannot find or use.

12
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:57,985
Five hundred kills to their credit.

13
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,544
Lovely.

14
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:01,451
This is Mr. Samuel Kay.

15
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:07,825
<i>MIS and Al specialist.
Fluent in nine computer languages.</i>

16
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:11,922
<i>Can, or more precisely, has hacked
his way into every system in the world...</i>

17
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:14,263
including your own.

18
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,497
<i>Especially when you consider
with whom they shall be working.</i>

19
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:21,836
<i>Maxine Barnol.</i>

20
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:25,276
<i>Where hardware hacking
and bribery won't work...</i>

21
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,109
you need a muse.

22
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,582
Extraordinary.

23
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,183
9-3-60. This is Blind Eagle,
do you copy, over?

24
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:39,014
Mr. Radio Jones,
communications specialist.

25
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:43,859
And the only person capable
of talking Mr. John Seeger...

26
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,266
into joining our little party.

27
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,033
<i>John Seeger.</i>

28
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,741
<i>The most decorated soldier
in the First Gulf War.</i>

29
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,171
He's a wild card, Chapel.

30
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:03,080
Yes. The best at doing what he does.

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,141
Will he know we're behind this?

32
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,649
Only if you want him to.

33
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,588
Just make sure you keep it
under control, Chapel.

34
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,884
We don't need a war.

35
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,161
Peace.

36
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,783
Though you cannot see it......

37
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:45,118
....just over that hill a fierce battle has erupted,
sending civilians fleeing for their lives.

38
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,336
It's perfect.

39
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:39,436
Johnny, hotwire this piece of shit
and lay a charge.

40
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,481
You, rookie, it's time to show us
what you're made of.

41
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,445
Jack a car in town,
and we move in on the target.

42
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:47,214
Once she's clear, we go in with the truck.

43
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:48,482
Do you think she's up to it?

44
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,749
Hmm.

45
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,790
Well, if she doesn't call us
after five minutes...

46
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,384
we'll do it the old-fashioned way.

47
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,039
The children will be down
in a minute.

48
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,511
Please get their breakfast ready
on the table.

49
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,048
I'm taking the Ambassador his coffee now.

50
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,516
I have an urgent message
for the Ambassador.

51
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:25,044
Guys, we're all clear.

52
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,050
- May I pour your coffee for you?
- Yes, please.

53
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,984
You two! Come with me.

54
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,857
Come with me now.

55
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:45,125
It's okay.

56
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:02,304
<i>Bonjour.</i>

57
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:03,372
What are you doing here?

58
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,680
You know what the fuck I'm doing here.

59
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,017
Your foreign policy sucks,
and we need you as insurance...

60
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,112
to get out of this mess.

61
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,753
- I'm the French Ambassador!
- I know who the fuck you are.

62
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:17,058
I'm running a bit of a tight schedule,
so let's move!

63
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,797
Get up on the truck.

64
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,931
Move!

65
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,874
Get! Go on!

66
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,106
All right, get on the truck.
It's not a fucking holiday!

67
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,641
Move!

68
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,275
All right, let's move out!
We don't want to keep our friends waiting.

69
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,235
Three days ago,
heavily armed mercenaries launched...

70
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:07,007
a lightning raid
overthrowing Sibi Al Fukar...

71
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,515
and his corrupt cadre of army officers...

72
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:14,247
who have held this tiny island nation
in their iron grip for over three years.

73
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,480
With the surprise arrival
of a brigade of French commandos...

74
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,925
these mercenaries have been dislodged
from their positions around the city...

75
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:25,021
and put on the defensive,
forced into a shrinking perimeter.

76
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,397
As the French mass for a final assault...

77
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:31,029
these besieged soldiers of fortune
now face a stark choice.

78
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,800
The inside of a French jail cell or death.

79
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,103
Colonel. Colonel.

80
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,102
Colonel, will you risk an attack
even though these mercenaries...

81
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:12,702
have taken civilian hostages?

82
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,775
Colonel Roland, when do you strike?

83
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,749
They have nowhere to go.

84
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:27,224
We will overtake them
but we'll have hostages to consider.

85
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:30,559
With your permission, I'd like to cross
the line and talk to the mercenaries.

86
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,326
And yes, I understand what that means.

87
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,000
Let her through.

88
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,034
- Who the hell are you with?
- Looks like I'm with the mercenaries.

89
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,587
Chief, I don't know where these numbers
are coming from!

90
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:12,989
We're outnumbered. We're in trouble.

91
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,255
Where are all these Frenchies
coming from?

92
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,827
Get head office on the secure line.

93
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,299
- Where's Kruger and his men?
- Last call we heard...

94
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,363
Kruger took the French Ambassador
and his family for extra insurance.

95
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,636
Why did you agree to work
with a slap-dick like that anyway?

96
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,109
It wasn't my call.

97
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,175
You two, move!

98
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,343
Camera crew coming in!

99
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,878
Maxine, what are you doing here?

100
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:45,516
Man, you're supposed to stay out
of the danger zone to gather intel only.

101
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,820
You hear that?

102
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,090
Oh, okay, well how's this for intel?
The French have landed.

103
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,790
Somebody fucked us! Who?

104
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,433
Radio, give me that com unit.

105
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,036
Damn it!

106
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,345
Hello, Bravo! Bravo 1-2-3.

107
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:11,714
Do you copy?

108
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,685
Got our employers on the line here.

109
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,222
Maybe it's time to swallow our pride
and call for a little help.

110
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,727
This is another CIA "fuck you," isn't it?

111
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,662
Oh, right, I forgot, the creed,
"Care for no one, fight for everyone."

112
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:27,029
It's a good motto, isn't it?

113
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:32,167
Sigma, this is Alpha 9. I repeat, Alpha 9.

114
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,303
Do you read me?

115
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>Sigma,
this is Alpha 9. Say again, Alpha 9.</i>

116
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,976
Chapel, you guaranteed me
this French fiasco would not happen.

117
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:42,240
<i>Sigma, this is Alpha 9.
I repeat, Alpha 9.</i>

118
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,340
You know,
I think we're in a refund situation.

119
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,080
Shall I make the check out
to the CIA or to you?

120
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,146
<i>- It's your call on this one, Dresham.
- Fuck you, Chapel.</i>

121
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,282
It's a bit more for my mercs to handle.

122
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,316
<i>Shall we call in the troops?</i>

123
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:56,362
Those mercs, did they figure out
who they're working for?

124
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,921
And what difference does that make?

125
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:00,296
Because right now we need deniability...

126
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:01,698
more than we need them back
in one piece.

127
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:02,860
You understand me?

128
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,233
We're still working the plan, Sigma.

129
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,738
Didn't you say there would be
no counter-support?

130
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,799
Can we expect any help from your end
with our extraction?

131
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,241
You really want them back, Chapel?

132
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,940
No help at all.

133
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,873
<i>Chapel, you and Dresham fuck us on this...</i>

134
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm gonna stick my.45 up your ass
and break every bone in your body.

135
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,010
- Chapel, this is getting out of control.
- You know something?

136
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,580
The next time that you and the Agency
want to plan a little business trip...

137
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,216
dial someone else.

138
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,823
Fucking Yank. Excuse my language.

139
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,165
All right, Jones, call in the chopper.

140
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,300
Samuel, load up all the wounded.

141
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,435
Send in a goddamn chopper now!

142
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,036
You'll never learn, will you?

143
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:49,480
- Who do you think we're working for?
- Heads up!

144
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,716
I'd settle for
just getting the fuck out of here.

145
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,517
I shouldn't have dragged you
into this, John.

146
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,956
They used me to get ahold of you, man!

147
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,633
You hang on, son.
I'm gonna get you on that chopper.

148
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,604
Take care of Eddie.

149
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,338
Hang on, Jones, you hear me?

150
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:18,707
Shondra.

151
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:20,007
Hang on, man.

152
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,440
Promise me.

153
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:34,253
Paul! Paul!

154
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:45,332
Go! Code blue!
There's our pickup. Let's go!

155
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,234
Stand back! Don't move!

156
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:52,574
I'm press! I'm press!

157
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:54,773
You just killed an innocent man, asshole!

158
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,159
<i>Colonel, this is Kruger. Come in.</i>

159
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,033
Mr. Kruger.

160
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,664
There is nowhere for you to run.

161
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,507
Now listen up...

162
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:26,603
I got the French Ambassador
and his lovely family here...

163
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:30,343
and the truck is rigged to blow,
so stand the fuck down.

164
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,965
Tell them to hold their fire.

165
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,564
Repeat. Everyone, stand down.

166
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,937
Pull forward!

167
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,562
- Colonel, what the fuck are you doing?
- Repeat, everyone, stand down.

168
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,601
On my mark,
get the fuck out of that truck!

169
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,508
Now! Get out!

170
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:07,079
Go! Move!

171
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,853
Keep moving!

172
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,221
Come on, men! Move!

173
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,667
Left bank, 20 degrees!

174
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,782
Come on! Come on!

175
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,362
Hey, hey.

176
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,261
No worries, Johnny boy.
We made it, didn't we?

177
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,132
I ought to fucking kill you right now, boy.

178
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,969
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, maybe not right now.

179
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,817
I hear the blacks in the States
fly really well.

180
00:20:57,817 --> 00:20:59,085
So why don't you and your buddy...

181
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,286
hop in the tail and fly the fuck out of here!

182
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:03,522
I'll fly on the tail, Kruger,
if you don't mind me...

183
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:07,259
throwing this grenade up in this helicopter
with all you motherfucking white folks!

184
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,602
Forget about it.

185
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,500
Yo, Seeger, come on, we're full!

186
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,408
Leave him, we're full, man!

187
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,341
Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here!
Come on!

188
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,087
Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

189
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,302
Maxine?

190
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,572
She'll play it through. She always does.

191
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,002
The car's going too slow.

192
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,705
Come on. Go.

193
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,977
Oh, yeah. We're catching up.

194
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:36,880
Whoa!

195
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:43,758
<i>Today, Galmoral
was turned over to the UN by the French...</i>

196
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:46,424
<i>ending a conflict
which began as a small coup...</i>

197
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:48,660
<i>by antigovernment mercenaries...</i>

198
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,965
<i>now celebrated as heroes here.</i>

199
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:55,697
<i>This small island nation has its first taste
of freedom in over 100 years...</i>

200
00:22:55,697 --> 00:22:57,105
<i>and democratic elections...</i>

201
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:03,849
You were correct.
One week, and he shows.

202
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,681
Guess you know him well.

203
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,265
Take him.

204
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,776
- And meet me back at base.
- Take him?

205
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,736
You make this shit sound easy.

206
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,687
The lady says it's a go.

207
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,126
Mom, it's the door.

208
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:55,064
Put your video game down
and answer it for me.

209
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,533
Do I have to?

210
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,875
Hey, Eddie.
I don't know if you remember me.

211
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,181
You used to live on the Army base
with me and your daddy.

212
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,183
But Mom said he's not coming home.

213
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,344
Well, there's nothing he wanted more
than to be with you.

214
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:19,886
Eddie. Go to your room, honey.

215
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,593
Why are you here, John?

216
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,528
State Department already notified us.

217
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,402
Why him?

218
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:46,916
Why my baby?

219
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,621
It was that coup in Africa, wasn't it?

220
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,081
The one on the news?

221
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,025
He always believed
he could make a difference.

222
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,697
Casualties of war.

223
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,195
You went along because of him, John.

224
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,705
So tell me what I lost him to.

225
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,997
Some stupid cause?

226
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,210
And now they're gonna fly him back...

227
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,678
and leave me with a folded flag
and a bunch of medals.

228
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:16,806
It's not that simple. It was a covert op.

229
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,776
- They're not bringing him back?
- Well, I'm bringing him back.

230
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:24,046
And I'm telling you,
he's gonna get full military honors...

231
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:25,385
and a proper burial.

232
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:32,662
Listen...

233
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,332
What is this?

234
00:25:36,332 --> 00:25:38,233
I'm gonna look after you
and the baby now.

235
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,426
What the hell is taking so long?

236
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:08,364
Don't worry.
He's gotta come out eventually.

237
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,914
Tell me you've got him.

238
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:29,545
Unfortunately I'm alive, and they're dead.

239
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,482
John. John, it's good to hear from you.

240
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:35,720
Look, I'm sorry about Jones.

241
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,854
You know we had to maintain
plausible deniability.

242
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:40,194
You know what? You fucked us,
and I'm not getting over that.

243
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:42,131
But we can talk about that, John.

244
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:44,863
<i>- So why don't you just come back in?
- Oh, I'm coming in.</i>

245
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:47,701
Believe me, I'm coming in.
I'm coming in to get you.

246
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,674
- You wanted a one-on-one.
- John, listen...

247
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,583
Surveillance at the United Nations
in New York...

248
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,516
turned up one of the people
you red-flagged.

249
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:02,076
He had a suitcase filled with money.

250
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:03,511
Thank you, Kelly.

251
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,458
So, you're back in business, Chapel.

252
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,075
Now, there's two ways
we can do this, John.

253
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:34,847
We can all end up
looking like Swiss cheese...

254
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,321
or we can go have a nice cup of coffee.
What's it gonna be?

255
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,052
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

256
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,922
Get this truck out of here.

257
00:27:58,211 --> 00:28:00,736
- Thank you.
- Kelly?

258
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:03,782
Just in from the FBI, sir.
There's been a shootout in Miami.

259
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,148
One of the dead has been identified
as a South African national.

260
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,955
He's a mercenary.
We used him in Galmoral with Seeger.

261
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,245
Great.

262
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:15,283
Also, our two men's taking the Jones'
house, they've been found dead.

263
00:28:15,283 --> 00:28:18,727
Goddamn this. Where is Seeger?

264
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,497
A witness said someone
matching his description...

265
00:28:21,497 --> 00:28:23,626
was taken away at the scene.
Maybe his friends.

266
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:24,829
Seeger doesn't have friends.

267
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,236
Besides, a commando-style
rescue mission in Miami...

268
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:29,536
is gonna cost somebody
a great deal of money to organize.

269
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:34,003
Get the jet ready. We're going to Miami.

270
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:36,907
Dresham here, I need authorization.

271
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:43,586
- Well, here's to you. Cheers.
- Yes.

272
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,592
I heard the French had you.

273
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,167
Like the CIA had you?

274
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,931
I didn't know I was gonna be
twisting in the wind like this.

275
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:03,297
I'd have never let them do that to me
and I'd have never let them do that to us.

276
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,708
The only reason I took this job
was so I could look you in the eye...

277
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,251
and tell you
I've killed for money, I've lied...

278
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,879
but my heart never got sold out
with the contract.

279
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,385
Until now.

280
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,921
He's waiting for you.

281
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,125
You deserve each other.

282
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,998
And I thought ladies liked the bad boys.

283
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39,367
I think she's mad at me.

284
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,880
How are you, John?
I understand your anger.

285
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:46,747
I don't think that anyone really
appreciates all that you do for them...

286
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:48,218
especially your country.

287
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:51,688
Yeah, three people died today.
I was kind of wondering why.

288
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,715
Either for nothing or for something.

289
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:59,196
It's your choice. You make the decision.

290
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,132
<i>This is our assignment
for Mr. Ahmet Dasan...</i>

291
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,427
<i>a billionaire extraordinaire.</i>

292
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,673
Mr. Chapel has arrived, sir.

293
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,139
- Ahmet Dasan.
- Pleasure.

294
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,640
Please, walk with me.

295
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:19,316
- You are aware of my problem?
- Yes, sir, I've looked into your request.

296
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,185
But I must say,
it's beyond my capabilities.

297
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:25,386
Quite simply put, it cannot be done.
I am sorry.

298
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:29,422
In four days from now,
the United States Justice Department...

299
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:31,588
will be transferring my son
from South Africa...

300
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:34,132
to a lockdown facility
in Leavenworth, Kansas.

301
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,225
A lovely facility, I'm told.

302
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:39,237
Guarded by the largest infantry division
of the US Army.

303
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,829
A well-known fact.

304
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,170
But until then...

305
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:48,371
the South Africans are detaining Kamal at
the Randveld Prison outside of Cape Town.

306
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,582
I'm told it's a lovely facility, too.

307
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,578
To snatch your son from Randveld...

308
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,924
the most heavily fortified prison
in the southern hemisphere.

309
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:08,623
- Yet, it is not quite Leavenworth.
- Almost. Trust me, it can't be done.

310
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:12,995
I have controlled the arms pipeline
through the Middle East for 20 years.

311
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,639
Money? I am a billionaire
many times over.

312
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:22,342
And I would spend every bit of it
to free my first-born child.

313
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:27,348
But in order for an operation of this type
to be completely successful...

314
00:31:27,348 --> 00:31:32,220
I should anticipate a certain risk
and a certain expense.

315
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:35,420
That is just your payment, Mr. Chapel.

316
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:39,492
A quarter down, the rest
when my son is standing before me.

317
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:42,567
Now, tell me again
how some things just can't be done?

318
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,703
I do stand corrected, sir.

319
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:50,332
You will find $20 million
in an account in the Cayman Islands.

320
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:54,036
When that amount has been depleted,
it will be automatically refilled.

321
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,572
And how many times may I deplete it, sir?

322
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:01,518
You will know when you've reached
the limits of my indulgence.

323
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:03,713
How?

324
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,084
There will be a bullet
in your head, Mr. Chapel.

325
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:14,958
Everything you need to know
about Randveld is in these files.

326
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,096
You decide.

327
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,061
Here you go.

328
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,341
I'm not interested.

329
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:30,879
My employer's money has no idea
of what that concept means, John.

330
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,521
<i>John, they said they'd kill us
if you didn't help them.</i>

331
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,563
<i>Please, John, don't let them hurt my baby.
We need your help.</i>

332
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:53,901
<i>They say they're going to take us to Africa.</i>

333
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,441
John, I am going to need your help.

334
00:32:58,511 --> 00:32:59,978
You know what?

335
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,980
I'm kind of fascinated that you just
don't have any means of persuasion.

336
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,516
Are you referring to a gun?

337
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,573
Mmm.

338
00:33:06,886 --> 00:33:08,649
I don't touch a gun.

339
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,451
And guns don't touch me.
That's why I'm still alive.

340
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:13,651
I think it'd be good if you let them go.

341
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:18,953
I think it would be nice if you understood
that I'm a pushover, but I am not an idiot.

342
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:23,968
And you promised Radio Jones
that you would take care of little Eddie.

343
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,528
And little Eddie is being taken care of,
as you can see, quite well.

344
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:31,440
You kind of got me over a barrel.
How much time do I have?

345
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,741
You have all the time in the world
as long as you do it within four days.

346
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,848
- Four days is just not enough time.
- But we have money.

347
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:42,743
And money has a way
of making time irrelevant.

348
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:46,517
There might even be
something in it for you, John.

349
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,420
What do you say
we get this show on the road?

350
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,861
Tell the pilot we're ready to go.

351
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,266
Okay, great.

352
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:04,775
Look, I want a search
of all the high-end hotels in Miami.

353
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:07,312
The penthouses.
Chapel's going to be in one of them.

354
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,210
Never mind.

355
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,155
What a pleasant surprise.

356
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,719
Thank you.

357
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,229
Someone's got some explaining to do.

358
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,907
Computer support,
I'm gonna need somebody...

359
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:41,913
who can get a hands-up on that
right away.

360
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,882
- Do you have any word on Samuel?
- Loyalty in a mercenary.

361
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:48,783
John, that's a character flaw.

362
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:51,151
- It is, isn't it?
- Actually, he's on board.

363
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:55,182
Couldn't resist being here
after that disaster in Africa.

364
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:57,627
Excellent. I suppose I'll get
to see him soon.

365
00:34:57,627 --> 00:34:58,788
Samuel?

366
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:08,940
Would you like to inform John
as to why you came so willingly?

367
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:13,541
- I'm here for you, John.
- Fellow mercs reunited.

368
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:17,607
Oh, the hate and mistrust.
Warms my heart.

369
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,880
John, you never asked about Maxine.

370
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:26,983
- I thought you and she were...
- You're right. I didn't ask.

371
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:30,326
Chapel must have deep pockets
if he was able to buy you.

372
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:34,030
I suppose so. Sorry, have we met before?

373
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,760
Oh, we partied on the same island once.

374
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,132
Now, tell me about Chapel
and your boyfriend.

375
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,537
As far as I know, they've already taken off.

376
00:35:42,775 --> 00:35:45,539
- Kelly, get on it.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,409
- You can keep the money.
- Honey...

378
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:50,673
you work for me now.

379
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:56,610
What do you have?

380
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,954
Private jet manifest
shows 15 unidentified passengers.

381
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:02,016
- Going where?
- Flight plan says South Africa...

382
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:03,823
but it could be anywhere
south of the pyramids.

383
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:07,229
- Maxine?
- Chapel has plenty of muscle and money.

384
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:09,699
Where he chooses to flex them
is none of my business.

385
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:13,568
Oh, really? Oh, but
seeing Seeger one last time was, right?

386
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,401
You're really afraid of him, aren't you?
Why? Does he have something on you?

387
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,405
- So John does have a weakness.
- Meaning what?

388
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,473
Meaning he'll come for you.
So, we're going to Africa, huh?

389
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:28,613
How about a safari?

390
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,326
Look, I don't like the way shit went down,
you know that.

391
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,225
And those men you let in?

392
00:36:43,225 --> 00:36:45,202
One thing for sure,
when you're a mercenary...

393
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,897
you're always gonna have casualties.

394
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,411
- Guaranteed?
- Guaranteed.

395
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,658
- Where's the goddamn car, Kelly?
- Over there, sir.

396
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,189
Then what the fuck happened?
Where are they?

397
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:23,894
- They passed through the VIP line, sir.
- How did they do that?

398
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:26,767
- They had diplomatic passports.
- Great. Of course, they did.

399
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,127
This is Kamal Dasan,
son of Ahmet Dasan...

400
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:01,536
Greek billionaire arms dealer.
Our job is to break him out of prison.

401
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:04,003
Our intel says that Dasan, Jr...

402
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:06,772
is being kept at the most secure facility
at Randveld.

403
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:09,837
So, there's guard stations at every point
and marshals backing them up.

404
00:39:09,837 --> 00:39:11,746
But I don't think we'll have
a problem with that.

405
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:13,375
How the fuck you figure that?

406
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,443
At 10:00 there's gonna be a shift change.

407
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:18,979
Because of the large number of guards
that are entering and exiting...

408
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:22,057
they're disabling their alarm system
for about six minutes.

409
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:25,062
That's when we'll make our move.
So, this is what's gonna happen.

410
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,131
The perimeter sensors are still left on.

411
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,168
Samuel's going to disable the system
in the northeast sector...

412
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,601
which is gonna indicate
a break-in in that area.

413
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:35,902
Obviously, when that happens
all the exits will be automatically locked...

414
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:39,307
except for the guard entrances,
for obvious reasons.

415
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:42,176
From this entrance, they're gonna
have direct access to the core...

416
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:43,578
which is where our boy is.

417
00:39:43,578 --> 00:39:45,708
We may have to take
a couple of guards out...

418
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,275
and then we may have to deal
with the marshals with CXL.

419
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,651
What do you think, Kruger?
You think you can handle that?

420
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:53,816
Fuck, yeah, but why don't we use
nerve gas on these pussies?

421
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:55,960
Well, with nerve gas, we're quite afraid...

422
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,326
that we may kill everybody,
especially our boy...

423
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:01,093
similar to the girls
that you are used to killing.

424
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:05,003
You wanna dance, motherfucker?
Get up. Get up!

425
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:09,999
So I think it's much better
if we act like professional soldiers.

426
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:14,839
- Don't you?
- That's not in your job description.

427
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:18,606
- Let's get back to work.
- Yes, sir. That would be nice.

428
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,019
We have a hole for you in Angola...

429
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:29,359
with your name on it, Kruger.

430
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,361
Everybody feeling up for this?

431
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:38,564
All right.

432
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,016
John asked me to give you this.

433
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,305
Mr. Dresham
would like to speak to you.

434
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,177
What did he want?

435
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:33,456
He wants me to gather intelligence for
an operation he's running in Cape Town.

436
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,083
Did he tell you what the target was?

437
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:39,895
Is it the Agency that wants John so badly
or is it just you?

438
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,597
Does it matter?

439
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,896
- Have the Americans arrived yet?
- They're right behind you.

440
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:29,280
Mr. Dresham, Spano Malik,
Chief of Police, Cape Town.

441
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,484
Mr. Malik, we have reason to believe
there's going to be an attempt...

442
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:36,180
to break into the black vault.

443
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:39,215
This is an official request from the CIA.

444
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:41,987
Your Foreign Affairs Division
have asked you to help us on this one.

445
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,490
This is absurd. Totally absurd.

446
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:50,328
- Humor me.
- It's not possible. Can't be done.

447
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:51,664
The bank's security systems...

448
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:54,205
were designed
by Cape Town's top security specialists.

449
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,036
Well, what are we talking about here,
some sort of private army or something?

450
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:03,513
Mr. Malik, you should assume these men
are as well-trained as they are financed.

451
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,414
Considering they've overthrown
the governments...

452
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:09,614
of some of your largest depositors,
maybe you should pay attention.

453
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,479
So, what's the CIA's interest?

454
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,359
There's an American national involved,
but we'll take care of him.

455
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,964
But even if your information is correct,
it's still impossible.

456
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,358
Impossible?

457
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:25,827
Maybe.

458
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:29,530
- Well, let's sign you in.
- Let's.

459
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:35,737
All control points are guarded,
blast doors that seal on the first alarm.

460
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,710
Video surveillance, naturally.

461
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,916
The doors are titanium-vanadium alloy...

462
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:44,114
with six different blast buffers.

463
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:48,452
Yeah, you could blow them in, but with
the amount of explosives you'd need...

464
00:43:48,452 --> 00:43:50,654
you'd probably bring
the whole building down on top of you.

465
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:54,955
This is the storage database
for the 12 largest banks in southern Africa.

466
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:58,427
You see, Mr. Dresham,
money is no longer a dollar bill.

467
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,063
It's a string of computer numbers
with a name attached...

468
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:05,075
and our many depositors from all over
the world require three things of us...

469
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,907
safety, security and anonymity.

470
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:10,076
Well, of course they do.

471
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:14,944
There are no hard copies
to these blueprints.

472
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,281
- Absolutely no one has access.
- Good.

473
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:23,991
The software is all hardwired
so they come up only on this unit.

474
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:27,395
Try to copy, delete, print,
or transfer any of them...

475
00:44:27,395 --> 00:44:30,594
they auto encrypt on a 256-bit key.

476
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,967
The vault itself is opened...

477
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:42,104
only with two magnetic strip keys...

478
00:44:42,104 --> 00:44:45,479
and a corresponding
offsite security code...

479
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:48,383
- which changes every six minutes.
- Impressive.

480
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,219
Clearly, your client's money is
in very, very good hands, Mr. Malik.

481
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,922
Indeed. I mean, these guys would be crazy
to even try...

482
00:44:55,922 --> 00:44:58,121
They won't. They don't have a chance.

483
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:01,563
We intend to put a stop to this little party
long before it gets that far.

484
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,193
Good.

485
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:07,304
Well, our department expects
to be kept fully informed. Understood?

486
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:11,468
Well, actually, I don't even do that
for my own government...

487
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,770
but I'm here for you.

488
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,640
Mr. Malik.

489
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,343
Shall we?

490
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:33,488
Seeger's gotta be crazy
to try and break into that place.

491
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:34,687
Why?

492
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:37,530
You heard the man,
nobody has access to those files.

493
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,933
I want you to find out where Seeger
and Chapel are operating from.

494
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,166
- I don't think he trusts me that much.
- Really?

495
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:51,280
Well, you don't get paid to think, Maxine,
so fuck him and find out.

496
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:54,741
Pimp.

497
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:07,826
Can anyone tell me why we've put
the control station so far from the prison?

498
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:10,399
Because they invented
wireless transmission.

499
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:13,564
I mean, you did buy us that cellular
relay tower on the mountain, right?

500
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,234
Indeed.

501
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:20,378
So, we control half the cellular phone
transmission in the city, why?

502
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,843
Because when the prison goes down...

503
00:46:22,843 --> 00:46:25,747
the locals might triangulate
our communication traffic.

504
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,682
- Now, where would that lead them?
- Hello, old boy.

505
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:33,348
I understand that you want
to use Maxine as a distraction.

506
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,893
She's been in bed with Dresham all along.
Oh, wrong choice of words.

507
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:42,195
But we do need to do something
about her.

508
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:43,856
Who's going to do it?

509
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:46,161
- I'll do it.
- Well done.

510
00:46:52,444 --> 00:46:55,971
- Seeger, you don't have to do this.
- Well, this time it's different.

511
00:46:56,348 --> 00:46:58,873
His name is Eddie,
and I made him a promise.

512
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:06,082
- That was a wonderful night, honey.
- It really was, thank you so much.

513
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:08,691
Where the hell is he?

514
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:11,661
He said to meet him here
and wear my best.

515
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:16,500
Remember, use the beacon
if I lose you in traffic. We want Seeger.

516
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:24,741
I get it. You don't talk because, like,
maybe if you had to kill somebody...

517
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,743
afterwards it would be hard.

518
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:31,674
You know, you got that statuesque
kind of, you know, stoic look on your face.

519
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,377
See, with me, it's never hard.

520
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:56,634
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

521
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,680
Why did you have me dress up like this?

522
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,415
Well, I promised you
after this last fiasco was over...

523
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:09,010
I'd take you out, do something nice,
so here we are.

524
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,183
- Are we being followed?
- No.

525
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:17,560
Bulldog, take that side road.

526
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,157
Side road?

527
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:25,526
Strange road, two men like you.

528
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:29,196
That could mean one of two things, right?

529
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:34,237
Either this will end up being really bad
or really good.

530
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:38,312
Max, how well do you know me?

531
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,919
- Really good.
- There you go.

532
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,864
Right this way, sir.

533
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:10,876
Lobster's good here.
I'm gonna order you some.

534
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:20,054
Thank you, sir.

535
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,887
Chapel here.

536
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:55,482
<i>Listen, Chapel, my friend.</i>

537
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:59,094
We played your game long enough.
Now we're gonna do things my way.

538
00:49:59,094 --> 00:50:02,600
And what made you think
that you have any leverage, old chum?

539
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:05,736
One call and there's a bullet
in the boy's brain.

540
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,601
<i>A terrible thing to waste,
wouldn't you say?</i>

541
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:09,899
I'm talking about the bullet.

542
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:13,038
Periodically I'm gonna call you
and ask for proof of life.

543
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:15,303
You're gonna give it to me right away...

544
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,138
and if you don't, the game's over,
you hear me? Now, put the boy on.

545
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:21,914
All right.

546
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:23,978
Very well.

547
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,319
The little boy packed
his school bag and got ready for school.

548
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,396
<i>Chapel here. Put the boy on.</i>

549
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:37,958
Are you there, John? Listen.

550
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:42,734
Eddie?

551
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:46,065
<i>Eddie?</i>

552
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:47,168
Yeah.

553
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:50,640
- Is that you, son?
- Yes.

554
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:53,545
Listen. How're you doing?

555
00:50:53,545 --> 00:50:55,984
<i>- You and your mom all right?
- Yeah.</i>

556
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:01,982
- All right. You hang in there, you hear me?
- That's quite enough.

557
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:09,624
John, you've had your proof.
Now get back to work.

558
00:51:09,868 --> 00:51:13,031
<i>I'll play you something sexy
to put you in the mood...</i>

559
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:14,969
<i>for you and the lady of your choice.</i>

560
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:21,345
It's a dangerous game
you're playing, John.

561
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:26,840
Yeah, it is. One second.

562
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:24,165
<i>- You looking for me?
- Yeah. That's it for you, poepol.</i>

563
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,719
Damn, that's a lot of work.

564
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,055
You know, Bulldog,
you never did say where you're from.

565
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:48,854
But let me guess, don't tell me. Detroit.

566
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:52,227
Detroit, Michigan. How'd you guess?

567
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:55,257
You know what? I'm from Detroit.
Highland Park.

568
00:53:56,134 --> 00:53:58,159
Two Motor City boys, just like that.

569
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,670
Let's get out of here and go have a drink,
what do you say?

570
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,673
- You buying?
- All right.

571
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,709
We're gonna have to leave a big tip.

572
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:18,912
What happened in there?

573
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,456
Care to dance?

574
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,986
We located them
on a satellite track this morning.

575
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,488
- Where are they?
- At a deserted church in Woodstock.

576
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,525
They were using it as a staging area.

577
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:56,651
- Good. So you got them, right?
- No.

578
00:54:56,651 --> 00:54:59,890
When we got there, they must've just left.
The place was deserted.

579
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:04,532
- Motherfucker's hitting the bank.
- The bank?

580
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:09,663
Seeger, he's hitting the bank right now.

581
00:55:09,663 --> 00:55:13,005
Listen, I want every cop in this
godforsaken place at that bank right now!

582
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:15,671
- You understand me?
- Right, right.

583
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,741
I want all cars down to
the Credit Natal immediately. Right now!

584
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,135
It's a go to you, John.

585
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:45,866
Well, well, well.

586
00:55:45,866 --> 00:55:48,878
You've made it abundantly apparent
that I don't work for you anymore.

587
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,038
But I'm just curious.

588
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:53,208
Why do you keep sending your boys
to mess up my dinner dates?

589
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,410
John?

590
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,781
You know, I can make
all the bad things go away.

591
00:55:58,089 --> 00:55:59,716
Everything but this.

592
00:55:59,991 --> 00:56:01,925
Tiger, this is Mouse,
what's happening at the Beehive?

593
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:09,665
All set to go.

594
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:12,026
You got any activities at target?

595
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:54,844
Change of the guard coming up
in three, two, one.

596
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:58,174
Alarms are down.

597
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:00,676
Go ahead and move in.

598
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:06,148
- Copy that, alarms are down. Go in now.
- Right, we're going in.

599
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:25,524
Get me out of here, man!

600
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:57,433
We're almost there.
Is our support in position?

601
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:00,370
Hey, you copy?

602
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:02,138
What the fuck, are you asleep?

603
00:59:06,077 --> 00:59:07,738
Okay, we're running out of time.
Let's move!

604
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:27,958
Back off!

605
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,735
Get the fuck out of my way!

606
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,369
What the fuck?

607
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,338
<i>Yo, Kruger.</i>

608
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:42,777
<i>Remember you said you'd rather die
than integrate?</i>

609
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:45,081
Yeah, well, now's your chance.

610
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,572
Fuck!

611
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,645
It's a setup. Let's get the fuck out of here!

612
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,542
Keep your eyes open.

613
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,239
What the fuck?

614
01:00:57,288 --> 01:01:01,520
Damn! TV in this country is quite violent.

615
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:15,471
You got an open vehicle on your left.

616
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,794
Let's go, go, go, go! Get us out of here!

617
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:02,247
Hold fast.

618
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:10,019
Come on, you wanna play chicken,
motherfucker?

619
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,389
Go!

620
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,813
Take the wheel!

621
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:48,156
We are home and dry, my brother!

622
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:51,629
Come on! Let's go!

623
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:04,578
You son of a bitch, John.

624
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:09,247
Oh, that's not nice. Come on, now.

625
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:12,445
- Is this your first time in the field?
- Fuck you.

626
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:14,518
You got any last words?

627
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,487
You're a patriot, John.

628
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:21,592
I mean, we both know
that's what you are, right?

629
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:26,534
I mean, those hostages,
I think about them everyday, you know.

630
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:29,539
Somehow I just kind of feel
like that's not quite the truth.

631
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:33,236
Oh, looky here. It must be your lucky day.

632
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,878
Po-po's just came up in here.

633
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:40,540
What are you waiting for?
Back door!

634
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,017
It's empty.

635
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,890
The man's a fucking ghost.

636
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:52,487
Fuck this.

637
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,300
It's unbelievable.

638
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,135
All right, be at target in four minutes.

639
01:04:04,901 --> 01:04:05,964
Dresham.

640
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:09,342
We gotta talk fast.

641
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:12,109
This better be worth real money
because after this, I'm done.

642
01:04:12,109 --> 01:04:13,740
You said you had to talk fast.

643
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,445
I got John to loosen up
a little bit last night.

644
01:04:16,445 --> 01:04:20,650
He told me that Credit Natal
is just a diversion for the real target.

645
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:23,682
Randveld.

646
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:27,722
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

647
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,325
It's a diversion.
They're hitting Randveld Prison.

648
01:04:32,325 --> 01:04:33,665
Clean this fucking mess up.

649
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,702
We got a 409 in progress
at Randveld Prison.

650
01:04:37,702 --> 01:04:39,970
I want all units
to Randveld Prison immediately.

651
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,238
Yeah, go!

652
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,729
<i>- Samuel.
- All clear.</i>

653
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:24,476
- May I help you?
- Detective Eric Morris, Cape Town Police.

654
01:05:24,476 --> 01:05:27,422
We have a situation we'd like to discuss
with your security.

655
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:28,983
Sure.

656
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:32,419
Yeah?

657
01:05:32,419 --> 01:05:36,057
Sir, we have a Lieutenant Eric Morris from
Cape Town Police Department to see you.

658
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,327
Okay, escort him down.

659
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:43,003
So, what's this about, Lieutenant?

660
01:05:43,003 --> 01:05:46,304
As you know we've received
some credible intel that there's...

661
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:48,469
a bomb threat here,
particularly in the black vault.

662
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:49,534
I haven't heard a thing.

663
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:52,272
Well, check with your supervisor.
I'm sure you will.

664
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,580
Reach out and rob someone.

665
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:13,166
We're having a communications problem.

666
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,035
I can't confirm what you're saying.

667
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:17,234
All right. Listen, son, what's your name?

668
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:20,771
- Stanley Morgan.
- Okay, Stanley.

669
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:22,869
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

670
01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:25,744
Easy way is you're gonna tell me
what I need to know and I'll be out.

671
01:06:25,744 --> 01:06:28,785
Hard way is I'm gonna be scraping you
off the ground from outside.

672
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:31,412
This is a time-critical situation.

673
01:06:31,412 --> 01:06:33,888
Look, even if I wanted to
I couldn't help you.

674
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:36,517
All right.
You do have the magnetic keys, don't you?

675
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:39,357
Yeah, but we don't have
the security access codes.

676
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:42,125
You know what?
That's where this will come in.

677
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,326
No problem.

678
01:06:45,636 --> 01:06:47,831
We got about six minutes,
and the clock is ticking.

679
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:49,873
But I really should contact someone.

680
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,365
Let's pull a code from cyberspace.

681
01:06:56,146 --> 01:06:59,047
You guys better step back,
'cause it could get a little exciting in here.

682
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,205
This is gonna be fun.

683
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,570
Showtime.

684
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:19,918
Okay...

685
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:22,056
<i>Samuel. You're on.</i>

686
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:25,691
Oh, I'm always on, baby.

687
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:29,338
Damn, I'm good.

688
01:08:36,013 --> 01:08:37,378
Nice work, Samuel.

689
01:08:37,378 --> 01:08:40,015
Okay, access the account firm
in Greece.

690
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,950
We're looking for big depositors,
preferably high up in the government.

691
01:08:44,087 --> 01:08:47,113
- Will the Army Chief of Staff do?
- Yes, ma'am.

692
01:08:57,034 --> 01:08:58,501
- General.
- Yes?

693
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,662
A call from South Africa,
they say it's of a personal nature.

694
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,206
Yes? Who is this?

695
01:09:06,206 --> 01:09:08,844
The secret number to the account
with my hand on the plug.

696
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:11,676
At least you'll have known
that at one point, you were very wealthy.

697
01:09:11,676 --> 01:09:14,478
- If not a little corrupt.
- My deposit safe?

698
01:09:14,478 --> 01:09:17,679
- Or should I just let the world know now?
- What do you want of me?

699
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,018
Listen carefully. Act quickly.

700
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:25,361
<i>Today's extradition of Kamal Dasan...</i>

701
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,296
<i>son of Greek billionaire arms dealer,
Ahmet Dasan...</i>

702
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:30,697
<i>from Randveld Prison
to Leavenworth, Kansas...</i>

703
01:09:30,697 --> 01:09:34,396
<i>has been complicated by an invasion
of the high-security facility...</i>

704
01:09:34,396 --> 01:09:36,905
<i>by a group
officials are labeling mercenaries.</i>

705
01:09:36,905 --> 01:09:38,373
<i>No word as to whether Dasan...</i>

706
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,603
So, where the fuck is my son?

707
01:09:40,603 --> 01:09:44,113
My guess is, boarding a heavily guarded
military flight...

708
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:46,115
to Kansas and questioning your love.

709
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:50,244
- Are you saying your man betrayed us?
- Yes, it does seem that way.

710
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:54,652
I'll tell you what, I'll just keep what's left
of my advance and call it even.

711
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:55,947
Cheers.

712
01:09:55,947 --> 01:09:58,287
<i>If convicted,
Dasan faced life without parole...</i>

713
01:09:58,287 --> 01:09:59,727
<i>for allegedly assisting his father...</i>

714
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:02,264
<i>- Son of a bitch.
...in the transfer of bombs to Al-Qaeda.</i>

715
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:04,892
<i>An unspecified number of inmates
have been killed.</i>

716
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:16,307
Yes, we shall see
if they have outlived their usefulness.

717
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,781
- Yeah.
- Hello, John.

718
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:21,818
<i>You've truly fucked me on this one,
haven't you?</i>

719
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:25,844
You've gone straight to the bank.
You've cost me a lot of money on this one.

720
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:28,015
Yeah, well, you win some
and you lose some, Chapel.

721
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,682
Yes, I know that.

722
01:10:29,682 --> 01:10:32,957
But you may have offed little Eddie
in the process.

723
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,998
<i>I'm looking at him right now.</i>

724
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,200
Oh, he's terrified.

725
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:42,164
You know I can find you wherever you are.
Go for it.

726
01:10:42,164 --> 01:10:44,104
I know that, old boy,
which is precisely why...

727
01:10:44,104 --> 01:10:46,972
I have a proposition
that will cost you nothing...

728
01:10:46,972 --> 01:10:48,773
and save little Eddie in the process.

729
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:52,213
While you are in the black vault
playing with other people's money...

730
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:55,581
do you think that you could find it
in your heart to wire me some?

731
01:10:55,581 --> 01:10:57,711
In exchange for those two, of course.

732
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,655
- How do I know you won't kill them?
- Oh, you don't.

733
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:03,849
But as you said,
you can find me anywhere.

734
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:06,896
- All right, first, proof of life.
- Yes, of course.

735
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:11,795
Master Eddie,
say hello to your Uncle John.

736
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,270
- Hello.
- All right, Eddie. I'll be there.

737
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,703
Don't you worry, son.

738
01:11:16,703 --> 01:11:17,831
<i>I will.</i>

739
01:11:17,831 --> 01:11:19,899
Now, John, I'm not a greedy man.

740
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:24,909
But I should think that $100 million
U.S. Dollars would be an appropriate sum.

741
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:26,414
I'll get it done.

742
01:11:26,414 --> 01:11:28,849
Good. Then I should expect it
within the hour.

743
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:33,950
And now...

744
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:38,788
it is time to say your final goodbyes.

745
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:40,222
You lied.

746
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:43,257
It's a fib, really. Right, Eddie?

747
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:49,667
I prefer apples.

748
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,339
Mommy?

749
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:58,542
- Are we gonna be all right?
- Yes, we are.

750
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:04,610
I want a contract out on Chapel so rich...

751
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,486
even the FBI
will try to collect on it.

752
01:12:07,858 --> 01:12:10,452
$500 million. Dead.

753
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,162
Sir, these men are here.

754
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:16,698
What? Didn't your checks clear?

755
01:12:17,234 --> 01:12:18,861
Come with me, you are under arrest.

756
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:20,994
What is this about?
Get me the Army Chief of Staff.

757
01:12:20,994 --> 01:12:22,732
- Yes, sir.
- Bullshit!

758
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,601
Samuel. We don't have much time.

759
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:33,175
We've got company coming in.
You're gonna have to hurry up.

760
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,877
Okay, shutting down.

761
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:38,053
All right, John, the rest is up to you.

762
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:46,760
- Are you done?
- Almost.

763
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,264
There's just one last person
that deserves to be rich.

764
01:12:52,169 --> 01:12:53,466
You're kidding me.

765
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:58,968
John.

766
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:04,977
John, John. We got company coming in.

767
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:22,021
There was a compromised access code.
I'm not sure, it could be terrorists.

768
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,465
I received a page
that an access code was issued.

769
01:13:25,465 --> 01:13:27,093
- What's going on?
- That's the Americans, sir.

770
01:13:27,093 --> 01:13:29,900
- They're checking the vault for a bomb.
- A bomb? What are you talking about?

771
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:33,808
Asshole alert.

772
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,413
You opened the vault?

773
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:43,282
You fucking idiot.

774
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:46,679
Arrest them now. Go!

775
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,492
You're kidding me.

776
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:56,424
You're not.

777
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:02,229
Wait here.

778
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,302
- Come with me, sir.
- Yeah.

779
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:29,925
Don't shoot!

780
01:14:39,342 --> 01:14:41,003
Move! Move! Move!

781
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,278
- The vault below.
- Right! Got it.

782
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,860
Stop them! Stop them!

783
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:10,965
Take them out now!

784
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,647
Now, you wanted a one-on-one?

785
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:04,017
Now, in prison...

786
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:08,820
even if you got a lot of money,
you can't spend it.

787
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:11,133
Somebody's got some explaining to do.

788
01:16:11,835 --> 01:16:14,668
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to come with me, sir.

789
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,373
Ladies first.

790
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:24,604
<i>Victim at 329.</i>

791
01:16:24,604 --> 01:16:25,739
What are they doing?

792
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:27,806
<i>Transport by private ambulance.</i>

793
01:16:30,887 --> 01:16:32,752
- They need you inside.
- All right, sir.

794
01:16:45,527 --> 01:16:46,830
There you go.

795
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:49,932
All right, you know what?
Don't un-cuff her.

796
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:51,132
You sure?

797
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,102
You guys.

798
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,310
Us guys, we're bad.

799
01:17:08,425 --> 01:17:10,017
What took you so long?

800
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,247
Oh, Jesus.

801
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:45,683
That's on me.

802
01:17:48,465 --> 01:17:51,093
$52 million
deposited into your account.

803
01:17:51,093 --> 01:17:52,996
Now I see why you wanted him so badly.

804
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:58,439
You, Mr. Dresham, are under arrest.

805
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:04,440
Shall we?

806
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:17,990
You hear that shit, man?

807
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,289
This route will take us directly
to the Botswana border.

808
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:23,264
Wait a minute, now,
we got unfinished business.

809
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:25,525
They're at the safe house.

810
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:35,907
There should be absolutely no mercy.
I want Seeger and all of them dead.

811
01:18:35,907 --> 01:18:39,346
Now, you're to fetch young Eddie
and Mummy.

812
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:43,877
- I never touch a gun.
- Sorry.

813
01:18:43,877 --> 01:18:44,942
That's your job.

814
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:48,412
Idiot.

815
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:50,656
Come! Let's go!

816
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:01,232
Come on. Get in the car.

817
01:19:09,546 --> 01:19:11,673
- Stay ready.
- Yes, sir.

818
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:52,853
Secure the perimeter.
I don't want anything coming through.

819
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,282
Keep your hands off my son!

820
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,209
Straight ahead. Got it?

821
01:20:16,546 --> 01:20:19,014
Come on, come on, kid.
Stop looking around.

822
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:33,651
Stay.

823
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:45,631
Keep an eye out.

824
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:33,216
I'm going inside the house.

825
01:21:33,216 --> 01:21:35,052
Take the wheel.
I'll meet you on the other side.

826
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,944
We've got company.

827
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,517
Kill them all!

828
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:33,943
Bulldog!

829
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:58,296
- Where's the boy?
- In the safe house. Southaven.

830
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:08,975
Gun!

831
01:23:23,966 --> 01:23:26,594
- Bummer. Damn.
- Bad parking.

832
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,204
Sam, you go in around the back.

833
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:05,100
Bulldog, you stay here.

834
01:24:05,775 --> 01:24:06,764
Come with me.

835
01:24:39,008 --> 01:24:40,703
East perimeter, all clear.

836
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:18,574
- Did you hear something?
- I'm not sure. Check it out.

837
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:58,342
Hello!

838
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:15,561
Get back!

839
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:17,629
Leave him alone, he's just a little boy!
He's scared!

840
01:26:17,629 --> 01:26:20,972
Let him go,
or I'll kill him right here, right now.

841
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:24,401
Stay.

842
01:27:06,155 --> 01:27:09,454
- I really need the bathroom.
- No, you don't.

843
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:12,190
You need to stay down there.

844
01:27:32,815 --> 01:27:35,215
- Are you guys okay?
- Thank God you're here.

845
01:27:35,215 --> 01:27:36,546
You all right?

846
01:27:44,226 --> 01:27:46,387
- Watch them for me, will you?
- Okay.

847
01:27:46,962 --> 01:27:49,055
All right, just hold on a second.

848
01:27:53,903 --> 01:27:56,201
All right, we'll get you out of here.
Are you okay?

849
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:58,206
Yeah. Thanks.

850
01:28:01,077 --> 01:28:03,568
Hello. Is anyone out there, please?

851
01:28:07,383 --> 01:28:08,372
Come on.

852
01:28:09,552 --> 01:28:10,541
Maxine.

853
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:15,219
- Bulldog. Take care of Eddie and Shondra.
- This way.

854
01:28:15,658 --> 01:28:18,855
This is Merc 9. I've got a read on Seeger
in the west garden.

855
01:28:43,786 --> 01:28:46,152
This just ain't your motherfucking day.

856
01:28:56,232 --> 01:28:58,393
Chapel here. Do you have a read
on Seeger?

857
01:28:58,393 --> 01:29:00,594
<i>Hello, is anyone out there, please?</i>

858
01:29:00,594 --> 01:29:02,136
<i>Hello. Anyone, please.</i>

859
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:09,273
Where are the hostages?
A read on Seeger, please.

860
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:12,036
<i>Read, please. Anyone there?</i>

861
01:29:12,882 --> 01:29:13,871
Damn it!

862
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:41,701
You have a gun.
You gotta break your own rules, I guess.

863
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:45,442
Go ahead. Come on, shoot me down.

864
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:49,713
I didn't think so. You know why?

865
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:53,487
Yeah, because I'm the only son of a bitch...

866
01:29:53,487 --> 01:29:56,024
who could do the things
that you always want getting done.

867
01:29:56,492 --> 01:29:57,982
And quite right you are, sir.

868
01:30:00,462 --> 01:30:01,793
I'll see you on the next gig.

869
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:36,157
Have you seen Chapel?

870
01:30:40,402 --> 01:30:42,734
You mean to tell me
you let that milquetoast pussy get away?

871
01:30:43,572 --> 01:30:44,732
Milquetoast?

872
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:48,472
Man, I always thought he had
an explosive personality.

873
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,208
Oh!

874
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:03,449
Isn't that terrible?

875
01:31:06,395 --> 01:31:09,728
Notice I said "had"
an explosive personality.

876
01:31:12,268 --> 01:31:13,257
Let's go.

877
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,498
<i>I promised
I would bring him back...</i>

878
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:49,799
<i>with full military honors.</i>
