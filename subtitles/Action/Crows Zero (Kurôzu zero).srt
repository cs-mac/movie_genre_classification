1
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,675
Don't take it personally.

2
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,806
Just setting an example.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,482
Ken...

4
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,416
make your peace.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,692
Genji! Fly!

6
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,104
Genji!

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,308
Genji...

8
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,713
Genji...

9
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,315
Damn it!

10
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,521
If I hadn't met you,

11
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,991
my life would have been...

12
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,168
"Suzuran Boys' High School"

13
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:05,735
"The King of Suzuran"
"Tamao Serizawa"

14
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,549
"The King of Suzuran"
"Genji Takiya"

15
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,738
Youth is a once in a lifetime gift.

16
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,927
Make it memorable... and meaningful.

17
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,270
Next, a few words from our
freshman class representative.

18
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,281
We look to Suzuran to give us
the knowledge and purity of mind...

19
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:00,163
to shape us into responsible
members of society.

20
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,621
Yo, listen up!

21
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,599
Here at Suzuran...

22
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,077
a man's worth is proven

23
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,104
by his fists.

24
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,272
But in all it's history,

25
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,907
nobody has ever conquered it.

26
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,445
Who's going to change that?

27
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,949
Me, that's who!

28
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,762
End of speech!

29
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,640
You're full of it, Squid Head!

30
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,269
Who's a "Squid Head"?!

31
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,278
You are.

32
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,654
No fighting, boys.

33
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,956
Please, no fighting.

34
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,258
This is supposed to be
a day of celebration.

35
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,443
Don't spoil your enrollment ceremony.

36
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:09,523
And disappoint your parents.

37
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,579
This year's freshman class
has some spirit.

38
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,388
Big trouble outside!
Yakuza on campus!

39
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,399
Someone call the cops! Quickly!

40
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,269
Hey, everybody chill out!

41
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,004
Knock it off!

42
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,406
There's something going down outside!

43
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,433
Let's check it out!

44
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,159
I'm looking for a punk
named Tamao Serizawa.

45
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,949
He sent one of our boys into hospital.

46
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,487
Show yourself!

47
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:23,973
Yo, Big Bro.

48
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,033
What?

49
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,511
Go buy me a soda.

50
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,679
I'll take canned coffee.

51
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,680
Hot chocolate.

52
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,581
And you?

53
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,982
Ice cream for me.

54
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,150
Ice cream.

55
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,219
Are you kidding me?

56
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,189
Please.
Let us handle this for you.

57
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,624
You just relax.

58
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,526
We'll settle this quickly...

59
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,161
by the time you return.

60
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,329
Go ahead.

61
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,463
You sure?

62
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,557
Yeah.

63
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,700
Then here, take this.

64
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,954
You too.

65
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,389
Okay.

66
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,938
It's in your hands.

67
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,931
Of course.

68
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,840
See ya.

69
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,765
Take your time.

70
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,300
Who's Serizawa?

71
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:08,237
You don't know?
Our own third year monster.

72
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,976
Alright, Serizawa! Get out here!

73
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,019
Make it snappy, punk!

74
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,408
Tamao!

75
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,181
I'm healthy, man!

76
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,582
That's good.

77
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,663
What?

78
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,158
Hurry and get on.

79
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,812
You're walking.

80
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,182
But you can't ride a bike.

81
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,005
Hey, Tamao!

82
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,201
Why are you lying to me?

83
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,352
Watch it, jerk!

84
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:12,026
Serizawa...
you got a license to drive that thing?

85
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,063
You Tamao Serizawa?

86
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,832
Hey... Hey!

87
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,586
Hey! Hold it!

88
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,435
Don't diss a public servant.

89
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,135
Get a life, Gramps!

90
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,740
Stop tailgating me, fuzz ball!

91
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,717
Move it!

92
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,371
Hey, watch it!

93
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,397
Move!

94
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,374
Serizawa! Let's play chicken!

95
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,255
Serizawa! Chicken!

96
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,619
Don't diss the poor!

97
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,246
Out of the way!

98
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,949
Aren't they my guests?

99
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,449
How should I know?

100
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,984
I haven't seen you before.

101
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,696
I'm new here.

102
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,181
Serizawa!

103
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,840
You're Tamao Serizawa?

104
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,094
Yep.

105
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,915
Looks like we've come to

106
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,102
one crazy school.

107
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:16,886
What was that

108
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,414
about conquering it, Squid Head?

109
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:27,687
"A word to my friends"

110
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:35,058
"Living on the wild side"

111
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:43,498
"That light which flickers
far off in the distance"

112
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:51,039
"It just might lead you
out of here someday"

113
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:20,856
CROWS - Episode 0

114
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,473
"A crumbling afternoon intersection"

115
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:34,652
"I see a flock of birds without wings"

116
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:42,730
"Striving to survive,
Still unaware of what they are"

117
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,474
"Wings burned by the sun"

118
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,181
"They can't even fly but..."

119
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,083
"They all have one ambition"

120
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,980
"I wanna fly and keep flying"

121
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,620
"I wanna fly and keep flying"

122
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,435
"A word to my friends"

123
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:37,148
"Living on the wild side"

124
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:45,054
"What does it mean to live as yourself?"

125
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,562
"Breaking free from
the shell that holds you"

126
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:03,213
"With every season
comes a new self-discovery"

127
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:08,076
"I wanna change and keep changing"

128
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:16,991
"I wanna change, I wanna change, change"

129
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,352
THE STREET BEATS in the house!

130
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,764
BEATS in the house!

131
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,367
Feel the buzz, yet?

132
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,827
Rock intoxication!

133
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,844
Must be lonely switching schools...

134
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,806
in your last year.
Right, Takuya?

135
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,282
Ushiyama...

136
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,614
you've got a big mouth.

137
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,548
Don't get mad.

138
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,559
Meet Ruka Aizawa.

139
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,656
So tell me...

140
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,358
Why did you transfer to Suzuran?

141
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,669
The "School of Crows" is considered
the roughest in the nation.

142
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,407
To be king of the hill? Why else?

143
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,804
Sounds like a yakuza.

144
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,477
You should quit.

145
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,762
Let's follow that
hard shot of rock

146
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,621
with a silky smooth chaser.
Our own Goddess of R&B.

147
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,723
OK, here we go!

148
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,471
Am I being a pest?

149
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,871
Yes.

150
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,546
Let's keep on rockin' till the mornin'!

151
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,875
It's getting hot in here!

152
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,982
Keep it hot!

153
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,028
What do you think?

154
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,064
What do you think?

155
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,200
What do you think?!

156
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,545
You're fine the way you are.

157
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,646
I was expecting you the way you are.

158
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,821
Right, Reiko?

159
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,729
Seiko.

160
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,119
Seiko.

161
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,519
Boss...

162
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,326
your son's home.

163
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,906
Excuse us, Reiko.

164
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,296
Excuse us.

165
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,546
This way.

166
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,334
How's Suzuran?

167
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,603
How the hell should I know?

168
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,945
I just started.

169
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,480
That tough guy act won't
fly there, you know.

170
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,848
Advice from a guy who couldn't conquer it.

171
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,050
Young sir...

172
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,291
please watch your tongue.

173
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,901
I'm not you.

174
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,371
I'm going to succeed.

175
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,939
Exactly what a father hopes for his son.

176
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,871
Then I'll take over the business,
like you promised.

177
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,980
That would be something.

178
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:17,991
First winning Suzuran,
then succeeding me in the organization?

179
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,101
Don't forget those words.

180
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,364
I'm going to do better than you.

181
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,918
Who did that?

182
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,256
Beats me.

183
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,535
Probably one of our fresh-faced
first year students.

184
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,666
Save them for later.
Concentrate on the third years.

185
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,941
Let's crush...

186
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,298
classes B, C, D and E in order.

187
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,765
The Mikami Brothers are in B.

188
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,707
Wow! Hey!

189
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:10,812
Thirteen Orphans!

190
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,321
In your dreams!

191
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,622
You're cheating again, right?

192
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,412
No, I mean it! Ready!

193
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,514
Genji?

194
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,687
Tokaji!

195
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,536
Chill out, ok?

196
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,904
Who's this jerk?

197
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,007
An old friend from junior high.

198
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:32,875
So what?

199
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,868
I said, chill!

200
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,505
All right?

201
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,274
How've you been, Tokio?

202
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,571
Okay.

203
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,118
Did you erase that?

204
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,046
Um... well...

205
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,290
Tamao Serizawa...

206
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,831
I hear you're top man around here.

207
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,361
Show me.

208
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,708
Hold it, Genji.

209
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,361
Why do you want to fight Tamao?

210
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,438
Hey!

211
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,780
Tamao, don't!

212
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,819
I had Thirteen Orphans, man!

213
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,729
It was cash in the pocket!

214
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,697
Serizawa!

215
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,655
What?!

216
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,467
The Mikami Brothers.

217
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,255
How convenient.

218
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,791
Sorry, Genji.

219
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,168
We've got no time for you right now.

220
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,173
If you really want a crack at Tamao...

221
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,917
go take down the second year,

222
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,138
Rinda-man, first.

223
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,255
- Rinda-man?
- What are you...

224
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,282
If you beat him, come on back.

225
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,293
Hey, Serizawa!

226
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,095
Let's get this over with!

227
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,225
We're busy men.

228
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,729
Just this once.

229
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,043
Hey, jailbird!

230
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,799
Let's see who rules the roost.

231
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,705
Since when is Rinda-man
one of yours, eh?

232
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,611
You were too chicken to fight him.

233
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,185
Rinda-man... in second year?

234
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,488
Yeah. Is he tough?

235
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,556
Hell, yeah.

236
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,825
Heard he beat the crap out of...

237
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,896
ten guys at once... as a freshman.

238
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,698
I heard it was fifty.

239
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,633
Bull. I heard a hundred.

240
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,135
That's stretching it.

241
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,836
And all hospitalized, too.

242
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,124
Where?

243
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,240
That's not the point.

244
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,634
The main point is that some of
those guys never made it back.

245
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,254
You Rinda-man?

246
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,606
At last I've found you,
you worthless scum.

247
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,913
Let me show you what happens...

248
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:09,044
when you mess with yakuza.

249
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,485
You're dead, Serizawa.

250
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,523
Me? I'm not.

251
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,927
Don't give me that!

252
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,473
Hey, you all right?

253
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:35,201
Truth is, I'm a Suzuran grad.

254
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,919
They called me Jarhead Ken.

255
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,347
Came close to ruling it, too.

256
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,659
Ruling Suzuran?

257
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,844
Yeah.

258
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,821
Don't you believe me, huh?

259
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,169
You don't get it, do you?

260
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,438
It takes more than a good punch...

261
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,541
to consolidate a place like Suzuran.

262
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,545
For example, it takes leadership...

263
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,471
and heroic virtues.

264
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:11,386
Let's see, what else?
Diplomacy... and keen perception.

265
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,608
It takes a bunch of things.

266
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,282
You have all that?

267
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,450
Can't you stop being so disrespectful?

268
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,929
Can't.

269
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,407
I'm new at Suzuran.

270
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,299
I don't know right from left.

271
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,934
So...

272
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,171
What?

273
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,413
Can you help me?

274
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:57,051
I'm not good with people.

275
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,023
Look...

276
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,967
I'm begging you, Ken.

277
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,712
All right, all right, fine.

278
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,148
Stop that.

279
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,575
You've come to the right man.

280
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:17,686
Really?

281
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,555
You needn't ask twice.

282
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,810
I can tell you right now

283
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,714
how to win control of your class.

284
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:32,660
It's all about making an impression.

285
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,854
In the loudest voice possible.

286
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,129
All right, who's in charge here?

287
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,143
The best guy in the class...
who is it?

288
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,274
It's me.

289
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,684
Who are you?

290
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,045
You win.

291
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,228
As of today, this is my class.

292
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,126
If you follow me...

293
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,367
"I'll show you what dreams are made of."

294
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,403
How's that?

295
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,316
You know, when you are at my level,

296
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,253
words like that just fit really well.

297
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,155
Did that really happen to you, sir?

298
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,190
Of course.

299
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,014
I'm speaking from experience here.

300
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,729
But here's the punch line.

301
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,832
It wasn't me doing the talking.

302
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,189
Damn, that's hot!

303
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,072
Morning!

304
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,428
Good morning, Boss!

305
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,064
Looking real sharp, Boss!

306
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,202
Nice jacket.

307
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,539
What?

308
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,527
Nothing, sir.
I was just thinking,

309
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,030
one day I hope to wear
nice suits like you.

310
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,650
Where's the massage parlor money?

311
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,265
Did you collect the dues?

312
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,010
They'd like us to wait
a little longer this month.

313
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,298
You loser.

314
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,546
You loser.

315
00:29:58,696 --> 00:29:59,834
Sorry.

316
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,076
Ryuseikai poached on our territory.

317
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,373
I'm sorry.

318
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,247
'Cause of you.

319
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,010
Forgive me.

320
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,913
Did they cut into our action?

321
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,521
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,057
I'm sorry.

323
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:28,243
As kids, me and Genji
used to look for

324
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,999
the best spot to watch the sunset.

325
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,411
I figured we'd be friends forever.

326
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:41,140
But that's all history.

327
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,349
I'm ready to take him on.

328
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,497
I see.

329
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,529
You think

330
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,610
things could change between us someday?

331
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,946
With me, the view never changes.

332
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,681
Anyone who dares to rise above us...

333
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,581
at Suzuran will be crushed.

334
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,363
You can sit back and relax.

335
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,113
This is Tamura of Class E.

336
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,182
Hi. Call me Chuta.

337
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,099
Wait, that would mean...
our strategy worked?

338
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,469
You're good, Genji.

339
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:05,807
So tell me then, Chuta,
what's the power structure

340
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,096
like at Suzuran?

341
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,539
Okay... I'll start

342
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,802
with the new players.

343
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,586
Have you heard of The Armored Front?

344
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:19,737
Yeah.

345
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,083
But they have nothing to do with Suzuran.

346
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,226
One of their leaders,

347
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,263
Hideto Bando,

348
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,558
transferred this year as a second year.

349
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,352
I hear you don't want to tick him off.

350
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,603
Then there's the first year...

351
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,699
Ebizuka Junior High Trio.

352
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,299
Kirishima,

353
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,525
Honjo

354
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,934
and Sugihara.

355
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,580
What about Rinda-man?

356
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,374
He's a bystander in the Suzuran war.

357
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,717
He's on another level.

358
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,643
Sounds like a monster.

359
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:53,972
No.

360
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,609
The real monster is Tamao Serizawa.

361
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,249
He's the closest to
controlling Suzuran High.

362
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,294
In Serizawa's shadow is Yuji Tokaji.

363
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,631
He fought Serizawa for two years.

364
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,367
Some call him the brain of
Serizawa's Army.

365
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,912
Another one of Serizawa's boys,

366
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,771
Shoji Tsutsumoto, was a judo champion.

367
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,144
Then there's Genji's
old junior high buddy.

368
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,322
Tokio Tatsukawa's been through

369
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:31,249
a lot with Serizawa.
They're like partners.

370
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,123
And the man they all follow,

371
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,820
the "king of beasts", Tamao Serizawa.

372
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:45,373
Together, they plan to conquer Suzuran.

373
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,434
It's never been done.

374
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,339
Class B, led by the Mikami Brothers,

375
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,736
has joined ranks with Serizawa.

376
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,542
I see.

377
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,823
After "B", comes "C", huh?
My class.

378
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,822
You should avoid a meaningless fight.

379
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,562
We're not going to wave
the white flag without a fight.

380
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,335
Okay. That's what you'll get, then.

381
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,330
We'll be waiting.

382
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:32,678
Class C is led by Takashi Makise.

383
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,689
He's lost to Serizawa many times,

384
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,477
but he keeps fighting.

385
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:40,645
That's why he's got followers.

386
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,760
He can't be won by sheer force, eh?

387
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,037
Got anything on him?

388
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,830
He strikes out badly with girls.

389
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,936
That's it then.

390
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,005
Let's get him a girl.

391
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,109
How?

392
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,809
Hi, girls!

393
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,829
Wait, wait, wait!

394
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,464
Wait, wait!

395
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,957
Just tell me your names.

396
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,104
What's that for?

397
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,406
It's on me.

398
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,076
I said I'll pay.

399
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,297
Please let me pay.

400
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,934
Oh, come on!

401
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,747
Just let me have a minute
of your time, please!

402
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,309
Okay.

403
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,851
Really?

404
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,376
That's kidnapping.

405
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,804
Just one or two women...
one or two women...

406
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,744
I'll get them for you somehow.

407
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,383
Wait here.

408
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,663
What are you doing?

409
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,383
Chopping cabbage.

410
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,518
Why?

411
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,121
This is my house.

412
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,007
No way!

413
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,440
That easy?

414
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,753
That reminds me, Tamao...

415
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:46,687
Yeah?

416
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:50,341
You owe me 2,000 dollars
in bike repairs.

417
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:51,426
Eh?

418
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,727
I'll add it to your tab.

419
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,461
Eh?

420
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:57,632
Yo, Serizawa! Let's get it on!

421
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,403
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

422
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,554
Go do your homework.

423
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,562
Not so fast, Shorty!

424
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,069
I think he's a second year.

425
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,447
Win control of your grade first.

426
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,826
You've got heart.
What's your name?

427
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,390
Gota Washio.

428
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,596
I'm Manabu. Nice try.

429
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,612
I hear you're asking for me.

430
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,774
You've got some guts.

431
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,194
I called you 'cause...

432
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,652
I know.

433
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,555
But

434
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,922
even if you beat me,
my men aren't going with you.

435
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,940
A group date. Interested?

436
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,317
"Love Love Group Date"?

437
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,421
Maybe it's not for you.

438
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,973
If I don't get a girl out of this,

439
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,678
the deal is off.

440
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,812
You sure about this?

441
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,118
Relax. Group dates are my specialty.

442
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,588
Welcome.

443
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,695
Sorry we're late.

444
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,277
My friends.

445
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,565
I'm Yu.

446
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,002
Kyoko.

447
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,043
I'm Ken.

448
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,786
Small frame, big equipment.

449
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,653
Big guy,

450
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,290
bigger attitude.
This is Genji.

451
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,225
Hi.

452
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,479
And this here is...

453
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,022
I'm... uh...

454
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,960
Makkie.

455
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,020
Your name sound like
a permanent marker.

456
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,429
Wow, pretty voice.

457
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:58,802
Makise!

458
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,537
Relax.

459
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,474
Yeah.

460
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,176
I might unload without
doing a thing.

461
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:13,287
Unload what?

462
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,153
Are you really going to force

463
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:22,054
a boy to explain that?

464
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,374
Why don't we all sit down?

465
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,842
That would be good.

466
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,977
Maki's a little nervous.

467
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,970
Cheers!

468
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,475
Thank you. Excuse me.

469
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,189
What, not drinking?
How about a snack?

470
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,325
Nuts?

471
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,061
I like chocolate, myself.

472
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,884
No? Nothing?

473
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,037
I know! How about a game?

474
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,339
The Yamanote Line Game!

475
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,797
What's that?

476
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,794
What is this?

477
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,093
What do you want?

478
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:35,563
Ken, this was a flop from the start.

479
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,703
Really? Things are just getting rolling.

480
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,840
Okay, I hear you. Leave it to me.

481
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,909
It's early but...
it's an emergency.

482
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,454
Chuta?

483
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,736
Looks like fun over here.

484
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,733
Can I join you?

485
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:23,350
Yo, who's the drop dead hottie?

486
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,660
I'm a wizard with my fingers.

487
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,153
Hey, you!

488
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,158
Hands off my girl.

489
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,504
Or what, Grease ball?

490
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,398
Come on!

491
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,018
Chuta!

492
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,307
Oh God, Chuta!
You all right?

493
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,524
Don't say his name!
They'll know it's a setup!

494
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,887
Oh, I get it.

495
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,457
Unbelievable.

496
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,192
Let's go.

497
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,363
You're an ass.

498
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,935
A total ass!

499
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,020
Are you crying?

500
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,162
You sure are weird.

501
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,165
Stop crying!

502
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,542
I sent Chuta home.

503
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,888
Hey, I'm sorry about today.

504
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,073
Forget it.

505
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,248
How about I...

506
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,651
take you to a massage parlor?

507
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,616
A massage parlor?

508
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,792
Yeah.

509
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,167
Really?

510
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,318
Sure.

511
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,039
Genji, what are you, mad?

512
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,140
A massage parlor?

513
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:20,941
Yup.

514
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,176
Really?

515
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,270
Uh-huh.

516
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,766
You crying?

517
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,337
A massage parlor?

518
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,667
Yes.

519
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:30,902
First...

520
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,754
you do it on a bed.

521
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,544
Then on an oiled mat.

522
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,183
What's wrong?

523
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,536
You gonna be sick or something?

524
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:02,182
Sorry to bother you.

525
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,912
Can I buy a pair of pants?

526
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,311
And underwear?

527
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:15,796
Okay.

528
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:22,359
You're fashion leader!

529
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,705
No doubt!

530
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,335
Which side's the front?

531
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,912
I'm wearing a women's pants!

532
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,180
I'll see you later, Makise.

533
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,452
Later.

534
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,832
Hey, Genji!

535
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:13,980
Class C.

536
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,583
It's yours.

537
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:21,554
Thanks.

538
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,820
Let's take it all.

539
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,623
You, number 7 pin!
You're not lined up right!

540
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,980
You're too close!

541
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,188
Spread out, you idiot!

542
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,019
Number 1!

543
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,184
Okay!

544
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,569
How's that look?
Okay? Let's bowl!

545
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,171
Shut up already!

546
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,421
Let him concentrate!

547
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:10,862
Anyone who moves, dies!

548
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,066
Cool, let's go!

549
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,217
All clear, man!

550
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,788
Big trouble!
Makise's joined up with Genji!

551
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,724
Stop peeing your pants over everything!

552
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,828
Well, Makise's now recruiting Izaki's gang!

553
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,063
Of Class D?

554
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:29,830
Yeah!

555
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,665
You sure about it?

556
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,500
Izaki's tough!

557
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,501
And crazy.

558
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,996
Stop whining, you sissies!
Come on!

559
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,760
Ready, aim...

560
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,296
Fire!

561
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,285
Strike!

562
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,039
Congratulations!

563
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:59,378
Let them join forces.
We can take them all at once.

564
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:01,755
Yeah.

565
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,840
He looks pale.

566
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:16,840
Must be the flu.

567
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,021
Rich kids get sick easy

568
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,231
when seasons change.

569
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,444
You're full of it.

570
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,786
Now we own the first years.

571
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,835
Pretty impressive.

572
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:49,468
As your junior high alum
and upperclassman, you do me proud.

573
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:55,307
Don't flatter yourself, Izaki.

574
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:01,647
We're ready to take you on, too.

575
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:08,278
Hiromi, do you know
who you're talking to?

576
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:12,199
I'm with Hiromi.

577
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,326
Age makes no difference at Suzuran.

578
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,127
Come see me anytime.

579
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,489
And you get a haircut first.

580
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:42,104
Even he can't take the third years.

581
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:45,357
Competition is stiff here.

582
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,945
Is it true you want to join us?

583
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:55,450
Yeah, but under one condition.

584
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:01,123
That I get to fight
Serizawa when the time comes.

585
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,333
Not you.

586
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,212
What?

587
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,840
What a naive fool.

588
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,306
There is no clean fight in a war.

589
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,355
Out of respect for Makise,

590
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,816
I figured I'd give you a chance.

591
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,450
But you can't beat Serizawa.

592
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:50,398
I'm not finished yet stupid.

593
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,592
Okay, who's next?

594
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,603
Genji!

595
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,029
Genji!

596
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,487
Genji, Genji!

597
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,115
Izaki!

598
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,662
Why'd you get behind this guy?

599
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,583
Don't say it's 'cause
he tried to get you laid.

600
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,462
No reason.

601
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:05,301
Not one I can explain, anyway.

602
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,312
You tell him this:

603
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,697
Tomorrow, I'll show him
how to throw darts.

604
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,921
You seem happy.

605
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,718
Well, of course I'm happy.

606
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:54,350
Right now, you're living
my unfulfilled dream.

607
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:58,104
Thanks in part to me.

608
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,231
Stop trying to act cool.

609
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,358
You let me be cool.

610
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:08,198
Hey' isn't that?

611
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,659
That's Ruka!

612
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,120
I'll cut that pretty face.

613
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,413
What's going on?

614
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,664
Get back here.

615
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,059
What do you think you are doing?

616
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:34,875
Who are you?

617
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,728
Know what I hate most?
Guys who...

618
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,939
carry knives and beat upon women.

619
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:46,027
Sorry about the other day.
Let me make amends.

620
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,031
Get Ruka out of here.

621
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,745
You're way outnumbered.

622
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,457
You have to lead your
men to the top of Suzuran.

623
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,876
Stop stalling and let's go, man!

624
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,461
Kill you!

625
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,296
You shut the hell up.

626
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,423
Just take her and go!

627
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,844
I said, stop acting cool.

628
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,306
From time to time, why not?

629
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,562
Now go!

630
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,613
Want a piece of me?

631
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,617
How old are you?

632
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,110
Old enough to kick your ass!

633
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,513
Let's go.

634
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,749
Hey now wait a second!
Hold it right there!

635
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,211
Wait, wait, wait! Listen up!

636
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,464
I'm Ken Katagiri.

637
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,091
My name can silence a crying baby.

638
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,177
I'm a ranking officer in the

639
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,804
Soshu Family Syndicate.

640
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,472
What's that?

641
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,141
What?

642
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,018
We don't give a damn!

643
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,566
Back off!

644
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,194
No one gets by me!

645
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,448
No one gets by.

646
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:34,427
There can't go...

647
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:41,017
We got a call. Figures it's you.

648
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,066
Detective Kuroiwa?

649
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:53,196
Aren't you getting
a little too old for this?

650
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,785
Leave me alone.

651
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,954
That reminds me.

652
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,664
I ran into Nakai,

653
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,960
the guy who lorded
over Suzuran back in your day.

654
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,629
He was a bad egg then.

655
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,548
Now, he's a company man.

656
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,719
Supporting a wife and kids.

657
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,475
It's time you grew up.

658
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,729
You're the only Suzuran graduate
still being a two bit hood.

659
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,947
Even as yakuza, you're mediocre.

660
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:44,330
Didn't that "School of Crows"
teach you anything?

661
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,007
I guess not to a dropout.

662
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,259
Right?

663
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,338
You all right?

664
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,834
Hell, yeah!

665
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:37,050
I scared them all off
with my sheer intensity.

666
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,888
I see. I'm glad.

667
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,684
I figured you dead for sure.

668
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:51,773
Hey, I'm invincible.

669
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,319
It'd take a lot more than that to kill me.

670
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:01,690
In that case...

671
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:03,491
let meet up?

672
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:11,709
Sorry, but I've got to be someplace.

673
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,162
Catch you later.

674
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:46,369
About the other day I'm sorry.

675
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,882
Ken's a character.

676
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,802
One of a kind.

677
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,554
Is he your friend?

678
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,474
I guess so.

679
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,441
Your face is a mess.
What happened?

680
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,152
Like here.

681
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,447
Ouch!

682
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:25,950
Sorry!

683
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,037
Want some candy?

684
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,790
Here.

685
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,044
Thanks.

686
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:57,815
"Genji's Perfect Succession"

687
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:26,844
Sapporo Beer!

688
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,680
Come on, Genji!

689
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,666
Tokio...

690
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,877
We can't overlook these guys anymore.

691
01:04:02,597 --> 01:04:05,174
I never asked you to.

692
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:16,852
I bet the view atop Suzuran

693
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:23,818
is breathtaking.
Let's go get it.

694
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,638
There is no clean fight in a war.

695
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:57,310
Right?

696
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,407
Jerk off.

697
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,786
What's that?!

698
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,221
Izaki!

699
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:40,311
Bring him down easy!

700
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,649
Izaki! Who did this to you?
Serizawa?

701
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:46,649
No.

702
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,989
I fell.

703
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:00,790
Don't do it.

704
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,877
We're still outnumbered.

705
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,968
Genji, wait!

706
01:06:13,376 --> 01:06:14,368
Out of my way!

707
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,847
Genji! Izaki's right!

708
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,224
Fight now and we lose.

709
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:20,351
That's not the point!

710
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,019
Yes it is!

711
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,738
If you lose, it's over for all of us.

712
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,494
That's how far this war's come.

713
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:06,415
Here.

714
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:08,759
Drink up.

715
01:07:19,762 --> 01:07:25,309
This really hurts.

716
01:07:28,938 --> 01:07:31,649
It'd hurt much less if it happened to me.

717
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:43,953
Welcome.

718
01:07:51,377 --> 01:07:52,879
What timing.

719
01:07:54,714 --> 01:07:57,592
Enemy territory. Tamao...

720
01:08:08,936 --> 01:08:10,730
Tokio...

721
01:08:11,936 --> 01:08:13,730
you bastard!

722
01:08:19,856 --> 01:08:21,824
It's me you want.

723
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:25,286
Did you do Izaki?

724
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,998
Don't play dumb.

725
01:08:30,082 --> 01:08:34,503
Hey! Take it outside!

726
01:08:40,468 --> 01:08:41,719
Wait, Tamao.

727
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:46,349
Move.

728
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:49,060
I said, move!

729
01:08:49,727 --> 01:08:51,729
Not here.

730
01:08:55,775 --> 01:08:57,777
Tokio!

731
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:00,780
Tokio!

732
01:09:00,988 --> 01:09:01,614
Tokio?

733
01:09:01,822 --> 01:09:07,578
Tokio, Tokio!

734
01:09:16,822 --> 01:09:18,578
An operation?

735
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,757
Yes.

736
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:24,011
I need to talk to our folks.

737
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,180
I'll talk to them.

738
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,810
I'm not a child. Just tell me.

739
01:09:34,105 --> 01:09:37,817
The chance of surgical success
for a cerebral aneurysm this size...

740
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:44,073
is about 30 percent.

741
01:09:45,783 --> 01:09:48,202
Then forget surgery.

742
01:09:51,831 --> 01:09:55,418
If surgery gets me 30 percent,

743
01:09:56,961 --> 01:09:59,463
I'll take life at 100 percent.

744
01:09:59,672 --> 01:10:01,215
But if you do nothing...

745
01:10:01,424 --> 01:10:05,469
I won't hold you responsible.

746
01:10:14,562 --> 01:10:16,689
I'm not going to die.

747
01:10:40,004 --> 01:10:42,632
Stop whinin' you little wimp!

748
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:43,716
Hey, Genji!

749
01:10:43,966 --> 01:10:47,178
Genji! What's gotten into you?

750
01:10:48,596 --> 01:10:49,388
Genji!

751
01:10:56,812 --> 01:10:57,647
Genji!

752
01:11:02,485 --> 01:11:03,319
Genji!

753
01:11:03,527 --> 01:11:04,654
Stop running!

754
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,308
As of today...

755
01:11:35,434 --> 01:11:37,770
you follow me. Got it?

756
01:11:41,357 --> 01:11:42,358
What are you doing?

757
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:47,238
I'm getting numbers, like Izaki said.

758
01:11:51,075 --> 01:11:53,160
Not like this!

759
01:11:55,329 --> 01:11:57,164
Listen!

760
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,630
You won't boost our strength this way!

761
01:12:01,794 --> 01:12:02,594
Genji!

762
01:12:03,838 --> 01:12:05,214
They got Chuta!

763
01:12:11,262 --> 01:12:12,096
Move!

764
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:13,514
Move!

765
01:12:18,477 --> 01:12:19,395
Chuta!

766
01:12:21,877 --> 01:12:22,995
What happened?

767
01:12:28,112 --> 01:12:29,113
Sorry.

768
01:12:30,114 --> 01:12:35,828
I was trying to recruit the first years
and got mixed up with Tokaji.

769
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,956
I'll show him.

770
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:41,959
Hey, Genji!

771
01:12:45,755 --> 01:12:46,630
Hey!

772
01:12:48,549 --> 01:12:49,925
That's enough!

773
01:12:58,642 --> 01:13:02,730
What are you doing wild for?

774
01:13:13,324 --> 01:13:17,787
Sorry but I can't follow you like this.

775
01:13:20,414 --> 01:13:21,332
Wait!

776
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:27,463
Makise!

777
01:13:48,984 --> 01:13:51,737
So much stuff has gone down so quickly,

778
01:13:51,921 --> 01:13:53,614
I'm lost.

779
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:57,493
I can't keep the alliance.

780
01:13:58,452 --> 01:14:00,120
What are you saying?

781
01:14:00,704 --> 01:14:02,748
You've come this far.

782
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:06,585
We're going where no one's been!

783
01:14:06,794 --> 01:14:09,797
To the top of Suzuran. Come on!

784
01:14:10,005 --> 01:14:12,883
You're the only one who can do it!
Trust me!

785
01:14:13,092 --> 01:14:14,093
Okay. So I'm a Suzuran drop out.

786
01:14:14,301 --> 01:14:16,846
A big fat loser, right?

787
01:14:17,054 --> 01:14:19,139
But not you. So let's finish this.

788
01:14:19,348 --> 01:14:21,350
Come on!

789
01:14:21,559 --> 01:14:25,896
You can do it! You said so yourself!

790
01:14:26,397 --> 01:14:28,607
You're living my dream, man!

791
01:14:32,152 --> 01:14:35,990
Fine, forget that, then!

792
01:14:36,282 --> 01:14:43,956
Forget about me! Be a man, okay?

793
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,294
A man.

794
01:14:49,962 --> 01:14:52,423
Don't be a loser.

795
01:14:58,762 --> 01:15:00,931
You made a pledge.

796
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:08,856
You've got to see this through.

797
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:13,110
Listen.

798
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:26,332
I came to Suzuran to outdo my old man.

799
01:15:34,298 --> 01:15:36,634
To outdo your old man?

800
01:15:40,638 --> 01:15:42,640
That's cool.

801
01:15:44,308 --> 01:15:49,021
What does he do?

802
01:15:51,132 --> 01:15:52,650
Same as you.

803
01:15:54,318 --> 01:15:56,403
Yakuza... the Ryuseikai.

804
01:15:58,864 --> 01:16:00,115
Ryuseikai?

805
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,035
Yeah.

806
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:17,035
Are you...

807
01:16:18,968 --> 01:16:21,428
Hideo's son?

808
01:16:22,888 --> 01:16:26,684
GPS keeps growing.

809
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,478
That's why we've got to make a move.

810
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:33,857
Without Serizawa, Tokaji?

811
01:16:34,525 --> 01:16:36,110
Not a good idea.

812
01:16:36,318 --> 01:16:37,528
Just listen.

813
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:39,822
I have plan.

814
01:16:46,412 --> 01:16:49,039
You wanted to see me?

815
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,209
Bando!

816
01:16:55,607 --> 01:17:00,509
I hear you need some soldiers

817
01:17:00,718 --> 01:17:02,423
to bring down our current boss.

818
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,930
If you do something for us,

819
01:17:05,139 --> 01:17:06,807
I'll lend you some muscle.

820
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:31,957
We got 30 more from the first year
and second year classes.

821
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:35,919
The rest is up to Genji.

822
01:17:37,772 --> 01:17:39,757
Be ready to go at any moment.

823
01:17:43,427 --> 01:17:45,262
And if Genji doesn't return?

824
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,225
We still go ahead.

825
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,021
There's no turning back now.

826
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,021
Fight me, will you?

827
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:18,378
If I win...

828
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:28,097
will you join me again?

829
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,405
You called me, Boss?

830
01:18:46,824 --> 01:18:49,326
You've been hanging out

831
01:18:49,535 --> 01:18:51,537
with a Suzuran punk?

832
01:18:55,582 --> 01:19:00,963
The same guy who beat up some of our boys.

833
01:19:02,297 --> 01:19:06,135
Actually, we mistook him for

834
01:19:06,343 --> 01:19:08,637
a kid named Serizawa.

835
01:19:28,031 --> 01:19:29,867
I want you to kill him.

836
01:19:35,706 --> 01:19:37,374
Thing is

837
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:42,796
that student

838
01:19:44,173 --> 01:19:47,134
is the son of Ryuseikai's boss.

839
01:19:47,473 --> 01:19:48,834
So?

840
01:19:49,261 --> 01:19:53,182
So I'm saying

841
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,478
if we were to off the heir of...

842
01:19:58,937 --> 01:20:01,231
the Ryuseikai syndicate

843
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:04,401
We'd start a war.

844
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:08,906
Is that the intent?

845
01:20:34,139 --> 01:20:37,559
Sorry to cause you so much trouble, Ken.

846
01:20:40,854 --> 01:20:43,357
Izaki leaves the hospital tomorrow.

847
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:47,611
I've slowly begun to understand

848
01:20:48,654 --> 01:20:54,076
what it means to have comrades.

849
01:21:16,014 --> 01:21:17,307
I've been looking for you.

850
01:21:27,651 --> 01:21:28,694
What for?

851
01:21:31,113 --> 01:21:32,823
I came to tell you something.

852
01:21:36,118 --> 01:21:38,829
I hear you haven't been yourself lately.

853
01:21:39,496 --> 01:21:41,164
It's about Tokio.

854
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,962
What's the story with him?

855
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:51,842
No story. He'll be back soon.

856
01:21:52,793 --> 01:21:55,012
Illness can't stop him.

857
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:01,268
We could call a cease
fire until he returns.

858
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,768
No need.

859
01:22:03,562 --> 01:22:05,272
Putting you in the hospital will be

860
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,149
my "get well" gift to him.

861
01:22:07,357 --> 01:22:11,236
That's funny. Mine is to

862
01:22:11,528 --> 01:22:13,655
put you in a bed next to his.

863
01:22:14,531 --> 01:22:17,993
Tokio's my friend.
He doesn't concern you.

864
01:22:20,078 --> 01:22:21,398
I came to tell you that.

865
01:22:22,414 --> 01:22:24,416
See you around, Poor Boy.

866
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:26,460
Poor people are tough, you know.

867
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:40,932
Man, I envy you guys.

868
01:22:42,559 --> 01:22:48,899
Driving straight down life's road
at full throttle. No pretensions.

869
01:22:54,738 --> 01:22:56,865
Makes me weep with joy.

870
01:22:59,201 --> 01:23:04,414
If I had spent my time
at Suzuran like you

871
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:10,212
I'd be better man now.

872
01:23:21,807 --> 01:23:24,309
You woke me up.

873
01:23:42,869 --> 01:23:44,246
What was that for?

874
01:23:47,582 --> 01:23:50,293
My punches don't affect you.

875
01:23:53,505 --> 01:23:55,590
I know about punches.

876
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:58,677
I've taken my share of them.

877
01:24:09,312 --> 01:24:10,647
Genji.

878
01:24:13,312 --> 01:24:15,147
take the top.

879
01:24:35,005 --> 01:24:37,007
Hey, Izaki.

880
01:24:40,844 --> 01:24:43,638
You're late. Where were you?

881
01:24:44,264 --> 01:24:46,975
You're a nag. And you smell.

882
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:03,033
Welcome back.

883
01:25:05,744 --> 01:25:06,620
Welcome back.

884
01:25:51,665 --> 01:25:57,254
It's been a long time.
You haven't changed.

885
01:26:01,299 --> 01:26:05,428
Back then, I

886
01:26:07,847 --> 01:26:09,766
admired you, sir.

887
01:26:11,017 --> 01:26:15,772
But you didn't let me
join your organization.

888
01:26:17,315 --> 01:26:21,236
So I went to our enemy.

889
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,071
What a fool.

890
01:26:25,115 --> 01:26:26,700
I didn't know a thing.

891
01:26:36,585 --> 01:26:40,088
My boss plans to kill Genji.

892
01:26:41,923 --> 01:26:43,300
What did you say to me?

893
01:26:45,135 --> 01:26:46,636
Why tell me?

894
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:51,683
I've spent my life running.

895
01:26:53,435 --> 01:26:59,441
I want it to end by
being honest with myself.

896
01:27:00,584 --> 01:27:01,735
I see.

897
01:27:14,623 --> 01:27:18,084
Please give this to Genji.

898
01:27:31,181 --> 01:27:33,892
I hear you'd let him succeed you

899
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,853
if he took Suzuran.

900
01:27:38,688 --> 01:27:41,024
What if he does take Suzuran?

901
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:43,401
What will you do?

902
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:50,784
You plan on having him
lead this kind of life?

903
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:57,457
If he has what it takes
to conquer Suzuran

904
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:03,630
I'm sure he'll choose not to.

905
01:28:13,014 --> 01:28:13,973
Hey, what's up?

906
01:28:14,182 --> 01:28:15,266
Help.

907
01:28:17,602 --> 01:28:20,730
We've been kidnapped by guys in
leather jackets with skulls on the back.

908
01:28:20,939 --> 01:28:22,065
Skulls?

909
01:28:22,649 --> 01:28:23,692
Yeah.

910
01:28:28,655 --> 01:28:32,409
I heard them saying Bando.

911
01:28:34,035 --> 01:28:35,245
Bando?

912
01:28:38,748 --> 01:28:42,293
They hang out at the Narai Warehouse.

913
01:28:42,502 --> 01:28:43,795
Where's that?

914
01:28:45,088 --> 01:28:46,047
Kijima Docks.

915
01:28:47,089 --> 01:28:47,674
They're dead.

916
01:28:47,882 --> 01:28:50,343
Genji, wait!

917
01:28:51,261 --> 01:28:53,888
Do we take on The Armored Front?

918
01:28:54,097 --> 01:28:58,393
If that's what he wants,
that's what we do.

919
01:29:04,107 --> 01:29:05,066
I hear you.

920
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:08,066
I'll gather men!

921
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,612
Let's go!

922
01:29:14,826 --> 01:29:17,162
I can borrow this?

923
01:29:21,124 --> 01:29:22,169
They've got spirit.

924
01:29:38,475 --> 01:29:39,726
Let Ruka go!

925
01:29:41,978 --> 01:29:43,021
Who's that?

926
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,023
Don't play dumb!

927
01:30:17,806 --> 01:30:19,224
You don't kidnap chicks!

928
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:01,850
Okay, that's enough!

929
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,399
No skulls.

930
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,299
You're pretty good.

931
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,242
So it wasn't you?

932
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:23,371
The third generation
of leadership is rotten.

933
01:31:24,289 --> 01:31:25,957
Until I've cleaned everything up.

934
01:31:26,457 --> 01:31:27,792
I've sealed the skulls.

935
01:31:28,001 --> 01:31:30,461
Look, I don't care.

936
01:31:30,837 --> 01:31:32,255
Who, then?

937
01:31:36,593 --> 01:31:40,471
Who gains the most out of us going to war?

938
01:31:42,599 --> 01:31:44,684
Serizawa.

939
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:48,980
You've got my boys all fired up.

940
01:31:49,689 --> 01:31:52,108
I probably can't control them.

941
01:31:53,443 --> 01:31:56,237
They'll want some kind of apology.
Especially from him.

942
01:31:56,946 --> 01:32:00,033
Hey, you.

943
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:10,960
We'll take an ear.

944
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:14,005
An ear?

945
01:32:14,797 --> 01:32:15,840
Yeah.

946
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:18,760
An ear.

947
01:32:20,136 --> 01:32:23,932
Only one of them will do.
That's funnier, right?

948
01:32:30,104 --> 01:32:31,773
Then are we even?

949
01:32:34,025 --> 01:32:35,485
If that's what you want.

950
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,910
Would you settle for mine?

951
01:32:46,537 --> 01:32:48,957
I'll give you both.

952
01:32:51,737 --> 01:32:53,257
As you wish.

953
01:32:57,924 --> 01:33:00,218
Hey, Genji!

954
01:33:11,437 --> 01:33:13,982
I don't want our filthy ear.

955
01:33:24,701 --> 01:33:29,372
They came to us with a request
to take the girl.

956
01:33:31,082 --> 01:33:34,252
The basement of Club S.

957
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,881
Go on.

958
01:33:40,133 --> 01:33:44,178
Get her out.
Then, we'll settle things.

959
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,893
Who cares who wins?
Both sides will be depleted.

960
01:33:53,146 --> 01:33:54,981
We'll clean up the stragglers.

961
01:33:56,566 --> 01:33:57,442
I'm in.

962
01:34:05,408 --> 01:34:09,037
Tokio's operation is at 5 tomorrow.

963
01:34:10,038 --> 01:34:11,581
I see.

964
01:34:16,002 --> 01:34:16,961
What is it?

965
01:34:23,885 --> 01:34:25,386
Give me the girl.

966
01:34:25,762 --> 01:34:26,763
Huh?

967
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:29,682
Don't act stupid.

968
01:34:35,313 --> 01:34:36,689
Get the hell out of here.

969
01:34:38,983 --> 01:34:40,234
What did you do?

970
01:34:43,071 --> 01:34:44,088
You again?

971
01:34:47,784 --> 01:34:49,118
Gig's up. Let her go.

972
01:34:49,285 --> 01:34:52,413
Ruka! You all right?

973
01:34:53,748 --> 01:34:54,707
Where is Kyoko?

974
01:34:54,999 --> 01:34:55,958
She is safe.

975
01:34:57,293 --> 01:34:59,846
Ruka! I'm so scared!

976
01:35:00,093 --> 01:35:02,046
Kyoko!

977
01:35:04,509 --> 01:35:05,259
Tokaji!

978
01:35:08,346 --> 01:35:09,806
Do you know what you've done?

979
01:35:10,181 --> 01:35:11,265
I did it

980
01:35:11,724 --> 01:35:13,518
to assure our victory.

981
01:35:13,768 --> 01:35:14,936
Don't be stupid!

982
01:35:17,313 --> 01:35:21,400
I'd rather be crushed head on
than to pull a punk stunt like this!

983
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:24,654
We took part in it, too!

984
01:35:41,671 --> 01:35:43,131
Losers.

985
01:35:57,103 --> 01:36:00,523
There's only one thing to do now.

986
01:36:02,066 --> 01:36:03,192
Yeah.

987
01:36:05,403 --> 01:36:07,864
Looks like the time has come.

988
01:36:16,956 --> 01:36:21,502
Tomorrow at 5.
At our very own Suzuran.

989
01:36:38,603 --> 01:36:39,403
Katagiri

990
01:36:40,646 --> 01:36:41,689
left this for you.

991
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:46,402
Read it.

992
01:37:02,627 --> 01:37:04,687
"Dear Genji, the perch is yours."

993
01:37:04,837 --> 01:37:06,214
"Fly! Fly high!"

994
01:37:09,759 --> 01:37:11,218
What'd you talk about?

995
01:37:13,763 --> 01:37:19,060
He's taking one for you.

996
01:37:21,437 --> 01:37:22,605
What's that mean?

997
01:37:23,356 --> 01:37:26,525
He ignored orders from
his boss to kill you.

998
01:37:47,505 --> 01:37:48,506
Gen!

999
01:37:50,174 --> 01:37:52,635
There is no move for you to make.

1000
01:37:56,973 --> 01:37:58,099
I didn't ask.

1001
01:37:59,433 --> 01:38:00,685
Don't be stupid.

1002
01:38:01,811 --> 01:38:03,854
The man chose this path.

1003
01:38:04,689 --> 01:38:06,816
He can wipe his own ass.

1004
01:38:13,739 --> 01:38:19,870
You can carry on his wishes.

1005
01:38:25,835 --> 01:38:26,961
Genji

1006
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,007
take the top.

1007
01:38:57,074 --> 01:38:58,034
Let's do it!

1008
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,999
Get psyched!

1009
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:21,867
Could you stop?

1010
01:40:23,528 --> 01:40:24,869
Stop, please!

1011
01:40:38,426 --> 01:40:39,927
Let me walk this.

1012
01:40:41,804 --> 01:40:42,972
Is that okay?

1013
01:41:48,704 --> 01:41:52,541
You sure you don't want to be with Tokio?

1014
01:41:55,503 --> 01:41:57,505
We fight together.

1015
01:42:04,428 --> 01:42:05,228
Tokaji!

1016
01:42:16,732 --> 01:42:19,401
Let's win and brag to Tokio.

1017
01:42:26,492 --> 01:42:27,660
Yeah.

1018
01:42:56,764 --> 01:42:58,774
It's starting.

1019
01:42:59,066 --> 01:43:00,859
Serizawa's got about 100.

1020
01:43:01,066 --> 01:43:02,659
GPS 70.

1021
01:43:03,696 --> 01:43:06,323
Serizawa's got the numbers...
and the strength.

1022
01:43:07,491 --> 01:43:09,118
GPS hasn't a chance.

1023
01:43:12,288 --> 01:43:13,497
Don't be so sure.

1024
01:43:18,669 --> 01:43:19,962
I can't do it.

1025
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:25,884
You look pretty sure of yourself.

1026
01:43:27,177 --> 01:43:32,141
You probably went
and warned them, anyway.

1027
01:43:34,518 --> 01:43:35,603
You're a fool.

1028
01:43:37,814 --> 01:43:39,856
It'll cost you.

1029
01:43:43,611 --> 01:43:45,863
Get the car.

1030
01:44:08,344 --> 01:44:09,678
You'll sleep.

1031
01:44:52,763 --> 01:44:53,931
It's begun.

1032
01:45:42,563 --> 01:45:43,772
Well, come on!

1033
01:46:10,924 --> 01:46:13,469
I'll cover your back
till you reach Serizawa.

1034
01:46:42,831 --> 01:46:44,708
Serizawa Army's winning.

1035
01:46:46,418 --> 01:46:47,961
What did I tell you?

1036
01:46:49,338 --> 01:46:53,008
Wait and see.

1037
01:47:38,595 --> 01:47:41,473
Is that the best you can do?

1038
01:48:15,966 --> 01:48:17,759
I want Serizawa's head!

1039
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,529
Why is Bando siding with GPS?

1040
01:48:38,363 --> 01:48:41,325
I guess he just felt like it.

1041
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:44,620
Whoa.

1042
01:48:45,996 --> 01:48:48,916
They were only a few but,
suddenly, it's an even fight.

1043
01:49:02,471 --> 01:49:03,597
About time.

1044
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:04,681
Hey, ugly!

1045
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:05,641
Baldy!

1046
01:49:05,849 --> 01:49:07,935
- Want some plastic surgery?
- Baldy!

1047
01:49:08,352 --> 01:49:09,436
Well, come on!

1048
01:49:13,023 --> 01:49:14,816
Don't mind if I do.

1049
01:49:23,867 --> 01:49:25,160
Izaki!

1050
01:49:26,119 --> 01:49:28,622
Plug your hole, pig face!

1051
01:50:04,533 --> 01:50:08,995
"I can't contain this feeling"

1052
01:50:09,996 --> 01:50:15,001
"Swelling up inside of me"

1053
01:50:15,877 --> 01:50:20,090
"You take on the world alone"

1054
01:50:20,298 --> 01:50:26,555
"But don't know where to stop"

1055
01:50:33,645 --> 01:50:40,736
"Where are you looking for,
flying into the sky?"

1056
01:50:40,944 --> 01:50:45,991
"The hero lives in you"

1057
01:50:46,199 --> 01:50:52,122
"That is our true destination"

1058
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:58,837
"Taking flight into the future"

1059
01:50:59,045 --> 01:51:04,593
"You are the sunlight"

1060
01:51:04,801 --> 01:51:09,765
"The hero lives in you"

1061
01:51:10,432 --> 01:51:13,059
"Somewhere in this town"'

1062
01:51:13,268 --> 01:51:15,937
"you're running breathless again"

1063
01:51:16,146 --> 01:51:18,565
"Only to return with scars"

1064
01:51:18,774 --> 01:51:21,777
"but so few reasons Why?"

1065
01:51:21,985 --> 01:51:24,571
"Maybe we'll find a place one day"

1066
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:29,701
"to share a laugh or two"

1067
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:35,791
"All you gotta do is believe"

1068
01:54:58,284 --> 01:54:59,869
You wanted this, right?

1069
01:55:04,541 --> 01:55:07,168
Take it. It's yours.

1070
01:55:20,932 --> 01:55:24,686
You regret becoming a yakuza?

1071
01:55:28,098 --> 01:55:29,315
No way.

1072
01:56:04,225 --> 01:56:05,727
Damn you!

1073
01:56:06,895 --> 01:56:08,146
You are a pest.

1074
01:56:09,105 --> 01:56:10,480
Don't take it personally.

1075
01:56:12,442 --> 01:56:14,402
Just setting an example.

1076
01:56:40,964 --> 01:56:43,189
Go, Genji!

1077
01:56:51,606 --> 01:56:53,066
Kill him!

1078
01:57:37,227 --> 01:57:38,695
Come on!

1079
01:58:08,984 --> 01:58:10,226
Make your peace.

1080
01:58:12,187 --> 01:58:15,064
Genji! Fly!

1081
01:59:12,205 --> 01:59:13,665
Genji!

1082
01:59:20,129 --> 01:59:21,923
Genji!

1083
01:59:32,976 --> 01:59:34,269
Genji...

1084
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,401
Genji...

1085
01:59:43,486 --> 01:59:44,696
Damn it!

1086
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:51,284
If I hadn't met you my life

1087
01:59:54,201 --> 01:59:56,582
would've been a complete waste.

1088
01:59:57,792 --> 01:59:59,002
Thanks.

1089
02:00:00,795 --> 02:00:02,130
Tamao.

1090
02:00:04,299 --> 02:00:05,883
It's the hospital.

1091
02:00:14,809 --> 02:00:16,477
How's Tokio?

1092
02:00:26,696 --> 02:00:28,239
Gotcha.

1093
02:00:39,484 --> 02:00:41,002
Tokio...

1094
02:00:42,784 --> 02:00:44,002
made it.

1095
02:00:47,759 --> 02:00:49,344
What did you say?

1096
02:00:53,639 --> 02:00:55,808
He won.

1097
02:02:35,908 --> 02:02:38,911
Bulletproof.

1098
02:02:40,508 --> 02:02:41,911
Boss.

1099
02:02:44,008 --> 02:02:44,911
I'm freezing.

1100
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:53,551
Thank you!

1101
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:16,365
Genji!

1102
02:03:18,242 --> 02:03:21,120
I'm alive!

1103
02:03:22,038 --> 02:03:24,790
I'm still alive!

1104
02:04:09,411 --> 02:04:10,753
Sorry,

1105
02:04:12,171 --> 02:04:15,049
but if I don't defeat you,
I don't have Suzura.

1106
02:04:17,009 --> 02:04:19,136
You never will.

1107
02:04:21,764 --> 02:04:27,853
Just like you beat Serizawa
there's always someone new.

1108
02:04:28,521 --> 02:04:30,189
That's Suzuran.

1109
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:35,861
You fight and fight
and then you graduate.

1110
02:04:37,196 --> 02:04:41,284
Conquest is just a dream.

1111
02:04:43,494 --> 02:04:45,371
Don't be so sure.

1112
02:04:52,795 --> 02:04:54,589
I won't hold back.

1113
02:05:01,554 --> 02:05:02,430
Let's do it.

1114
02:06:06,348 --> 02:06:09,455
"I feel my soul about to explode"

1115
02:06:11,353 --> 02:06:16,063
"Into something that will live forever"

1116
02:06:16,358 --> 02:06:19,430
"My instincts keep telling me"

1117
02:06:21,296 --> 02:06:25,684
"This is my defining moment"

1118
02:06:25,834 --> 02:06:30,856
"Eternal rock 'n' roll,
Eternal rock 'n' roll"

1119
02:06:31,006 --> 02:06:32,947
"Never ending rock 'n' roll"

1120
02:06:35,043 --> 02:06:38,286
"A fate named reality is"

1121
02:06:40,148 --> 02:06:44,597
"An onslaught of unforgiving truths"

1122
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:47,862
"The moment I'm cornered in"

1123
02:06:50,092 --> 02:06:54,446
"I must face it without regret"

1124
02:06:54,596 --> 02:06:58,868
"Eternal rock 'n' roll,
Eternal rock 'n' roll"

1125
02:06:59,568 --> 02:07:01,871
"Never ending rock 'n' roll"
