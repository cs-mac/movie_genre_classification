1
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:29,665
Can't you call in sick and tell them
you have a doctor's appointment?

2
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:32,873
And l'll make it worth your while.

3
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,631
You do make it hard.

4
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:42,435
Received a call yesterday...

5
00:00:42,596 --> 00:00:45,030
...and got a lead
on some bookie joints opening up.

6
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:46,629
Should be a pretty dull day...

7
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,788
...so I will be home by 6.

8
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:54,226
- You are gonna make me late.
- I am not.

9
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:55,590
I gotta go.

10
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,431
- Oh, no, please?
- Get off.

11
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:01,504
I gotta go.

12
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,632
- Come on.
- No, I don't want you to. Please?

13
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:04,990
- Got to.
- No.

14
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:07,431
- Got to. Got to.
- No. No.

15
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,389
Oh, yeah.

16
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,475
You're beautiful.

17
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:31,750
Good morning, Los Angeles.
It's 6:30 a.m.

18
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,713
The temperature
is a cool 49 degrees.

19
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,151
The traffic is already starting
to become heavy.

20
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,705
A shootout took place
in South Compton last night...

21
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,514
...leaving a 26-year-old male dead.

22
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:42,394
In a statement issued
by the police...

23
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:45,707
...the shooting has been blamed
on the violence between two gangs...

24
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,628
...Hyde Park
and East Side Gangsters...

25
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,230
...who have been the focus
of the mayor's commitment.

26
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,191
- Come on.
- What's up, man?

27
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,075
Shit.

28
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,110
- Shut up. Stay still.
- I ain't did nothing.

29
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:04,073
Stay right there. Come on.

30
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,829
Get down.

31
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:07,873
Get down.

32
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:12,354
What the fuck?

33
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,271
All right.

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,951
Let's get out of here.

35
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,906
Hey, check it out.

36
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:38,628
Oh, shit.

37
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:40,955
All right, let's go.

38
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:43,232
All right, let's go.

39
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:59,591
Ron and Schrulner.

40
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:03,834
I always had my suspicions.

41
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:08,828
But who are you?

42
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,469
Come on.

43
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:25,034
Hello.

44
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:31,307
What, now?

45
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:36,226
This better be important.

46
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,227
L'll be there in 20.

47
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:44,389
- Damn it.
- What's wrong?

48
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:46,468
I gotta go get somebody.

49
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,471
- L'll be less than an hour.
- Dinner's almost ready.

50
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:53,833
I know, I know, l'll make it quick.
Promise.

51
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:56,669
- I guess l'll keep a plate warm for you.
- Thanks.

52
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:21,274
Come on, Gary, it's cold.

53
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:29,034
Linda's gonna have my ass.

54
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:44,028
Hello.

55
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,594
Hello.

56
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:24,868
Ready. Aim. Fire.

57
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:29,029
Ready. Aim. Fire.

58
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,551
Ready. Aim. Fire.

59
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:47,910
Max Ballister is a hero.

60
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:54,430
He gave his life in the line of duty
with courage and conviction.

61
00:06:54,796 --> 00:07:00,393
His loss will forever
be remembered by everyone.

62
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:15,628
Simon, the police say
it was a random gang shooting.

63
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,310
They may never know who did it.

64
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,796
I won't accept that option, Simon.

65
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:27,028
Someone murdered Max.

66
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:30,946
Someone shot him in cold blood.

67
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:36,474
If you come by the house,
I have copies of the police reports...

68
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:38,866
...they would release to me.

69
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,948
Along with Max's personal items.

70
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,069
- Yo.
- Hello.

71
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,195
Can I help you?

72
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:40,709
Sign says room for rent.

73
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:43,436
I have a few apartments
available upstairs.

74
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,507
This the kind of place
you're looking for?

75
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,035
Can I see the room?

76
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,993
Yeah.

77
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:53,027
Follow me.

78
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,547
So they're not exactly
the Four Seasons...

79
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,594
...but they're cheap,
and they rent by the week.

80
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:09,471
It comes furnished.

81
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,231
Change your mind?

82
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:13,664
No, it's perfect.

83
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:16,908
All right. Well, I'm gonna need
the first week in advance.

84
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,794
Yeah, that's no problem.

85
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:21,424
Cop was killed not far from here
the other day.

86
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:22,824
Know anything about that?

87
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,191
Like I said,
this isn't the best neighbourhood.

88
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:29,474
- In fact, it's getting worse by the week.
- Yeah.

89
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,831
That cop was my son.

90
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,305
Oh, I'm sorry.

91
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:35,750
How much you say I owe you?

92
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,146
One twenty-five.

93
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:40,227
By the way, I'm Simon Ballister.

94
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,511
I'm Alice Park.

95
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,234
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

96
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,587
- Can I help you?
- This is my 'hood, pendejo.

97
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:53,189
You don't fucking belong here.

98
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,304
Really?

99
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:58,991
Listen, I got some personal stuff going
on that makes me have to be here...

100
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:01,511
...so why don't you take
your lively, chubby ass...

101
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:03,109
...and get the fuck off my car?

102
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:04,629
Lt's my fucking 'hood.

103
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:07,788
I'm starting to get scared.
I'm starting to get scared.

104
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:09,514
Come on, rob me.

105
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,350
Kung fu this, motherfucker.

106
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:42,592
Tell every motherfucker
they're not safe...

107
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:45,065
...till I find the motherfucker
who killed my son.

108
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,192
You understand me?

109
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:02,347
Tell them. Tell them what I said.

110
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:05,546
I'm gonna get that guy.

111
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:17,955
How can I help you?

112
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:21,426
I'm Simon Ballister,
Max's father.

113
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:22,995
He was murdered last week...

114
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:25,954
...and I'd like to speak
with the officer in charge.

115
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:28,232
I'm sorry. Max was a good man.

116
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:31,388
Highly respected officer
in this department.

117
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:34,912
Detective Shaw is heading up his case.
L'll let him know you're here.

118
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,705
Simon Ballister,
Max's father, here to see you.

119
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,552
Thank you, send him in.

120
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:47,868
- Right back this way, Mr. Ballister.
- Thank you.

121
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,748
I know, I know,
that's what he told me.

122
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,593
Hello, Mr. Ballister.
I'm Detective Shaw.

123
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,629
Nice to meet you.

124
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,707
Nice to meet you.
A little privacy please?

125
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:01,993
- Yeah.
- Please, have a seat.

126
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:10,194
Well, I didn't mean
to bother you or anything...

127
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:13,587
...but I just wanna see if there's
any updates, you know, intel...

128
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,235
...on my son's case.

129
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:18,156
- As I explained to your wife...
- You mean my ex-wife.

130
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,351
Ex-wife.

131
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:22,952
- The chances of finding
your son's killer are slim to none.

132
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:25,346
He was one of ours,
we don't take that lightly...

133
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,871
...but it looks like
it was a random gang shooting.

134
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:32,712
It's kind of disappointing to see
that kind of confidence...

135
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,628
...from my son's own team,
you know?

136
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:37,515
I understand. Unfortunately,
the numbers worked against us.

137
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,394
Last year,
we had 487 homicides...

138
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,547
...almost half of which
were gang related.

139
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:44,310
Good news is, that's down 6 percent
from the year before.

140
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:47,673
Does that mean you have
no evidence whatsoever?

141
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,827
He was found in the street
next to his car.

142
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:51,595
A random shooting.

143
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,826
Killer probably never
stepped out of the car.

144
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,669
All we do have is the bullet,
which we recovered from him.

145
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:59,066
- What calibre was that?
- Forty.

146
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:02,190
Mr. Ballister, he was
a well-respected officer.

147
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:03,835
We were all very fond of him.

148
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:08,390
Listen, would you mind if I give you
a call now and again?

149
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:10,626
Not at all. Here's my card.

150
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,432
Did you ever get the chance
to meet my son?

151
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,029
No, wish I had.

152
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:17,948
Unfortunately,
our paths never crossed.

153
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,834
He work ed Vice,
out of headquarters.

154
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:22,385
I've been assigned here
since I pinned on a badge.

155
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:23,909
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

156
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:26,590
Thank you.
Pleasure meeting you.

157
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,992
Detective Shaw.

158
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,908
Hello?

159
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:06,947
- Holy shit, man.
- What's up, man?

160
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,549
What's up, man?

161
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:10,593
I came here looking for you.
That's it.

162
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:11,950
- For me?
- Yeah.

163
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:14,391
I ain't trying to rob no one, man.
Come on, man.

164
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,469
For real, man. I heard you was asking
questions, man. That's about it, man.

165
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:21,355
Come here.

166
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:24,076
Sit down. Sit down.

167
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,229
Man.

168
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:29,830
So, what's your name?

169
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:32,666
Gary, man. Gary Morrison.

170
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:34,030
What are you doing here?

171
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,266
I just came here to ask you
a couple questions.

172
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:40,473
I heard you was asking about Max.
Max Ballister.

173
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:42,430
Did you know my son?

174
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:47,746
I mean, I ran numbers,
Max, he worked Vice, so...

175
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,749
You know, times came,
I helped him out with a couple tips...

176
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,669
...on a few local joints in the area,
and things like that.

177
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:55,588
I got you. So you're a snitch.

178
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:59,225
Man, that's a rude term, man.
I was a CI, all right?

179
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:01,114
I was a confidential informant.

180
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:03,426
In other words, you're a snitch.

181
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,344
You a cop too?

182
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:07,750
Not exactly.

183
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,866
You Simon.

184
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:14,991
See, Max... Yeah, man.
Max, he mentioned you couple times.

185
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,511
Hey, look, man,
I don't know you that well, man...

186
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:20,793
...but the East Side Gangsters,
they run this neighbourhood.

187
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,948
- Is that right?
- I mean, you stick around, like:

188
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,471
Like, they'll probably kill you.

189
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:28,547
Before all them bad things
happen to me...

190
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,468
...maybe you could tell me
where they are.

191
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:36,392
They stay over in the projects
on Florence.

192
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,549
- On Florence?
- It's a closed construction site now...

193
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,308
...but that's where Max was shot.

194
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:46,188
Like I said, it ain't a good idea for you
to go nowhere near there.

195
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,666
I really don't care
what their business is.

196
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,669
I just want the motherfucker
that killed my son.

197
00:17:52,836 --> 00:17:54,189
I understand, man.

198
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,711
Like I said, Max,
he was a good guy, man.

199
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:02,232
I mean... I don't know,
I gots to go, man.

200
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:13,352
Hey, man, look,
I'm sorry about Max, man.

201
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:16,393
Yeah, me too.

202
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,509
So, what are you thinking?

203
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,190
- It's Gary.
- Gary doesn't have the balls.

204
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:35,991
Think about it. Now, his brother lsaiah
is trying to work his way up.

205
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,953
Killing Max could have been
his ticket.

206
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:41,392
- Let's take him down, then.
- Timing's not right.

207
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:44,070
We'll take him down
when we take down Armand.

208
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,624
Knock, knock, nigga.

209
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,426
What the fuck's your bitch ass
doing off in here?

210
00:19:58,316 --> 00:19:59,829
Looks like your luck just ran out.

211
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,635
You know what, man?
Luck is a funny motherfucking thing.

212
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,195
Oh, why's that?

213
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:07,712
Luck can change in the blink
of a motherfucking eye.

214
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,432
You're a badass white boy, huh?

215
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:34,230
Think you bad, huh?

216
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:40,309
Come on, motherfucker. You...

217
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:02,391
Motherfucker, you wanna tell me
who killed my son?

218
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,070
Man, I don't know shit.

219
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:05,874
You don't know shit, huh?

220
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:08,630
- Who killed my son?
- Nigga, fuck you.

221
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,468
I'm gonna be doing
the fucking now.

222
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,309
- Man, fuck y'all.
- What'd you say?

223
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:15,433
Fuck you. I don't know shit.

224
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,312
Shit! Man, in my fucking ear.

225
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:26,154
- Fuck. I'm gonna smoke your ass.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

226
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:29,035
Hey, all right, look.
L'll get you some knowledge, all right?

227
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:31,869
- Shot my fucking ear off.
- Who killed my son?

228
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:35,870
- It wasn't who you think it is, all right?
- It ain't who I think? What's that mean?

229
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,425
- Nigga, it wasn't us.
- Shit. You motherfucker...

230
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,429
...l'm gonna get your ass.
Bitch, you're dead, bitch.

231
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:44,030
I got nothing but time for you.
Don't forget that.

232
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:45,834
You shot my fucking ear.

233
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,827
Oh, fuck.

234
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:51,591
I'm gonna get your fucking ass.
Oh, shit.

235
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:53,995
Benny, what's your problem?

236
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:57,034
Armand, why are we playing
these games?

237
00:21:57,756 --> 00:22:00,224
Well, Benny, I like games.

238
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:01,949
I've got a game we can play.

239
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,795
It's got one question:
Why are you a snitch?

240
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:10,514
- No, I'm not a snitch.
- That ain't what I heard.

241
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:13,986
You should be working for CNN
the way you put my business out.

242
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:16,954
Armand, look at what I gave you.

243
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,913
There's a major deal
going down...

244
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:23,035
...and I risked my life to bring you
this information because I respect you.

245
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,507
Because I wanna do business
with you.

246
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,512
I wanna do business
with you too, Benny.

247
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:32,349
- Let me cut this cheque for you.
- Thank you.

248
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:40,469
You should know
nigga's cheque's gonna bounce.

249
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,589
What the fuck are you doing?

250
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:49,192
Oh, my bad.
I didn't like the way he smelled.

251
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,144
All right, look.

252
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:56,070
I've got most of the information
on the deal he was brokering.

253
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,114
- L'll keep you informed.
- Oh, the fuck you will.

254
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:02,109
You let me know when and where,
me and my boys will be there.

255
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:05,313
Like I said,
I will keep you informed.

256
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:08,388
What the hell
happened to you two?

257
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:12,030
Man, some big-ass white boy
jumped us.

258
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:13,265
A white boy.

259
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:16,072
- What?
- Nigga, are you deaf?

260
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:18,625
Yeah, man. That nigga is.

261
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:21,356
Look, some big-ass white boy...

262
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:25,191
...as in Paul Bunyan motherfucker,
came out of nowhere up in the spot...

263
00:23:25,356 --> 00:23:28,075
...did some kung fu shit
on my little homey and me...

264
00:23:28,236 --> 00:23:30,306
...grabbed that nigga's gun
and shot his ear.

265
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,068
- Nigga, please.
- What?

266
00:23:32,796 --> 00:23:34,275
Hey, take it easy, all right?

267
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,347
Just put the gun down. Relax.

268
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,714
Where's Maurice and Anthony?

269
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,754
Man, them niggas gone, man.
He smoked both them fools.

270
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:45,505
- One dude?
- Yeah.

271
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,746
One dude smoked
two of my motherfuckers?

272
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,510
What are y'all, bitches?
Do I have to buy y'all dresses?

273
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:53,110
You niggas want miniskirts, tutus?

274
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:56,791
Dip your motherfucking ass in olive oil
and put you in roller skates, bitch?

275
00:23:56,956 --> 00:24:00,232
Dude said his name
was like Ballister...

276
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:03,468
...or Bollister or some shit...
- Ballister did this to you?

277
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:05,831
Yeah, that's that nigga, right.
Yeah, Ballister.

278
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:07,748
Fuck. The guy
I was telling you about.

279
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,589
You knew this motherfucker
was gonna do shit like this?

280
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:13,589
I got a lot of money
on this deal, partner.

281
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:16,509
Ain't got time for this bullshit.

282
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:19,907
- Clean that motherfucker up.
- Come on, man.

283
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:24,792
Yeah, I can see
what you're thinking, Benny.

284
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:26,674
You had deceit on your mind.

285
00:24:26,836 --> 00:24:29,794
Think you're gonna take
a brother down?

286
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:32,234
Remember Scarface,
motherfucker?

287
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:36,476
"Look at you now.
Look at you now, you fuck."

288
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:40,626
So it must feel good
to be able to put to use...

289
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:42,787
...those lessons
you learned in the military.

290
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:45,675
Yeah, well, I really wasn't
in the military.

291
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:47,429
You're not a salesman, Simon.

292
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:50,747
And you're not a cop. And someone
taught you how to fight like that.

293
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:54,591
No, no, no. All the fighting stuff,
I got that off home videos.

294
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,314
Whatever.

295
00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:00,070
- Listen, could I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

296
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:03,034
Those bangers that were here,
what gang are they with?

297
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:06,150
Hyde Park.
They're Chivo's boys.

298
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,546
Chivo had something to do
with your son's murder?

299
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,149
L'll let you know.

300
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:16,032
- Hello.
- Hello, this is Simon.

301
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:18,906
Simon? Yeah...

302
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:23,308
Yeah, Max spoke very fondly
about you.

303
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,669
I saw you at the funeral.

304
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:29,986
I wanted to come over
and pay my condolences...

305
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:32,954
...but I just wasn't quite
in the mood, sorry.

306
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,235
I understand.

307
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:38,194
I wanted to see if the police
had been by to interview you...

308
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:42,144
...and whether or not they returned
any of Max's property, or...

309
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:45,429
They were more interested
in any files or paperwork...

310
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,234
...that he might have
brought home.

311
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:53,154
Did Max have anything
on a computer, by any chance?

312
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:55,905
Yeah, but the police took it.

313
00:25:57,196 --> 00:26:00,233
Well, listen,
I just want you to know one thing.

314
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:01,988
I will find who did this to my son.

315
00:26:02,156 --> 00:26:06,115
And if you need anything,
you call me, you hear?

316
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:08,672
All right, babe.

317
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,905
- Shoot it.
- Defence.

318
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:14,670
Come on, man,
Don't let them score again.

319
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:17,509
Man.

320
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,951
Pass the ball, man.

321
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:23,313
Make some shots, I could dish it
to you. You playing with no D on it.

322
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:27,271
They done got three points, man.
It's 9-7. You wanna win this or what?

323
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,825
- You crazy?
- We need to talk.

324
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,827
Look around you, fool.
You see all those eyes on us?

325
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,589
Any of them see me get in that car,
I'm dead. You feel me?

326
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:46,307
Well, look, l'll just pretend like
I'm a policeman. You know?

327
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:48,273
You ain't no cop,
that's for sure, man.

328
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:50,745
Heard what happened
to them boys.

329
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,794
News in the 'hood travels fast,
don't it, now?

330
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:55,548
Look, man, I need your help.

331
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:58,430
- What's up, partner?
- It's good, homes.

332
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:00,070
What kind of help?

333
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:02,466
I need you to help me find
who killed my son.

334
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:06,951
Ain't no way nobody ever gonna find
his killer, man, that's for damn sure.

335
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:09,028
You have to tell me what you know.

336
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:15,586
What you gonna do
if you find the shooter, huh?

337
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:17,794
I'm gonna kill him.

338
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:23,429
I don't care who ordered the hit.

339
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:27,309
I don't care
whose business is what.

340
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:29,990
I just wanna know
who killed my son.

341
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:39,907
It's not looking good for me, man.

342
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,191
Get in the car.

343
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,674
All right, showtime.
What do you know?

344
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:05,671
Man, look, man, there's this Mexican
called El Chivo, all right?

345
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,474
- The goat?
- Yeah.

346
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:10,196
He runs the Hyde Park Gang.

347
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:12,354
Them motherfuckers there.

348
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:15,155
You think this guy
might have pulled the trigger?

349
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:18,434
Maybe.

350
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,315
I mean, maybe he had
somebody pull a drive-by.

351
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:26,948
Well, like I said, I don't really care
about who ordered it or anything.

352
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:28,231
I just want the shooter.

353
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,384
Well, if it came from Chivo,
he would know who did it.

354
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:34,395
You have any idea
why he might want my son dead?

355
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:40,951
Max, man... Look, he hit
them bookie joints hard, man.

356
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:43,835
Chivo, he runs most of them.
You know how it is, man.

357
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:46,794
You start fucking with a man's money,
you could end up dead.

358
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:50,708
Where can I find this guy?

359
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:56,226
He got a club on Slauson
called Anodyne, all right?

360
00:28:56,396 --> 00:28:58,114
He's there most nights.

361
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,272
All right, you did good, man.

362
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:03,711
L'll see you soon, you hear?
Thank you.

363
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:06,948
Yeah, man. Right.

364
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:09,831
Hey, Gary.

365
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,025
This yours?

366
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:18,154
What the fuck is he doing?

367
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:21,668
Don't worry about it, dude.
Look like he talking to some cop.

368
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:25,351
Talking to a cop?
Man, you better check this, man.

369
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,825
Dude, that's my little brother,
all right?

370
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:29,395
L'll handle that shit.

371
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:30,955
All right.

372
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,471
Don't fucking worry about it,
all right?

373
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:45,550
Hey, lsaiah, what up, man?

374
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:48,071
- The fuck was that about?
- Nothing.

375
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,474
Don't fucking lie to me.
Who is he?

376
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,595
- That cop's old man.
- You tell him anything?

377
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:55,908
Just where to find Chivo
and them.

378
00:29:57,516 --> 00:29:59,427
You believe this shit, yo?

379
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,712
Man, does a chicken have lips?

380
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,275
- Shut up.
- Like I give a fuck.

381
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,825
- Come on, man.
- All right, yo. Listen.

382
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:07,987
You stay the fuck away from him,
feel me?

383
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:10,431
- He came looking for me.
- I don't give a fuck.

384
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:13,952
If I see you with him again,
I'm gonna whup your ass, all right?

385
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:16,275
- All right?
- All right, man.

386
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:19,348
- Yo, tell Moms I won't be home tonight.
- Where you gonna be?

387
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,746
- Don't worry about it, just tell her.
- Fine.

388
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,952
- I'm out, yo.
- All right.

389
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:55,428
Excuse me, sir.
Could I talk to you?

390
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:57,746
Why don't you get out of here?

391
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:01,306
You know, I wanna see Chivo.

392
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:04,149
You know, the problem is,
this is a private club...

393
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:05,954
...and your name's
not on the list.

394
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,710
So why don't you
just get the fuck out of here?

395
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:11,595
You look like a smart guy.
L'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

396
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:14,554
L'll give you 5 bucks
if you could let me in.

397
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:16,710
How's that?

398
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,594
- L'll tell you what, tough guy.
- What?

399
00:31:18,756 --> 00:31:21,475
Lf you can make it back down,
you and me, we've got a date.

400
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:23,672
- All right.
- Why don't you go on in?

401
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:37,955
Hey, man, private club.

402
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:52,386
- Who the fuck...?
- Hey, hey.

403
00:32:02,476 --> 00:32:05,832
I'm Simon Ballister, Max's father.

404
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,872
Sorry to hear about your son.

405
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:13,106
I wanted to talk to you
for a minute, if I could.

406
00:32:14,276 --> 00:32:16,631
Girls, I have to say,
I've found something...

407
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,514
...more important
than you right now.

408
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:20,632
L'll be back.

409
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:27,672
So you're the crazy vato that's been
beating the shit out of all my guys.

410
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:30,270
Well, I've been trying
to get some answers, you know?

411
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:33,667
Yeah. Kind of becoming a habit
with you, ain't it?

412
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:35,747
I hope not.

413
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:44,032
Some folks say you might know
something about who killed my son.

414
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,675
Now, let me take a guess.

415
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:48,555
You heard that from some
myopic gangbangers, right?

416
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:49,785
That's right.

417
00:32:50,796 --> 00:32:52,548
I thought so.

418
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:55,594
Why would I wanna kill Max?
He was a good cop.

419
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:59,431
We were a lot alike,
both pillars of the community.

420
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:02,987
We both helped our people
our own way.

421
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:08,266
Well, you know, seems like maybe
he took down a few of your joints.

422
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:09,915
So what? This is the barrio.

423
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:12,988
Takes down one of my joints today,
it's back up tomorrow.

424
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:17,149
And besides, we all know
what kind of heat a dead cop brings.

425
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:21,350
No. You ever heard of a gang
called the East Side Gangsters?

426
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:24,833
Heard it came from them.

427
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:28,552
It sounds like maybe you're asking me
to take out your competition.

428
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,866
I am.

429
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:37,825
East Side Gangsters been trying
to cut into my territory for years.

430
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:40,385
Especially that Armand Tucker.

431
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:43,190
Yeah, I want you
to take them down...

432
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:46,832
...but that doesn't mean
what I'm telling you isn't true.

433
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:49,305
I liked your son.

434
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:55,072
I swear on my dead mother's grave,
they did it.

435
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:06,385
You know, I look at you...

436
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:09,275
...I see a man like me.

437
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:13,915
A bad man with good intentions.

438
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:15,429
I believe you.

439
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:20,353
Mami, tequila.

440
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:28,147
- Anything else?
- Later.

441
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:42,468
Here's to my son, and finding
the motherfucker who killed him.

442
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,667
Tough guy.

443
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:49,350
See, the problem is...

444
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:52,394
- Excuse me. I really need to talk...
- Get the fuck out of here.

445
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,116
Doing that to my homeboy,
the problem is, I ain't him...

446
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,594
You mean motherfucker.

447
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:01,111
I don't like it when you pick on
the little people.

448
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:02,834
- Oh, man.
- Come here.

449
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:04,395
- Oh, man.
- Come on.

450
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:05,830
Oh, God, no.

451
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:07,429
- Thank you.
- You busted my hand.

452
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,075
Thanks so much.

453
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:11,591
- Bottle of tequila, keep yourself warm.
- Thank you.

454
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:13,747
- My name's J.D.
- Sandwich. Nice to meet you.

455
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,429
- Thank you, man.
- All right.

456
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:17,509
- Y'all be good.
- I know it, man.

457
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:20,634
- Come back and see me sometime.
- I will.

458
00:35:24,316 --> 00:35:25,544
Yeah, I think we got him.

459
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:29,504
I want a 24-hour tail on him
from now on.

460
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:35,112
Simon, I just wanted you to know,
for whatever it's worth...

461
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:39,986
...that I really respect you for how
you've handled this whole situation.

462
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:42,626
You and Max
must have been really close.

463
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:48,468
You know, when time passes on,
you kind of get to thinking a little bit.

464
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:54,589
Seems like
every day that goes by...

465
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,792
...you kind of can't get used
to the fact...

466
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,868
...that somebody
that close to you is gone.

467
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:05,665
You always think,
"Hey, man, I gotta call my son"...

468
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:07,633
...or, "I'm going to see him soon."

469
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,707
And then you
kind of remember...

470
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,505
...the unthinkable
has actually happened.

471
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:16,793
Aim. Fire.

472
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:37,109
There's really
no greater sorrow...

473
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:42,031
...than when a man's own child
passes before he does.

474
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,230
And I do have regrets,
because when he was a child...

475
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:52,469
...I really didn't spend
much time with him.

476
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,147
But when he got older...

477
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,035
...I really kind of feel like
I got to make it up.

478
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:22,114
You could be away from somebody
for 10 years...

479
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:26,349
...knock on the door, walk through
that door, and it's like you never left.

480
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:28,867
That's close...

481
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:33,035
...and that's how he and I were,
you know?

482
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:35,232
That close.

483
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:46,275
That's him right there, yo.

484
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:49,269
Why the fuck does Armand
want this nigga dead anyway?

485
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,553
Doesn't matter.
Let's smoke this fool.

486
00:37:52,716 --> 00:37:54,752
We do this and we in.

487
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:57,669
Bread, bitches and cocaine.

488
00:37:57,836 --> 00:38:00,953
- You need to stop that snorting shit.
- Man, nigga, fuck you.

489
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:03,914
- Let's smoke this fool.
- Don't fuck up my car, hell.

490
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:14,748
Say good night, motherfucker.

491
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:21,347
Goddamn,
I can't believe you missed.

492
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:24,826
- Back this motherfucker up. Let's go.
- Goddamn, motherfucker. God, shit.

493
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,113
- Motherfucker.
- We gotta get out of L.A.

494
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,154
I'm going. If you didn't have
a motherfucking slow-ass hearse...

495
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:45,705
You keep talking about my car,
you gonna catch a bus.

496
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,025
Here. Look, we here.

497
00:38:54,196 --> 00:38:55,265
Come on.

498
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:58,428
Get the tyre, something. Shit.

499
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:02,150
Fuck!

500
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,348
Look at your dumb ass
missing and shit.

501
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:10,428
- Come on, come on.
- All right, I'm gonna get you closer.

502
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:19,111
- Shoot the tyres out.
- Drive my motherfucking car.

503
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:21,471
Just shoot the motherfucking
tyres out this time.

504
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:23,467
Watch me.

505
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,271
Jack it up, bitch! Jack it up.

506
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:37,632
Come on, come on.
Buck again, buck again.

507
00:39:37,796 --> 00:39:39,548
Unload on his ass.

508
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:44,585
What the fuck?
Nice driving, motherfucker.

509
00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:47,190
It ain't me. This motherfucker
is all over the road.

510
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:48,994
How the fuck
is it the car's fault?

511
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:52,549
- How come it ain't you?
- Fuck.

512
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:57,346
- God, where the fuck is he going?
- Just drive my motherfucking car.

513
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,834
Yeah.

514
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:09,155
I can't see shit.

515
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:15,273
- I see him.
- Goddamn. Fuck.

516
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:23,594
I swear, if something fall out
from under this, it's your ass.

517
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,906
Hang on, hang on.

518
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:30,310
L'll show you
how to smoke this, motherfucker.

519
00:40:37,956 --> 00:40:41,266
Here we go, we got his ass now.
We got him now. Yeah, right here.

520
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:42,630
- Come on. Come on.
- Shit.

521
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:04,066
- This motherfucker's slippery as hell.
- Closer.

522
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:05,908
All right,
I'm gonna get you closer.

523
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:26,227
- Come on.
- You got him. You got him.

524
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:30,467
Come on up.

525
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:38,627
What the fuck?

526
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:44,356
- This motherfucker is crazy as hell.
- Ram his ass.

527
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:50,150
Go!

528
00:41:50,796 --> 00:41:52,707
What the fuck? Oh, shit.

529
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:28,351
Who sent you?

530
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:30,791
Fuck you.

531
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,314
Fuck.

532
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:38,514
That's the wrong answer.

533
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:41,668
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Who sent you?

534
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:43,984
Armand, man.

535
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,073
Father killed.
Brother, Isaiah Morrison.

536
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:43,192
Mother, Carla Morrison.

537
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:49,907
Isaiah, mostly misdemeanours,
no felonies.

538
00:44:50,076 --> 00:44:52,465
Suspicion of burglary,
suspicion of armed robbery...

539
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:54,945
...suspicion of destruction
of property.

540
00:44:55,116 --> 00:44:57,835
Known gang affiliations,
East Side Gangsters.

541
00:44:59,716 --> 00:45:03,026
East Side Gangsters, suspected
in over 30 killings in the past year.

542
00:45:03,196 --> 00:45:05,505
Rack eteering,
drug running, murder.

543
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:11,547
Armand Tuck er, no convictions.

544
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,305
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Simon Ballister.

545
00:45:19,036 --> 00:45:20,230
- Hi.
- What do you want?

546
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:22,466
Listen, I need
that package right away.

547
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,910
All right, where are you?

548
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:28,592
Lt's 1001 North Central.

549
00:45:28,756 --> 00:45:30,716
- L.A.?
- That's right.

550
00:45:30,716 --> 00:45:33,913
You know, the only part they didn't
have in Scarface was him fucking.

551
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:36,033
Tweedledee and Tweedle-dumbass,
you don't know...

552
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:39,427
- Hold on, man. Hold on.
- "Say hello to my little friend."

553
00:45:40,076 --> 00:45:42,465
You understand me?
He'd just hold a gun to the bitch.

554
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:44,228
- Be like, nigga, suck it.
- Armand?

555
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:46,785
Let y'all snort some cocaine
off this motherfucker.

556
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:49,516
- Excuse me, boss?
- Motherfucker!

557
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:51,507
Can't you see
I'm doing something?

558
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:54,315
- Excuse me, boss...
- Why the fuck you gonna interrupt me?

559
00:45:54,476 --> 00:45:56,865
- Sorry, boss.
- You females go on and go upstairs...

560
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:59,266
- Reggie B. And lsaiah...
- Nigga, hold the fuck up.

561
00:45:59,436 --> 00:46:02,508
- All right, all right.
- You ladies go back to the room...

562
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,110
...get it cracking without me,
you understand me?

563
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:06,629
L'll be in in a minute.

564
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:10,709
And feel free
to try them little things out.

565
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:13,709
You know what I'm saying?
I got some toys back there.

566
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:15,104
Yeah, it's Christmas.

567
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,306
- You like that, huh?
- Hell, yeah.

568
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:28,548
You could have that on the regular
if you handle your business.

569
00:46:28,716 --> 00:46:30,354
I'm disappointed in both of y'all.

570
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:32,154
Especially you, lsaiah.

571
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:34,546
You hold your bitch ass up
right there, partner.

572
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:37,594
Take that motherfucking rag off
around your bitch-ass neck.

573
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:40,224
You ain't repping shit.

574
00:46:43,516 --> 00:46:44,710
Look at the ground.

575
00:46:44,876 --> 00:46:47,754
Look at the floor.
Don't even look at me, nigga.

576
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:52,314
Boy, I put trust in you.
I put trust in you, boy.

577
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,946
I put trust in you,
but you wanna fuck up.

578
00:46:57,476 --> 00:47:00,991
You know I don't ask people
for many things, man.

579
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:05,944
Most of what I accomplish,
I accomplish myself.

580
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:08,550
Everything I accomplish,
I accomplish my damn self...

581
00:47:08,716 --> 00:47:11,105
...because I ain't gonna never
snitch on me, nigga.

582
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:13,346
I asked you to do this
to prove yourself...

583
00:47:13,516 --> 00:47:15,074
...and you drop the ball, coz.

584
00:47:15,236 --> 00:47:17,670
- Yo, man, this Simon...
- Silence, nigga.

585
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:20,706
Look, I know
this motherfucker tough.

586
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:24,152
That's why I gave you this assignment.
It's a chance to prove yourself.

587
00:47:24,316 --> 00:47:26,910
Now, if you prove yourself,
we got a thing called trust.

588
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:29,385
Trust go a long way
in this organisation.

589
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,114
You understand me?

590
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,474
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

591
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:37,026
Good, because
if you don't do this correctly, partner...

592
00:47:37,196 --> 00:47:39,790
...we ain't friends.
Matter of fact, we enemies.

593
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:41,674
You, your family, your mama...

594
00:47:41,836 --> 00:47:44,589
...that pregnant bitch
you got around the corner, nigga.

595
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,713
Yeah. You wanna see
that child, nigga?

596
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:49,595
Because I don't give a fuck
about the little motherfucker.

597
00:47:50,196 --> 00:47:52,551
Why don't you do yourself
a motherfucking favour...

598
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:54,627
...and go kill that son of a bitch?

599
00:47:57,596 --> 00:47:59,188
Keep your head up, coz.

600
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:02,866
And this time, make sure
he lay down and stay there.

601
00:48:04,996 --> 00:48:07,794
They don't make niggas
like they used to.

602
00:48:07,956 --> 00:48:11,346
These little motherfuckers running
around here, krump dancing and shit.

603
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:12,790
One motherfucking white boy.

604
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,471
How the fuck my whole motherfucking
clique bruised the fuck up?

605
00:48:16,636 --> 00:48:19,867
What kind of steroids this
motherfucker on? This is my shit here.

606
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:23,346
He wanna run his little white ass
around here like he renegade.

607
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:26,474
Matter of fact... Hey, you bitches,
get your ass up out of here.

608
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:30,311
Your skeleton-ass, motherfucking
drug-addict ho's snorting up my shit.

609
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:32,910
The fuck
out of my goddamn house.

610
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,352
Kill the bitch in a week,
goddamn it.

611
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:58,274
- Morning.
- Morning.

612
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,791
Special delivery
for Simon Ballister.

613
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:02,867
- Upstairs, apartment A.
- Great. Thank you.

614
00:49:03,036 --> 00:49:04,788
No problem.

615
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:09,666
You ain't gonna score again,
I'm telling you.

616
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:12,350
You ain't gonna score.
I ain't gonna let you.

617
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,995
I ain't gonna let you.

618
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:16,954
Can't let you score.
Can't let you score.

619
00:49:19,596 --> 00:49:21,473
Finally got the ball.
You can't guard me.

620
00:49:21,636 --> 00:49:23,354
I'm about to pop
that shit right here.

621
00:49:23,516 --> 00:49:26,474
You don't even know
when I'm coming, do you? Do you?

622
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:29,588
Patience, baby.

623
00:49:29,756 --> 00:49:32,031
Yo, I quit, man.
You're good, y'all. L'll get out.

624
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:35,906
I'm tired. You be playing
too much defence.

625
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:38,506
Play lsaiah.

626
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:41,715
Bet he won't be
doing all that then.

627
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:46,313
Good game, though.
Good game.

628
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:52,231
Take care.

629
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:06,791
Why?

630
00:50:11,596 --> 00:50:13,154
Check out the guy over here.

631
00:50:13,316 --> 00:50:14,795
Got the Lone Ranger over here.

632
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:17,907
Shit.

633
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:21,505
Let's go, guys.
Let's have a little fun. Let's go.

634
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:38,793
- Take cover.
- Run, nigger, run, boy. Run.

635
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:40,548
Come on.

636
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:51,549
Run his fucking ass down.
Come on.

637
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,035
You're going nowhere.

638
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:56,307
Get him. Get him.

639
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:00,149
Shit.

640
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,795
Yeah. Yeah.

641
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:09,188
Hey, hey.
Where you going, nigger?

642
00:51:10,596 --> 00:51:11,790
Alone in the 'hood?

643
00:51:11,956 --> 00:51:15,266
Maybe me and my boys will give you
a little bit of hospitality, huh?

644
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:17,028
You ain't going nowhere, man.

645
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,708
- He's scared.
- We're gonna have fun.

646
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:23,073
- What you got in your bag, huh?
- We're gonna work you over real good.

647
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:24,225
Were you lost?

648
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,305
Keep moving, white boy.

649
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:37,831
You stupid motherfucker.

650
00:51:40,036 --> 00:51:42,709
- Didn't you hear me, white boy?
- Got your back, brother.

651
00:51:42,956 --> 00:51:44,548
Who you calling white boy,
mother...?

652
00:51:45,556 --> 00:51:46,784
Hey.

653
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:02,391
Bad motherfucker.

654
00:52:12,356 --> 00:52:15,746
Gary. Let's go.

655
00:52:18,956 --> 00:52:21,470
Been an accident at Bellevue.
We need an ambulance.

656
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:23,513
Don't make fun of my ride.
It's a rental.

657
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:26,065
Damn. Hope you got insurance.

658
00:52:36,716 --> 00:52:38,547
Man, that was some crazy shit.

659
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:41,150
Where the fuck
you learn that shit, man?

660
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:44,592
Yo, I bet he never had
an ass-whupping like that before. Shit.

661
00:52:44,756 --> 00:52:47,589
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything, man.

662
00:52:48,116 --> 00:52:49,674
Why'd you lie to me
about Chivo?

663
00:52:50,956 --> 00:52:53,914
- What you talking about?
- See, I think you're trying to play me.

664
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:56,544
Look, fool,
I ain't never said he did it, man.

665
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,707
I told you what the word
on the street was.

666
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:01,026
Chivo didn't have nothing
to do with Max.

667
00:53:01,476 --> 00:53:04,707
- What, you asked him or something?
- That's right, I asked him.

668
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:06,946
He told you
he ain't have shit to do with it?

669
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:08,834
That's right.

670
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,426
- And you knew he wasn't lying?
- That's right.

671
00:53:11,596 --> 00:53:12,790
- But I am?
- That's right.

672
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,594
Man, fuck you, man.
I'm leaving, man.

673
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:17,828
Would you like me to stop the car
so you don't land on your head?

674
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,432
Shit.

675
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:22,824
How's your brother?

676
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,947
Did he have a little accident
last night?

677
00:53:27,876 --> 00:53:29,832
Man, how the fuck
you know about that, man?

678
00:53:30,036 --> 00:53:34,314
Because I caused the accident, see?
He tried to ambush me last night.

679
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:38,953
Brother with the East Side boys?
Ls that it?

680
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:41,311
Who's Armand Tucker?

681
00:53:42,676 --> 00:53:47,192
Hey, did your brother
kill my son?

682
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:55,106
You ain't got nothing to say?

683
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:58,111
All right.

684
00:54:04,876 --> 00:54:06,628
You protecting your brother?

685
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:10,632
I'm leaving, man.

686
00:54:10,796 --> 00:54:12,752
Hey, Gary.

687
00:54:13,596 --> 00:54:16,064
My backpack, man.

688
00:54:40,316 --> 00:54:41,829
Good rocks, it's gonna cost you.

689
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:43,907
- Yo.
- Hey, lsaiah.

690
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,509
Hey, you gonna
pick me up, man?

691
00:54:45,876 --> 00:54:48,344
- Do you got my money?
- You all right? What happened?

692
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:50,313
Man, just some skinheads
tripping, man.

693
00:54:51,116 --> 00:54:53,107
L'll be there
as soon as I can, all right?

694
00:54:53,276 --> 00:54:56,074
Taking care of some business
for Armand.

695
00:54:57,636 --> 00:55:01,106
Yo, man.
Hey, you gotta stop that shit, dog.

696
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:04,985
- What?
- No, no, no. I was talking to Reggie.

697
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:08,592
Stupid-ass motherfucker.
Yo, man, let's go, dog.

698
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:11,316
Look, man, I really need
to speak to you, man, for real.

699
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:12,795
I got some shit to run by you.

700
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:15,914
Hey, I'm on my way,
all right? One.

701
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:52,389
You and your brother head back,
k eep an eye on my place.

702
00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:55,468
Everybody else, remember,
this is for big bucks, no fuckups.

703
00:55:55,636 --> 00:55:57,706
All right, gentlemen, here we go.

704
00:56:49,116 --> 00:56:50,788
Keep your voice down.

705
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:54,115
Gentlemen, take it up front.

706
00:56:56,236 --> 00:56:57,589
You got my goods, huh?

707
00:56:57,756 --> 00:56:59,269
Lt's all there.

708
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:05,790
Two hundred birds, baby.

709
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:15,111
All right.

710
00:57:15,276 --> 00:57:16,550
- You counted it?
- Yeah.

711
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:19,105
- You say it's good?
- We got the car.

712
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,625
- Where's the money at?
- What's up? Right here, baby.

713
00:57:22,796 --> 00:57:24,388
We should rush
these motherfuckers.

714
00:57:24,556 --> 00:57:27,434
The deal was you do
what I say, remember?

715
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:31,066
Don't double-cross me. I'm the one
that put you on to these fools.

716
00:57:31,236 --> 00:57:33,033
Just sit back and watch.

717
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:35,266
Who knows,
you might just learn something.

718
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:38,155
Handle your business, partner.

719
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:41,426
- It's all there.
- Looking kind of light though.

720
00:57:41,596 --> 00:57:43,871
- It's all there.
- Count the stuff. It's all there.

721
00:57:44,036 --> 00:57:45,992
Let's make it happen.

722
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:49,355
If you don't believe it,
just count. Count the cash.

723
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,389
Yeah, it is.

724
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:55,909
Money's yours.

725
00:57:56,076 --> 00:57:57,634
- Shred them.
- Look at the bottom.

726
00:57:57,796 --> 00:57:59,548
We good, man. We good.

727
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,631
- Dope is ours, money is ours.
- Take the shot.

728
00:58:02,796 --> 00:58:04,149
- Let's do it.
- Yes, brother.

729
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:09,792
Motherfucker set us up.

730
00:58:37,956 --> 00:58:39,594
Well?

731
00:58:39,756 --> 00:58:41,428
Nice classroom.

732
00:58:41,596 --> 00:58:44,668
- Rasheed, get the car.
- Let's go.

733
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:55,110
Nice shot, pal. Bring it on down.

734
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:09,311
Where are we?

735
00:59:10,276 --> 00:59:13,188
Lt's all here. What do you got?

736
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:16,189
- Looks like about 200 keys.
- About 3 million cash.

737
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:17,755
Take them wheels right there.

738
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:19,747
You two load up in that one.
Follow me.

739
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:22,955
- Get in, gentlemen.
- Let's go.

740
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:25,346
Let's move. Now, now, now.

741
00:59:25,516 --> 00:59:27,268
Meet you out front.
Let's go. Move it.

742
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:34,673
Just dump it in. Let's go.

743
01:02:10,796 --> 01:02:13,356
- Merry fucking Christmas.
- Man, fuck Santa Claus.

744
01:02:13,516 --> 01:02:16,030
He never got me shit.
That's why I sell dope.

745
01:02:16,196 --> 01:02:18,756
All right, listen up.
Now, take that yeyo down below.

746
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:22,067
After you done with that,
take this SUV to the chop shop...

747
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:24,955
...put it in pieces and crush it.
- Keep your eyes open.

748
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:30,111
- Can't believe we pulled this shit off.
- You couldn't have done it without us.

749
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:33,190
Now, that money doesn't move
until we broker the dope.

750
01:02:33,356 --> 01:02:36,268
Man, you know what your problem is?
You worry too much.

751
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:39,394
Once we ship this shit east, man,
we all gonna get paid.

752
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,226
All right. I'm posting men outside,
make sure nothing comes or goes.

753
01:02:43,396 --> 01:02:47,309
Good looking out.
Five million in cocaine and cash.

754
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:50,627
Any idea how much we could make
if we step on it two or three times?

755
01:02:50,796 --> 01:02:54,391
- Yeah, I do.
- I'm talking helicopter, Bill Gates.

756
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:57,346
- Helicopter.
- I always wanted one, man.

757
01:02:57,516 --> 01:03:00,030
That way I can get a bird's-eye view
of my territory.

758
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:02,585
I can watch the little soldiers
slanging and banging.

759
01:03:02,756 --> 01:03:06,635
In case a little motherfucker fuck up,
I can come in, Vietnam Rambo style.

760
01:03:06,796 --> 01:03:08,946
You know, right out
the side of that bitch:

761
01:03:09,716 --> 01:03:11,149
Drop, bitch!

762
01:03:11,316 --> 01:03:14,467
- Yeah. You've been to Nam?
- Been to Nam? You been to Compton?

763
01:03:14,636 --> 01:03:18,231
Vietnam ain't got shit
on the motherfucker CPT, coz.

764
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,875
Ballister is making you look bad.
What's it gonna take?

765
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:32,312
Plastic surgery. Don't worry.
We got a special delivery for his ass.

766
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,432
Yeah, you better.

767
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:29,986
It's that nigga right there.
Yo, call him.

768
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:33,785
Hey, Armand?
Yeah, he here. Just pulled up.

769
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:37,153
Hey, youngster,
some real shit gonna go on here.

770
01:04:37,316 --> 01:04:38,954
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

771
01:04:39,116 --> 01:04:41,630
- All right?
- All right.

772
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:44,515
There has been so much going on
around here, Simon.

773
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:46,906
You have to give me something.

774
01:04:54,636 --> 01:04:58,151
Yeah, man. Make it happen, man.
Going up there and do this thing.

775
01:04:58,316 --> 01:05:03,026
- Got your ass now, motherfucker.
- Hey, coz.

776
01:05:04,156 --> 01:05:05,908
Get strapped up, baby.

777
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,750
Hey, man,
we gotta make it happen, man.

778
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:11,032
I ain't playing with you.

779
01:05:15,316 --> 01:05:17,989
You know you did
the right thing, right?

780
01:05:18,156 --> 01:05:21,546
- Yes, sir.
- We'll show you how to put work in.

781
01:05:37,756 --> 01:05:40,224
Get over there right now
and get down. We got company.

782
01:06:20,236 --> 01:06:22,625
- Who's out there?
- East Side Gang.

783
01:06:22,796 --> 01:06:26,266
- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
- Follow me and stay low.

784
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:10,674
Get down.

785
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:13,515
Go to the back,
go to the back.

786
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:28,024
Gotta find him.

787
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:30,788
Get up.

788
01:07:41,356 --> 01:07:43,586
Oh, shit, man.

789
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:45,790
Watch out.

790
01:08:41,676 --> 01:08:44,144
Superman.

791
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:46,466
Have some of this kryptonite.

792
01:08:54,356 --> 01:08:56,631
Stay down, stay down. Okay.

793
01:09:01,516 --> 01:09:03,268
Okay, I gotta do this.

794
01:09:04,556 --> 01:09:06,274
Jesus.

795
01:09:06,436 --> 01:09:10,827
You can do this.
Okay, okay, okay.

796
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:15,265
Let that motherfucker
have it, man.

797
01:09:22,196 --> 01:09:23,470
Come on.

798
01:09:27,436 --> 01:09:30,587
You ever had
some crazy nigga, bitch?

799
01:09:31,596 --> 01:09:34,110
Go get the motherfucking car.
Get the car.

800
01:09:38,156 --> 01:09:40,624
You like dim sum, bitch?

801
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:43,754
Well, you can have some,
and that bitch-ass white boy you with.

802
01:09:48,076 --> 01:09:50,465
You and the punk-ass
motherfucker you with.

803
01:09:54,956 --> 01:09:56,469
Get in, get in.

804
01:09:56,636 --> 01:09:59,104
Drive, motherfucker. Drive.

805
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,546
Simon? The cops are coming.

806
01:10:02,716 --> 01:10:05,594
The cops are coming.
No, look at me, Simon.

807
01:10:05,876 --> 01:10:08,185
Stay with me, Simon.

808
01:10:08,356 --> 01:10:09,550
- Wak e up.
- Ready.

809
01:10:09,716 --> 01:10:11,434
- Wak e up, Simon.
- Aim.

810
01:10:11,596 --> 01:10:13,109
Fire. Ready.

811
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:16,951
I swear on my dead mother's grave,
they did it.

812
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,589
Someone murdered Max.

813
01:10:22,076 --> 01:10:25,591
- It wasn't who you think it is, all right?
- Someone shot him in cold blood.

814
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:29,146
The chances of finding
your son's killer are slim to none.

815
01:10:29,316 --> 01:10:30,635
Please...

816
01:10:30,796 --> 01:10:33,594
Wak e up, Simon.
Wak e up, Simon.

817
01:10:33,756 --> 01:10:35,428
Wake up, Simon.

818
01:10:36,476 --> 01:10:38,831
No, Simon, let go.
That's my cousin Winston.

819
01:10:38,996 --> 01:10:41,351
Simon, Simon, stop.
That's my cousin, let him go.

820
01:10:41,516 --> 01:10:44,030
- Damn.
- Sorry, man.

821
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:46,233
You probably
just reopened that wound.

822
01:10:46,396 --> 01:10:47,909
Don't worry, man. I'm all right.

823
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:50,715
He's a nurse
at USC Medical Center.

824
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:53,629
This is what he specializes in,
Simon.

825
01:10:56,876 --> 01:10:59,106
You need to take it easy
on those stitches, dog.

826
01:10:59,316 --> 01:11:01,113
They're gonna hold. It's fine.

827
01:11:01,276 --> 01:11:03,551
I'm gonna have to look
or it's gonna get infected.

828
01:11:03,716 --> 01:11:05,832
I don't have time for that.
I've got to go.

829
01:12:30,316 --> 01:12:33,149
Yo, man, what the fuck
you doing in my house?

830
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:35,873
I'm looking for this.

831
01:12:36,036 --> 01:12:39,028
Oh, lookie here, look what I found.
Does this look familiar?

832
01:12:39,196 --> 01:12:41,630
Gun don't look familiar.
I don't know where you got it.

833
01:12:41,796 --> 01:12:44,674
- What, did you kill my son with this?
- We didn't do that shit.

834
01:12:44,836 --> 01:12:47,191
You been running around
fucking up everybody over this.

835
01:12:47,356 --> 01:12:51,031
- No, man, we didn't do that hit, dog.
- You killed my son with this, didn't you?

836
01:12:51,196 --> 01:12:53,346
And you just fucked up
by dropping your gun.

837
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:56,872
Yeah, smoke that nigga this time.
Don't miss.

838
01:12:57,036 --> 01:13:00,392
You done fucked up
by being a dumb motherfucker too.

839
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:12,034
The fuck? Lsaiah.

840
01:13:12,196 --> 01:13:13,675
- Man, look, man.
- What the fuck?

841
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:15,906
- You play me?
- Fuck, man.

842
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:17,987
What is this?
Go ahead, play me some more.

843
01:13:18,156 --> 01:13:20,875
Man, I didn't even do shit.
I ain't playing you.

844
01:13:21,316 --> 01:13:22,829
Fuck, man. Isaiah.

845
01:13:22,996 --> 01:13:24,714
He fine, he fine. He all right.

846
01:13:25,196 --> 01:13:28,029
Who did my son?
You played me.

847
01:13:28,396 --> 01:13:31,308
You lied to me about Chivo,
you sent me down the wrong road.

848
01:13:31,476 --> 01:13:33,865
- What are you hiding?
- It was that dirty cop, Shaw...

849
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:36,869
...who killed Max, man.

850
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:42,591
When I was...
When I was hanging with lsaiah...

851
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:46,351
...I overheard a conversation
between Shaw and Armand.

852
01:13:46,516 --> 01:13:49,269
They was talking about
how they gonna eliminate Max, man.

853
01:13:49,436 --> 01:13:51,074
Why?

854
01:13:51,236 --> 01:13:55,548
I told you, man.
Max, he was a nice guy.

855
01:13:57,876 --> 01:14:01,425
I tried to warn him, man.
I went there that night.

856
01:14:13,756 --> 01:14:15,667
I was just too late.

857
01:14:18,276 --> 01:14:19,504
Too fucking late.

858
01:14:22,636 --> 01:14:24,388
Fuck, I saw it all happen.

859
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:43,705
Shaw just shot him.
Fucking shot him.

860
01:14:44,076 --> 01:14:48,388
Wiped the gun down,
threw it over a fence.

861
01:14:48,556 --> 01:14:52,708
I hopped that fence, man.
I grabbed the gun, I fucking ran.

862
01:14:52,876 --> 01:14:55,436
I fuck... I ran. I ran.

863
01:14:55,596 --> 01:14:59,555
I ran, man,
until I ain't hear fucking shit.

864
01:14:59,716 --> 01:15:02,230
No siren, nothing.

865
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:07,868
I sure enough wish you would have
told me that a long time ago.

866
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:13,513
I did not come to this town
to get played.

867
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,827
I wanted to come here
and take care of one thing.

868
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:19,352
I'm gonna go see Shaw.

869
01:15:20,356 --> 01:15:24,235
- I hope you're not lying.
- I'm sorry, man.

870
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:27,185
I'm sorry.

871
01:15:27,996 --> 01:15:30,874
They were gonna kill my family!

872
01:15:32,116 --> 01:15:34,471
Fucking family.

873
01:15:44,116 --> 01:15:49,110
This is an H&K G36.
It's a bad machine gun, man.

874
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:55,024
- This is revenge.
- Yeah, that's what it is, revenge.

875
01:15:55,196 --> 01:15:57,346
What the fuck you think it is?

876
01:15:57,756 --> 01:16:00,145
- Why?
- Because they killed my son.

877
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:04,344
- Simon, this is never going to end.
- I don't really give a fuck what they do.

878
01:16:04,516 --> 01:16:06,347
I just know what I'm gonna do.

879
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:12,516
- You're just as bad as they are.
- No, I'm a lot fucking worse.

880
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:10,153
- These guys for real?
- For sure.

881
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:13,872
Say, man,
I don't trust this motherfucker.

882
01:17:14,036 --> 01:17:15,515
You gotta watch them.

883
01:17:15,676 --> 01:17:19,191
These motherfuckers get out of line,
we gonna take them out, all right?

884
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,865
Yeah, it's about that time, nigga.

885
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:30,427
- What's up, coz?
- Armand.

886
01:17:36,036 --> 01:17:37,674
What's up with the white boys?

887
01:17:37,836 --> 01:17:40,873
Hey, man, what can I say?
Affirmative action, you know.

888
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:47,674
I wouldn't touch that
till I see some money.

889
01:17:50,036 --> 01:17:51,833
Come on.

890
01:17:53,956 --> 01:17:55,184
Check that out, Shaw.

891
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,270
Yeah, we're good.

892
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:19,749
Just like I promised.

893
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:26,146
- You playing me, motherfucker?
- Say what, nigga?

894
01:18:26,316 --> 01:18:28,750
Who the fuck
do you think you dealing with?

895
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:31,908
- Nigga, what's your problem?
- What's my problem?

896
01:18:32,076 --> 01:18:35,591
L'll tell you what my problem is.
That's fucking baking soda, bitch.

897
01:18:36,156 --> 01:18:37,669
It is baking soda.

898
01:18:37,836 --> 01:18:41,146
I should have known better than to
deal with low-level West Coast hood.

899
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,109
Fuck the West Coast, nigga.

900
01:18:43,276 --> 01:18:45,665
Get my money
and let's get the fuck out of here.

901
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:54,865
Fuck's going on?

902
01:19:08,636 --> 01:19:10,308
Somebody answer me.
What's going on?

903
01:19:10,476 --> 01:19:13,115
- That motherfucker Ballister.
- Fucking son of a bitch.

904
01:19:13,276 --> 01:19:14,948
Ballister? What does that mean?

905
01:19:15,396 --> 01:19:18,672
Hey, man, why don't you do yourself
and me a favour, all right?

906
01:19:18,836 --> 01:19:20,189
Shut the fuck up.

907
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:25,508
Now, I know my original plan
didn't go as planned...

908
01:19:25,676 --> 01:19:29,351
...but I got a contingency.
- Contingency plan?

909
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:32,235
Bitch, what the fuck
is your contingency plan?

910
01:19:32,396 --> 01:19:34,626
Just let me look over
the paperwork, partner.

911
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:52,386
That's the motherfucking
contingency plan, partner.

912
01:19:52,556 --> 01:19:55,992
- You motherfuckers.
- Yeah, fuck you, bitch.

913
01:19:56,156 --> 01:19:57,635
Look at your whore ass now.

914
01:19:57,796 --> 01:20:00,947
Dressed like a motherfucking
tampon, nigga, what?

915
01:20:01,116 --> 01:20:03,107
That's the problem with you
New York niggas.

916
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:04,948
Running around,
all shiny and shit.

917
01:20:05,116 --> 01:20:09,155
You dressed for the funeral
you about to have, motherfucker.

918
01:20:09,316 --> 01:20:11,830
- You gonna kill me?
- Oh, I think it's obvious, partner.

919
01:20:11,996 --> 01:20:12,985
Look around.

920
01:20:19,556 --> 01:20:22,434
You already fucked up, Armand,
by double-crossing me.

921
01:20:22,596 --> 01:20:26,350
- Don't make this shit any worse.
- Let's see, how could it get worse?

922
01:20:26,516 --> 01:20:29,872
Look like your boys is dead.
Yeah, you dead already.

923
01:20:30,036 --> 01:20:33,392
You kill me, my homeboys
are gonna retaliate.

924
01:20:33,556 --> 01:20:36,548
Believe me, motherfucker,
they won't stop until your ass is dead.

925
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:38,308
How the fuck
a dead motherfucker...

926
01:20:38,476 --> 01:20:41,036
...gonna retaliate,
you stupid son of a bitch?

927
01:20:41,196 --> 01:20:44,825
A dead man can't walk.
You already dead, see?

928
01:20:44,996 --> 01:20:49,228
You got killed by the L.A.P.D.
In a motherfucking shootout.

929
01:20:49,396 --> 01:20:53,469
Process that, nigga. Can your neuron
fire that fast, motherfucker?

930
01:20:53,636 --> 01:20:56,787
Yeah, that's what happened.
L.A.P.D. Shot your bitch ass.

931
01:20:56,956 --> 01:21:00,028
Happens all the time.
Ain't that right, Shaw?

932
01:21:07,476 --> 01:21:09,432
Yeah, that's right.

933
01:21:27,036 --> 01:21:29,345
- I got the stairs. You take the front.
- Got it.

934
01:24:40,556 --> 01:24:42,353
Fuck.

935
01:24:45,276 --> 01:24:47,506
Come on, Ballister.

936
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:51,436
Come on out here, you big fuck.

937
01:24:51,596 --> 01:24:54,156
Let's go. You and me, brother.

938
01:24:56,076 --> 01:24:58,590
I'm talking to you!

939
01:24:59,436 --> 01:25:01,267
Hey!

940
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:04,753
Come on, you stupid fuck,
answer me.

941
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:08,709
Pussy. Come on, baby.

942
01:25:11,836 --> 01:25:13,667
I'm waiting.

943
01:25:14,636 --> 01:25:17,150
You're gonna make me
come to you, huh?

944
01:25:26,556 --> 01:25:29,309
Where are you, sensei?

945
01:25:32,236 --> 01:25:33,305
Obi-Wan.

946
01:26:08,556 --> 01:26:09,784
Fuck.

947
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:33,468
Kill this motherfucker.

948
01:26:33,636 --> 01:26:35,831
Kill him. Kill him.

949
01:26:37,116 --> 01:26:38,310
Kill him.

950
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,754
Kill him.

951
01:26:51,316 --> 01:26:53,193
I gotta hand it to you, partner.

952
01:26:55,196 --> 01:26:58,791
You're quite the father. Come back
and run through the neighbourhood.

953
01:26:58,956 --> 01:27:00,992
Killing up all kind of niggas
and Mexicans.

954
01:27:01,156 --> 01:27:02,714
Just a white boy on a rampage.

955
01:27:04,836 --> 01:27:07,430
But we still got this little dilemma,
now, do we not?

956
01:27:07,836 --> 01:27:10,555
I know you ain't dumb enough
to bring a fist to a gunfight.

957
01:27:11,636 --> 01:27:12,625
I am.

958
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:23,186
You probably think
I'm gonna kill you.

959
01:27:23,956 --> 01:27:27,107
But you know what?
I came here for one thing.

960
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:29,267
And I did what I came here to do.

961
01:27:30,956 --> 01:27:33,424
I got no beef with you.

962
01:27:46,076 --> 01:27:48,146
He's a cool motherfucker.

963
01:27:52,556 --> 01:27:54,865
Now, that shit was gangster.

964
01:27:55,624 --> 01:28:11,379
THE END
