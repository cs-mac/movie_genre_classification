I've been working
with you seven years.

00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,161
Seven years.

4
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,666
I always liked you.

5
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,672
Always looked after you.

6
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,969

Woman #2:
That's the secret?

00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,092
- Woman: Yep.
- Woman #3: Yeah, she's right, Tes.

Everybody knows that already.

23
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,682
Secret number two: fake it.

That's definitely not a secret.

that relate to what we're doing now?

Tes: I'll tell you.

28
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,318
See, most women apply
secret number two to one thing--

29
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,158
sex. The rest of the time
we're too real.

30
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,322
Too real because it's
in our nature to be real,

31
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,583
which ultimately
is a woman's downfall.

32
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,120
But faking it keeps you
living in man's land.

33
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,880
Whoa! Who the fuck
wants to live in man's land?

34
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,757
We're already living in it, guys.

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,385
All right, wait wait, let me
ask you a question then.

36
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,048
Would you be faking it
if you compromise?

37
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,717
'Cause you can't fake
compromise.

38
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,102
You half can.

39
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,389
What the fuck
does that mean?

40
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,105
Compromise is half faking.
'Cause if you weren't compromising half

41
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,521
you would have it all, in which case
you wouldn't be faking.

42
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,736
You would be taking.
For example,

43
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,617
guys compromise when they
leave the toilet seat down.

44
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,870
They do it because
they know they can't win.

45
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,406
And I'm not faking it
'cause I don't pretend not to mind

46
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,122
when they do leave
the toilet seat up-- because I do.

47
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,756
Slow it down. How is that
a compromise on your end?

48
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,212
Yeah, and I thought that
you said we should fake it?

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,049
It's a compromise because I'd fake
other things to get my way.

50
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,259
Or I'd take away the pussy.

What are you even talking about?

53
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,929
I think
you're confusing yourself.

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,099
No no, I think it's just
too complicated for you to understand.

55
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,359
No, it's not at all.

56
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,895
I get what you're saying.
I just don't agree with you.

57
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,235
To me compromising
is not faking.

58
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,490
( Sighs )

59
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,619
Fine. Then we'll just agree
to disagree.

60
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,783
Or we could agree that I'm right
because that's a compromise.

61
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,326
Tell you what:

62
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,463
I'll fake it
and we can agree on that.

63
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,623
Okay.

64
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,714
But you're compromising
to agree on faking it.

65
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,467
I can explain it to you
if it's too complicated.

66

on that one, Tes, sorry.

- Quit staring at that guy.

- I'm not staring.
- Yeah, you are staring.

72
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,410
Do you know what the word
"conspicuous" means?

73
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,946
Or do you want me to explain
that to you as well?

74
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,207
- Kara, stop staring.
- I'm not conspicuous.

75
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,243
We're the only girls in here
with all our teeth.

76
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,753
We're very fucking conspicuous.

77
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,381
Okay, but what if that's our guy?
I mean, didn't Mel--

78
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,292

What do you guys think
about Harry and Sally?

81
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,720
What about them?

82
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,934
You don't worry about them, Kara.
They're harmless.

83
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,397
So what if we missed him?
We spent, what? 20 minutes

84
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,312
with Deputy Elmore.
What if he came and left?

85
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,365
( Sighs )

86
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,573
Kara:
So, Tes, what are we doing?

87
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,116
Do you have a plan?

88
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,331
Mel did say 2:30.

89
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,595
All right.

90
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,393
So I'm guessing she runs the place.
And there's no way

91
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,304
this shit goes down here
without her getting a piece of the pie.

it's her.

Okay.
Okay, great, I'll take her.

94
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,362
- Let's find out what she knows.
- Mm-hmm.

- Guess I got the trucker.

98
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,959
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?

99
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,165

knows where the fucking truck is?

we could use some gas money.

So what's the deal?

176
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,947
The deal is we're going
to some shitty isolated diner.

177
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,613
- Where?
- Somewhere across the river.

178
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,374
Why would Mel
send us over there?

179
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,034
He's never sent us
out of the parish before.

'Cause something big
has come up.

181
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,624
Apparently someone's running
a shipment along Mel's route.

182
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,383
Who?

183
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,841
Don't know,
but Mel doesn't like it.

184
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,475
There's a driver who's picking up
a preloaded rig down in the Gulf.

185
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:42,638
He brings it up the 220 and delivers
the bricks to another driver

186
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,556
who's waiting with the cash.

187

- Dawn: Who's the driver?
- Tes: That's where we come in.

188
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,981
Mel wants us to get
ahold of the shipment

189
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,567
and find out who the pickup is.

190
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,233
Which brings me to the best part
of this whole operation:

191
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,745
neither man knows the other.
They only know where the diner is.

192
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,201
So driver A isn't going
to do something stupid

193
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,412
and risk getting caught
with a load of dope.

194
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,576
He'll just drive away.
And same goes for B.

195
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,371
I mean the last thing he's going to do is go crying to
the feds

getting ripped off.

we get there before they do

It's fine?
It's a big fucking deal, Kara,

203
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,606
so you might want
to pay attention.

204

if we fucked this one up too.

I don't know.

316
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,779
Just that we're
40 miles from town.

317
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,410
I wouldn't worry about it, Kara.

318
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,074
What was the one good thing Mom used
to say to us when we were kids?

319
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,790
Always make sure
he wears a condom?

320
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,546
Oh no, wait.
Sorry, Kara.

321
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,128
That was what she said
right after your dad left town.

322
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,133
Oh whoops.

323
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,920
That's what she should have said
to your dad when she met him.

324
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,429
Oh ho ho!

325
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm serious.

326
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,352
She said she wanted us
to trust in ourselves.

327
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,107
Okay, so I'm trusting
in myself.

328
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,272
And I don't know.

329
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,908
I just-- I know something
doesn't feel right.

330
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,153
Yeah.

331
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,869
You know what?
I'm trusting in myself.

332
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,205
And everything's telling me
that it is right.

333
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,994
And I know

334
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,914
Tes is a little tough,
but I need you to trust me.

335
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,005
Can you do that?

336
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,102
Yeah.

337
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,308
Well, you know what?
That's all right, Kara,

338
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,395
because you're probably just
overthinking things like you always do.

339
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,901
- Are you joking?!
- No.

340
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,654
I go along with every plan.
What's wrong with you?

341
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,565
What? I have an opinion.
Is that the problem?

342
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,200
Yeah, Kara, maybe that's the problem.
I wouldn't call it an opinion,

343
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,986
but I think that might
be the problem.

344
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,785
I'm just saying
try enjoying it a little.

345
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,792
( laughs )
I am enjoying it.

346
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,248
- A lot, actually.
- All right.

347
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,289
Well, when you really start, let me know, I'll pull out
the video camera.

348
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,878
Yeah, fuck you.
Fuck you.

349
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,544
- What are you guys laughing at?
- Me apparently.

350
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,633
- Thank you.
- Oh yeah? Why's that?

351
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,265
Dawn doesn't think
that I can enjoy anything.

352
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,175
- Can you?
- Really, you too?

353
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,265
- What do you mean "really"?
- Why do you guys always

354
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,974
- have to team up against me?
- Aww.

355
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,265
- I'm the nicest person I know.
- Oh really?

356
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,557
You guys are full of shit.

357
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,692
Oh, we just pick on you
'cause you're little.

358
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,354
Fuck you.
Look how big I am now.

359
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,067
- Okay, shut up.
- Tes: You know what?

360
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,653
I'm the boss, okay?
Everyone in here needs to shut up.

361
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,236
Tes:
So I'm guessing she runs the place.

362
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,532
And there's no way that shit goes down
without her getting a piece of the pie.

363
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,871
If anyone knows
anything, it's her.

364
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,411
Okay, great.
Great, I'll take her.

365
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,296
- Let's find out what she knows.
- I'll take the door.

366
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,628
- Guess I get the trucker.
- ( music playing )

367
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,919
All right, I'm not even gonna say it 'cause you all
know what this is.

368
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,929
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?

369
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,807
Which one of you shitkickers
knows where the fucking truck is?

370
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,561

Mmm.

377
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,582
I was gonna save it for later,

378
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,295
but since your radio sucks,

379
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,927
I got us some tunes.

380
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,305
Lucky for you some of us
still live in the golden age.

381
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,261
Yeah?
What age is the golden age?

382
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,266
Oh, the '80s.
And not just the '80s,

383
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,178
- but Bruce Willis in the '80s.
- No!

- Oh yeah.
- Oh my God.

385
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,059

- Hmm?
- Little Bruce Willis.

388
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,189
- Oh no.
- Dawn: Kara, you gotta hear this too.

- Tes: This is totally it.
- No, I'm not supporting this.

- This isn't funny.
- Shh shh.

Who even comes out with this shit?
I don't believe it.

392
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,411
- No no no, girls, it's not funny.
- Come on, Kara, get some learning.

393
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,325
Wow, you guys think
you're funny, don't you?

394
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,165
- Oh yeah.
- Tes, take this shit out.

395

Throw this shit out the window.

- Tes: Shit.
- Dawn: Fuck!

- What does he want?
- Did you steal the tape?

- I told you!

How are you doing there,
beautiful?

00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,314
It's hot, ain't it?

411
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,068
I can see you sweating over there,
but you just wear it so well.

412
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,656
You're just as sweet
as a little daisy, ain't you?

413
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,660
So where are y'all headed,
way out here this time of night?

414
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,576
- Sorry?
- I said

415
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,496
where are y'all headed,
way out here this time of night?

416
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,085
Yeah, uh, we're just--
we're heading up to see some relatives.

417
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,842
A sick relative out in Chaparral.

418
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,379
- Chaparral?
- Yes sir.

419
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,140
- A relative you say?
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,843
All right then,

421
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,308
on the count of three

422
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,099
I want y'all to say
the name of the relative

423
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,939
that you're going to visit
at the same time.

Y'all didn't even have to answer that.
( laughing continues)

430
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:10,338
No, seriously seriously seriously,
did it-- did it get you going?

'Cause that shit--
that shit never gets old.

Can I get your license

00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,689
Yeah. Um...

434

Actually, you know what? Um,

435
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,777
this is actually my brother's car,
so I don't have the registration.

436
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,909
But think you could help a girl out?

437
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,908
That's all right.

438
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,496
We don't really get to do this
too much way out here anyway.

439
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,458
- Can I ask why you pulled us over?
- Oh shit, I'm sorry.

440
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,668
Your tire is low.

441

I can't have you drivin' out here
with no air in your tire.

442
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,716
You don't wanna be changing
a tire out here in this heat.

That's right, Tom. The true friends

- do not come from outer space.
- Here we go.

the gray men beneath the bedrock.

It's inside of earth.

not heard of Area 52.

Man: Uh, I think I have.
That's in Hoboken, isn't it?

454
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,094

00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,955
Fuck me.

469
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,621
Elmore, pick up.

470
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,956
Hey, Elmore, pick up.

471
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,290
Elmore, it's an emergency.
Pick up.

472
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,546
We got a 10-27
down at Randy's stop.

473
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,135
Elmore, pick up.
Randy's been shot!

474
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,392
Fuck me.

475
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,178
Yeah, boy, I'm telling you,
this heat out here,

476
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,643
it'll kill you. And me,

477
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,682
I just-- I just wouldn't wanna

478
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,351
have y'all dying out here

479
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,771
and me having to call your mamas
and give them the tragic news.

480
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,031
Yep, no no, we wouldn't
want that either, Officer.

481
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,818
- Thank you.
- Cuidado.

482
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,868
Cui-da-do.

483
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,124
You gotta be careful out here.

484
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,751
Now there's a truck stop
just up the way.

485
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,460
I think y'all need to pull in there and
get yourself some air in these tires.

486
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,750
Yeah, great, will do.
Thanks, Officer. Sounds good.

487
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,840
In fact, I can follow behind y'all

488
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,925
and make sure that
you get there in one piece.

489
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,716
No, we're fine, Officer.
Thank you very much.

490
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,008
- We got it.
- Mm-hmm.

491
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,803
Come on now, come on.

492
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,516
You ain't got to call me officer.

493
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,641
You can call me Elmore.

494
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,937
- Well, Elmore, uh--
- That's my name.

495
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,572
Elmore.
( chuckles )

496
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,903
Elmore Huggin.

497
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,866
As in "you hug me,
I hug you"--

498
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,952
it's a regular "hug in."

499
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,076
- You get it?
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,087
Elmore--
Elmore Hug-ins.

501
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,591
I just crack myself up.

502
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,136
- Huh?
- Yes.

503
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,843
- It's funny.
- In fact,

504
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,134
you know what I'm gonna do?
I can turn on them blue and reds

505
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,268
and I can escort y'all if you want to.

506
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,725
No!

507
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,642
No, really.
Just following behind us would be fine.

508
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,027
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

509
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,233
It could be fun though.
It could be fun.

510
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,023
Yeah.
Bet it could be a lot of fun,

511
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,442
but, you know, we're really fine.
But thank you so much.

512
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,861
All right.

513
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,866
You're the boss.

514
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,127
You ladies,
now you be safe now.

515
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,340
Great.
Thank you, Officer!

516
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,346
What the fuck
was that all about?

517
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,051
- Don't ask me.
- ( engine starts )

518
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,268
(siren blurts)

519
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,122
(thumps)

520
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:46,151
(wheezing )

521
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,282
( silenced gunshots )

522
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,805
( engine starts )

523
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,319
This is it?

524
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,076
This is the big exchange point?
Are you kidding?

525
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,239
Tes, why are there cars here?
I thought you said this place was empty.

526
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,033
- Have I been here before?
- Yeah, Kara,

527
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,951
it's probably the late night rush.

528
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,167
- Tes, are you sure?
- What is with the 20 questions?

529
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,630
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Hey, relax.

530
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,885
Relax.
I was just asking.

531
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,923
I am relaxed.
I'm very fucking relaxed.

532
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,725
Dude, don't get mad at me, all right?
This wasn't my fucking idea.

533
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,636
Genius.

534
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,476
What do you want from me, huh?

535
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,313
- I don't know right now.
- No no no, I think you do.

536
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,149
Tell me,
what do you want from me?

537
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,197
I want you to acknowledge

538
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,906
that it's a little strange that Mel would even give us
another job

539
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,116
after how bad
we fucked up the last one.

540
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,781
Okay?
And this is where he sends us?

541
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,952
I mean, call me crazy--
this doesn't feel weird to you?

542
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,042
- Dawn?
- Why do you do that?

543
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,378
- Kara: What? What am I doing?
- That--

544
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,133
questioning.

545
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,136
How long have we
been doing this for?

546
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,423
- How long?
- Are you serious?

547
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,184
Yeah. And how many times
has Mel ever steered us wrong?

548
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,472
- ( Sighs )
- How many, Kara?

549
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,980
- None.
- Right, none.

550
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,863
So what are you
so worried about? What?

551
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,649
Look around, Kara.

552
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,114
There's nobody.
No witnesses.

553
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,120
It's like the easiest job
we'll ever do. All right?

554
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,158
In fact, it's probably why
Mel sent us here--

555
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,201
so we can get our shit
back together.

556
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,621
Think about it.

557
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,428
Hey, is Mel fucking you yet?

558
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,223
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

559
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,976
- Yeah, fuck you for saying that.
- Fuck you, Tes...

560
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,853
- Fuck you!
- ...for bringing me all the way

561
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,433
out here and never
fucking listening.

562
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,975
Chill, both of you!
Chill.

563
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,029
I don't even know what you guys
are fighting about any more,

564
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,285
but every time
it's like fucking World War III.

565
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,117
I don't care what it is.
We have a job to do,

566
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,207
so not one of us is leaving this car

567
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,997
until we are all fucking calm.

568
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,153
- ( Guns clicking)
- All right.

569
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,111
So there are these four nuns.

570
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,243
They're sitting outside
of the confessional.

571
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,778
The first nun goes in,

572
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,447
and she says "Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned."

573
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,333
And the Father goes,
"How have you sinned?"

574
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,962
She says, "I'm so sorry, Father,
I looked at a man's penis."

575
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,374
The Father says, "Ahhh,
that's terrible. I want you to say

576
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,544
10 Hail Marys and go out and wash
your eyes with holy water."

577
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,510
So the nun says "Yes."
She walks out, says her 10 Hail Marys,

578
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,721
up to that basin and washes
her eyes out with holy water.

579
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,309
Second nun goes in, says "I'm so sorry,
Father, I have sinned. Forgive me."

580
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,099
The Father says
"How? How have you sinned?"

581
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,020
She said
"I touched a man's penis."

582
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,028
So the Father goes "Ugh,
that's even worse than the last one."

583
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,115
"I want you to go say 20 Hail Marys
and wash your hands with holy water."

584
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,281
So the nun steps out,
she does her Hail Marys

585
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,370
and washes her hands
with holy water.

586
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,285
Suddenly there's a commotion.

587
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,704
And the priest comes out,
he's like "Whoa, what's going on?"

588
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,623
Because the two sisters--
like three and four are fighting.

589
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,168
He's like, "Yo yo yo, Sisters,

590
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,302
what happened?
What's going on?"

591
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,385
Fourth nun, who's been
eavesdropping, steps out and says,

592
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:05,052
"I don't care what you say, Father.
I am not washing my mouth

593
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,312
in that water
after she sits in it."

594
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,144
( laughs )

595
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,308
Wow.

596
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,068
- ( Dawn laughs )
- Nice one, Dawn.

597
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,650
- Dawn, you're retarded.
- You really just told that joke?

598
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,657
I like that joke.
My daddy taught me that joke.

599
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,069
Tes:
That's even worse.

600
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,408
( Rock music playing )

601
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,947
Tes: Right.

602
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,529
So I'm guessing
she runs the place.

603
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,366
And there's no way this shit
goes down here

604
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,496
without her getting
a piece of the pie.

605
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,578
If anyone
knows anything, it's her.

606
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,540
Okay, great. I'll take her.
Let's find out what she knows.

607
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,289
- I'll take the door.
- Guess I got the trucker.

608
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,585
All right, I'm not even gonna say it
'cause you all know what this is.

609
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,595
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?

610
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,473
Which one of you shitkickers
knows where the fucking truck is?

611
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,439
Dawn!

612
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,768
( Gunshot)

613
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,366
( panting )

614
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,248
- ( door opens )
- Drop the gun.

615
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,964
Drop the fucking gun!
Put the gun on the floor

616
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,300
or I'm gonna put your fucking brains
all over that fucking table. Do it!

617
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,641
I'm not gonna ask you again!

618
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,262
You got three seconds to put it down
or I'm gonna put you down

619
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,930
like fucking Thelma ands Louise there!
Three.

620
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,191
- ( Sobbing )
- Shut up!

621
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,195
Two.
Listen, Jesse Jane,

622
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,572
this ain't "Jeopardy."
You don't get a fucking option here.

623
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,950
Your only option is
to put down the fucking gun!

624
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,579
- Eh, fuck it.
- No no no no no!

625
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,536
- You put your gun down.
- Fuck you. I'm not dropping shit.

626
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,286
All right, obviously--
obviously none of us

627
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,625
are gonna drop
our guns, so let's just--

628
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,506
- let's just talk about it.
- Huh?

629
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,759
You wanna fuckin' talk?
This ain't fuckin' couples therapy.

630
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,386
The only one talking here is me and I'm telling you
to drop the fucking gun!

631
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,014
I know! All right, all right,
listen-- listen to me!

632
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,470
We'll both just put our guns down
at the same time.

633
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,136
( Sobbing continues )

634
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,522
Would you shut her up?!
Jesus.

635
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,981
See, I don't think you understand
what's going here fully. Okay?

636
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,690
If you had any sense left--

637
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,855
and I'm bettin' big on you, baby,
right now that you do--

638
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,525
I think you'd put that down before Mel gets here and
fuckin' blows us both--

639
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,568
- Mel?
- Yeah, Mel.

640
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:12,330
Big guy, blue suit,
always has fuckin' pecans.

641
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,794
Oh. Oh oh oh oh oh.

642
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,081
Oh, that's right.
You don't know shit, do you?

643
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,466
You know why? Because I'm
in fuckin' control of the situation--

644
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,424
- How the fuck do you know Mel?
- Oh, me and Mel, we go way back, baby.

645
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,555
- What?
- That's right.

646
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,637
That gravy train that you've been on,
it's over, so you might as well

647
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,268
give up now because there's no way
that you're walking out of here.

648
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,771
What about the fucking dope?
What about the dope and the money?

649
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,523
Dope? What dope?
There's no fucking dope!

650
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,525
( laughs )

651
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,561
it's the-- the fucking money?

652
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,605
The only thing I know about money
is our mutual buddy Mel

653
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,366
- pays pretty fucking good.
- Mel wouldn't do that to me.

654
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,243
Mel wouldn't do that to me. Mel wouldn't fucking do
that to me, all right?

655
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:56,033
- You're lying!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut her up!

656
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,201
Mel wouldn't do that?

657
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,961
I bet he told you that someone
was infringing on his corridor,

658
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,090
is that right? That the story?
That the one you got? Hmm?

659
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,967
And he sent you here to fucking
figure out who was. Is that it?

660
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,345
Is that gettin' close?

661
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,131
Are you out of your fucking mind?

662
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,551
You think someone's actually running their own
shipment along Mel's route?

663
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,438
You think he doesn't know
what's going down here 24 fucking 7?

664
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,520
That someone's got the balls
to step up in his shit?

665
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,185
And you think that
if something were going on,

666
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,571
you think he'd send
you three fucking bimbos

667
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,357
here to figure out who it was?

668
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,618
( laughing )

669
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,988
- I mean, even I'm not that stupid...
- ( door closes )

670
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,952
and I never even got
through high school!

671
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,583
( Gunshots )

672
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,369
You're slipping.

673
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,715
- You're getting sloppy, Billy.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

674
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,467
What the fuck are you doin'
wearing a cop uniform for?

675
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:53,052
The more prevalent question is
what the hell are you doing here?

676
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,592
- Why isn't everything taken care of?
- What?

677
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,352
What the fuck you care?
You're not in on this.

678
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,730
I care because
it's a hot fucking night

679
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,391
and I've been roasting outside
for over an hour

680
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,856
and all your dumb ass
managed to do was this.

681
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,568
Dumb ass? Fuck you!!
Shit got out of hand!

682
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,404
These two Midwest tourist
motherfuckers wouldn't leave

683
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,490
and this fucking cunt here
and her two dead sisters

684
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,576
decided to shoot up the joint!
I didn't plan for this shit!

685
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,957
Well, aren't you lucky
that I showed up then, huh?

686
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,539
Yeah. So quit standing there with your thumb up
your ass and help me out here!

687
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,125
- This bitch is volatile!
- Calm down! Just calm down.

688
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,507
Now would somebody walk me through what
happened here, please?

689
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,759
- They shot us.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

690
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,840
- They shot us and they shot my friends!
- Uh-- they?!

691
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,175
They shot-- they shot us!

692
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,714
You're the ones who decided
to go all "Boogie Nights"

693
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,009
and fuckin' shoot up the joint,
set off a nuclear fucking bomb in here!

694
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,554
They fuckin' shot Francine, Ronny.

695
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,143
- They fuckin' shot her!
- Oh, that's sad.

696
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:47,527
Ronny, tell this chick what the fuck's going on with
Mel and everything,

697
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,779
- all right? Help me out here.
- I'll get to that.

698
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,985
Why is he calling you Ronny?

699
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,571
I thought you said
your name was Elmore.

700
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:58,204
Why don't both of you just--
just put your guns down

701
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,615
before you two kids
get hurt here, okay?

702
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,454
Fuck you!
I'm gonna kill this fuckin' cunt.

703
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,494
Hey, you calm down.
Ain't nobody gettin' killed right now.

704
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,004
I am calm. Don't tell me to be calm.
I'm calm as a fucking kitten.

705
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,212
You're sweating like a junkie
over there. You just calm the fuck down.

706
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,503
- What the hell is going on?
- Billy: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

707
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,673
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Billy.

708
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,558
Tes:
Who are you? Who are you?

709
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,186
Why aren't you doing something?

710
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,347
Me?

711
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,641
Shit, Tes,

712
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,437
you must have a lot of tears
clouding those eyes.

713
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,776
Come on.

714
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,737
( Humming )

715
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,831
You don't remember me?

716
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,917
Come on.

717
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,708
Come on!

718
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,919
Come on!

719
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,882
( Mimicking Latino accent)
I am the delivery guy.

720
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,634
( Rock music playing )

721
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,473
Need anything else, honey?
You good?

722
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,809
You all right, baby?

723
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,778
♪ Damn, baby,
wanna get in on the action... ♪

724
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,448
That's the first decent piece of ass
I've seen in this place all night.

725
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,584
Tell me again, what the fuck
are we doing here, man?

726
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,246
Just relax, B.
It picks up, I'm telling you, man.

727
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,132
Later on this place will
be crawling with pussy.

728
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,921
- Fuck, this beer tastes like piss, man.
- Yeah?

729
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:40,181
This place smells like piss, all right?

730
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,594
Why aren't we at Cabaret Club
or-- or 4 Play, Zebras?

731
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,809
All right. Look around.

732
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,684
Look at our competition.

733
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,739
- What competition?
- Exactly.

734
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,071
Any other place
we're just a number.

735
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,113
- Here we get free fucking rein.
- Free fucking rein?

736
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:06,749
Of what?
King of the ugly bitches?

737
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,501
Seriously, I wouldn't fuck
any of these chicks with your dick.

738
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,254
Davon, I'm getting herpes
by just looking at these chicks.

739
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,791
Now I don't know what kind
of chicks you're nailing,

740
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,301
but I've got a stack of hundreds
burning a hole in my back pocket,

741
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,339
and I would rather let my pants
flambé my fucking cock off

742
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,927
than pay any of these trailer rats
to get anywhere near my dick.

743
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,717
I'm serious, fucker!

744
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,682
You need to relax, man.

745
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,687
I'm not sitting in some
putrid shithole just 'cause

746
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,848
you don't feel like you're up
for a little competition, man.

747
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,767
These bitches should be
paying me to be in here.

748
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,027
- Oh boy.
- Finish that shit

749
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,439
and let's get outta here.

750
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,699
Anything else you boys want?

751
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,825
- ( Chuckles )
- Wow.

752
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,659
All right, thank you, God. This is
what I'm talking about right here.

753
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,244
- I told you this shit was legit, right?
- Whoo.

754
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,785
Baby, where'd you come from, huh?

755
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,045
Right over there actually.

756
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,633
You got a sexy mouth on you.
I love that shit.

757
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:01,638
Look, what do you say you get off work
early and we head out to my place?

758
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,798
Third floor, The Fairfield.

759
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,514
You know, I'd love that,
but I gotta work, honey.

760
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,770
I'll make it worth your while.

761
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,306
That's sweet,

762
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,066
but unless you're gonna make it worth my while
every day, I've got a job to keep.

763
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:17,274
She's got a point, B.
You know, make it worth her while, man.

764
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,692
Fine. All right. Look,
why don't you give me your number

765
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,986
and we can get together
after you're off, okay?

766
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,950
I don't get off until 5:00.

767
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,868
But, hey, how about you give me
your number and I'll call you, for sure.

768
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,035
( laughing )

769
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,955
Playin' me like a bitch now, right?

770
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,046
Look, do I look like a dumbass to you?

771
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,052
No, you look like a good tipper.

772
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,054
Tell you what,

773
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:47,387
for one of those bills, I'll hook you up with Charlene
over there.

774
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,803
She'll take care of you.

775
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,690
She'll finish you off before you
can even say "cock-a-doodle-do."

776
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,943
All right, fuck Charlene, okay?

777
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,899
I want you.

778
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:02,986
And I told you, I don't get off
until 5:00, so next time.

779
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,275
Hey hey hey hey.

780
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,694
Come on, come on.

781
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,864
I think there's a little misunderstanding here, all
right?

782
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,704
Come on, it's a simple question,
all right? How much is it gonna take?

783
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,962
- Give him a number, he'll pay.
- Oh no, I understand.

784
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,875
- Not for sale.
- Everything is for sale.

785
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,338
It's just business, baby.

786
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,095
Now look,
you're a smart girl, right?

787
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,131
Just give me a number
and it's yours.

788
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,518
Okay, you want a number...

789
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,893
four.

790
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,896
Four. 400?

791
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,808
Inches. That's the size
requirement for this ride,

792
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,444
and you're two inches
under the limit. Sorry.

793
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:43,903
Hey look, bitch,
I don't know who you think you are,

794
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,782
but this isn't
a multiple choice question.

795
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,319
All right, now there's a simple answer and you're
going to give it to me.

796
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,329
- Hey, man, what the-- ow!
- Hey, man, what the...?

797
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,785
Take it easy, man.
He's only playing with her!

798
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,995
( Mimicking Latino accent)
You like questions?

799
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,838
Because I have got
a multiple choice question for you.

800
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,499
You can A) stay here,

801
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,011
pretend like you enjoy getting
sodomized by George over there.

802
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,138
You might like it.
Or B)...

803
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:11,346
- Ow.
- ...you can keep mouthing off

804
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:15,514
and get the record
for the quickest loss of your teeth,

805
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,932
which I can make happen
to you for no charge.

806
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,975
No charge!

807
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,897
Or, or C)

808
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,861
you can pick up your jacket,

809
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,947
you and your boyfriend
can calmly walk out,

810
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,204
drive away and never come
into this club again.

811
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,661
- Now--
- Ow.

812
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,996
Cuidado. Cuidado.

813
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,958
I want you to think carefully

814
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,294
because I want you
to make the right choice.

815
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,585
(Grunting )

816
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,254
Davon: C, man!
C, man.

817
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,922
He's sayin' C.
You're gonna break his arm!

818
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,682
Ay carajo!

819
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,886
You want me to break his arm?
Do you want me to break his arm?

820
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,929
No no no no!

821
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,315
- I can break his arm if you want me to.
- No no no!

822
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,100
- You sure?
- Ah!

823
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,144
Let your friend answer.

824
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,938
- Can your friend answer?
- Yes yes.

825
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,528
- Answer.
- C, C!

826
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,034
- C?
- Please.

827
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,365
- "Si" as in yes?
- C, yes yes.

828
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,745
- Or see, see?
- C.

829
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,872
- C as in yes, I let you go?
- Please.

830
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,123
- C?
- C-

831
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,126
It's a good answer.

832
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,084
It's a good answer.
I don't have to get bloody today.

833
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,045
- I don't have to get bloody today.
- Yeah.

834
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,086
Adios. Go. Vamonos.

835
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,763
- Hey, fuck you, man!
- Let's get outta here.

836
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,179
Wow. Thanks.

837
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,060
I'm Jessica.

838
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,063
Of course you are.
It's a beautiful name.

839
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,771
The guy--

840
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,652
was he worth it?

841
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,030
What?

842
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,111
You know what.
Come on.

843
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,868
Come on, come on.

844
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,826
You know what.

845
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,490
Come on.

846
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,917
Hmph.

847
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,178
20 bucks...

848
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,845
an old condom...

849
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,688
a punch card for helado latte.

850
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,941
Fucking maricon.
He can't even drink espresso.

851
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,191
...Amex card.

852
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:32,075
Coño, it's a great haul.

853
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,075
You really cleaned up
on this one.

854
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:37,078
What are you, a cop?

855
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,114
No. Not quite.

856
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,000
Huh.
Well, that's too bad, isn't it?

857
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,912
A girl really likes
a man in uniform.

858
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,173
And I'm sure that

859
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,175
men in uniform,
they like you too.

860
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,964
You know you are
much too special to be here.

861
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,881
- Hmm.
- Huh?

862
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,345
Tell my boss that.

863
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,182
I don't need to talk to him.

864
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:05,354
I have someone--
someone who wants to meet you.

865
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,402
- ( gulps)
- Come on.

866
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,064
Come on.

867
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,280
( Reggaeton playing )

868
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,611
Wow, nice house.

869
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,243
- It is.
- Yours?

870
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,655
I am just the delivery guy.

871
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,074
The gate is open, you just knock.

872
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,038
- Okay.
- Hey!

873
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,544
Hey. Don't forget me.

874
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:11,583
And don't worry-- I will never
let anything happen to you.

875
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,260
You will come out
as fresh as a daisy.

876
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,515
I am for you!

877
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,099
I am for you.

878
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,263
Ronny:
I am hurt, Tes.

879
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,850
I thought you told me
you love a man in uniform.

880
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,395
That was two years ago.

881
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,531
I saw you for
15 fucking minutes!

882
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,783
Yes, but I remember you.

883
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,945
You were always special to me.
But, hey...

884
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,409
I won't hold it against you.

885
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,121
Mel never did encourage
friendships amongst his staff.

886
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,660
Right, Billy?

887
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,469
You dumb dummy.
How many times I tell you?

888
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,479
Don't open the door
to my house unless I open it!

889
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,311
Hey, baby, how you doing?

890
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,817
Good to see you.
You want a drink?

891
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,858
Get in there and get me
some goddamn bourbon. Go on, git!

892
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,444
- ( High-pitched whining )
- Shut the-- shut the fuck up!

893
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:21,611
I don't even understand you.
Hey, baby.

894
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:22,778
Come on in.

895
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,036
She's just fooling around a little bit.

896
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,701
That's all. That's Darla.
She's a good friend of mine.

897
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,710
- ( Glass shatters )
-( laughs )

898
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,042
Clean it up! Up!

899
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,542
Nice tits, but-- ugh!

900
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,507
Really, sit down anywhere.
Feel free.

901
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,718
Not-- not--
wouldn't sit right there.

902
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,099
We had a little party here
last night

903
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,387
and there was
an accident in that chair.

904
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,227
But sit anywhere else
besides that. Really.

905
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,312
Oh.

906
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,818
You know, I like pecans.

907
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,071
I love pecans, really.
It's my favorite food.

908
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,152
I don't think God
has made a better f--

909
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,409
food than pecans.

910
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,195
Thanks.

911
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,864
My God, I like 'em.

912
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,249
I mean that's just a--
what do you think?

913
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,370
- I don't know.
- Allergies?

914
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,379
- No.
- Not allergies?

915
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,508
Well, in that case,
have some pecans.

916
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,839
( laughs )

917
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,255
I'm just playing.
But I'm not.

918
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,219
But I kinda am.

919
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,804
I do like pecans.

920
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,973
They reduce
your risk of gallstones.

921
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,318
I should know.
I had one.

922
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,355
Hurt like a motherfucker
right across here-- the abdomen.

923
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,660
I had it sonically treated.

924
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,038
Zapped it--

925
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,574
no gallstone.

926
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,833
Pete Rose had a gallstone.

927
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,207
Weird, isn't it, to think
that Charlie Hussle

928
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,126
- had the same gallstone that I have?
- Who is that?

929
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,295
Not a baseball fan?

930
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,055
Not really, no.

931
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,557
- I wouldn't call myself a fan.
- ( chuckles )

932
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,435
My mom used to take me
to some minor league games.

933
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,847
- Your mom...
- Yeah, my mom.

934
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,265
...Was a baseball fan?

935
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,311
She, uh, she did it
for my brother really.

936
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,445
Dad not a baseball fan?

937
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,027
Not exactly.

938
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,331
I do find you interesting.

939
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,334
An interesting girl-- Tes.

940
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,291
With one S.

941
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,957
Wow, impressive.

942
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,467
You officially know
everything about me.

943
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,381
Well, I don't know
everything about you.

944
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,469
And I'm not sure it's official.

945
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,430
But yeah, I know some things.

946
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,139
And how is that?

947
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,897
I always try to find out
as much information as I can

948
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,775
about the people I'm planning
on offering a job to.

949
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,403
- A job?
- Mm-hmm.

950
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,188
I already have a job.

951
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,359
I work in a little shithole
down on Third and Caulson.

952
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,823
- Yeah, I know that.
- It's a place called Spiro's.

953
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,954
- I don't know if you know it.
- Spiro's?

954
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,581
- A strip club. Yeah.
- It is a shithole.

955
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,491
- A strip club.
- It's a dump.

956
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,036
A dump, a dump.

957
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,204
It's been dump
for a long time.

958
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,715
I know it.
I own it.

959
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,462
The reason I pulled you
out of that bullshit nightclub

960
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,507
is because I thought that
what I had to offer you

961
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,925
would be interesting,

962
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,469
something that's better
than going to the bar,

963
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,889
going down there
and talkin' to the local guys

964
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,776
and lettin' them touch you
and just gettin' groped

965
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,357
- every night for three bucks an hour.
- You know what? You got the wrong girl.

966
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,943
- I don't do that. I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

967
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,528
Neither do I.

968
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,786
I serve drinks and I look cute.
That's it.

969
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,663
You do both
those things really well.

970
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,245
( Clicks, soft music playing )

971
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,287
You also do something else
really well.

972
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,840
You know
what I'm talking about?

973
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,146
Do I look like a cop?

974
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,393
If I was a cop, I would have turned
your dumb ass in by now.

975
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,687
Shit,

976
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:27,197
Ronny would have
done that by now.

977
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,528
That was Ronny
out there, you know.

978
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,695
Did he tell you his name?

979
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:36,661
Yeah, probably not.
Anyway that's Ronny.

980
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,576
But I do empathize

981
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,087
with your problem.

982
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,416
Who doesn't want money?
Who doesn't want it?

983
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,836
Who doesn't need it?
Who doesn't have bills to pay?

984
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,176
I empathize to the Nth degree.

985
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:58,349
'Cause God knows it takes a special girl
that knows how to do what you do.

986
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,606
( Tes chuckles )

987
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,641
Lifting wallets?

988
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:06,108
Yeah, that's a skill.

989
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:15,070
I would say that you've
got some balls, woman.

990
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,239
You've got some balls that clank

991
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,373
when you walk
down the street-- no offense.

992
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,160
None taken.

993
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:25,248
I gotta get another drink.
I'll put a little bit more in there.

994
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,166
Let me get you one too.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

Ronny:
He is a businessman.

998
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,893
And this is just business.

999
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,026
But for me, Tes,

1000
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,860
this is the--
the business of my heart.

1001
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,195
Business of your heart?

1002
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,031
( laughs )

1003
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,366
The business of your heart?

1004
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,533
You let us walk into this,
remember?

1005
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,498
My friends are dead

1006
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,584
because of you,
you fucking maniac!

1007
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,714
What did you think was
going to happen?

1008
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,094
You think you were going
to work for a few years,

1009
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,425
collect your 401 K

1010
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,511
and retire to Boca Raton?

1011
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,681
You are a drug pusher, Tes.

1012
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,145
You exchange

01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,126
I'm a football girl.

1020
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,542
I like Roger Staubach.

1021
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:56,214
So don't sing me the goddamn
national anthem like I give a fuck.

1022
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,764
You think I was lifting those wallets just to jerk
myself off?

1023
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,440
See, I'm just a simple girl
who appreciates a buck or two,

1024
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,601
but that's not why
I lifted those wallets.

1025
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,896
I did it 'cause I'm good at it.

1026
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,191
And fuck you
for not noticing sooner.

1027
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,403
So do me the goddamn courtesy

1028
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,163
and stop talking to me
like I'm your fucking

1029
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,575
date on prom night, all right?

1030
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,584
Like I don't know what you do.

1031
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,166
Come on,
let's not waste any more time.

1032
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,752
I'm willing and able

1033
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,758
because I can.

1034
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:38,093
I marked you.

1035
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,721
Pecan?

1036
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,400
I prefer walnuts.

1037
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,687
But I'll eat your fucking pecans
all day long,

1038
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,355
Mel.

1039
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,904
Fuck.

1040
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,200
God damn, woman.

1041
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,622
Congratulations.

1042
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,007
Come on.

1043
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,927
Take a walk outside.

1044
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:21,089
What do you know about coke?

1045
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,052
Ronny:
Do you think you can bungle

1046
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:28,142
$2 million worth of coke
and just walk away?

1047
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,602
This last job,
it was your last.

1048
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,692
You never answered
the question, Ronny.

1049
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,108
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1050
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,402
You know,

1051
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,742
I am glad you asked that.

1052
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,826
Actually, Billy,

1053
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,837
I am going to need you
to hand over the money.

1054
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,794
All of it.

1055
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,800
What the fuck are you talking about?
What are you doing, Ronny?

1056
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,802
Don't make this difficult, Billy.

1057
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,634
Now there is an easy way

1058
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,094
and there is a hard way

1059
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,510
- and I will let you choose.
- Fuck you!

1060
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,349
Fuck me?

1061
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,104
No fuck you!

1062
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,858
What the fuck, Ronny?
What the fuck are you doing?

1063
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,270
I told you--
you can either do this

1064
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,438
the easy way or the hard way.

1065
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,733
And apparently
you are choosing the latter.

1066
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,778
I didn't choose shit, Ronny!
Take your fucking gun off of me.

1067
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,570
You have some dignity, Billy.

1068
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,739
You are screaming
like a fucking schoolgirl.

1069
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:30,284
Now I am getting mine,

1070
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,203
and you're going to get it
and that's all there is to it.

1071
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,589
'Cause I am done, Billy.
I am done.

1072
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,795
What about the cop?
You shot a fucking cop, Ronny.

1073
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,551
I didn't shoot the cop.

1074
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,712
- You shot the cop.
- Me?

1075
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,598
What the fuck you talking about?
I didn't shoot no cop!

1076
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:47,851
You're fucking delusional, Ronny!

1077
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,603
You think I expected you
to just hand over the money?

1078
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,264
What about Mel?
What are you going to tell Mel?

1079
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,727
That you shot me over the money

1080
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,018
he paid me to get rid
of these fucking bitches?

1081
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:58,687
- Ronny: You let me worry about Mel.
- What's he talking about, Ronny?

1082
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,355
Billy: What do you mean
"What is he talking about"?

1083
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,866
It's just a setup.
Open your fucking eyes!

1084
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,822
Can't you see the way he's acting?

1085
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,611
He was gonna wait
for you three bitches to be dead

1086
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,451
and then he was
gonna waltz in here

1087
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,615
and he was gonna
shoot me for my money!

1088
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,456
Which, by the way,
I don't fucking have!

1089
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,792
You know you are half right--
half right.

1090
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,000
Ronny:
See, after you steal the money,

1091
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,636
you die valiantly in a shoot-out
with the unlucky deputy outside

1092
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:26,924
while trying to make
your daring escape.

1093
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,559
Then I take one
of these unlucky ladies,

1094
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,186
throw her in the trunk,
take off and bang!

1095
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,144
She disappears with the money
and is never heard from again.

1096
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,684
Billy:
That's me and her, Ronny.

1097
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,899
What about you?
What the fuck you gonna do?

1098
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,904
I was never here.

1099
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,987
Wait, I thought you said there
wasn't any money. What money?

1100
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,949
The money Mel paid him
to get rid of you three.

1101
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,455
I told you it's not here.
I don't have it!

1102
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,914
Ronny, it's me Billy.

1103
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,045
Why don't you put your gun down

1104
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:02,129
and let's kill this fucking chick
and let's get outta here together?

1105
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,171
That is not going to happen.

1106
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,590
I was planning on leaving myself,

1107
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:12,431
but now that we are involved
in this little pickle,

1108
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:15,814
I'm going to have
to take Tes with me.

1109
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,816
Her? Come on, Ronny.

1110
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,774
I'll-- I'll give you Jesse's half.

1111
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,483
I'll give you all of it!

1112
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,240
I thought you said
the money wasn't here.

1113
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,117
- Where is it?
- No, it isn't here.

1114
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:31,405
There's no cake here.
I'll give it to you when I get it.

1115
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,074
You know Mel. Mel doesn't let
anybody handle the cash.

1116
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,787
You of all people
should know that!

1117
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,078
- You are lying, Billy.
- Lying?

1118
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,588
I'm the only one here
who's on the level, Ronny!

1119
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,421
I don't think so.

1120
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,649
Ronny: I saw you.
I saw the money.

1121
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,688
Billy:
Oh come on, Ronny.

1122
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,949
That wasn't our fucking money.

1123
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,530
What was it then?

1124
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,788
It was this-- the tools!

1125
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,164
- The guns!
- Wait a minute.

1126
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,701
Why is Mel doing this?

1127
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,416
I don't know why
you are so confused.

1128
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,831
You know the policy.

1129
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,170
Policy? What policy?

1130
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:29,088
Do you think that Mel
gives two shits about you?

1131
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,929
He is not there
for you like I am.

1132
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,469
I have always
been there for you.

1133
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,763
But Mel?

1134
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,808
No strikes.
You fuck up once,

1135
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,897
you are done!

1136
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,606
Isn't that right, Billy?

1137
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,360
He has always done this.

1138
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,901
He is-- he is paranoid.

1139
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,786
You remember that--
that chick he told you about?

1140
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,664
The one that
went on vacation?

1141
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,152
Welcome to Cancun.

1142
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,067
And in case the pieces
are a little foggy,

1143
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,953
this is why Billy is here.

1144
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,082
And this how I fucked up.

1145
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,665
I wasn't there to protect you
like every other job.

1146
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:46,047
I've been there for you
every time-- every time.

1147
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,084
But this one time,
this last time...

1148
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,970
if I had have been there,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

1149
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,472
What are you talking about?

1150
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,599
Billy:
You're fucked, Ronny.

1151
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,136
Your stupid fucking plan
is flawed.

1152
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,270
This chick
doesn't even know you.

1153
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,431
Know me?

1154
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:06,818
What the fuck
do you know about love?

1155
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:13,233
Tes, I know you see it.

1156
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,824
I saw it in your eyes in the club.

1157
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:21,666
What?
What did you see in my eyes?

1158
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,577
You can't tell me
that it wasn't there.

1159
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,838
I saw it. It was there.

1160
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,840
Billy: There's nothing there.
There's nothing there.

1161
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,001
You know you are getting
on my fucking nerves, Billy.

1162
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,216
You think Mel's
gonna stand for this?

1163
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,677
And you think in your wildest
fucking delusions

1164
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,137
-this bitch is even interested in you?
- Ronny: Bitch?

1165
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,223
You're going to treat
this woman with respect.

1166
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,765
If you call her a bitch again...

1167
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:49,027
I will shoot you dead.

1168
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,360
Now Mel is the reason
why I'm here.

1169
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,905
He is becoming careless.

1170
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:59,446
He's becoming senile.

1171
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,286
All he does
is crack pecans all day.

1172
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,200
That's why I'm retiring.

1173
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:07,086
I came here to collect my pension.

1174
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,919
And now I'm going
to collect my girl.

1175
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,004
Your girl?

1176
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,965
I'm not your girl.
I'm not your fucking girl!

1177
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:18,132
This mess is because of you!
You understand?

1178
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:21,016
This is not because of Mel.
Mel wouldn't do this!

1179
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,428
I'm so glad you are
such an expert on Mel.

1180
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,143
How many times have you talked
to him over the last--

1181
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,103
three months?

1182
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,644
Once?

1183
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,154
I work with the guy every day.

1184
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:36,065
- I know Mel.
- Yeah, I know Mel too, okay?

1185
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,076
I know Mel. This is just--
this is all just a test.

1186
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,784
- It's a test.
- Billy: You think this is a big test?

1187
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,574
Does that look like
a fucking joke to you?

1188
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,618
We're all fucked!
Ronny!

1189
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:50,129
Will you please shoot this girl
and let's get the fuck out of here?

1190
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:53,258
I'm not going to ask you again,
Billy, to calm down.

1191
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,295
Fuck you, Ronny!

1192
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,304
You know what?

1193
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,805
Since you are being
such a brave girl,

1194
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,895
and Billy here is-is--

1195
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,856
a whiny little bitch,
I'm going to make a deal with you.

1196
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,236
You don't have to tell me
yes or no.

1197
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,160
You just have to show me.

1198
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,118
I want you to shoot him

1199
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,500
and then we will
walk away together

1200
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,878
- and disappear.
- Don't listen to him.

1201
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,673
Ronny:
But if you don't,

1202
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:38,086
I'm going to have to--

1203
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,220
I will have to shoot you both.

1204
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,507
Billy:
He's full of shit.

1205
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:46,018
He'll shoot you before you even get
a shot off once I'm fucking dead.

1206
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,271
Look at what he's doing--
he's double-crossing Mel,

1207
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,102
now he's double-crossing us.

1208
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,483
You don't want to end up
like your friends here.

1209
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,815
Billy: I'm telling you,
he's a fucking liar!

1210
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,071
He's gonna fuck you
like he's fucked all of us.

1211
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,574
He's gonna shoot us
and he's gonna take the money.

1212
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,360
Will you shut the fuck up, Billy,
and-and-- and let--

1213
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,746
let the girl think, for fuck's sake?

1214
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,123
Let her make
her own decision.

1215
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,534
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

1216
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,170
I came in here freely
of my own accord, didn't I?

1217
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,752
- Billy: Liar.
- I could have--

1218
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,715
I could have did you both quickly
like I did them, but I didn't.

1219
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,221
Billy: He thought he could walk
in here and put a couple in us,

1220
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,724
but he's stuck!
You're stuck, Ronny.

1221
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,929
Tes...

1222
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,279
marry me?

1223
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,858
I love you.

1224
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,743
I'm telling you,
he's on the fucking insane train.

1225
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,327
You're going to have
to shoot him now.

1226
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,631
- You're a fucking psychopath!
- Make your decision.

1227
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,042
Don't do it.
He's insane.

1228
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,462
- Two, one.
- Don't.

1229
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,005
- Shoot him.
- ( groans )

1230
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:06,924
Don't fucking--

1231
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,389
Shoot him.

1232
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,520
- You can do it. Shoot him.
- Don't.

1233
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,274
I am so sad

1234
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,817
that you make this decision.

1235
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,987
We could have worked.

1236
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:31,040

the fuck I am.

1279
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,505
I'm gonna tell you
a little story, Ronny,

1280
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,962
a parable.

1281
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,670
You know what a parable is, right?
Like out of the Bible.

1282
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:16,216
- Yeah.
- A long time ago,

1283
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:20,432
these cowboys and Indians
were involved in a big fight.

1284
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,473
American Indians--
pre-casino, big fight.

1285
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:26,188
Big fight-- arrows, bullets.

1286
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,024
You know how it goes.

1287
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,983
One of these cowboys--

1288
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,743
let's call him Bucky--

1289
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,279
Bucky gets himself captured
by one of the Indians--

1290
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,618
not just any Indian,
the big Indian.

1291
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:44,786
Big world-famous fucking Indian,
Chief Running Bear.

1292
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:48,126
So Bucky thinks he's fucked.

1293
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:51,213
Thinks his life is over,
he's gonna be killed.

1294
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:55,221
But Running Bear, instead of killing him, he takes
him back to the tribe.

1295
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:59,509
And he forgets all about
being a cowboy.

1296
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,683
He forgets all his cowboy ways.

1297
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,441
Old Bucky couldn't want
for nothing.

1298
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,396
As you can imagine,
him and Running Bear

1299
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:14,566
got very close.
Very close.

1300
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:17,736
Running Bear makes
Bucky his consigliere.

1301
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:20,997
Bucky makes...

1302
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,249
heavy wampum.

1303
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,830
Heavy wampum.

1304
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,796
You know what happens next?

1305
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,551
He makes a mistake.

1306
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:40,011
- He just started to get restless.
- Okay.

1307
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,347
- He didn't have enough.
- No no.

1308
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:47,850
He starts forgetting everything
that Running Bear had done for him.

1309
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,228
He looks at Running Bear and he
goes "Look at this motherfucker.

1310
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,647
He's drinking
too much firewater,

1311
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,986
smoking too much
peace pipe.

1312
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,743
I can do it better than him."

1313
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,281
He just says "Fuck it."

1314
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,786
Then he starts fucking
Running Bear.

1315
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,999
And he fucks him.

1316
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:17,424
And not no "Brokeback Mountain"
kind of fucking.

1317
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,889
You following me, Ronny?

1318
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,937
The moment that he starts
to fuck Running Bear,

1319
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,227
he loses somethin'.

1320
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,862
Do you know what he lost?

1321
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,658
He lost fuckin' respect for him.

1322
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,195
Respect.

1323
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,991
Right.
He's looking at lost respect.

1324
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,502
In that moment

1325
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,255
the cowboy loses everything.

1326
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:57,715
He lost the thing
that was most important to him.

1327
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,629
And for what?

1328
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,424
For what, Ronny?

1329
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,892
So he could steal
a couple more furs?

1330
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:16,145
All I needed was to have
something for myself, Mel...

1331
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,615
something that would
let me know who I was.

1332
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,574
I've been working with you
seven years.

1333
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,240
Seven years.

1334
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,123
I always liked you.

1335
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:35,836
I always looked after you.

1336
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,711
But I never trusted you.

1337
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:43,097
Trust doesn't exist in this world,
does it, Mel?

1338
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,138
No. It does not.

1339
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,850
It does not.
I know you've been stealin'.

1340
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:55,147
Was this, like, some kind
of goodbye present?

1341
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,653
All this?

1342
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,401
Well, Running Bear,

1343
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,160
he had a heart...

1344
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,367
Ol'\C6.

1345
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,659
He had mercy.

1346
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,078
He understood mercy once.

1347
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:19,000
- ( Harmonica music playing )
- Can he set the cowboy free

1348
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:21,965
in the desert

1349
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,846
all alone?

1350
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,593
Mel: How the fuck
would Running Bear do that?

1351
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,809
Set the cowboy free?

1352
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:35,603
( Chuckling )

1353
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,813
Well, I don't think
that's going to happen.

1354
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,653
He sets the cowboy free,
he knows that eventually

1355
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:49,743
someday that cowboy's gonna
come back and start fuckin' him again.

1356
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,666
What are we gonna do now, Mel?

1357
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,251
You know what we do.

1358
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,837
Maybe I fucked up,

1359
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,502
maybe I made a mistake,

1360
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:06,013
maybe I was desperate,

1361
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:10,176
just trying to get something to feel,
you know, anything anything.

1362
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,936
But I ain't going back
to the way I was.

1363
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,143
Ain't going back to the way I was.

1364
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,228
I wouldn't do that to you, Ronny.

1365
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,439
I wouldn't send you back.

1366
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,320
You know why?

1367
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,983
Because Running Bear
has respect.

1368
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:33,407
There was never any money,
was there?

1369
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,078
Not for you, cowboy.

1370
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,168
Why don't you tell me a story?

1371
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:44,460
I liked that, uh, that cowboy story.
I liked that.

1372
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,880
Only this time, could you--
could you--

1373
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,970
let the cowboy
and the cowgirl
