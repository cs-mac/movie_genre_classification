1
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,452
I get it, Frank.

2
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,580
I get it.

3
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,668
Guys like us, paranoia is second nature.
I get that.

4
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:48,506
You're wondering if I'm some kind
of a decoy to lure you out.

5
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,176
I'm not. I'm not. It's safe here.

6
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,888
So no need for any of this Marathon Man stuff.

7
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,890
It's definitely safe, okay?

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,459
You don't need to interrogate a man

9
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,437
that's waited months just to talk to you.

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,315
Oh, come on.

11
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,075
I get it.

12
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,162
I get it. You wanna--

13
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,749
You're trying to intimidate me.

14
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,961
And I'm not like, uh...
reassuring you, or...

15
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,756
Are you...

16
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,758
You know, you risk botulism doing that.

17
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,261
You always talk this much?

18
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,929
I guess I talk when I'm nervous.

19
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,432
Well, guess you're not as stupid as you look.

20
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,112
- What is that?
- Shit.

21
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,698
Okay.

22
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,702
Okay, this place is rigged.

23
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,247
What do you mean it's rigged?
What is that?

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,042
It means, I don't type a code
into the central terminal, then...

25
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,461
kaboom.

26
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,382
That alarm means we got three minutes
before it gets awful warm in here.

27
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,179
- Ah, no. That's bullshit.
- Do I look like I'm lying to you?

28
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,014
- You really wanna take that risk?
- What's the password?

29
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,766
Only takes a retinal scan.

30
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,249
What? You really wanna die together?

31
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:32,319
Come on!

32
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,106
Come on!

33
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,028
Ninety seconds. We're both gonna die
feeling pretty stupid here, you know that?

34
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:00,072
Oh, you...

35
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,494
Come on!

36
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,056
- I'm gonna say it one time--
- Are you gonna help me out?

37
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,624
- Oh, yeah. No bullshit.
- Yeah?

38
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,376
I'm warning you.

39
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,887
I forgot it was-- I forgot it was there!

40
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,723
- What is that? What is that?
- I forgot it was there!

41
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,780
- Nice and easy, Lieberman.
- Okay...

42
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,663
Hey, what are you doing?

43
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,832
- What are you doing?
- Retinal scan.

44
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,250
Go on.

45
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,011
- Disable it.
- I can't! It's hardwired.

46
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,764
Piece of shit.

47
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,480
All right.

48
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,316
Oh, are we still doing this?
Come on.

49
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,026
Yup.

50
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,571
We are most definitely still doing this.

51
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,077
You're an idiot.
You don't know a goddamn thing.

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,162
The same people that killed you, killed me.

53
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,164
Is that right?

54
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,626
Start talking.

55
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,420
You know, I got an idea, man.

56
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,882
Why don't you get me some pants?

57
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,385
Yeah. I could make us some tea.

58
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,345
We could do this like--

59
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,061
Yeah. Does that hurt?

60
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,564
Oh, yeah. I get it.

61
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,942
That's just stimuli.
You're reacting to it.

62
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,319
You get used to that.

63
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,322
Pain. You can get used to pain, Lieberman.
You can adjust to it.

64
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,450
You can adjust to pretty much anything.

65
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,161
Just as long as there's routine, right?

66
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,956
Routine. Human mind, it craves it.
Needs it.

67
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,958
But if you take that away, that...

68
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,837
That's when you start to lose your shit.

69
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:25,217
When you take away day and night and food.

70
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,219
No water, no patterns.

71
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:33,810
You know what's crazy, Lieberman?
Even though you know what's happening...

72
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,104
I'm telling you that it's happening...
Even though you know it...

73
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,398
rationalizing it won't do shit.

74
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,903
People think that torture is pain.
It's not pain.

75
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,906
It's time.

76
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,786
It's time to slowly realize
that your life, it's over.

77
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,457
It's over, Lieberman.
Now all you got is the nightmare.

78
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,961
You and me, we got time.

79
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:10,930
I was a, uh... NSA analyst.

80
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,646
I was working on Afghanistan intelligence,
which, uh...

81
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,442
Maybe you know it's just an oxymoron
because, uh...

82
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:29,323
our basic tactic is to pay anyone
we can to tell tales.

83
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,783
You know?

84
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,079
"Hey, kid. Tell me a story,
I'll give you some money."

85
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,791
So they did, you know?

86
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,589
And, uh... my job was to, uh...

87
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,927
assess this shit pile

88
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,347
for, uh, actionable intelligence.

89
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,562
It was a monumental waste of my time.

90
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,984
Till one day, uh...

91
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,405
they sent me something interesting.

92
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,574
I just don't understand.
What is that disk?

93
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,242
Why did they send it to you?

94
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,220
I'm the analyst.
That's what they're meant to do.

95
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,163
They send me actual, real intelligence

96
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,833
and then I, you know, I assess it
and decide how to deal with it.

97
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,795
It's actually... I could do my job
for the first time in five years.

98
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,297
But you should...
You should give it to your section chief.

99
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,217
Pass it up the line of command
so it's not on you.

100
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,802
If he buries it? What then?

101
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,180
- Then that's on them.
- Mom, did you get juice?

102
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,309
Yeah, honey.
Yeah, come in here. I'll get you some.

103
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,646
If you go around the chain of command,

104
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,731
neither of us is naive about what it could mean.

105
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,778
- Should I get a cup?
- Yeah, yeah, get a cup.

106
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,323
- Hey, Leo, you want some juice, honey?
- Yes, please.

107
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,452
All right, you guys,
get into your pj's. Time for bed.

108
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,736
I finished my homework.

109
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,583
Oh, your father will look at it
before you go to sleep.

110
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,045
- All right.
- Thanks.

111
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,755
- Go. Go.
- Thank you.

112
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,192
- To bed.
- Love you. Good night.

113
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,359
- Love you.
- Good night.

114
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,885
- Good night.
- Good night, baby.

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,311
- I really wanna do the right thing here.
- Mmm-hmm.

116
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,606
You want me to tell you it's okay

117
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,525
so that if this all blows up,
it won't be your fault.

118
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,613
David, I just...

119
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,699
I can't do that.

120
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,039
You know, everything that we teach them
about being good human beings...

121
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,126
that's what this comes down to.

122
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,587
This is why I took this job.

123
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,714
This is why we are here and I'm not...

124
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,259
writing apps in Silicon Valley.

125
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,263
How am I supposed to look these guys in the eye,

126
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,932
knowing that I didn't have the guts
to do the right thing?

127
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,313
Look, hey... hey.

128
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,358
Come here.

129
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,361
Mmm.

130
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,326
You do... what you think you should.

131
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,416
Hmm.

132
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,102
Your turn, Dad! Dad?

133
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,062
David.

134
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,109
Oh, sorry, you guys. Um...

135
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,737
- Is it a quadruped?
- What's a--

136
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,905
- Four-legged animal. A quadruped.
- You know that.

137
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,198
Sorry. Uh, yes.

138
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:43,577
Okay, so we got a non-jungle-dwelling quadruped.

139
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,138
- Vegetarian.
- Four-legged vegetarian animal

140
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,373
that does not live in the jungle.

141
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,666
- And...
- This is painful.

142
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,252
- Are we gonna be late?
- No.

143
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:55,131
No. No, no, no.
We should be fine, you guys. I think.

144
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,508
Everyone has the same idea we do.

145
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,551
I wanna make it there in time.

146
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,473
Make it to that haunted house, before the line.

147
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,267
- Stay in the car.
- What?

148
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,603
- No matter what happens.
- What are you doing? Babe?

149
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:11,730
- Dad? Dad?
- What are you doing?

150
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,374
- What are you doing?
- Stay in the car.

151
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,608
Understand? Stay in the car.

152
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:16,819
- Stay in the car. I'll be right back.
- Dad?

153
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,029
David!

154
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,806
Don't move!

155
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:52,354
- Lieberman, get on the ground! Now!
- Look, this is a mistake, all right?

156
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,983
Whatever your orders, I'm not a criminal.
I'm an NSA analyst.

157
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,401
Get down!

158
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,862
- I'm an NSA analyst!
- He's got a weapon!

159
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,655
No, I don't. No, no, no, no, no!

160
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,449
- That's not true!
- David?

161
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,532
This is a mistake, okay?
This is a mistake.

162
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
Sarah, go.

163
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,121
- David!
- Drop the weapon!

164
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,723
- Sarah!
- On your knees!

165
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:12,249
- No, no, no.
- David!

166
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,877
No, no, no! Sarah, go!

167
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,879
- David!
- Go, go, go, go!

168
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,089
No!

169
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,424
No!

170
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:24,261
No! No!

171
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,555
Cell phone saved my life.

172
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,356
I went underground.

173
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,276
They, uh, rewrote the narrative.

174
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,196
Planted evidence, painted me as a traitor.

175
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,948
Picked my life apart.

176
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,286
Made life hell for Sarah. For our kids.

177
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:52,748
You know, she said you were brave.

178
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,043
- Hmm.
- Brave and stupid.

179
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,589
And here I am, tied butt naked to a chair.
So, uh...

180
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,345
Yeah.

181
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,269
Are we still doing this?

182
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,521
Yeah.

183
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,859
Could I at least have a glass of water?

184
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,322
Autopsy report.

185
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,700
- Unless Wolf shot himself in the leg...
- Hmm.

186
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,579
...busted his own face and broke his own neck,

187
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,041
I think it's fair to say
that we're looking at murder here.

188
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,960
- God.
- Well, torture, then murder, to be exact.

189
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,506
I think the killer came down the chimney.

190
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,051
Motion detectors never picked him up.

191
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,720
Wolf comes home, turns off the alarm
and bam! The guy hits him.

192
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,558
So we're looking for Bad Santa?

193
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,645
The press knows he's dead.

194
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,275
No statements. Not yet.

195
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,072
This is going to be a jurisdictional cockfight.

196
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,908
NYPD and FBI?

197
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,118
They're both already trying to jump onboard.

198
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,495
Screw 'em.

199
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,289
He was one of us.

200
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,396
Why you gotta be so quiet?
Like a damn cat.

201
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,483
I could tie a bell around my neck
or something, if that'd help you out.

202
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,319
Yeah, you do that.

203
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,865
- Want some coffee? It's fresh-brewed.
- Sure.

204
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,620
So, what brings you down here?

205
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,625
Personal delivery.

206
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,669
Thank you.

207
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,839
I'm honored, Mr. Russo, sir.

208
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,010
Kiss my ass, Curtis.

209
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:15,141
So, uh... how's it all going here, anyway?

210
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,562
Ah, you know, it's good.
Your money pays the rent.

211
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,190
Keeps the homeless guys in coffee and soup.

212
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,985
And occasionally, we talk about being a vet.

213
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,114
It helps.

214
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,865
Some of them, I think.

215
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,618
They keep coming back
so that must mean something, right?

216
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,329
You always were good
at putting people back together.

217
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,706
You should stay.
See what you're paying for.

218
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,837
- Yeah. Yeah, I don't need that.
- Which is why you should stay.

219
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:51,010
It'd be good for these guys to see
someone like them who made a second life.

220
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,974
I'd feel guilty that I got out in time.

221
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,146
These guys, they...
they got problems that I don't.

222
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,441
I'm way too selfish to do what you do.

223
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,568
There's nothing selfish about this.

224
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,654
It means a lot.

225
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,578
- So how's business?
- Pretty good, actually. As you ask.

226
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,663
A mover and a shaker.

227
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:22,416
A man of wealth and taste.

228
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,588
You always knew you were destined
to do greater things, I'll give you that.

229
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,343
What?

230
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,929
I just... I can't tell if you think
that's a good thing or not.

231
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:40,184
No, I... I'm proud of you. I really am.

232
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,106
You know there's always a job for you at Anvil.

233
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,940
Instructor's job.

234
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,151
You're still the best corpsman I ever saw.

235
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,197
Hell, I bet you'd have stitched
your own damn leg back on, given a chance.

236
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,407
Hell, yeah.
If you could find it.

237
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,911
But is that why you're here?

238
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,627
We still good for tomorrow night?

239
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,463
Yeah.

240
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,635
Yeah, I'll be there.

241
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,720
Good.

242
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,559
You should come work with me, Curtis.

243
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,439
You know I'd look after you.

244
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,525
Yeah, I'm sure.

245
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:34,946
But I got out in time, too.
Even if it did cost me a leg.

246
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,242
I ain't got no plans on going back.

247
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,288
Guess that makes us the lucky ones.

248
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,008
Who's coming, Lieberman, huh?

249
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,885
I know someone's coming.
Tell me who it is.

250
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,847
- No, no, no, someone's coming.
- Nobody's coming.

251
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,683
- I don't believe you survived on your own.
- Yeah?

252
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,892
Tell me who it is.

253
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,936
I survived for the same reason that you survived.

254
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,730
'Cause I'm good at this stuff.

255
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:55,694
I know that it makes it easier for you
if you make me the enemy, but I'm not.

256
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,820
Hey...

257
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,573
I'm the only friend you have, Frank.

258
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,659
Hey!

259
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,372
I'm the only friend you have, Frank.

260
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,125
Hey!

261
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,257
If somebody was coming, who would it be?

262
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,889
Success here is a matter of perspective.

263
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,309
It can't be measured
in battles won or land claimed.

264
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,146
Gentlemen, I'm here to offer you freedom.

265
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,650
To wage the war that must be waged
to finally win this thing.

266
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,319
What we will do is dirty and tough,

267
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,532
but it will speed an end of this war
and safeguard our nation.

268
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,409
Major Schoonover.

269
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,790
You were all handpicked
'cause you're the best at what you do.

270
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,294
Inter-unit rivalry has no place here.

271
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,715
Berets, Delta, SEALs, Force Recon...
I don't give a shit.

272
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,343
This is who we are now.

273
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,305
This is Operation Cerberus...

274
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,973
and you are my dogs of war.

275
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,146
The enemy operates
without regard to honor or rules.

276
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,399
So neither will we.

277
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,318
Our mission is simple.

278
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,029
We capture, interrogate
and execute high-value targets.

279
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,698
Sounds like the Phoenix Program.

280
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,575
Do we have a problem with that, gentlemen?

281
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,160
Not if Congress doesn't.

282
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,538
They're fine with it.

283
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:34,501
I'm the only authority you will need.
I point, you shoot.

284
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,173
Castle and Russo are team leaders.
They'll post all assignments.

285
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,343
Any questions?

286
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,889
Sir... does this mean
that Ann-Margret's not coming?

287
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,517
I mean...

288
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,562
Jackass...

289
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,199
Play any Kenny Rogers on that thing?

290
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,745
Well, it's, uh...
it's not really my speed.

291
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,455
Gunner Henderson.

292
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,457
You're leading my team.
I've heard good things.

293
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,460
Yeah, likewise.
Jack Kimber, he's a friend.

294
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,263
He calls you the best breacher he ever saw.

295
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,381
I'm excited to watch you work.

296
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,681
All here to serve the Lord's will, my friend.

297
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,218
Hmm. Fair enough.

298
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:28,889
We're the sword of the righteous.
Our aim must be true.

299
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,349
"Righteousness keepeth him that is upright
in the way,

300
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,396
but wickedness overthroweth the sinner."
It's Proverbs 13:6.

301
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,900
Okay.

302
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,031
Your face. I'm messing with you, boss.

303
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,910
- All right, man. Nice to meet you.
- All right, man. You, too.

304
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,872
- He seems fun.
- Oh, yeah.

305
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:01,046
How's, uh... how's your team look?

306
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,216
Ready for bear.

307
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,097
Hey, you notice that our fearless leader
didn't even give us a name?

308
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,433
Yeah.

309
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,935
Heard some of the guys call him Agent Orange.

310
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,690
- I like that.
- Do you?

311
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,943
What, you don't trust him?

312
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,281
Ours is not to reason why, Frankie boy.

313
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,660
Ours is but to do or die.

314
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,620
That's from a poem about a bunch of guys

315
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:37,082
who got their asses handed to 'em
on the back of bad intel, right?

316
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,752
- You are shitting me.
- Shit you not.

317
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,798
You read a poem?

318
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,800
Billy, you're so funny, man.

319
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,512
- Seriously, it's hilarious.
- Hey, you never cease to amaze me, man.

320
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,181
All by yourself?
I didn't know you could read.

321
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,934
Sorry about that.

322
00:23:57,143 --> 00:24:01,397
I once took out a machine gun nest,

323
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,609
saw this guy's head explode and...

324
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,237
all I thought was, "Good shot."

325
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:14,661
I hated the enemy 'cause I had to, but...
but I respected him, too.

326
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,872
They don't haunt me.

327
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,504
One of our Apaches hit some of our own.

328
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,548
Friendly fire.

329
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,050
There is no such thing.

330
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,596
But it's war, right? Shit happens.

331
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,601
Except I then saw some press officer
pass it off to reporters

332
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,395
as an enemy ambush.

333
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,897
Lying pricks.

334
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:46,484
All I could think was
that it dishonored those men as soldiers.

335
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,237
They were good at their jobs.

336
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,199
They didn't get ambushed like assholes.
It was a lie.

337
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,244
When, um...

338
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,540
I dream, I see that guy.

339
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,087
And it... It's me that he is lying about.

340
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,384
Me that he is turning into an asshole.

341
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,303
Like it all meant nothing.

342
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,895
What do you do when you can't trust your own?

343
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,939
Take matters into your own hands.

344
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,068
- Oh, here we go.
- No, no, no, no. I agree with O'Connor.

345
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,612
First time for everything, right?

346
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,573
About time you saw sense.

347
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,575
We take matters into our own hands.

348
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,954
We are not the only soldiers
to feel let down by the country we serve.

349
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,999
I have friends who have been betrayed
in ways that you guys can't even imagine.

350
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,043
Everything taken from them.

351
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,218
A good man risked his life to save mine.

352
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,472
Yeah.

353
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,392
And I decided not to throw away
that gift he gave me.

354
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:04,938
So I got a job... started my second life.

355
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,734
And now I take pride in living that life well.

356
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,236
What the hell is it that you do anyways, Curtis?

357
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,988
I sell insurance.

358
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,034
It's a hell of a sales tool.

359
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,704
All right, let's wrap it up, guys.

360
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,216
Read this, kid.
You're right to feel betrayed.

361
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,094
And there's plenty men who feel just the same.

362
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,930
This touchy-feely bullshit
ain't gonna solve nothing.

363
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,983
You gotta spin me around so I can enter the code.

364
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,127
Here's the thing.

365
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,069
There are no explosive devices in this place.

366
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,363
If there were, I would have found 'em.

367
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:58,950
So, you keep saying, "Believe me,"
but you keep lying to me, Lieberman.

368
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:03,038
Bravo, Frank, you got it.
No explosives.

369
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,748
No fire.

370
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,875
Spin me around. Let me show you something.

371
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,046
Spin me around! Come on!

372
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,313
Smile, Frank, you're on Candid Camera.

373
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,989
You see, if I don't enter a code,

374
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,826
then all these video feeds,
they get sent to various media outlets

375
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,493
and the world knows you're still alive.

376
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,914
You want that? No? Let me go.

377
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,624
Let me go.

378
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,172
Figured if they ever found me here...

379
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,926
at least I could broadcast my murder
to the world.

380
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,720
Let my family know I wasn't what everyone said.

381
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,854
I would have lost my last chance
of going home and seeing 'em.

382
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,940
This chance. Us.

383
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,860
My family... they're gone.

384
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,278
They're gone because of your goddamn disk.
What about that?

385
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,002
Had nothing to do with what you did, huh?

386
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,949
Hey, you shut your mouth.

387
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,408
- Yeah?
- You shut your mouth.

388
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:26,079
You followed orders, I did my job.
You tell me what's the difference--

389
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,497
- There's a difference--
- Yeah?

390
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,820
- Yeah.
- What's the difference?

391
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,792
What's the difference?
Let me ask you something.

392
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,003
- How many times was Zubair beaten?
- Shut your mouth.

393
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,546
How many times was this innocent man tortured?

394
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,175
He was a good man!
He was an honorable father. He was a cop.

395
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,260
Hey!

396
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,766
- Are you gonna kill me?
- The thought does cross my mind.

397
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,409
- It's crossing my mind.
- You're not gonna kill me.

398
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:50,771
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I know people. I'm an analyst.

399
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,063
It's my job.

400
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,066
You're not gonna kill me
'cause you're a good man.

401
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,609
You...

402
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,490
You don't know shit. You don't know shit.

403
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,960
Who else knows?

404
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,177
Who else knows?

405
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,391
There is still time for you to undo this.

406
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,019
I will help you.

407
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,814
You answer the question.

408
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,822
Do all these men know I am a police officer?

409
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,366
Are they all part of this?

410
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,578
- What's he saying?
- Nothing useful.

411
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,122
We sure he's even got anything?

412
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,208
Are you questioning my intelligence, soldier?

413
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,296
Please, I'm not a terrorist.
I have a family, children--

414
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,717
I am a good man.

415
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,930
If you want your family to see another sunrise...

416
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,558
you will stop talking. You understand me?

417
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,523
If you don't know anything...

418
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,821
Do it.

419
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,907
Please... I'm not a terrorist.

420
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,327
I have a family. I... I have a family.

421
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,894
What are you doing?

422
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,605
We desecrating corpses now?

423
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,316
Frank?

424
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:08,283
Schoonover said get the bullet.
I'm getting the bullet.

425
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,326
Looks to me like we're hiding evidence.

426
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,454
You good with that?

427
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,918
No one's asking for our opinions.
Not while we're here.

428
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,046
Let's go.

429
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,444
Happy birthday, Frank.

430
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:49,657
It's a good thing you did...
getting a stone.

431
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:55,413
Yeah. Figured he deserved
a marker of some kind, right?

432
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:05,006
Frank would have hated this, this maudlin shit.

433
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,970
I wish he'd...

434
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,767
Why didn't...
Why didn't he come to us, man?

435
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,855
After Maria and the kids?

436
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,501
Why didn't he come to us?
He didn't have to be alone.

437
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,735
We could've helped him.

438
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,821
Yeah, he didn't want any help.

439
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:31,574
He wanted to kill every bastard
who had a hand in it.

440
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,455
I miss him.

441
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,043
And I could see it.

442
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,255
I could see it.

443
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:49,800
Even before... what happened.

444
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,220
He was changing.

445
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,680
He was finding it harder and harder to come back.

446
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,103
He said Kandahar was like nothing else.

447
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:03,773
He said the lines were blurred.

448
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,318
When did he say that?

449
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:13,866
Uh, just when he was over there.

450
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:18,288
He called me, you know, to shoot the shit.

451
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,457
Said I was lucky not to be there.

452
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,169
Yeah.

453
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,296
Well...

454
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,923
you were.

455
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,226
Oh.

456
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,480
Yeah, he did not die easy.

457
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,775
You feel guilty for disliking this man.

458
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,114
I wanted him out of my way, Mom,
but not like this.

459
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,241
And now you get to sit in his chair.

460
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,660
Temporarily.

461
00:33:57,743 --> 00:34:00,538
Someone has to become the agent in charge.

462
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,498
Why not you?

463
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,710
- I'm not sure I'm suited to command.
- Really?

464
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,922
You went to Afghanistan
because it was a fast track to promotion.

465
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,508
"A notch on your belt" was the phrase you used

466
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,260
when I tried to talk you out of it.

467
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,928
Well, my priorities changed.

468
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,809
With the death of your friend.

469
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:27,190
And now you're closing yourself off,
find it hard to trust people.

470
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,818
But this withdrawal is not a good thing, Dinah.

471
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,114
Don't make me the victim of this, Mom.
I'm not.

472
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,532
You want a victim, look at Wolf or Ahmad.

473
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,201
And I'm not withdrawing.

474
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,162
Truth is, I just don't trust anyone else
to get it right.

475
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,873
You want to label me something,
then call it arrogance.

476
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,376
I'm the best. Others will let me down.

477
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,503
Of course they will, darling.

478
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,714
C'est la vie. That's life.

479
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:56,219
How we deal with disappointments
is what decides the person we are.

480
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,902
Yeah, but I'm not talking about someone
turning up late for dinner

481
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,306
or buying the wrong flowers.

482
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,933
You know what? You are arrogant.

483
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,146
And more than a little self-important.

484
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,482
But you will have to trust someone, sometime.

485
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,944
Though I wonder if it isn't the other way around.

486
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,988
After what happened with your friend,

487
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,200
perhaps you are terrified
someone will choose to trust you.

488
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,788
Hmm?

489
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,377
- Hey, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

490
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,878
Hi.

491
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,931
No!

492
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,530
Happy birthday, Frank.
It's the 15th.

493
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,490
Happy birthday.

494
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,787
I know all there is to know.

495
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,747
- Yeah.
- Hey.

496
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,376
If you cut me loose, I'll buy you a cake.

497
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:16,341
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

498
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,427
You know, sooner or later
you're gonna have to, uh,

499
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,305
get me something to drink or eat.

500
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,890
Or kill me.

501
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,270
What's it gonna be?

502
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,817
Mmm.

503
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,036
You never should have come after me, Lieberman.

504
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,288
I didn't have a choice.

505
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,166
They took our families from us.

506
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,669
Jesus. That's such bullshit.

507
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,964
Your family's alive. Mine's gone.

508
00:36:57,923 --> 00:36:59,509
You threw yours away.

509
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,640
You had a choice. I didn't.

510
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,477
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.
Maybe someday you're gonna believe it.

511
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,812
You and I both thought
we were serving our country.

512
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,064
- We both thought that.
- Type the code.

513
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,776
And now if I go home, I get my family killed.

514
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,654
You know, you and I together,
we could change that.

515
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,240
Type the code.

516
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,827
I'm sorry, Frank.

517
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,479
Lewis? You down there, son?

518
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,610
You down here?

519
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,702
Dad...

520
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,996
Son...

521
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,127
- Shit.
- Come here.

522
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,963
Oh, God.

523
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,091
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

524
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:05,968
- What?
- I could have killed you.

525
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,679
No, no. You didn't. Nobody got hurt.

526
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,393
- Dad, I could have killed you.
- You're okay. I'm okay.

527
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,437
No, I could have killed you, Dad.

528
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,333
Pulled Wolf's bank records.

529
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:50,888
Thirty million?

530
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,684
Yep. Six accounts. All buried offshore.

531
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,853
- Any indication where it's from?
- Still working on that.

532
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,316
We have to run this up the flagpole, Dinah.

533
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,359
As far as you're concerned, I am the flagpole.

534
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,820
Who else can we trust with this?

535
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,156
I'm new here, you brought me the evidence.
Everyone else is suspect.

536
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,950
And you don't find that kinda scary?

537
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,497
No. Of course not.

538
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,291
Puts you right where you want to be.

539
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,336
And where is that, exactly?

540
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,091
On your own.
Riding cowboy. You against the world.

541
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,510
You speak to Wolf like this
when he was your boss?

542
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,763
That's what I get?

543
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:37,392
You know, you came in here with a bug up your ass

544
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,395
about a case nobody wanted
and all this "we're not partners" stuff,

545
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,398
- but now you want me to keep your secrets?
- Yeah.

546
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:50,865
You know...
you were right about one thing.

547
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,410
Trust, loyalty... you gotta earn those.

548
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,416
Stein. Sam.

549
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,418
Wait.

550
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:17,975
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

551
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,104
Easy now, Frank.

552
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,816
Hey, don't do that. I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't... No swift move--

553
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,281
Why don't you sit down?

554
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,034
Have a cup of coffee. Come on.

555
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,456
Time to choose.

556
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,714
- Why didn't you kill me?
- Oh, my God, man.

557
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,551
You didn't listen to anything that I said?

558
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,055
Oh, my God.
You gotta be the most stubborn...

559
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,891
Why didn't I kill you? Jesus.

560
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,560
- The codes.
- Turned that off.

561
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,606
You know, it's like you said.
Routines, right? Patterns.

562
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,982
Jesus Christ.

563
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,945
They lull us into a sense of,
uh, normality, a false sense of security.

564
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,822
We cease to question.

565
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,032
- Even somebody like you.
- You're an asshole.

566
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:20,913
You know, these men that, uh,
tried to kill us, they have patterns.

567
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,668
Patterns that don't, uh, involve you and me.

568
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,048
- I mean, they think we're dead.
- Lieberman...

569
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,884
I don't do partners.

570
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,302
Get over yourself.

571
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,722
There's no place for emotion here, you know?

572
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:42,059
You and me have both done things
that we would like to take back.

573
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,142
We can't.

574
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,106
But we're not the bad guys here, they are.
Right?

575
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,822
Yeah.

576
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,957
Shut up.

577
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,630
Oh, I love my wife. I love my wife.

578
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,840
What'd you get?

579
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,593
Springsteen. Playing the Meadowlands.

580
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,178
Lady got me tickets for when I get back.
Huh? Right?

581
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,304
Nice.

582
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:24,476
- Yo, 29 days and counting, man.
- That's right. You bet your ass.

583
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,438
What about you, Bill?

584
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,441
You got plans?

585
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,739
Yeah, yeah. I got some plans.

586
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:41,786
Billy the Beaut, huh?
Some things don't change.

587
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,164
You ever think about,
maybe, quality over quantity?

588
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,708
Pick a winner. Settle down.

589
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,044
God made me this way for a reason, bro.

590
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,254
It'd be wrong not to share the wealth,

591
00:43:52,337 --> 00:43:54,589
- you know what I'm saying?
- "Share the wealth."

592
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,359
- You know what we should do?
- What's that?

593
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,384
Know what we should do?

594
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,845
Frank's gonna head home
and read his kids a bedtime story.

595
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,096
At ease.

596
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,307
Need you gentlemen for a briefing.
Five minutes.

597
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,642
Sir.

598
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,109
This terrain means...

599
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,153
we won't be able to land near the compound

600
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,739
without alerting the enemy,
so we're gonna land here,

601
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,366
north of this ridge. Move in on foot.

602
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,494
Once both teams are in position,
we'll hit the compound.

603
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,705
No air support?

604
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,248
This is a clandestine mission, Lieutenant Russo.

605
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,042
Air support would negate that.

606
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,127
You got something to add, Castle?

607
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,672
Sir, this looks like an ambush.

608
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,508
And what do you base
that sound factual analysis on, Castle?

609
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,636
This man has been a target for months.
His whereabouts are finally confirmed.

610
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,241
We're not gonna get this chance again.

611
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,725
So what now? He's just here? He's...

612
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,128
He's just waiting to be caught
where there's no easy exfil?

613
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,145
Where the terrain makes it a death trap?

614
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,898
You got any idea what they call teams like ours?

615
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,334
They call us the American Taliban.

616
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,152
Because we go in, the middle of the night,
people disappear.

617
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,154
We have been doing it for a year, all right?

618
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,826
Now, look, they know about us.
They want us dead.

619
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:05,535
I think this is a trap.

620
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,080
I think it's a trap
because it's exactly what I would do.

621
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,625
Russo?

622
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,379
I trust Frank's instincts, sir.

623
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,883
And I trust hard-earned,
thoroughly vetted intelligence.

624
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:23,846
I'll take my information over the vague
notions of the war whisperer over here.

625
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,765
Listen, asshole.
Let me tell you something.

626
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,492
- You don't have operational command--
- This is--

627
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,809
Wind it down, lieutenants.

628
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,312
Last I checked, neither of you were in command.

629
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,274
Sir.

630
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,365
Prep your teams.

631
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,493
I think if we do this, men are gonna die.

632
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:52,166
I pointed. Now you need to go shoot.

633
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,919
- Sir.
- Dust off at 2300.

634
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,546
- Now get the hell out of here.
- Roger.

635
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,562
Once they get those mortars ranged in,
they're gonna pound us into the ground.

636
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,941
I'm going through that building.
Clear a path for an evac.

637
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,752
- You out of your mind?
- What do you wanna do?

638
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,611
You wanna die here? Like a rat in a jar?

639
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,363
It's about time I had a fair fight.

640
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,742
- I'm going.
- Then I'm coming with you.

641
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,286
You gotta stay here. Keep him safe.

642
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,122
- What are you talking about? That's crazy.
- Bill, you stay here.

643
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,833
Keep him safe. Cover.

644
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,961
Frank.

645
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,839
I gotta get home to the boss. I gotta go.

646
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,756
Move.

647
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,559
How you doing, sir?

648
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,357
Reap what you sow, eh, Frank?

649
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,235
Gonna do some reaping of my own.

650
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,362
You just don't bleed out, you hear me?

651
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,781
I'm gonna get you home, sir.
I'm gonna get you home.

652
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,659
Cover!

653
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,121

Did you get him?

00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,156
Did you kill the target?

672
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,247
Did you get him?

673
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,208
Did you kill the target?

674
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,293
What'd you say?

675
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,242
- What'd you say, you piece of shit?
- Whoa, whoa.

676
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,840
You did this!

677
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,443
- You did this, you hear me?
- Back up!

678
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,843
I'll kill you!

679
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:39,138
You did this! You did this!

680
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,890
You want to kill the man?
I cannot let you do that.

681
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,392
- Stand down!
- Why you protecting that piece of shit?

682
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,187
I'm protecting you.
Guys like that, it's never on them!

683
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:56,488
No. No, don't...
Don't touch... Don't touch me.

684
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,032
Open your eyes, man.

685
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,744
This whole thing...
This whole thing is bullshit!

686
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:06,998
You don't like the way that it smells?
Get out! I am.

687
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,092
I requested a transfer back to Force.

688
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:23,307
I can't. We... We can't do this anymore!

689
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,604
Let's... let's get out.

690
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,274
I mean, look at us.

691
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,902
Frank!

692
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,531
Look at yourself.

693
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,836
Bill.

694
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,156
You could have ended it all that night.

695
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:07,642
You didn't, and then they killed your family.

696
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,848
You have to live with that.

697
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,191
But this war that you're waging, I mean, come on.

698
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,319
That's the US military. That is the CIA.

699
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:21,489
You just got rolled over by one spook
zip-tied to an office chair, here.

700
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,368
I mean, I thought I needed you,
but you need me just as bad.

701
00:53:28,913 --> 00:53:29,914
Look...

702
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:37,256
I've spent months and months hacking into
every agency and their server.

703
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,008
Phone companies, police departments,
it doesn't matter.

704
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,428
Anything they can throw at us,
I can throw it right back at 'em.

705
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,640
- I've been getting ready for you, Frank.
- What does that mean?

706
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,684
What does that mean? It means that
every missile needs a guidance system.

707
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,810
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Okay?

708
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,146
Without me, you're just a blunt instrument.

709
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:57,276
Yeah, blow me off. Yeah. Do it.
Blow me off. That's right.

710
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,737
Damn it.

711
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,700
Sit down.

712
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,494
- Ah...
- Get in.

713
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,997
Don't be proud. Get in.
I want to show you something.

714
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,749
- Come on. Get in.
- Ah, damn it.

715
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,295
You son of a bitch.

716
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,471
You know, that heroin was just financing
for something else.

717
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,059
Your Operation Cerberus...

718
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,980
...doesn't exist.

719
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,483
There's no official record.
There's no congressional approval.

720
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,778
It's totally off the books.
You know what that means?

721
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,198
They turned you into a hit man, Frank.

722
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,745
Now, I don't care if we trust each other or not.

723
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,957
I don't wanna be blood brothers.
That stuff is for kids in tree houses.

724
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,501
But you and me, we want the same thing right now.

725
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:58,837
So work with me.

726
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,882
One condition.

727
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,385
- Yeah, name it.
- They die.

728
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,428
Yeah?

729
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,975
Every single one of 'em. No trials.

730
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,893
No bullshit.

731
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,771
They die.

732
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,611
Yeah, I can live with that.
