1
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,231
I want every one of you guys
over there now! Now!

2
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:02,745
Welcome to Valdez, Alaska, sir. Rig 59
in sight. Looks pretty hot down there.

3
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:03,950
Heads up.

4
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:21,555
Thank God.

5
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,421
What's cooking?

6
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:58,921
Goddamn it, Forrest,
this is a disaster here!

7
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:02,016
It's totally out of control.
I got four guys down.

8
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:05,269
And all because of your goddamn pal
Jennings' lousy...

9
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:08,226
Your goddamn pal Jennings' lousy what,
Hugh?

10
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,274
Come on, the crane's all loaded
with explosives for you.

11
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:14,941
Hey, Forrest is here.

12
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,699
I'm telling you, Forrest,
those goddamn preventers caused this.

13
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:24,452
I told Jennings they weren't up to spec,
but he made me use them anyway.

14
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,821
Come on, Hugh...

15
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,040
how'd he make you do anything?

16
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,749
Hugh's been getting sloppy lately,
hasn't he?

17
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:32,839
Certainly has, Mr. Jennings.

18
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,122
Certainly has.

19
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,177
You don't believe me, do you?
You think I'm makin' this up.

20
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:40,097
I can't figure out why someone'd
do that to his own rig.

21
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,344
It doesn't make sense.

22
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:45,810
He's really paying you that much money?
Now you believe him over your friends?

23
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,981
Why don't you fall back
before you say something stupid?

24
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,857
You used to be a good man.

25
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:54,687
Now you're nothin' but a whore.

26
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,695
For $350,000...

27
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:59,198
l'd fuck anything once.

28
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:03,910
Where's my shield?
Hot enough for you in there?

29
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,194
Brand-new preventers!

30
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,700
Don't make sense!

31
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,132
The chain, it's caught!

32
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:32,106
You! Look at me!

33
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,650
Down!

34
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:35,103
Bring it down!

35
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:53,419
What the fuck?

36
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,049
Shit!

37
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,098
Get back!

38
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,244
Very impressive, Forrest, as always.

39
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:14,743
I'll expect your full report
on my desk by morning.

40
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:17,451
- You'll have it.
- I look forward to it.

41
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:20,629
All right, go on!
Get that goddamn diverter up there!

42
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,177
So, what did he say?

43
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,520
I don't know,
something about faulty preventers.

44
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,230
Nothing to do with it.

45
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,061
It was human error all the way, as usual.

46
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,816
As in almost every fire or spill
you've ever seen.

47
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:44,363
Am I right, Forrest?

48
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,107
Preventers were not the problem.

49
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,200
And the human error in this case
is Hugh Palmer.

50
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,866
He's the rig foreman, it's his responsibility.

51
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:54,078
And his burden to pay the penalty.

52
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,455
My oil is flowing all over the ocean...

53
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,460
instead of into my refinery,
where it's worth money.

54
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,703
I'll have Eskimos and environmentalists...

55
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:05,132
probing all the orifices of my body
for the next two weeks.

56
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,923
Now, why the hell would I do that
to myself on purpose?

57
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:10,420
I don't know. I asked him the same thing.

58
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:12,840
It doesn't really matter now, does it?

59
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:16,138
I sort of blew up all the evidence, didn't l?

60
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,181
I guess you did.

61
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:43,417
I got Tonto with his fish breath
busting my balls.

62
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,703
Don't touch me.

63
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,087
Cochise, you want some money?
Take this!

64
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:48,175
Animal.

65
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,634
Hey, don't bust my balls. I'm warning you.

66
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:55,470
Buy a drink?

67
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,221
Listen to me, you yellow-snow-eating...

68
00:08:58,562 --> 00:08:59,937
welfare-collecting...

69
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,765
redskin piece of shit.

70
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,521
Get the fuck out of here!

71
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,364
You want a smoke too?

72
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,360
"Dances With Whiskey."

73
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:17,413
Hey, I warned him.

74
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:21,868
Hey, Cupcake, what the fuck you think
you're looking at?

75
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:26,084
Oh, shit.

76
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,834
Nothing much at all.

77
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:33,046
Fuck him up, Forrest!

78
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:44,732
Pussy!

79
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:53,021
Right about that. Fuckin' pansy.

80
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:55,942
I haven't seen you here before.

81
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,667
Sit down.

82
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,703
Don't sneak up on me, I might shoot you.

83
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,836
Just don't hit me, that's all.

84
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,668
How you doing, Bubba?

85
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:16,674
Look, I might have been out of line before.

86
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:20,598
You were wrong about something.

87
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,427
I know you're no whore.

88
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,302
You were right about that.

89
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:27,932
You were just wrong when you thought
I was a good man once.

90
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,560
Jesus, you sound as bad as me.

91
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,774
What's eating at you?

92
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm just under a lot of pressure.

93
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,787
Three of my men are dead...

94
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,865
including your pal, Lorenzo.

95
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,000
You don't know what's going on.

96
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,005
Don't you even give half a shit?

97
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,514
You still don't believe me...

98
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,470
that those preventers are bad?

99
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:06,313
I believe you.
They had stress cracks all over.

100
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,722
If those were new, something's funny.

101
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:13,400
Goddamn right, somethin' funny.
That's what I keep tellin' you.

102
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:18,193
And if you still can't figure out
why Jennings made me use them anyway...

103
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:22,121
check out the requisition file on Aegis-1.

104
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:23,868
Go ahead.

105
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:28,534
You got the clearance.
I can't get in there, but you can.

106
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,874
Check it out, then we'll talk.

107
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:32,535
Listen to me.

108
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,295
I left my daypack and some weapons
at your place.

109
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:38,301
I think I'll pick them up
and go up into the hills.

110
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:40,877
They're in the closet, just get them.

111
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,680
- Upstairs closet?
- Yeah.

112
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,633
Hey, Mike. Check it out: Cupcake's date!

113
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,018
Come on, Cupcake.

114
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,018
Don't cry. What happened?

115
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:58,146
Did your boyfriend leave you?

116
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:03,692
You know, Pocahontas is still available.

117
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:06,157
Cupcake's dream date!

118
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,527
Geronimo!

119
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,906
Cochise!

120
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,210
This way.

121
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:14,959
You still want that brew? I'll get it for you.
No hard feelings?

122
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,257
Come on.

123
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,174
Buck up for the suds, pal.

124
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:27,934
All right, here.

125
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,391
Mutt, get out. You piece of shit.

126
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:38,935
Come on.

127
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,899
Now, who're we gonna play with now?

128
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:49,029
Don't break anything, understand?

129
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:50,618
You wanna play with me?

130
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,451
You want a piece of this?

131
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:55,709
I'm afraid I'll fuckin' kill him.

132
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:58,707
Let's get outta here. Come on.

133
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,301
Oh, shit!

134
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:20,403
Jesus!

135
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:31,570
I've got you!

136
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:40,955
Well, let's see, that's Natives: 8,
and Oil Workers: 0.

137
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,626
Anybody else want to play with Cupcake?

138
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,999
Take him on.

139
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:52,674
My nuts!

140
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:58,519
Hey, buddy.
Don't be fucking with oil workers.

141
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:04,985
My balls!

142
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,452
You're a man, right?

143
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,745
This guy doesn't have a fuckin' clue.

144
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:20,838
Are you a man?

145
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:22,044
Oh, Jesus.

146
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:23,504
Am I a man?

147
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,591
Yeah. I got a big pair of balls
right between my legs.

148
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:30,681
Did you use those to beat up
on this little native man?

149
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,391
Big balls, okay.

150
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:35,145
We'll play a little game,
the hand-slap game.

151
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,977
One man leaves the circle.

152
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:38,890
I miss, you get a shot.

153
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:41,065
You miss, I get a shot.

154
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:45,108
All right, I'll play your game...

155
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:47,856
if you play my game.

156
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:51,988
I'll play your game afterwards,
if I'm still standing.

157
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,738
Because you're a tough guy...

158
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,573
and you got big balls.

159
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:56,863
All right.

160
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:00,079
Don't hurt him, Forrest!

161
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,209
Here we go, Mr. Big Balls.

162
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,501
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

163
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:08,092
You gotta be quick.

164
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:11,466
Why don't you just take
your best shot, pal?

165
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,480
This is the man's man.

166
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,060
I'm the cupcake.

167
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,401
One man leaves, here we go.

168
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,030
You're a man, right?

169
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:29,277
You're a man, right?

170
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:30,645
Here we go, "man"!

171
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:31,820
Put your hands up!

172
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,320
Put your hands up!

173
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,131
Shit.

174
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,843
That's disgusting. What is that, halibut?

175
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,314
"Buck up for the suds, pal."

176
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,643
Maybe he ate that at Maggie's.

177
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:14,070
You're a man, remember?
Big balls between your legs. Here we go.

178
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:15,993
Come on.

179
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:32,295
Did you see that?

180
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,979
What does it take?

181
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,271
What does it take to change
the essence of a man?

182
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:58,192
I need time to change.

183
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,864
Time.

184
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,494
I do too.

185
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,336
I do too.

186
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:15,927
Where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

187
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:17,590
Thank you, brother.

188
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:20,172
You are about to go on a sacred journey.

189
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,097
This journey will be good for all people.

190
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:25,803
- But you must be careful.
- Right.

191
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,854
- Give me the bottom line.
- ABC and CBS are leading with it at 7:00.

192
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:37,866
Local environmentalists want
investigations by the EPA...

193
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:40,489
OSHA and the Department
of Environmental Concerns.

194
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:44,791
Why all the heat? It's a small oil spill.
Accidents happen.

195
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,872
That's why we arranged for a commercial
and bought time on the in-state nets.

196
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:50,752
We can run it in the back.

197
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,338
Mike him that way.

198
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:55,382
Put it on another circuit
and bring it up to half.

199
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,589
- That's okay?
- Okay.

200
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,924
Yeah. Okay.

201
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:01,055
Go get 'em.

202
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,303
Thank you.

203
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:05,758
Ready?

204
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:09,388
We start with an out-of-focus world.

205
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,772
We pull back to one twig...

206
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:14,063
one branch...

207
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:16,650
and then the whole pristine forest.

208
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:17,979
Listen...

209
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:20,781
you have any great ideas...

210
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,579
just keep them
to your fucking self, okay...

211
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:26,663
and leave this shit to me.
Now, where do I stand?

212
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,202
Right over there.

213
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,910
All right, guys, we're ready to go.

214
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,125
Speed.

215
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:34,954
Marker.

216
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Action!

217
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:42,050
Lift the cards up.
I can't see them down there.

218
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,261
"Every year...

219
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:48,352
"hundreds of thousands
of Porcupine caribou...

220
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:51,440
"make their way down
from the Ogilvie Mountains...

221
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:53,765
"to the coastal plains of Alaska.

222
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:57,398
"They come to feed
off the tundra grasses...

223
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:00,315
"and to have their children.

224
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,822
"Children like these little guys...

225
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:04,982
"right here.

226
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,830
"You see, we at Aegis Oil believe...

227
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,407
"in protecting our natural treasures.

228
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:14,786
"We believe in keeping them safe...

229
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,122
"for future generations to enjoy.

230
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:19,999
"After all...

231
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:22,795
"the earth is our home too.

232
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,462
"Who cares?

233
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:29,096
"We do, at Aegis Oil."

234
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:31,510
Cut!

235
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,439
Fuck, these animals stink!
Bring me a washcloth!

236
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:37,349
Take that.

237
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,477
Tell me more about the fire.
What exactly did we lose?

238
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:44,233
We lost the rig.

239
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:46,863
- File a claim with Lloyd's of London.
- Already done.

240
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:50,488
There were three fatalities.
We'll know about two others today.

241
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:52,324
- All roughnecks?
- Yes, sir.

242
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,328
Offer the standard settlement.

243
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,337
Bruce, would you get the fuck out of here,
please?

244
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:01,546
Sir, I glanced at the standard settlement
recently...

245
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:05,679
and I think that the long-term benefits
for the surviving spouses are...

246
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:07,423
unnecessarily generous.

247
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:09,638
Now you know why I love this woman.

248
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,968
Amend the settlement as you see fit.

249
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,346
What's the position on Aegis-1?

250
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:22,816
Surely you understand that
on any substantial construction project...

251
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:25,941
particularly one of this size,
there are inevitable delays.

252
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,612
How long do they say now?

253
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:28,900
Twenty-one days.

254
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,118
Goddamn it, we have 13 days!

255
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,528
Thirteen!

256
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:35,115
Sir, we have two crews working full-time.

257
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,787
Put on a third crew!

258
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:40,413
Why is this so hard for you to understand?
Get out of here!

259
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,630
I don't give a shit! Let me explain...

260
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:45,042
- You look ten years younger.
- Get out!

261
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,430
Aegis-1 is going to be the biggest rig
and refinery...

262
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:54,391
on the face of this planet.

263
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,106
And if it is not on-line and operational
in 13 days...

264
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:04,606
then the oil rights will revert back
to the goddamn Eskimos.

265
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:07,731
That is not going to happen.

266
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,574
There's something else.

267
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,283
A friend of mine at the EPA says he hears
that they have an unnamed source...

268
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,698
making noises
about substandard equipment...

269
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:17,990
at Aegis-1.

270
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,997
There was discussion
of faulty preventers, specifically.

271
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,296
Hugh...

272
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:27,964
Palmer.

273
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,761
Now, wouldn't that be lovely?

274
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,847
We'd lose the oil rights...

275
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,806
worth billions of dollars a week.

276
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,351
I don't need that kind
of problem right now.

277
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:48,063
You're the people I hired...

278
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:51,277
to help me get rid
of these kinds of problems.

279
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,688
Life goes on.

280
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,892
Sure does.

281
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,290
Holy shit!

282
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:52,730
Sir, security alert in progress.

283
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,233
I'll take it on the box.

284
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:57,858
Nothing major, but you'd red-flagged
Forrest Taft for security access.

285
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,197
Yes, of course.

286
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:02,662
Well, he's into an Aegis-1 requisitions file.

287
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:06,747
He used his security code to gain access
to the main computer?

288
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,335
That is correct.

289
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,499
Well done.

290
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:12,379
It seems your friend, Forrest Taft...

291
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:15,585
has gained access
to a restricted Aegis-1 file.

292
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:17,885
A requisition file...

293
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:21,258
that includes the purchase
of all preventers.

294
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:22,802
That is a problem.

295
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,132
If I might...

296
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,813
l'd like to be the first to volunteer
to take care of that problem as well.

297
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:32,184
I suggest you take care
of the Hugh Palmer problem first.

298
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:34,854
He's the immediate threat.

299
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:36,321
He certainly is.

300
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,364
And change the access code.

301
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:00,971
Hugh?

302
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:02,882
Hello? Anybody home?

303
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,379
- Shit!
- Hugh?

304
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:06,423
Hugh Palmer.

305
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:13,555
There you are.

306
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,526
Good morning. How are you?

307
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:17,274
Otto and l...

308
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:20,906
came to offer you a ride
to Mr. Jennings' press conference.

309
00:25:20,992 --> 00:25:22,071
It starts in a few hours.

310
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,158
He'd like you to be there with him
just to clear up a few things.

311
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:28,707
What kind of things?

312
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:30,746
Well....

313
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:34,043
Actually, why don't we sit down?

314
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:36,331
Yeah, please, it's your home.

315
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,551
For starters, Hugh...

316
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:44,131
that spill in the cove the other day
was actually nobody's fault but your own.

317
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:47,047
And all this business
about substandard equipment...

318
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:49,763
has nothing to do with anything, does it?

319
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,093
You tell Jennings...

320
00:25:51,188 --> 00:25:54,142
l've rolled over for you bastards
long enough.

321
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:58,601
If he uses those same preventers
when Aegis-1 goes on-line...

322
00:26:00,364 --> 00:26:02,487
there'll be a goddamned disaster.

323
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:04,650
And I don't want any part of it.

324
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,078
It's just one guy talking, but I gotta tell you
that's a very poor attitude on your part.

325
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,499
Here's what we're gonna do.

326
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,708
Let's skip the press conference
all together?

327
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Good.

328
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:21,718
Because if this is what you truly believe...

329
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:26,264
l just don't see how your being there
will help Mr. Jennings in any way.

330
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:30,056
I am, however, gonna have to ask you
for your pipe tally books.

331
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:34,097
I'm certain you know
which ones I'm talking about.

332
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:37,107
They were the ones that you promised
to supply the EPA with.

333
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:38,192
Listen!

334
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,236
Stupid shit!

335
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,442
Tie him up!

336
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:57,795
You with me?

337
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,118
I've got nothing here!

338
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:01,372
You consider yourself a modern guy?

339
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:03,508
Sometimes modern guys...

340
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,803
are a little too modern
for their own fucking good.

341
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:08,264
- What the...
- Shit.

342
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:13,353
Which I think is going to be the case here...

343
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:17,645
because most modern guys put a logbook
under their computer.

344
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:19,143
Only thing is...

345
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,517
your computer's been downloaded.

346
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:25,196
I'm afraid that's a problem.

347
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:26,775
That's your problem.

348
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,695
Oh, yeah.

349
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:32,448
Why don't we cut through all this rat shit?

350
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:36,708
At present count,
you only have ten fingers.

351
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:40,127
I honestly don't want to have
to ask you ten times.

352
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:42,370
Where are your books?

353
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:45,217
I want the disks and I want those books.

354
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:48,049
I'm telling you, I don't have them!

355
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,050
Have you listened to yourself lately?
Have you?

356
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:54,935
Everything with you is "l, l, l."

357
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:57,144
There is no "l" in "team."

358
00:27:57,396 --> 00:27:59,353
It is T-E-A-M.

359
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:00,899
Team!

360
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:12,861
Better quit while you're ahead.
You know what I'm saying?

361
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,153
While you can still play marbles.

362
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,912
Where are the disks?
Where are the books?

363
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,079
Fuck you!

364
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:21,287
Fuck me? No, fuck you!

365
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:28,552
Hugh.

366
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:30,047
Go to hell.

367
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:31,429
Okay.

368
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:34,510
Okay, I'll go to hell.

369
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:39,772
Hugh, you want to talk
about faulty equipment?

370
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:42,978
I want to see how faulty this pipe cutter is.

371
00:28:46,737 --> 00:28:48,860
It's about the end of the line for you.

372
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:51,273
God, no! Otto, what are you doing?

373
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:12,174
Aegis Oil has now determined...

374
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:15,298
that what little spillage there was
in this accident...

375
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,091
was contained so effectively
by our environmental-impact crews...

376
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:22,768
that only minimal disruption
of the area's ecosystem will result.

377
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,813
What do you mean by "minimal"?

378
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:30,735
According to our analyst,
the presence ofpetroleum by-products...

379
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:34,736
and other toxins in lnulat Cove
will be back down to acceptable levels...

380
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:36,984
according to EPA guidelines...

381
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:39,870
within three months.

382
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:44,661
So, by the time your next fishing season
starts, the cove will be back to normal.

383
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:51,583
- There'll be a written statement.
- Wait.

384
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:53,254
Things won't ever be the same.

385
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:56,014
Aegis Oil always wants to talk about...

386
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:59,300
acceptable levels of this
and acceptable levels of that.

387
00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:02,975
But the people want to talk
about the poisons in their environment...

388
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:05,815
that weren't here
before Aegis Oil came to town.

389
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:09,268
We want to talk about the increased rates
of skin cancer...

390
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:11,395
women who fail to ovulate.

391
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:15,071
And when they do,
they give birth to abnormal babies.

392
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,691
That's what the Tribal Council wants
to talk about.

393
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:19,364
Is this the same Tribal Council...

394
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:23,203
who sold its oil and mineral rights
to my company 20 years ago?

395
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,322
Thank you very much.

396
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:27,786
The same Tribal Council
that will get those rights back...

397
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:32,125
12 days from today when you don't make
the start-up deadline for Aegis-1.

398
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:35,134
We'll make the deadline.

399
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,377
We'll see about that, Mr. Jennings.

400
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:40,014
Is that a threat?

401
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,097
Blood of our people is upon you,
Mr. Jennings.

402
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:46,895
- What is it, Liles?
- It's oil.

403
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:48,179
Thank God.

404
00:30:48,357 --> 00:30:50,148
This is a new fucking suit!

405
00:30:57,241 --> 00:31:00,444
You see that insane woman?
Ruined a perfectly good suit.

406
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:03,490
I'm just appalled at these people.
They're animals.

407
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,657
They're not crazy about you either.

408
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:07,872
The hell with the goddamn Eskimos.

409
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,831
I make my deadline,
I'll be in the driver's seat.

410
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:16,343
You know, I did a little snooping around
the other day.

411
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:18,880
I went over to Aegis-1...

412
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:22,470
and checked out the latest
requisition file. I understand now...

413
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,263
why you're using
the substandard preventers.

414
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:29,393
If you wait for the next shipment,
you'll never make the deadline.

415
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:33,527
I gotta say, I'm a little ashamed of you.

416
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:36,644
I'd just like to ask you something.

417
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,734
How much is enough?

418
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,319
How much money is enough?

419
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:46,613
I've got to get out of these clothes.

420
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,788
I'll talk to you later. Okay, Forrest?

421
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:51,782
Stick around.

422
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:06,636
Goddamn it, there's been another accident.

423
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,968
A substation on the north slope.

424
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,353
I know we've had our disagreements...

425
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,013
but can you do
this one last thing for me?

426
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:17,730
I thought we were gonna have a little talk.

427
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:19,067
After this.

428
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:24,066
Can you help us out with this, Forrest?

429
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:27,361
You're the only one with the expertise.

430
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:55,813
All right, I'm gonna go check it out,
see what I need.

431
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:59,023
If you smell anything, get out of here.

432
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:01,895
Don't worry. We know what we're doing.

433
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,202
Your turn, Mr. MacGruder.

434
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,772
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

435
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:33,063
We now have evidence
that both the lnulat Cove spill...

436
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,658
and the explosion yesterday
at Substation 101...

437
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,909
were the result of sabotage.

438
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,531
We have tentatively identified
at least two of the conspirators...

439
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:47,086
as former Aegis employees who appear
to have died in the latest explosion:

440
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,831
Forrest Taft and Hugh Palmer.

441
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:53,797
I hope that this brings to an end...

442
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:56,506
these wanton acts of destruction...

443
00:36:57,514 --> 00:37:02,306
as well as the crass attempts by
Mr. Ittok's Tribal Council to use them...

444
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,845
as a public-relations tool...

445
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:07,560
to derail the timely completion...

446
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:10,480
of the Aegis-1 refinery.

447
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:14,860
But you're talking about internal sabotage
by people in your own company.

448
00:37:14,948 --> 00:37:16,941
Is this how you run Aegis Oil?

449
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:18,820
Use your sense, man.

450
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:21,570
Thank you. No more questions.

451
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,679
This is my father.

452
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:30,516
Tell him...

453
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:32,893
my name is Forrest.

454
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:43,701
And he's Silook.

455
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,783
Thank you...

456
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:47,830
for rescuing me.

457
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:02,132
He says it was nothing.
He thought you were a bear.

458
00:39:02,221 --> 00:39:05,590
He still thinks you might be a bear.
He hasn't decided yet.

459
00:39:08,894 --> 00:39:10,305
You tell him...

460
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:13,731
l'm a mouse...

461
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:17,358
hiding from the hawks...

462
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:20,278
in the house of a raven.

463
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:36,158
He says that's just what a bear would say.

464
00:39:55,732 --> 00:39:57,890
He says you sound like a bear too.

465
00:40:04,657 --> 00:40:06,365
There's no sign of him yet, sir.

466
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,901
I can assure you we've been over
every inch of ground up here.

467
00:40:09,996 --> 00:40:13,697
Frankly, I don't see how
he could've survived that explosion.

468
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,827
Ifyour goddamn cleanup goons
haven't found his body...

469
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:18,746
then the son of a bitch is alive.

470
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:21,210
Find him, goddamn it. Do not fail.

471
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:23,007
Yes, sir. We won't.

472
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,760
Goddamn, that was pleasant.

473
00:40:27,096 --> 00:40:31,094
Mr. Jennings said to say hello to you
and he'd like us to keep looking.

474
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:41,229
Are you packed?

475
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,398
Excuse me?

476
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:44,735
You and l, we're going to Aegis-1.

477
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:47,196
Make sure we go on-line on time.

478
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,863
Yes, sir.

479
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:51,420
It's okay, boys, relax.
We're just going for a little ride.

480
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:58,135
Get these dogs off of me.

481
00:41:58,353 --> 00:42:00,595
You fucking dogs, get off of me.

482
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:20,165
Listen to me.

483
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,781
I didn't tell you the whole story,
I'm in trouble.

484
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:26,876
People are after me. If they come here,
you are in a lot of danger.

485
00:42:32,304 --> 00:42:34,546
He says, if you're healthy enough to steal...

486
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,797
you're healthy enough
to make your journey.

487
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:23,345
There was a time there were no people
on the earth...

488
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:28,642
until the fifth day, a man burst forth...

489
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,725
from the sacred place, full-grown.

490
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:38,190
Looking up...

491
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:40,618
he sees a raven.

492
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,247
Raven stared intently at man...

493
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,870
and said, "Wait here."

494
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,293
When Raven returned...

495
00:43:53,384 --> 00:43:56,670
he had made the birds, fish and animals.

496
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:01,932
Raven was worried man would destroy
all he had made to inhabit the earth.

497
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,227
So he formed Bear to be feared by man...

498
00:44:06,397 --> 00:44:08,224
and to protect the land.

499
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:11,315
Now the outsiders have come.

500
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,563
They're not afraid of the bear.

501
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:17,607
They do not respect the land.

502
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,581
We must find a way to teach them respect.

503
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:40,301
That's why I did not let you leave.

504
00:44:40,598 --> 00:44:41,598
Why me?

505
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:43,759
You fought Nanook the Bear.

506
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,259
You survived the cold of lmah the River.

507
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:51,729
Hear the gods sing.

508
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:54,941
I listen to what they say.

509
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:57,352
In you...

510
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:00,232
l have seen a great spirit.

511
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:03,368
Are you willing...

512
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:05,944
to discover the nature of that spirit?

513
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,371
You have died twice.

514
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:17,462
Now sleep, and be reborn.

515
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:23,424
You will fight your most difficult battle.

516
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:25,839
Then you will find your way back.

517
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:16,739
We're approaching the village now, sir.
We'll be setting down momentarily.

518
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,239
You the chief?

519
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,742
You the chief?

520
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,081
What about you? You the chief?

521
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:08,116
Seen this man?

522
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:10,379
Have you seen this man?

523
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,088
Spread out.

524
00:50:21,976 --> 00:50:22,976
Sir!

525
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,926
Goddamn it!
Is there any other sign of him?

526
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,356
No, sir.

527
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:29,058
All right, where the fuck is he?

528
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,649
Don't touch my father.
You give this to me. This is mine!

529
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,497
You!

530
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,285
Son of a bitch.

531
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,499
I will watch you die.

532
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,666
You saw. He attacked me!
He attacked me!

533
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,975
He says...

534
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,027
you're the spirit warrior.

535
00:52:41,865 --> 00:52:44,900
The gods have already decided your fate.

536
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:48,108
Eagle and the bear are your spirit guides.

537
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:51,954
This special amulet will...

538
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,709
help guide you in and out
of the spirit world.

539
00:52:59,048 --> 00:53:00,163
Tell him...

540
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:06,341
thank you...

541
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:10,011
and good-bye.

542
00:53:53,936 --> 00:53:55,644
You didn't find Taft...

543
00:53:56,314 --> 00:53:58,983
but you managed to kill
an unarmed Eskimo.

544
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:02,236
Well, I'm not an officer of the court, am l?

545
00:54:07,533 --> 00:54:09,526
In front of a dozen witnesses.

546
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:10,899
Mr. Jennings...

547
00:54:11,162 --> 00:54:14,246
that tribe completely misinterpreted
our presence there.

548
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:17,666
They panicked, attacked and forced us
to defend ourselves.

549
00:54:18,503 --> 00:54:22,286
You stay here and start planning
additional security for Aegis-1.

550
00:54:23,298 --> 00:54:25,041
We're running out of time.

551
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:32,594
What, you guys have had this all along?

552
00:54:32,766 --> 00:54:34,141
For emergencies.

553
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:04,581
Turn around. I think you'll see
something down there.

554
00:55:28,738 --> 00:55:31,490
Looks like they trashed this place
pretty good.

555
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:52,093
They've been here too?

556
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:02,723
There's a pair of pants over there.
Those boots, they should fit you.

557
00:56:03,522 --> 00:56:05,349
I've still got my .45.

558
00:56:12,698 --> 00:56:13,943
Good old Hugh.

559
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:18,405
Looks like they must have gone
on foot from here.

560
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:24,665
He's still one step ahead of us.

561
00:56:25,169 --> 00:56:27,874
Come on, let's go back.
Let's try Hugh's cabin.

562
00:56:30,424 --> 00:56:32,464
Put that pack down.

563
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:36,757
Come in here, look in here. Get me
all the shotgun shells you can, 12-gauge.

564
00:56:36,847 --> 00:56:38,555
We'll load up the truck.

565
00:56:44,063 --> 00:56:45,890
Looks like my friends are here to play.

566
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:48,139
Okay, get in there. Get in there.

567
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,686
Who the hell is this guy?
Just who the fuck is he?

568
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,689
You want to know who he is?

569
00:58:19,782 --> 00:58:20,980
Try this:

570
00:58:21,909 --> 00:58:25,444
Delve down into the deepest bowels
of your soul.

571
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:30,118
Try to imagine
the ultimate fucking nightmare...

572
00:58:31,002 --> 00:58:32,995
and that won't come close...

573
00:58:33,129 --> 00:58:35,798
to this son of a bitch
when he gets pissed.

574
00:58:39,802 --> 00:58:41,047
Well, sir....

575
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:44,222
I think we got that one covered.
He seems pretty pissed.

576
00:58:44,307 --> 00:58:45,172
Very pissed.

577
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:47,223
Then I suggest you try and stop him.

578
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,935
What about independent contractors?

579
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,060
I know of a group based
out of New Orleans.

580
00:58:51,147 --> 00:58:53,899
Independent contractors?
You mean, mercenaries?

581
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:56,688
Spartech used mercenaries
in the Philippines, sir.

582
00:58:56,778 --> 00:58:58,189
R.D.L. used them in Angola.

583
00:58:58,279 --> 00:59:00,568
You're talking about Third World countries.

584
00:59:00,657 --> 00:59:02,566
Alaska is a Third World country.

585
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:04,652
It's just one we happen to own.

586
00:59:20,884 --> 00:59:22,164
Just stay put.

587
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:30,469
Mr. Jennings, I'm Stone.

588
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,181
Were you able to get the files I requested?

589
00:59:34,314 --> 00:59:37,232
This guy's already committed
two acts of sabotage.

590
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:40,687
Mr. MacGruder will be going
along with you as liaison.

591
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:42,688
You'll be reporting to him...

592
00:59:42,906 --> 00:59:44,697
he'll be reporting to me.

593
00:59:44,783 --> 00:59:45,946
Understood?

594
00:59:46,743 --> 00:59:47,858
Understood.

595
00:59:47,953 --> 00:59:50,989
If there's no new information,
we'll get on with the search.

596
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:54,913
We've got quite a sophisticated
little listening post set up inside.

597
00:59:56,128 --> 00:59:57,622
We'll find your man.

598
00:59:57,754 --> 00:59:59,960
That brings us to another question.

599
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:06,801
How do you want him delivered?

600
01:00:11,768 --> 01:00:12,883
I see.

601
01:00:42,965 --> 01:00:44,044
Hey, brother.

602
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:45,331
Hey, brother.

603
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,048
Whatever's on this disk
is what Hugh died for.

604
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:53,053
These are the pressure readings
from Aegis-1.

605
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:55,763
The whole goddamned platform is
a time bomb.

606
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:59,348
As soon as that thing gets on-line,
it's gonna blow.

607
01:00:59,607 --> 01:01:01,683
It just won't take the pressure.

608
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:04,899
But what doesn't make sense to me...

609
01:01:05,404 --> 01:01:07,029
is these other wells.

610
01:01:07,114 --> 01:01:09,783
You see these high levels
of benzine and toluene?

611
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,990
They're five, ten times
what they should be.

612
01:01:12,078 --> 01:01:13,358
Deep-well injection.

613
01:01:13,454 --> 01:01:14,734
That's what I think.

614
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:15,612
What?

615
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:18,162
They'll play a well out for all it's got.

616
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,666
Then they take the deadly toxins
they have from everywhere else...

617
01:01:21,754 --> 01:01:26,297
they'll reverse the pumps,
blow it back in there, top it off with crude.

618
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:29,970
Or they'll broker the space
to another company.

619
01:01:30,846 --> 01:01:31,961
Clever.

620
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:37,302
This is just one of the many little activities
that Jennings uses to...

621
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,021
finance Aegis-1 and the rest
of his dog-shit empire.

622
01:01:45,027 --> 01:01:46,770
It's like I always say...

623
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:48,649
we gotta blow it...

624
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,648
and we gotta blow it now.

625
01:01:56,664 --> 01:01:59,120
Blowing up Aegis-1 is not the answer.

626
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,290
There are enough dead bodies.

627
01:02:01,544 --> 01:02:03,371
Let's leave it to the authorities.

628
01:02:03,462 --> 01:02:05,502
I know the press. Let's contact the press.

629
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,831
Haven't you learned anything
from my father?

630
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:10,083
What do you want me to learn, Masu?

631
01:02:10,886 --> 01:02:15,844
Do you really think that this hocus-pocus
spirit stuff is gonna help us now?

632
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:19,968
What do you think, an angel will
miraculously come down out of the sky...

633
01:02:20,061 --> 01:02:23,644
and stop, say 350 billion tons of oil
from being spilled...

634
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:25,724
into our oceans every year?

635
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,694
Maybe a ghost will stop all the cars
from using gasoline.

636
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,356
Maybe somehow...

637
01:02:31,072 --> 01:02:33,397
some spirit will trip the big switch...

638
01:02:33,491 --> 01:02:36,741
and the technology that's been
repressed for the last 70 years...

639
01:02:36,828 --> 01:02:41,205
will suddenly be ours and it'll be
a better place to live, a beautiful place.

640
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:45,419
Maybe I should send my spirit guide over
to Aegis-1 and stop it from going on-line...

641
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,076
so that Jennings can't fuck you
and your people...

642
01:02:48,173 --> 01:02:50,415
out of your land
and your way of life forever.

643
01:02:50,508 --> 01:02:53,081
See, I loved the spirit world
and your father.

644
01:02:53,178 --> 01:02:54,720
But it doesn't matter right now.

645
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:58,220
What really matters is the cold,
hard reality of this world.

646
01:02:58,349 --> 01:03:00,176
That's what we've gotta deal with.

647
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:02,474
I didn't want to resort to violence.

648
01:03:02,687 --> 01:03:06,352
I don't have a choice and I'm not taking
any chances this time...

649
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,143
because I can't.

650
01:03:17,285 --> 01:03:19,527
I'll go into the mountains
over the back ridge.

651
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:23,239
I don't think anybody will be able
to follow us up there by horseback.

652
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,453
Give me this FX shotgun
with all the magazines and ammo you got.

653
01:03:26,544 --> 01:03:27,575
Give me one M-14...

654
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,746
a couple of 45s and the SSG.

655
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,620
And I think that'll do it.

656
01:03:35,762 --> 01:03:36,960
You ride good?

657
01:03:37,055 --> 01:03:39,178
Of course. I'm a Native American.

658
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:14,291
Are you aware that you don't have
one shred of information...

659
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:18,511
on this renegade prior to his coming
to work for Aegis Oil?

660
01:04:19,263 --> 01:04:21,220
Yes, we are aware. So what?

661
01:04:21,306 --> 01:04:24,093
So what was he doing?
What's his military record?

662
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:27,387
Where in the hell did he receive
his EOD training at?

663
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:30,309
We couldn't access that information
at the time.

664
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,317
And now we don't feel
it's germane to his capture.

665
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,147
What do you got on the screen?

666
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:36,696
Nothing yet, sir.

667
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:47,705
Our man in DC finds nothing
on this guy before 1987.

668
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,497
Which means either he was born
fully grown...

669
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,294
or his background is so secret...

670
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:55,380
it doesn't even flag "top-secret"
when you run hisjacket.

671
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:56,877
That's beautiful.

672
01:04:57,009 --> 01:04:59,334
What is it?
What's that supposed to mean?

673
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,753
If I had a guess,
I'd say it means he's Company.

674
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:04,967
Forrest Taft has been in the CIA?
I don't think so.

675
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,009
CIA. NSA, maybe.

676
01:05:07,186 --> 01:05:08,186
DOD?

677
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:11,022
Whatever he is, he's a damn problem.

678
01:05:24,495 --> 01:05:25,610
Oh, my God.

679
01:05:25,746 --> 01:05:28,450
I stocked this place up
a couple of years ago.

680
01:05:29,582 --> 01:05:30,862
Just in case.

681
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,536
In case of what?

682
01:05:32,668 --> 01:05:35,373
In case you declare war
on some small country?

683
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:36,630
Yeah.

684
01:05:45,806 --> 01:05:47,004
What are you doing?

685
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:48,510
This is a com unit.

686
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:50,890
I know they're coming to look for me.

687
01:05:51,437 --> 01:05:53,180
And if I keep a signal...

688
01:05:53,773 --> 01:05:55,600
they'll be able to find me...

689
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:57,684
and that's just what I want.

690
01:06:08,204 --> 01:06:09,782
Bingo. I've got something.

691
01:06:09,872 --> 01:06:11,035
Six-two degrees...

692
01:06:11,123 --> 01:06:14,077
nine minutes by 148 degrees even.

693
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:17,912
I know that country. A chopper's not going
to do us much good.

694
01:06:18,464 --> 01:06:20,457
We need to get in there on horseback.

695
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:23,670
Get on the radio, Spinks.
Get us some horses up there.

696
01:06:23,928 --> 01:06:27,677
Let's take the chopper back up
and spot him. We'll flush him out.

697
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:31,135
If this rig isn't on-line...

698
01:06:31,561 --> 01:06:32,841
MacGruder on 2.

699
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:37,607
I'm listening.

700
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:42,437
Sir, we found something. We're now
in the areajust north of Taft's cabin.

701
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:45,949
C-4.

702
01:07:30,994 --> 01:07:34,778
Get this up to the horses
as fast as you can and stay out of sight.

703
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:20,039
Let's get out of here.

704
01:09:39,705 --> 01:09:40,705
There he is.

705
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:42,746
We've got him now. Let's go.

706
01:09:53,469 --> 01:09:54,584
Hold it up.

707
01:10:08,067 --> 01:10:10,640
Looks like he kept to the trail
after he set it.

708
01:10:10,736 --> 01:10:13,108
You had me spooked on the chopper
for a second.

709
01:10:13,197 --> 01:10:15,438
I thought this guy was gonna be good.

710
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:17,322
A Cub Scout could've found that.

711
01:10:17,408 --> 01:10:20,611
You'd better watch it.
Talk like that'll get you killed.

712
01:10:21,371 --> 01:10:22,534
Fuck you.

713
01:10:29,212 --> 01:10:30,077
Hold it up!

714
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:31,416
Wait a minute!

715
01:10:34,842 --> 01:10:36,633
Son of a bitch, cease fire!

716
01:10:37,053 --> 01:10:38,962
What the hell are you doing?

717
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:42,170
Hold your fire!

718
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:47,139
Cease fire, damn it!

719
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:50,017
There's nothing there.
What the hell are you shooting at?

720
01:10:50,108 --> 01:10:52,017
- Put it away!
- I put it away!

721
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,391
Let's go!

722
01:12:09,603 --> 01:12:10,718
Come on.

723
01:12:44,513 --> 01:12:45,676
This guy's good.

724
01:12:45,764 --> 01:12:49,347
At least we know where in the hell
he's going to now, don't we, Mac?

725
01:12:49,434 --> 01:12:50,679
Damn right.

726
01:12:51,978 --> 01:12:52,978
Aegis-1.

727
01:12:56,858 --> 01:12:59,776
The only way we can get to the rig
is through the refinery.

728
01:12:59,861 --> 01:13:02,530
It doesn't look like anyone is expecting us.

729
01:13:04,449 --> 01:13:06,940
Nothing could be further from the truth.

730
01:13:25,386 --> 01:13:28,387
Stay out of sight.
I'm gonna go blow the generator.

731
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,395
I got something!

732
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,931
How much time, Mr. Harold?

733
01:14:55,226 --> 01:14:57,764
Should be on-line in three,
three and a half hours.

734
01:14:57,853 --> 01:14:59,762
Sir, this is John Stokes.

735
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:03,105
He's the special agent in charge
of the FBI Anti-Terrorist Unit.

736
01:15:03,191 --> 01:15:06,809
We now believe that this maniac Taft
is on his way here...

737
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,645
and poses a genuine terrorist threat.

738
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,198
We're in position.

739
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:12,944
Thank you, Mr. Stokes.

740
01:15:43,273 --> 01:15:45,431
I'll be back. I gotta take a piss.

741
01:16:32,405 --> 01:16:35,157
I thought you wanted us to kill
this motherfucker.

742
01:16:35,241 --> 01:16:38,573
How are we supposed to shoot him
with all these cops here?

743
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:40,113
I don't think so.

744
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:43,407
It's essential we have the FBI here
to cover ourselves legally...

745
01:16:43,499 --> 01:16:45,326
and it will help with the press.

746
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:47,659
They'll take the fall
for anything that happens.

747
01:16:47,753 --> 01:16:51,454
Don't worry about the FBl. They couldn't
find a hooker in a whorehouse.

748
01:16:51,548 --> 01:16:54,999
This guy'd have to be
out of his mind to try to get in here now.

749
01:16:55,093 --> 01:16:57,050
Then we should count on that.

750
01:16:57,387 --> 01:17:00,174
Forrest Taft is the patron saint
of the impossible.

751
01:17:00,265 --> 01:17:02,590
If you'd done your job
as you were supposed to...

752
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,842
it wouldn't have come to this!

753
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:09,975
I pay you people a hell of a lot of money
to avoid situations like this.

754
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:14,404
And the one time shit happens,
you pricks let everything go out of control!

755
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,608
Get out of here. This place's gonna blow!

756
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,131
What's the matter? What's happening?

757
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,503
Emergency generators!

758
01:17:42,599 --> 01:17:46,300
- Security cameras are out.
- We're losing power! Computers are out.

759
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,684
- We have to reboot.
- How long will that take?

760
01:17:48,772 --> 01:17:50,480
Four, five minutes, tops.

761
01:17:50,774 --> 01:17:52,434
He's back.

762
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,348
Who are you calling?

763
01:17:54,445 --> 01:17:57,066
I'm just gonna reach out
and touch somebody.

764
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:08,373
What the hell was that?

765
01:18:14,088 --> 01:18:16,377
Taft! You son of a bitch!

766
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,713
Goddamn it!

767
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:29,310
It's Tooley. What's up?

768
01:18:29,437 --> 01:18:32,771
This shit's poison!
We have to get the fuck out of here!

769
01:18:33,774 --> 01:18:35,019
Come with me.

770
01:18:35,318 --> 01:18:36,516
Come with me.

771
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,231
Go, go, go...!

772
01:18:43,326 --> 01:18:44,820
Let's go!

773
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:47,073
We got an unstable condition here!

774
01:18:47,163 --> 01:18:49,072
Get your goddamn people out of here!

775
01:18:49,165 --> 01:18:50,659
I'll tell Jennings.

776
01:18:52,752 --> 01:18:53,915
Fuck me!

777
01:18:55,171 --> 01:18:56,416
Oh, thank God.

778
01:18:57,256 --> 01:18:58,750
What's the damage?

779
01:19:00,343 --> 01:19:03,510
He took out Structures 8, 12, and 21.

780
01:19:04,013 --> 01:19:07,263
That's not enough. He must get
to the rig to do any real damage.

781
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:10,517
Between Stone's men and the FBl,
he'll never get there.

782
01:19:10,937 --> 01:19:13,095
He'd need a miracle to stop us now.

783
01:19:14,815 --> 01:19:16,689
See over here, these three doors?

784
01:19:16,776 --> 01:19:18,484
Here's where we are now.

785
01:19:18,694 --> 01:19:21,102
I need you to place two satchels
here and here.

786
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:23,106
Then open this door and this door.

787
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,824
We want to create a wind tunnel...

788
01:19:24,909 --> 01:19:27,530
so the wind will carry the fire through.

789
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,827
This man is inside the refinery.

790
01:19:29,914 --> 01:19:32,322
Now, we can't allow him get to the rig.

791
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,783
What I want you to do is snipe the guy.

792
01:19:34,877 --> 01:19:36,953
You can see much better if you're higher.

793
01:19:37,046 --> 01:19:38,326
We gotta talk.

794
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:39,752
Disperse.

795
01:19:40,383 --> 01:19:41,961
We've got a big problem here.

796
01:19:42,051 --> 01:19:44,459
Intel tells us we're dealing with one guy.

797
01:19:44,554 --> 01:19:46,759
We think we got
a fucking fire team out there.

798
01:19:46,846 --> 01:19:50,215
My guy in DC tells me that
we're not dealing with a student here...

799
01:19:50,308 --> 01:19:52,016
we're dealing with a professor.

800
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:55,056
Any time the military has
an operation that can't fail...

801
01:19:55,146 --> 01:19:57,269
they call this guy in to train the troops.

802
01:19:57,357 --> 01:19:59,184
He's the kind of guy who'd drink...

803
01:19:59,276 --> 01:20:02,194
a gallon of gasoline
so he can piss in your campfire.

804
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:04,735
You could drop this guy off
at the Arctic Circle...

805
01:20:04,823 --> 01:20:07,658
wearing bikini underwear,
without his toothbrush...

806
01:20:07,742 --> 01:20:11,076
and tomorrow afternoon
he's gonna show up at your poolside...

807
01:20:11,162 --> 01:20:13,914
with a million-dollar smile
and a fistful ofpesos.

808
01:20:13,999 --> 01:20:16,039
This guy's a professional, you got me?

809
01:20:16,126 --> 01:20:17,537
If he reaches this rig...

810
01:20:17,627 --> 01:20:21,292
we're all going to be nothing
but a big hole in the middle ofAlaska.

811
01:20:21,381 --> 01:20:23,208
Let's go find him and kill him...

812
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,257
and get rid of the son of a bitch.

813
01:20:25,343 --> 01:20:27,134
Look on the middle deck.

814
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:27,601
We've got to get out, and I mean now.
The FBI has already pulled back.

815
01:21:27,696 --> 01:21:29,024
Excuse me?

816
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,067
This whole place is going to blow.

817
01:21:31,158 --> 01:21:35,452
If you want to go down with your ship,
that's fine, but I am not that stupid!

818
01:21:35,537 --> 01:21:37,079
Oh, yes you are.

819
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:42,912
Where are you going?

820
01:21:44,421 --> 01:21:45,915
To the bathroom.

821
01:21:49,885 --> 01:21:51,925
Stay here, I'm going to the rig.

822
01:22:19,748 --> 01:22:21,076
Let me out!

823
01:22:28,757 --> 01:22:29,757
Listen to me.

824
01:22:29,842 --> 01:22:32,511
If you really want Jennings,
you're gonna need me.

825
01:22:32,595 --> 01:22:34,801
I got files, tapes, books....

826
01:22:35,014 --> 01:22:38,050
- You better have them on you right now!
- I got them!

827
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:46,353
Fuck him!

828
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:09,039
I want you to protect this entrance
like it was your sister's cherry, Tonto.

829
01:23:09,922 --> 01:23:11,998
Put people over here, over here.

830
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:15,922
I'm going to the rig.
I'm gonna put Pump 3 on-line.

831
01:23:16,012 --> 01:23:18,681
That'll be enough for me
to keep my leases...

832
01:23:18,765 --> 01:23:20,971
without any help from you pricks!

833
01:23:22,143 --> 01:23:26,141
You're in charge here, Tonto.
Do not let that son of a bitch in here!

834
01:23:26,564 --> 01:23:29,351
What do you think, stock in or out?
What do you think?

835
01:23:29,442 --> 01:23:32,063
I don't think it's gonna make
much difference.

836
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:36,400
Well, I do. See, when it's out, I feel
like a pussy, you know what I'm saying?

837
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:39,575
And when it's in,
it feels like meaner or something.

838
01:23:39,661 --> 01:23:43,326
When I kill the son of a bitch,
I want to feel good about myself.

839
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:57,837
What the hell is this?

840
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:01,390
Gasoline.

841
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:03,217
Get the fuck out of here!

842
01:24:12,318 --> 01:24:16,019
Jesus Christ, this motherfucker's good!
I told you he was good, didn't l?

843
01:24:16,114 --> 01:24:18,272
He's good and he's coming this way.

844
01:24:43,598 --> 01:24:45,223
Take her to Level 6.

845
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,475
Here he comes.

846
01:24:52,816 --> 01:24:54,394
Open wide, sweetheart.

847
01:25:06,496 --> 01:25:07,776
Cover my back.

848
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:23,086
Warning: Emergency generator on.

849
01:25:29,936 --> 01:25:32,392
Warning: Main generator locked out.

850
01:25:49,998 --> 01:25:50,998
Okay.

851
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:53,416
Give me that shape charge.

852
01:26:02,761 --> 01:26:06,296
I'm gonna set some charges which
will cause the preventer to implode...

853
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:08,761
and that will prevent an oil spill.

854
01:26:10,851 --> 01:26:12,927
That's right, go ahead, Big Boy.

855
01:26:13,104 --> 01:26:14,384
Make your move.

856
01:26:14,605 --> 01:26:17,310
I'll shove this goddamn shotgun
up your ass...

857
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,021
and blow the top
of your fucking head off.

858
01:26:28,703 --> 01:26:31,028
You're a bunch of gutless pricks!

859
01:26:31,622 --> 01:26:32,785
All of you!

860
01:26:37,878 --> 01:26:39,787
- Help me with this!
- Fuck you!

861
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,422
Yellow bastard!

862
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:51,723
He's still getting it on-line.
That stupid asshole!

863
01:26:52,226 --> 01:26:53,886
I can't believe what he's doing.

864
01:26:53,978 --> 01:26:55,638
Lose your gear, let's go.

865
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:59,775
We've got less than three minutes
before this whole fucking place blows.

866
01:27:05,573 --> 01:27:06,736
There he is!

867
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:08,863
Don't shoot!

868
01:27:08,951 --> 01:27:09,951
Hold your fire!

869
01:27:10,036 --> 01:27:12,112
You'll blow us to kingdom come!

870
01:27:13,622 --> 01:27:15,081
Let's go!

871
01:27:22,965 --> 01:27:24,459
No firing! Come on!

872
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:27,210
Move it. Let's go, let's go.

873
01:27:27,344 --> 01:27:30,215
I'll pull the heat.
When they come to me, you go.

874
01:27:40,149 --> 01:27:42,189
I got him. I got him over here!

875
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:43,640
Where? Where?

876
01:27:43,735 --> 01:27:45,313
Where the fuck is he?

877
01:28:28,029 --> 01:28:29,029
Forrest.

878
01:28:36,204 --> 01:28:38,280
My long lost friend, Michael.

879
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:41,906
Who's this?

880
01:28:42,669 --> 01:28:45,872
- This the slope bitch you've been banging?
- No, not her.

881
01:28:46,089 --> 01:28:49,588
This the one that got you all concerned
about the dirty snow?

882
01:28:49,717 --> 01:28:51,045
Jesus, Forrest...

883
01:28:51,136 --> 01:28:54,837
you and me, we bought hookers
better than this for five bucks in Bangkok.

884
01:28:54,931 --> 01:28:57,885
You know, I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

885
01:28:57,976 --> 01:29:00,681
What does one say to a man
with no conscience?

886
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:05,726
I'd like to tell you about the millions
of people that you've made suffer...

887
01:29:05,942 --> 01:29:09,311
but I'd be a total idiot
to think that you'd care.

888
01:29:10,405 --> 01:29:12,445
You're a piece of shit, Michael.

889
01:29:12,907 --> 01:29:14,105
Scum of the earth.

890
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,691
I don't know what you did with my rig...

891
01:29:17,245 --> 01:29:19,486
but whatever it was,
I want you to stop it.

892
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:21,786
Turn it off. I'm leaving.

893
01:29:21,915 --> 01:29:23,374
I got a better idea.

894
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:27,504
You're a macho man with a code of honor.
You won't shoot me in the back.

895
01:29:44,563 --> 01:29:45,678
Go ahead.

896
01:29:46,064 --> 01:29:47,475
Shoot me! Go on.

897
01:29:47,774 --> 01:29:49,767
Shoot me, you fucking coward!

898
01:29:50,569 --> 01:29:52,692
You haven't got the fucking guts!

899
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,322
I wouldn't dirty my bullets.

900
01:29:54,406 --> 01:29:55,900
You macho asshole!

901
01:29:56,033 --> 01:29:57,408
Go ahead, shoot!

902
01:29:57,618 --> 01:29:59,361
Dirty one for me, Forrest.

903
01:30:09,463 --> 01:30:11,005
That's for my father!

904
01:30:22,559 --> 01:30:23,757
We won't make it!

905
01:30:23,852 --> 01:30:25,180
We're going to die!

906
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,346
Calm down. We're not going to die.

907
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:29,515
We stopped the spill, didn't we?

908
01:30:30,943 --> 01:30:32,734
Your father would be proud of us.

909
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:37,149
Listen to me. I'll make a path.
You stay on my heels and don't look back!

910
01:32:37,275 --> 01:32:39,268
I'd like to start off by saying...

911
01:32:39,361 --> 01:32:40,641
thank you...

912
01:32:40,904 --> 01:32:43,573
to the brothers and sisters
who've come here today...

913
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:45,365
representing this cause.

914
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:48,071
I've been asked by Mr. Ittok
and the Tribal Council...

915
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:52,028
to speak to you and the press
about the injustices brought against us...

916
01:32:52,123 --> 01:32:54,958
by some government officials
and big business.

917
01:32:55,293 --> 01:32:58,294
How many of you out there have heard
of alternative engines...

918
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:02,129
engines that can run on anything
from alcohol to garbage or water?

919
01:33:02,217 --> 01:33:05,503
Or carburetors that can get
hundreds of miles to the gallon?

920
01:33:05,595 --> 01:33:09,260
Or electric or magnetic engines
that can practically run forever?

921
01:33:09,349 --> 01:33:12,718
You don't know about them,
because if they were to come into use...

922
01:33:12,811 --> 01:33:15,136
they'd put the oil companies
out of business.

923
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:19,607
The concept of the internal combustion
engine has been obsolete for over 50 years.

924
01:33:19,693 --> 01:33:23,144
But because of the oil cartels
and corrupt government regulation...

925
01:33:23,238 --> 01:33:27,865
we and the rest of the world have been
forced to use gasoline for over 100 years.

926
01:33:27,951 --> 01:33:30,656
Big business is primarily responsible
for destroying...

927
01:33:30,745 --> 01:33:34,280
the water we drink, the air we breathe
and the food we eat.

928
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,491
They have no care
for the world they destroy...

929
01:33:37,586 --> 01:33:40,291
only for the money
they make in the process.

930
01:33:40,672 --> 01:33:42,830
How many oil spills can we endure?

931
01:33:43,466 --> 01:33:45,672
Millions and millions of gallons of oil...

932
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,094
are destroying the ocean
and the many forms of life it supports.

933
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:53,723
Among these is plankton, which supplies
60 to 90% of the earth's oxygen.

934
01:33:54,019 --> 01:33:56,177
It supports the entire marine ecosystem...

935
01:33:56,271 --> 01:33:59,438
which forms the basis
of our planet's food supply.

936
01:34:00,108 --> 01:34:01,851
But the plankton is dying.

937
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:06,068
I thought, "Well, let's go
to some remote state or country...

938
01:34:06,155 --> 01:34:07,733
"anywhere on earth."

939
01:34:07,823 --> 01:34:10,112
But in doing a little research, I realized...

940
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:13,486
that these people broker toxic waste
all over the world.

941
01:34:13,579 --> 01:34:17,707
They basically control the legislation and,
in fact, they control the law.

942
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:22,669
The law says no company
can be fined over $25,000 a day.

943
01:34:23,422 --> 01:34:25,628
If a company's making $10 million a day...

944
01:34:25,716 --> 01:34:28,207
by dumping lethal toxic waste
into the ocean...

945
01:34:28,302 --> 01:34:31,220
it's only good business
to continue doing this.

946
01:34:31,305 --> 01:34:34,425
They influence the media
so that they can control our minds.

947
01:34:34,516 --> 01:34:36,924
They've made it a crime
to speak out for ourselves.

948
01:34:37,019 --> 01:34:40,518
If we do so, we're called conspiracy nuts
and we're laughed at.

949
01:34:40,606 --> 01:34:44,224
We're angry because we're all being
chemically and genetically damaged...

950
01:34:44,318 --> 01:34:46,227
and we don't even realize it.

951
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,072
Unfortunately, this will affect our children.

952
01:34:49,323 --> 01:34:51,731
We go to work each day
and right under our noses...

953
01:34:51,825 --> 01:34:56,321
we see our car and the car in front of us
spewing noxious, poisonous gases...

954
01:34:56,705 --> 01:34:59,030
that are all accumulative poisons.

955
01:34:59,333 --> 01:35:02,916
These poisons kill us slowly,
even when we see no effect.

956
01:35:03,504 --> 01:35:06,955
How many of us would've believed
if we were told 20 years ago...

957
01:35:07,049 --> 01:35:10,999
that on a certain day we wouldn't be able
to see 50 feet in front of us...

958
01:35:11,095 --> 01:35:13,586
that we wouldn't be able
to take a deep breath...

959
01:35:13,681 --> 01:35:16,717
because the air would be a mass
ofpoisonous gas.

960
01:35:16,892 --> 01:35:19,050
That we couldn't drink out of our faucets...

961
01:35:19,144 --> 01:35:21,849
that we'd have to buy water
out of bottles.

962
01:35:22,314 --> 01:35:25,730
Our most common and God-given rights
have been taken away from us.

963
01:35:25,818 --> 01:35:27,063
Unfortunately...

964
01:35:27,152 --> 01:35:30,984
the reality of our lives is so grim
that nobody wants to hear it.

965
01:35:31,115 --> 01:35:33,108
I've been asked what we can do.

966
01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:38,036
I think we need a responsible body
of people that can actually represent us...

967
01:35:38,122 --> 01:35:39,664
rather than big business.

968
01:35:39,748 --> 01:35:41,656
This body ofpeople must not allow...

969
01:35:41,749 --> 01:35:46,245
the introduction of anything into our
environment that is not biodegradable...

970
01:35:46,879 --> 01:35:50,082
or able to be chemically neutralized
upon production.

971
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:55,254
Finally, as long as there's profit to be made
from the polluting of our earth...

972
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:59,048
companies and individuals will continue
to do what they want.

973
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:03,556
We have to force these companies
to operate safely and responsibly...

974
01:36:03,855 --> 01:36:07,805
with all our best interests in mind,
so that when they don't...

975
01:36:07,984 --> 01:36:12,646
we can take back our resources and our
hearts and our minds, and do what's right.

976
01:36:15,366 --> 01:36:19,411
Kompasla, the great spirit,
I ask you to bless all the people here...

977
01:36:19,912 --> 01:36:23,281
all the grandmas, all the grandpas,
and the little ones.

978
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:25,784
We have the four directions...

979
01:36:25,918 --> 01:36:27,661
and I want to bless...

980
01:36:27,962 --> 01:36:32,174
the future generation
and the lndian nation, our people...

981
01:36:32,508 --> 01:36:34,168
to be strong again.

982
01:36:34,427 --> 01:36:35,802
Spotted Eagle...

983
01:36:37,138 --> 01:36:39,214
the earth is our grandma.

984
01:38:03,056 --> 01:38:04,056
Look.
