1
00:00:16,232 --> 00:00:20,031
Also, I'm leaving for Daejon tomorrow.

2
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:22,131
<i>She's leaving because of me.</i>

3
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:26,231
You know, right, that I'm leaving
because I don't want to see you?

4
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:30,331
<i>Hye Rim, too, is leaving because of me.</i>

5
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:34,131
<i>When I was young, even my
mom left because of me.</i>

6
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,932
Let's not see each other again, Soo Hyun.

00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:10,132
<i>I have to disappear.</i>

13
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,732
<i>Episode 15</i>

14
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,831
Are you still feeling cold?
Did it get any better?

15
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:27,632
Thanks to you, it got better.

16
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:37,431
What was that sound?

17
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:40,231
It's the doctor. What do we do, Noona?

18
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,732
What do you mean? We
have to get out quickly.

19
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:52,931
Doctor, you're back?

20
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,232
Yeah.

21
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,031
Yoo Rim, you're here?

22
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:11,832
Yes.

23
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:19,831
What's wrong with him? It's past 12 am and he
doesn't find it strange that I'm at your house?

24
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:22,832
For now, let's get you out. Hurry.

25
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:14,432
Doctor.

26
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,532
Doctor!

27
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,832
Doctor, Doctor!

28
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:44,032
<i>What's wrong? Why would he drink so
much when he can't hold his liquor?</i>

29
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:48,832
- Goodbye.- Goodbye.

30
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:57,232
Oh my, Chairman.

31
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:09,031
I thought I should repay you
for the debt I owe you.

32
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:12,031
It's okay if he joins us, right?

33
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,832
Yes.

34
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:25,931
Madame Go, can you help me out?

35
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,431
This guy wants to marry my daughter,

36
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,931
please look into his
personality and fortune.

37
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:36,331
Ah, Doctor Choi, since you're a
psychologist, you'd also know, right?

38
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,031
Please look into it together.

39
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:43,531
Asking a psychologist to look into a person's fortune
and to evaluate him seems to be a severely biased view.

40
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:47,131
His drooping eyes make him appear
as a mild mannered person.

41
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:53,331
On top of that, being so stiff in an identification
photo is evidence that he's not a crafty person.

42
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:59,831
Being raised by a single mother bothers me a bit
but... Wow, his credentials are really impressive.

43
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,531
Seeing that he's done a lot of volunteer work shows that he
seems to have a lot of consideration for others as well.

44
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:09,032
He seems like a decent person. More
importantly, Yeon Woo likes him.

45
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:12,331
Not all people with drooping
eyes are mild mannered.

46
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:17,431
Among the most violent criminals, many have
drooping eyes. And being raised by a single mother?

47
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:23,731
It's already an established theory that the presence of one's parents
doesn't have much relevance in that person's life. Most of all,

48
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:27,131
the fact that you're asking a fortune teller to
evaluate this person to begin with is wrong.

49
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:29,131
A fortune teller uses their senses

50
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:34,131
to just barely tell someone's fortune. They
can never know what's inside that person.

51
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:37,631
Doctor Choi, you're as fastidious as ever.

52
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:43,831
But, from what you both have said, I
will have to meet him one more time.

53
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:47,831
What do you think? Madame Go,
would you also like to meet him?

54
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:52,231
I don't have time. I'm going
to leave the cafe soon.

55
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,731
But, why? Is something wrong?

56
00:05:54,732 --> 00:06:00,731
Yes, there was something that happened. Also,
there's an unni in Daejon who tells fortunes.

57
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:04,831
Since it's the new semester, it's the
peak season and she asked me to help.

58
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:08,531
There's a chance I won't be coming back.

59
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:09,831
But, why?

60
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:14,731
She will be immigrating to Australia soon
so she asked me to take over the cafe.

61
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:18,931
The location and earnings are
better than where I am now.

62
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:23,231
That's why I'm thinking
about moving for good.

63
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:26,931
That's such a shame.

64
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:29,832
You'll come running when
I ask for you, right?

65
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:11,631
What?

66
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:15,732
Did you hear, Doctor? Right now, Noona
Hye Rim is packing her bags and leaving.

67
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:27,411
Choi Soo Hyun didn't even go to work. What lingering
feelings do you have left to keep looking back?

68
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,131
<i>The doctor is going to come soon.</i>

69
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:34,231
What will he do when he comes? Will he hold on to her and
ask her not to leave or kneel down and beg for forgiveness?

70
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:39,031
Your doctor will never do such things. Even
if he does, my sister will leave either way.

71
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:42,131
Right Unni? You won't look back, right?

72
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,632
Of course.

73
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,032
Ji Ho take care of yourself. Yoo Rim,
I will contact you when I get there.

74
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,331
Where did you say she was going?

75
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,431
<i>What?</i>

76
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:01,731
Where is Hye Rim leaving from? Where is it?

77
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,332
<i>Daejon42,500 Won ($42.50)</i>

78
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:47,431
Excuse me, where is the bus to Daejon?

79
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,932
<i>It left a moment ago.</i>

80
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:59,631
It's the elementary school I went to.

81
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:03,831
I stayed here until the fifth
grade and moved to Seoul.

82
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:06,731
So that's why you bought
a house on Jeju Island.

83
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:12,031
I remember the old times and
I can also practice here.

84
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:13,531
Would you like to hear it once?

85
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:15,731
Doctor, you can play piano, too?

86
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:18,931
I just took a short course,
so I'm not so good.

87
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:21,932
But still, I practiced very hard.

88
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:43,132
<i>Bach, The Well Tempered Clavier</i>

89
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:48,231
<i>The melody line attached
to this song is Ave Maria.</i>

90
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:50,731
<i>Is that so? No wonder it was so nice.</i>

91
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:53,532
<i>I think if a woman plays this,
she will look so beautiful.</i>

92
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:37,582
I got it wrong.

93
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:43,001
Doctor, by any chance
is this what I earlier...

94
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:48,252
Yes, you're right. Because
you liked it so much...

95
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:52,502
Wow, I'm touched.

96
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,361
I'm sorry for liking you.

97
00:10:58,362 --> 00:11:00,801
No, Doctor, why would you say that?

98
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:05,751
Without making it obvious
or calling attention to it,

99
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:09,432
I wanted to keep it inside
of myself as a gift.

100
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:20,221
Doctor, do you know how to play chopsticks?

101
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,922
Just a little.

102
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:29,961
All I can do is play with both of my index
fingers. Doctor, you do the accompaniment.

103
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:31,291
Here I go.

104
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:34,582
One, two, three. Two, two, three.

105
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,601
Congratulations on your achievement.

106
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:56,891
Thank you.

107
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:00,131
It is thanks to your kindness.

108
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:04,182
I wish you good luck wherever you go.

109
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:11,241
So, can my child attend the
university in Seoul next year?

110
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:16,661
Marie Antoinette said the mom
is holding the child back.

111
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:19,841
So, you need to let go.

112
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:22,941
What? But still, I'm the mom.

113
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:27,451
"I believe in you, stay strong, everything will
be okay." She said never to say such things.

114
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:33,071
As a matter of fact, your child is probably feeling burdened and
if you interfere too much, you will make it even more difficult.

115
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:38,771
So, let your child feel
loved, but keep silent. Okay?

116
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,512
Yes.

117
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:45,041
It's so tiring, how many more left now?

118
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:48,571
Three people. But after two hours,
five more people will be coming.

119
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:51,271
What the heck? I don't
even have time to eat.

120
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:54,281
Besides that, do you have any
thoughts of going on a blind date?

121
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:55,272
A blind date?

122
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:59,591
It's my friend's younger brother. He's
good looking and runs a large restaurant.

123
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:02,981
Also, he has two cars and
as a bonus, he has a child.

124
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,531
A child? Is he a divorcee?

125
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:09,361
Of course, you are a divorcee, too. Are you
going to act greedy and ask for a bachelor?

126
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:13,552
If you do that, you'll be punished. You should
know when it's appropriate to be greedy.

127
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,392
Move.

128
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:14,781
<i>Soo Hyun, I did wrong.</i>

129
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:20,402
<i>I won't ask for forgiveness, so
can you meet me one more time?</i>

130
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:52,221
Doctor, aren't you eating?

131
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,321
I'm not eating.

132
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:56,312
You didn't eat yesterday, either.

133
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:03,352
It's okay. When my clients
come, let them in.

134
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:16,671
<i>Yeah, Won Ji Ho.</i>

135
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:20,912
<i>Hyung Seung Chan, about the doctor...</i>

136
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:30,752
Doctor.

137
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:38,222
But, why did you suggest
coming here so suddenly?

138
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:44,041
<i>Now that I think of it, I think
you were also on her bucket list.</i>

139
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,941
<i>While walking on the blue
shores of Jeju Island,</i>

140
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:50,972
<i>she said she wanted to link arms
with a cool man and pick sea shells.</i>

141
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,631
Ta-da! Here's a seashell. Isn't it pretty?

142
00:15:56,632 --> 00:16:00,402
Oh my, it's pretty.

143
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,041
Here, give me your arm.

144
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,741
No, I'm okay.

145
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:09,242
Everyone does this here.

146
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,162
What's on your bucket list?

147
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,992
The first wish, I think
half of it has come true.

148
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:28,711
Go on a backpacking trip to
Peru to see Machu Picchu...

149
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:32,002
Go to Las Vegas and gamble 10 million won.

150
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:37,622
Go to a club and dance my
heart out all night long.

151
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:43,351
Lie down in an igloo and see
the Aurora Borealis in Alaska.

152
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,611
See the Aurora Borealis...

153
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:47,901
There's a lot of traveling overseas.

154
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:51,792
If you're going to do that, then you
need to go to Incheon Airport first.

155
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:56,792
Also, you need to go to Seoul
to pack your things first.

156
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:00,261
Doctor, I think you need
to come with me to Seoul.

157
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,961
No, I just want to be here.

158
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:05,421
How can you do that alone here?

159
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:09,152
Come with me to Seoul
first and prepare. Okay?

160
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:15,122
And, Doctor, you have to help my hyung.

161
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:18,222
What about Doctor Choi?

162
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,731
Unni!

163
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,792
Yoo Rim!

164
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,051
What are you doing here?

165
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:33,252
I came to film a restaurant
in Daejon and stopped by.

166
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:37,842
Cheers!

167
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,151
Nothing much going on in Seoul?

168
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,201
Mm, well...

169
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:51,991
Oh right, Choi Soo Hyun is totally not
himself right now. Isn't it exciting?

170
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:56,222
Well, I left. If he eats and
sleeps well, is he a human?

171
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:02,371
<i>Choi Soo Hyun, you are not in your
normal state of mind right now.</i>

172
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,481
<i>You need something now.</i>

173
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:10,342
<i>Something that will never leave you,
betray you, and only follows you around.</i>

174
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:24,252
Now, what should I name you?

175
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:28,201
How's Go Hye Rim?

176
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:31,051
Hye Rim. Hye Rim.

177
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:34,791
Come on, give it to me this once. So I can
send a text message to Soo Hyun. Huh?

178
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,361
I told you so. Now that you are drunk
you want to contact him again!

179
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,252
You can't. You absolutely can't.

180
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:45,501
You're right. Why should
I call the likes of him?

181
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:48,612
Tell him to have a nice
life for all I care.

182
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:57,081
Come on, just once. Just once,
let me talk to Soo Hyun! Huh?

183
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:59,671
I want to hear his voice!

184
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,662
I said you can't!

185
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,142
Yes?

186
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,732
Hyung! Who do you think came?

187
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:30,221
Doctor Choi, have you been well?

188
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:32,202
Doctor.

189
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:39,531
You didn't clean out my office. I worried that
you might have turned it into a storage house.

190
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,341
I knew you'd return.

191
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:43,991
I heard you and Hye Rim broke up?

192
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:46,761
Yes. She found out about the experiment.

193
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:50,322
I heard she went to Daejon. Don't you think
you should go see her at least once?

194
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:54,062
She was only the main
subject of the experiment.

195
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:05,061
Are you eating well? What about sleep?

196
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:08,761
Yes, there's nothing wrong with me.

197
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:13,702
<i>Are you lying in front of me?
Or are you being truthful?</i>

198
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:23,411
If I were in your situation, I think
tearing up would be the natural reaction.

199
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:26,052
I usually don't cry.

200
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,872
Did your meeting with your mother go well?

201
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:39,331
You have to understand your mother.

202
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:40,332
Your mother also...

203
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:44,361
I know, that she's nothing
but an ordinary person.

204
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:47,941
I don't think that a mom
is a perfect person.

205
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:52,532
When she scolded me as she left, she
probably did that by mistake as well.

206
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:57,792
You're saying everything
that I was going to say.

207
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:03,572
But, how do you feel right now?

208
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:11,132
You might think that way with your head, but
your feelings are fluctuating right now.

209
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:17,771
<i>Feelings are stronger than you think.</i>

210
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:21,872
They don't get sorted out just by
trying to understand it with your head.

211
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:26,991
Right now, if you suppress
yourself like this,

212
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:30,112
your feelings may explode someday.

213
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:35,992
The same goes for Hye Rim and your mother.

214
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:45,662
I have to overcome it. I can endure it.

215
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:50,242
Eat a lot.

216
00:21:57,802 --> 00:21:59,702
What?

217
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:03,542
You want to take a walk?

218
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:11,522
Where? Hey, that's too far.

219
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:16,652
Even so, you really want to go?

220
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:23,872
It can't be helped. If you
really want to, then let's go.

221
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:54,701
How did you know to come here?

222
00:22:54,702 --> 00:22:56,941
I heard from Seung Chan.

223
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,522
I came to walk my puppy.

224
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:00,971
All the way to Daejon?

225
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:02,341
Yes, is that weird?

226
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:04,841
Then, do you think that's something
you would do in your right mind?

227
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,601
She wanted to go on a drive.

228
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,021
What's with the puppy?

229
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:12,221
I just adopted her. Her name is Go Hye Rim.

230
00:23:12,222 --> 00:23:14,132
Hye Rim.

231
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,781
Do you like your new job?
The atmosphere is nice.

232
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:23,158
Oh, a poster of a seagull. Good,

233
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:28,261
because it relieves you of feeling stifled
while subconsciously helping you feel free.

234
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:31,602
It will be able to console you.

235
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:34,981
Why are you suddenly talkative?

236
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,261
Were you nervous?

237
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,641
No. Why would I?

238
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:40,702
Please give me a cup of coffee.

239
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:52,582
It's been a long time. Can
you tell me my fortune?

240
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:59,351
Of course, I know you're a
fake, but you have intuition.

241
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:01,801
What do you think will
happen to me in the future?

242
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,082
Do you think things will turn out well?

243
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:17,501
I don't know about your future, but I
think I know how you feel right now.

244
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:19,901
You didn't come for a
walk, you came to see me,

245
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:22,251
but your pride wouldn't
allow you to just come, so

246
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,412
you made up a ridiculous
excuse about your puppy.

247
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:28,691
The same goes for your attitude right now.

248
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:31,431
Afraid that you might not be able to control
yourself in case you reveal your feelings,

249
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:35,252
afraid that you'd collapse, you're keeping
yourself guarded, aren't I right?

250
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:39,312
That's right.

251
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:45,852
Then, what do you think I have to do?

252
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,092
I'm going on a blind date.

253
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:55,892
I'm going to meet a nice man who is totally
different from you and start a new life.

254
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:02,532
So, there's nothing you can do for me.

255
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:16,331
Thank you. Please come again.

256
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:18,492
Goodbye.

<i>Experiment Log: "Blueprint for new
second preliminary experiment."</i>

272
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:38,601
Don't you think Hyung is in a serious state?
He still doesn't sleep these days, right?

273
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:41,541
Yes. In the past, he would at least
turn off the lights and lie down.

274
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,621
Maybe he's given up. These
days, all he does is read.

275
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:48,802
Why are you worrying about a person like that?
He even did an experiment on my sister.

276
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:52,522
That's right. You're family.

277
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:57,211
The results are out! They're out!

278
00:26:57,212 --> 00:26:58,192
What is?

279
00:26:58,193 --> 00:27:02,272
The documentary festival. I
filmed Ji Ho and submitted it.

280
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:05,242
The homepage is...<i>Excellence
Award: Go Yoo Rim</i>

281
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:14,231
Yay! Ah, what to do? Thank goodness!

282
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,371
Congrats, Yoo Rim.

283
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:19,101
But shouldn't we buy some choco-pies and congratulate you? <i>(Korean tradition of
making an instant cake using chocolate covered marshmallow cakes and toothpicks)</i>

284
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:22,621
Ah, what to do? This is so great!

285
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:25,381
Seung Chan, today, it's my special treat.

286
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:27,301
Then I'll buy the cake. Wait a moment.

287
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:29,341
Thank you!

288
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:32,792
Oh, what to do? I'm so happy! So happy!

289
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:45,231
Please get those two to stop.

290
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:49,051
They've been like that since a while ago and
it's embarrassing me to death, seriously.

291
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:50,732
I'm sorry.

292
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:07,732
Um, Ji Ho. Yoo Rim.

293
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:18,771
Find the main test subject for our second preliminary
experiment from far away. Our experiment's failure,

294
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:23,321
I mean the one that got scrapped was
because Go Hye Rim was too close.

295
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:29,711
So, you have to find someone whose residence
or workplace is far away from where we work.

296
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:31,601
Yes.

297
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:35,761
But Doctor, the hypothesis of this experiment is that
there is no such thing as true love for a woman,

298
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:39,051
but I think that there
is such a thing as love.

299
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,121
Why?

300
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:41,921
I'm dating Noona Yoo Rim,

301
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,431
but when I see that noona, she
treats me with true sincerity...

302
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,641
That's love that lasts only three years,

303
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,131
fake love that is maintained by hormones.
The problem comes afterwards.

304
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:54,001
Is there a guarantee that Yoo Rim will keep
liking you after three years has passed?

305
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:55,992
If there is, prove it.

306
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:02,511
A woman will abandon a man
at some point or another.

307
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:04,442
So, you too...

308
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:13,021
<i>Soo Hyun, it's Mom.</i>

309
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:16,061
<i>Let's meet one more time, okay?</i>

310
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:20,821
<i>I'm at the pasta restaurant
where we dined previously.</i>

311
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:22,822
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

312
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:37,672
<i>Please come to the
consultation office by 5 p.m.</i>

313
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,771
Doctor, your mother...

314
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:44,432
Seo Yeon Hee is here.

315
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:55,351
You hated me a lot, right? I...

316
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:57,192
Why did you break up with Father?

317
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:02,722
We weren't a good fit from the start.

318
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:09,012
He was too self-righteous and
only wanted to keep me cooped up.

319
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:16,581
Then one day, I met a man.

320
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:19,631
<i>See? You can't trust a woman's love.</i>

321
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:24,131
But, I really loved you. So...

322
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:26,842
You said you have another
family in the States, right?

323
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:32,192
So why did you come here?

324
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:38,351
I saw your article and
wanted to see your face.

325
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:41,292
Then, that means you're going back soon.

326
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:46,231
<i>Everything is as you please.</i>

327
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:52,581
You leave as you please and come to see me as
you please. And again, you leave as you please.

328
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:54,751
Did you ever think of me
who would be left alone?

329
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,701
I worried.

330
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:03,272
I did, but since you're a psychologist...

331
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:09,852
I thought that you might
understand me a little bit.

332
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:15,571
Just because I'm a psychologist, do
you think my heart is made of steel?

333
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:19,041
We're the same as everyone else. The only
difference is that we can analyze the mind.

334
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,972
It doesn't mean we don't
get emotional scars.

335
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:27,051
I don't remember anything
from when I was young.

336
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:32,281
The trauma from when you abandoned me when I was
young was so big, it even sealed off my memory.

337
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:39,551
Also, it's been thirty years. You have
a family, but to me, I had no one.

338
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:42,151
I grew up lonely with a father who
hated me as much as he hated you

339
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:46,442
along with a mother who only looked
after my younger brother, but...

340
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:53,761
<i>Calm down, Soo Hyun. This person
is also just an immature human.</i>

341
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:59,121
<i>One by one, let's go about this slowly.
That's the correct answer.</i>

342
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:03,131
What were you going to do
after coming to see me?

343
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:07,371
I thought it would be good to
keep in contact with each other,

344
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:10,851
even though it's not as happily as before.

345
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:13,941
Calling each other, and occasionally
having meals together...

346
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:19,381
When I was young, do you
remember when you abandoned me?

347
00:32:19,382 --> 00:32:22,552
Don't you remember what you
said to me as you abandoned me?

348
00:32:27,472 --> 00:32:29,252
What...

349
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:35,331
Mom, back then, you scolded me.

350
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:41,712
"Don't let your ice cream drip." That if I
kept doing that, you wouldn't come see me.

351
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:48,101
So I held on tightly to my ice cream.

352
00:32:48,102 --> 00:32:55,322
In that hot weather, while wiping off the ice cream
I dripped, I was diligently waiting for you, Mom!

353
00:32:56,122 --> 00:32:58,681
But in the end, you didn't come.

354
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:03,101
That memory became branded into me.
"I did something wrong."

355
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:07,832
"Because I dripped ice cream,
Mom didn't come." That's why I

356
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:12,961
hurt whenever I get hit by water droplets.

357
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:18,741
Because I remember what I did wrong,
it hurts as if I'm punishing myself!

358
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:21,531
<i>But you can't even remember that?</i>

359
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,621
<i>I lived for thirty years inside that agony!</i>

360
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:30,091
<i>On rainy days, I couldn't go outside and trembled.
But you, the perpetrator, can't remember it?</i>

361
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,182
Does that make any sense?

362
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:37,681
I-I-I'm sorry, Soo Hyun!

363
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,821
I did wrong!

364
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:44,461
What did you do wrong? Abandoning
me and leaving? Divorcing Father?

365
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:48,321
Lying about coming back?
What are you sorry about?!

366
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:52,911
I just wanted to see your face, that's all.

367
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:57,031
I wanted to see, just once,
how well you grew up.

368
00:33:57,032 --> 00:34:00,712
That's right, I did and
don't ever come back.

369
00:34:23,382 --> 00:34:25,392
Please enjoy.

370
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,492
Welcome...

371
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:35,701
Doctor, how are you here?

372
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:40,112
It's been a long time. Can
we talk for a moment?

373
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:51,291
I heard that Soo Hyun's
mom came to see him, but...

374
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:56,992
This time, I think she touched upon a
very painful part of Professor Choi.

375
00:34:57,732 --> 00:35:01,822
It was the first time seeing
Professor Choi that agitated.

376
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:11,532
You were upset because of
the experiment, right?

377
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:16,271
You also knew about the experiment, Doctor?

378
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:19,862
Yes. I'm sorry that I couldn't stop him,

379
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:25,121
but do you know what that
experiment means to Professor Choi?

380
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:29,601
He probably did that to write his thesis,
get awards, and to become famous.

381
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:36,911
There's that, but above all that, that experiment
is Professor Choi's defense mechanism.

382
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:38,381
What?

383
00:35:38,382 --> 00:35:43,901
If he proves that there's no such thing as true love for
women, his mother who abandoned him also had no love,

384
00:35:43,902 --> 00:35:49,512
then he can relieve a bit of
the pain from being abandoned.

385
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:55,951
Then, whenever Soo Hyun is
abandoned by someone...

386
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:58,351
He blames himself.

387
00:35:58,352 --> 00:36:04,901
On the outside, he reasons that it's because of
women, but on the inside, he's fooling himself.

388
00:36:04,902 --> 00:36:09,412
Also, inside that perpetrator
is not only his mom,

389
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,581
you are also there.

390
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:16,151
What? Why me?

391
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:20,492
Because in the end, you also
abandoned Professor Choi and left.

392
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:28,441
But, looking at Professor Choi's state right
now, it doesn't look like he was hurt only once.

393
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:30,702
Was there anything else between you two?

394
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:38,741
In the middle of the experiment, I
told him that I wanted to break up,

395
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:41,401
but Soo Hyun was the first
who wanted to make up

396
00:36:41,402 --> 00:36:44,161
and I accepted a purple tulip.

397
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:47,882
A purple one? Are you certain?

398
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:54,742
<i>What color does the tulip appear to you?</i>

399
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:02,432
<i>Plum-colored? Is it not? Purple?</i>

400
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:07,481
<i>Purple?</i>

401
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:13,181
When he was an undergraduate, Professor Choi
talked about the meaning behind tulips.

402
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:17,901
Purple and plum are similar colors, but the
meanings of the flower are complete opposites.

403
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:24,532
The meaning of the purple tulip that you
chose is love that does not last forever.

404
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:30,781
Professor Choi might also have
accepted the implication with it,

405
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:35,592
that love with you is not eternal.

406
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:40,501
Did anything else happen besides that?

407
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:43,822
<i>It's 12 o'clock. Time's up.</i>

408
00:37:45,112 --> 00:37:49,391
<i>What to do, Soo Hyun?
Cinderella's magic has worn off.</i>

409
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,981
<i>Cinderella</i>

410
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:56,351
<i>You still don't get it?
Everything was a lie.</i>

411
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:01,621
<i>"I love you, Soo Hyun"? How ridiculous.
Why would I?</i>

412
00:38:01,622 --> 00:38:05,581
But, Doctor, I also received my
share of scars from Soo Hyun.

413
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:09,051
You know that. For a period of
four months he experimented on me.

414
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:16,272
But, you know that Professor
Choi really liked you.

415
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:22,661
That experiment, was
important to Professor Choi.

416
00:38:22,662 --> 00:38:27,681
He was also going to submit a thesis to the world's most prestigious
academic journal, JPSP.<i>(Journal of Personality and Social Psychology)</i>

417
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:30,671
If that were to be canceled,
other projects or

418
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:35,841
an award from the world psychological
association would all have gone down the drain.

419
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:41,341
But, Professor Choi really
wanted to stop that experiment

420
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:43,562
because of you.

421
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:50,971
The problem is now. Professor Choi
is currently in a really bad state.

422
00:38:50,972 --> 00:38:56,131
It's because of his mom who abandoned
him and left and also because of you.

423
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:59,971
He is probably feeling abandoned twice.

424
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:05,572
If you leave him like this, it's dangerous.
You have to help him.

425
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:16,162
Hey, Go Hye Rim. Don't you
think I'm a bit strange?

426
00:39:18,642 --> 00:39:21,852
I took three sleeping
pills, but I'm not sleepy.

427
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:26,072
I also barely ate,

428
00:39:28,462 --> 00:39:30,742
but I'm not hungry.

429
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,031
Where are you going?

430
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,261
- I'm taking a walk.-
At this time of night?

431
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:44,261
The time doesn't matter.

432
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:48,482
A healthy mind belongs to a healthy body.
I will become healthy.

433
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:58,971
<i>The important thing is that
I've realized that I'm weird.</i>

434
00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:01,401
<i>That's the start of
treatment for everything.</i>

435
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:03,811
<i>So as of now, I don't have a big problem.</i>

436
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:08,212
<i>If I dig a bit more objectively
into my problem...</i>

437
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:10,921
<i>Should I become a paper airplane as well?</i>

438
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:12,932
<i>Freely?</i>

439
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:34,272
Hyung!

440
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,492
Hyung!

441
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:55,801
- Hyung, what's wrong with you? Are
you out of your mind?- What about me?

442
00:41:55,802 --> 00:42:00,112
What did you do on the edge of the roof?
Did you have a death wish?

443
00:42:09,072 --> 00:42:12,452
I was just thinking of
something else for a second.

444
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:17,051
Are you okay? Do you
want me to support you?

445
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:20,492
No. Leave me alone. I can go alone.

446
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:35,321
What? He went up the roof to die?

447
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:38,702
Yeah. The pose was exactly one of suicide.

448
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:43,901
Why is Soo Hyun really doing that?
Why is he becoming so broken?

449
00:42:43,902 --> 00:42:45,371
<i>Can you come up here?</i>

450
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:48,681
Suddenly, his biological
mother came and even you left.

451
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:51,401
If it were me, I don't think I
would be in my right mind either.

452
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,431
I also heard from Ji Ho.

453
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:55,942
Hyung started a new experiment.

454
00:42:56,662 --> 00:42:57,841
What?

455
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:02,281
<i>The experiment that he did on you is considered scrapped and
this time, he's really preparing for it with all his might.</i>

456
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:05,062
I think he already got the
experiment's main test subject, too.

457
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:15,121
<i>Professor Choi is a man who grew
up not knowing what love is.</i>

458
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:18,601
<i>Even when he loved, he
didn't know it was love,</i>

459
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:23,161
<i>so he used the experiment as an
excuse to confirm if there was love.</i>

460
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:26,761
<i>He thought that women
would always leave him</i>

461
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:31,281
<i>and from his mother to you, he
really has only been abandoned.</i>

462
00:43:31,282 --> 00:43:35,392
<i>And so now, he's almost beyond repair.</i>

463
00:43:48,882 --> 00:43:53,641
<i>Right now for Professor Choi, he probably
feels as if he's standing on a cliff.</i>

464
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:59,171
<i>Then the only person to rescue
Professor Choi is you, Hye Rim.</i>

465
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:03,242
Fine. Even if I shatter to
pieces, I'm just going.

466
00:44:18,962 --> 00:44:23,821
Excuse me. You came to hear about the explanation
of the psychological experiment, right?

467
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:28,841
Yes. Are you Doctor Choi Soo Hyun?
I thought he would be a man.

468
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:33,501
No. I'm a person that went
through that experiment once.

469
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:38,941
You came thinking that it's about the relationship
between your ideal type and your immune system, right?

470
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:43,231
That's a total fake. It's actually a
psychological experiment on love.

471
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:44,072
Excuse me?

472
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:47,731
It's an experiment where three men will approach you
under false pretenses to find out who you will fall for.

473
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:53,122
It's a really horrible experiment.
Do you want to do it?

474
00:45:08,402 --> 00:45:09,981
How did you come here?

475
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:12,451
You came to see the new test subject
to do the experiment on, right?

476
00:45:12,452 --> 00:45:14,901
I'm sorry, that person left.

477
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:18,382
I told her what the real
experiment was about.

478
00:45:19,472 --> 00:45:22,662
Since I came back, you're happy, right?

479
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:25,131
Why did you come back?

480
00:45:25,132 --> 00:45:27,962
Because I missed you.

481
00:45:30,212 --> 00:45:34,321
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to
fall for Cinderella's story twice,

482
00:45:34,322 --> 00:45:36,131
so if you're here to act again...

483
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:41,161
I'm not going to do that anymore. I'm
really here to see you Soo Hyun.

484
00:45:41,162 --> 00:45:46,481
Oh right, there is another reason why I came
here. There is a project I wanted to do.

485
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:52,102
It's called the 'Choi Soo Hyun
rehabilitation project.' You'll help, right?

486
00:45:55,012 --> 00:45:56,621
You guys, I'm here!

487
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,672
<i>Oh, Hye Rim!</i>

488
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:01,821
How are you here?

489
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:04,631
What do you mean how? This is
the place where I used to live.

490
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:07,442
Is it weird that I came
back to my own house?

491
00:46:09,812 --> 00:46:12,582
Soo Hyun, come here. I have
something to tell you.

492
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:17,671
What's going on?

493
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:20,802
Hye Rim's here. She's with Hyung.

494
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:33,481
Choi Soo Hyun rehabilitation project, phase
one. To start with, eat all of this.

495
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:36,341
Hye Rim, I don't know what you
heard that made you come, but...

496
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:39,681
You aren't happy I came back?

497
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:42,711
You aren't at all happy? Just so-so?

498
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:45,182
Should I just go back?

499
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:48,771
No.

500
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,451
Then eat a spoon of this.

501
00:46:51,452 --> 00:46:55,841
I came all the way from
Daejon to feed you this.

502
00:46:55,842 --> 00:47:00,572
Consider me. Okay? Eat just a little.

503
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:12,051
Good job!

504
00:47:12,052 --> 00:47:15,792
Now, let's try a big spoonful.

505
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:29,081
Here, you upload photos and images of yourself
throughout daily life in a natural way.

506
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:30,841
You used to always say this, Soo Hyun.

507
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:34,281
When someone is natural,
they are in the best state.

508
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:36,001
Hye Rim, I don't really do SNS.

509
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:38,481
What should we use to make your ID?

510
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:40,732
Go Hye Rim Love?

511
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:43,941
Good.

512
00:47:43,942 --> 00:47:47,222
The password will be my birthday.

513
00:47:50,352 --> 00:47:53,321
Ta-da. It's all done now.

514
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:56,162
What picture should we upload?

515
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:02,052
This is good.

516
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:05,982
Hye Rim, aren't you going to unpack?

517
00:48:07,662 --> 00:48:10,701
Fine, today's tasks end with this.

518
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:15,272
Tomorrow, we're going to start with phase two
of the Choi Soo Hyun rehabilitation project.

519
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:40,411
<i>Go Hye Rim came back. Go Hye Rim came back.</i>

520
00:48:40,412 --> 00:48:43,242
<i>Go Hye Rim came back.</i>

521
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,761
Don't you think they'll
stop me at the entrance?

522
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:55,581
No Doctor, you look like
you're in your twenties.

523
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:58,521
Just cover your eyes with sunglasses.

524
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:00,901
- Fighting!- Fighting!

525
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:04,122
<i>Go in. Yes, go on in.</i>

526
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:07,371
Wait a minute.

527
00:49:07,372 --> 00:49:09,551
How old are you?

528
00:49:09,552 --> 00:49:11,401
I'm in my twenties.

529
00:49:11,402 --> 00:49:13,192
Really?

530
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:16,121
I'm in my thirties.

531
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:17,721
Then let me see your ID.

532
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,791
Why are you like this to my girlfriend?

533
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:20,931
She's your girlfriend?

534
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:22,832
Let's go, Mi Ran.

535
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:25,691
Girlfriend?

536
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:28,252
She's not his mom? Mom?

537
00:49:40,362 --> 00:49:42,791
Here you go, Doctor.

538
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:43,961
What about cups?

539
00:49:43,962 --> 00:49:47,252
Here you just drink it out of the bottle.

540
00:49:55,102 --> 00:49:57,242
What's wrong, Doctor?

541
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:03,081
Because a carbonated drink suddenly
went down my throat, it really stings.

542
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:06,891
If you come here, you dance right?
Teach me how to dance.

543
00:50:06,892 --> 00:50:12,412
Yes, since you made up your mind to party all
night, you have to take good care of yourself.

544
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:43,001
You wench, now you're
receiving awards like this.

545
00:50:43,002 --> 00:50:46,621
I was so proud earlier
that I was about to cry!

546
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:50,461
But, Ji Ho really didn't come?

547
00:50:50,462 --> 00:50:52,612
I'm not sure.

548
00:50:55,532 --> 00:50:56,641
What is that?

549
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:59,731
<i>Follow me</i>

550
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:03,782
It's Ji Ho. That's
definitely Ji Ho's doing.

551
00:51:19,332 --> 00:51:23,602
What are you doing? Why are you
playing with a drone here?

552
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:35,802
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

553
00:51:53,032 --> 00:51:58,011
The universe is such and such, mathematical formulas are
this and that... Now I don't need things like that.

554
00:51:58,012 --> 00:52:00,591
I just like you, Noona.

555
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:04,032
Noona, will you marry me?

556
00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:19,851
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

557
00:52:19,852 --> 00:52:22,822
You guys already want to
get married at your age?

558
00:52:31,132 --> 00:52:34,181
How long have you been dating? Just
a little over two weeks, right?

559
00:52:34,182 --> 00:52:35,881
But, marriage? Does that make any sense?

560
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:38,621
I've liked Ji Ho since long before!
You know that.

561
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,011
But he didn't!

562
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:42,801
Why is the duration so important?
Love conquers all.

563
00:52:42,802 --> 00:52:46,971
The very quality of how much I liked
you then and now are different.

564
00:52:46,972 --> 00:52:51,361
If you were a pebble on a beach,
Noona Yoo Rim is like a great ocean.

565
00:52:51,362 --> 00:52:56,481
If you were a small shooting star,
Noona Yoo Rim is like a huge universe.

566
00:52:56,482 --> 00:53:00,341
Look, even the way he talks isn't normal!
How could you...

567
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:02,971
Why are you making a fuss when
we're the ones who are in love?

568
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:05,942
Why, are you scared that
we'll turn out like you?

569
00:53:06,632 --> 00:53:07,961
Yes, you're right.

570
00:53:07,962 --> 00:53:11,541
You saw me get married at twenty one and totally
get ruined. Yet you're still acting this way?

571
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:15,661
Just like you go to middle school at fourteen, and just like you go
to high school at seventeen, there's also a proper age for marriage!

572
00:53:15,662 --> 00:53:18,511
Stop worrying! We won't turn out like you.

573
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:20,881
Right, Ji Ho? You won't betray me, right?

574
00:53:20,882 --> 00:53:23,032
Of course I won't.

575
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:27,681
If you're going to act this
way, get out of my house.

576
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:28,761
Unni!

577
00:53:28,762 --> 00:53:33,252
I don't need a little sister who doesn't
listen to me, so pack your bags and leave!

578
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:40,691
How much money do you have?

579
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:41,612
Why?

580
00:53:41,613 --> 00:53:45,501
I have 60,000 won ($60) in cash and about 2,000,000
won ($2,000) in my bank account. What about you?

581
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,211
I also have around that much.

582
00:53:47,212 --> 00:53:51,882
Alright, then we can hang
on for six months so...

583
00:53:59,432 --> 00:54:02,291
<i>Unni, I have chosen to
go live with Ji Ho now.</i>

584
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:05,581
<i>Come find us when you're
ready to bless our marriage.</i>

585
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:08,541
These two...

586
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:12,801
<i>The person you're trying to reach cannot pick up the
phone so please leave a message after the beep.</i>

587
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:15,331
Fine, let's see how many days
you two can survive out there.

588
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:18,832
It's obvious you two will come crawling
back in a week completely broke.

589
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:32,841
Hello.

590
00:54:32,842 --> 00:54:35,621
Oh, yes. Hello.

591
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:38,631
I came because I had an appointment here, but Soo
Hyun's consultation seems to be running late.

592
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:40,802
I've been waiting for a while.

593
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,981
I don't know if you know this, but

594
00:54:43,982 --> 00:54:47,051
I am currently dating Soo Hyun.

595
00:54:47,052 --> 00:54:51,291
Yes, I guessed so.

596
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:55,081
<i>What's this? Why is she still being so
calm after I've told her we're dating?</i>

597
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:57,931
Why did you come to see Soo Hyun?

598
00:54:57,932 --> 00:55:02,101
There are also many psychologists in the States
to ask that favor, so why does it have to be...

599
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:04,741
While I'm at it, it's good
to ask someone I know.

600
00:55:04,742 --> 00:55:08,432
And, I also missed Soo Hyun.

601
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:14,491
When you were dating Soo Hyun, wasn't
it you who wanted to break it off?

602
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:18,182
A person's heart is always bound to change.

603
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:22,361
I don't have any thoughts about
interfering in your relationship.

604
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,422
I won't try to force myself in it, either.

605
00:55:26,432 --> 00:55:27,282
Then...

606
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:31,171
But, I will not back off, either.

607
00:55:31,172 --> 00:55:33,741
I've already told you, that
I'm already dating Soo Hyun...

608
00:55:33,742 --> 00:55:38,011
You know, don't you? That the power
of nostalgia is very strong.

609
00:55:38,012 --> 00:55:43,131
Between Soo Hyun and I, there are many
memories that you don't know about.

610
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,431
I came back because I
missed those memories.

611
00:55:45,432 --> 00:55:49,572
Also, I believe that Soo Hyun
would feel the same as well.

612
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:08,321
Has Claire left?

613
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:11,661
Yes, quite a while ago.

614
00:56:11,662 --> 00:56:15,641
I heard you dated her in the past?

615
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:16,881
How did you know that?

616
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:19,832
Marie Antoinette told me.

617
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:27,182
Did you like her a lot?

618
00:56:27,932 --> 00:56:30,292
No, not really.

619
00:56:31,832 --> 00:56:34,892
It looks like you liked her a lot.

620
00:56:36,032 --> 00:56:38,862
You liked her more than me?

621
00:56:39,932 --> 00:56:43,121
Why? Are you jealous?

622
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:46,121
You know why I came back, right?

623
00:56:46,122 --> 00:56:51,051
Even though I was tricked by your lies, I
came back because I worried about you.

624
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:54,822
You have a responsibility in
repaying me for my kindness.

625
00:56:55,632 --> 00:56:58,182
And how should I do that?

626
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:03,402
Look at this for an hour.

627
00:57:04,432 --> 00:57:06,241
Why these?

628
00:57:06,242 --> 00:57:09,931
A person named John Brad
wrote a book called <i>Hurt...</i>

629
00:57:09,932 --> 00:57:11,991
Something like that.

630
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:16,441
He stated that it was important for people with emotional
scars to start by experiencing childhood feelings.

631
00:57:16,442 --> 00:57:20,241
First of all, it's not John
Brad, but John Bradshaw.

632
00:57:20,242 --> 00:57:24,211
The Korean title is <i>Treatment of the Hurt Inner
Child</i>. In English, it's called <i>The Inner Child</i>.

633
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:28,781
Anyway, look at your childhood pictures and
try to experience those feelings again.

634
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:33,831
You can also write a letter to yourself now
in the point of view from your child self.

635
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:38,241
I'm a psychologist, I already know those
methods. That's why they don't work on me...

636
00:57:38,242 --> 00:57:42,711
But you only know them, you've never
tried the methods before, have you?

637
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:47,242
I'll come back in an hour,
so do your homework by then.

638
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:04,281
<i>- If you keep on dripping ice cream...
- Mom!</i>

639
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:07,721
<i>I won't come on your birthday.</i>

640
00:58:07,722 --> 00:58:10,181
<i>Mom!</i>

641
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:11,701
<i>Soo Hyun.</i>

642
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:15,521
<i>I wish you came to find me.</i>

643
00:58:15,522 --> 00:58:19,672
<i>I don't want to be alone here.</i>

644
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:30,681
I can't see any shooting stars, they said
there would be a meteor shower today.

645
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:34,042
It's probably because
today's weather was cloudy.

646
00:58:36,232 --> 00:58:40,461
Then, what do we do if it's like this when
we go to see the Aurora Borealis in Alaska?

647
00:58:40,462 --> 00:58:43,032
The Aurora Borealis is...

648
00:58:46,332 --> 00:58:48,212
Us?

649
00:58:49,132 --> 00:58:51,881
We're going to see it together?

650
00:58:51,882 --> 00:58:53,431
Of course.

651
00:58:53,432 --> 00:58:57,242
Then were you thinking of going
somewhere nice like that alone?

652
00:59:01,632 --> 00:59:03,531
Thank you.

653
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:05,701
It's nothing.

654
00:59:05,702 --> 00:59:09,652
Then, should we make a schedule...

655
00:59:14,832 --> 00:59:17,062
Make a schedule...

656
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,812
Yes.

657
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:26,982
But, Doctor.

658
00:59:31,932 --> 00:59:34,582
Please get the surgery.

659
00:59:38,732 --> 00:59:41,361
How did you know?

660
00:59:41,362 --> 00:59:43,461
You can't go like this.

661
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:47,151
We don't know if something might happen
before we see the Aurora Borealis.

662
00:59:47,152 --> 00:59:49,701
So, Doctor, get the surgery,

663
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:53,042
and after your body
recuperates, let's go together.

664
00:59:56,832 --> 00:59:59,042
I'll take care of it.

665
01:00:00,532 --> 01:00:04,582
Doctor, I'll take you home
on the scooter so hop on.

666
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:33,911
Did you look at your childhood pictures?

667
01:00:33,912 --> 01:00:35,891
When did you come?

668
01:00:35,892 --> 01:00:38,171
Did you write the letter?

669
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:40,421
You didn't, did you?

670
01:00:40,422 --> 01:00:43,531
Hye Rim, please stop this.

671
01:00:43,532 --> 01:00:46,211
I'm a psychologist.

672
01:00:46,212 --> 01:00:47,981
I'll take care of myself
after knowing my state...

673
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:52,002
You said you met your mom.

674
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,072
How was it?

675
01:00:56,932 --> 01:00:59,872
What are you going to do if you know?

676
01:01:02,332 --> 01:01:06,391
I've also abandoned Do Gyung before.

677
01:01:06,392 --> 01:01:09,812
After I fought with my husband,
because I was so angry,

678
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:15,391
I forgot about the fact that I had
a child, and just wandered around.

679
01:01:15,392 --> 01:01:21,811
But I came back to see her crying
in front of the refrigerator.

680
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:25,632
Next to her were half eaten
pieces from a loaf of bread.

681
01:01:27,132 --> 01:01:32,602
Come to think of it, I realized I
had starved her for the entire day.

682
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:39,211
I was that kind of a bad mother.

683
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:42,681
So, what do you want to say now?

684
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:47,461
But it wasn't because I
didn't love my child,

685
01:01:47,462 --> 01:01:51,472
because even if you love
someone, mistakes can be made.

686
01:01:52,432 --> 01:01:54,491
When your mother abandoned you...

687
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:57,602
Who is trying to teach whom here?

688
01:01:58,332 --> 01:02:00,331
What you said

689
01:02:00,332 --> 01:02:03,832
comes from the contents of
psychological counseling 101.

690
01:02:05,232 --> 01:02:07,601
If you're a fortune teller, act like one.

691
01:02:07,602 --> 01:02:09,901
Don't think of teaching a psychologist.

692
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:11,801
But you

693
01:02:11,802 --> 01:02:14,412
just know this intellectually.

694
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:18,911
Right now, you need courage.

695
01:02:18,912 --> 01:02:23,081
Instead of knowing it and sweeping it under the rug,
you should look into your problem, acknowledge it,

696
01:02:23,082 --> 01:02:26,861
and you need the courage
to actively fix it.

697
01:02:26,862 --> 01:02:28,851
Fine,

698
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:32,141
I have fear of abandonment
and lack of affection.

699
01:02:32,142 --> 01:02:35,511
My mother abandoned me at a young
age and I developed a trauma.

700
01:02:35,512 --> 01:02:39,671
To defend myself against that, I made
up a thesis that love doesn't exist.

701
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:44,711
Also, to prove that, I even
did this damn experiment!

702
01:02:44,712 --> 01:02:46,792
Does that satisfy you?

703
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:50,551
You know well,

704
01:02:50,552 --> 01:02:55,302
but if that experiment succeeds,
do you think you will be happy?

705
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:59,041
You might be happy for a moment

706
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:04,491
that you have proven that love doesn't exist, and you
will be able to rationalize your mother's abandonment.

707
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:07,671
But that's only rationalization.

708
01:03:07,672 --> 01:03:11,992
It's nothing but a wall you created
so you wouldn't feel the pain.

709
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:16,672
So, you'll deteriorate even more. Why?

710
01:03:17,732 --> 01:03:21,311
Because that's not how you truly think,

711
01:03:21,312 --> 01:03:27,022
because deep in your heart, you're
waiting for someone to really love you.

712
01:03:29,332 --> 01:03:31,012
Look here.

713
01:03:31,832 --> 01:03:34,821
What does a fake fortune teller know?

714
01:03:34,822 --> 01:03:37,811
I'm going to break down that wall.

715
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:40,791
And so you can truly acknowledge your pain,

716
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:45,691
and so you can truly be healed, I'm going
to shatter this experiment to pieces.

717
01:03:45,692 --> 01:03:49,452
I'll prove to you that
true love does exist.

718
01:03:56,932 --> 01:03:58,892
This...

719
01:04:00,332 --> 01:04:02,862
What color do you think it is?

720
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:05,821
Purple?

721
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:08,202
No, it's plum-colored.

722
01:04:09,072 --> 01:04:12,072
It symbolizes eternal love.

723
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:18,022
I love you, Soo Hyun.

724
01:04:19,632 --> 01:04:22,781
I'm different from your mom.

725
01:04:22,782 --> 01:04:26,271
I will never

726
01:04:26,272 --> 01:04:28,591
leave your side.
