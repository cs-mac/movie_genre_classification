1
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:32,083
<i>The Vietnam peace talks</i>
<i>are continuing here in Paris today...</i>

2
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:37,111
<i>... against the background of what to do</i>
<i>about the release of American POWs.</i>

3
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:40,189
<i>In the United States,</i>
<i>sentiment is running high...</i>

4
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,389
<i>... for a complete accounting</i>
<i>for all of the POWs and MIAs...</i>

5
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:49,063
<i>... those listed as Missing in Action,</i>
<i>before any treaty is signed.</i>

6
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,196
<i>The prisoners, men such as these...</i>

7
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:56,808
<i>... are Americans who have been captured</i>
<i>during the 10 years of fighting in Vietnam.</i>

8
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,206
<i>The Undersecretary of State,</i>
<i>Conrad Morgan...</i>

9
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:01,906
<i>... is the chief American delegate</i>
<i>to the talks.</i>

10
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:06,247
<i>This morning, outside the mansion</i>
<i>in which the talks are being held...</i>

11
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:09,216
<i>... Morgan told reporters</i>
<i>that he is optimistic.</i>

12
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,448
<i>I now sincerely believe...</i>

13
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,492
<i>... the North Vietnamese delegates</i>
<i>are dealing in good faith...</i>

14
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,153
<i>... and that significant progress</i>
<i>can now be made.</i>

15
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,423
<i>As chief delegate to these talks...</i>

16
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,022
<i>... are you saying a final agreement</i>
<i>has been reached?</i>

17
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,658
<i>What I'm saying is what I said.</i>

18
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:27,263
<i>The situation is e</i>x<i>tremely delicate,</i>
<i>but significant progress can now be made.</i>

19
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,603
<i>Is that clear? I certainly hope it is...</i>

20
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:33,611
<i>... because I would appreciate</i>
<i>those of the press getting that straight.</i>

21
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:38,048
<i>What if Kuong Yen decides to throw</i>
<i>new roadblocks into these negotiations?</i>

22
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,109
<i>I suppose we'll have to</i>
<i>take things one step at a time.</i>

23
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:45,623
<i>There is one more question the American</i>
<i>public deserves to have answered.</i>

24
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,386
<i>What about the Missing in Action?</i>

25
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,586
<i>Have you and Kuong Yen</i>
<i>discussed that at all?</i>

26
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,220
<i>Of course we have discussed that...</i>

27
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:54,323
<i>... and we will continue</i>
<i>to discuss that question.</i>

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,836
<i>But I'm sure you can all realize,</i>
<i>that is of such a sensitive nature...</i>

29
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,064
<i>... I'm not at liberty to go into that now.</i>

30
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,075
<i>I can only say this: I'm very hopeful</i>
<i>that we will arrive at a solution.</i>

31
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,303
- What the hell are you doing in my room?
- You told me to meet you here.

32
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,872
Could have waited in the lobby.
Turn that goddamn thing off, please.

33
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,077
I'm enjoying it.

34
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,679
<i>Mr. Morgan, please,</i>
<i>can we have a statement before you...</i>

35
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,187
Harolds?

36
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:21,616
- Come on, bring that shit in here!
- Coming.

37
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:27,459
I'm not as nimble as I used to be.

38
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,999
Nor as coordinated.

39
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,738
Actually, Conrad,
I have always been rather clumsy.

40
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,481
When you get that stuff cleaned up,
make me a scotch, will you please?

41
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,347
So, the war is over, Mr. Undersecretary?

42
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,683
You're practically a national treasure.

43
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,514
Son of a bitch.

44
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,487
Which son of a bitch is that?

45
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,425
Hope they cut his balls off.

46
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:02,860
- Give Harolds a pair of scissors.
- When the time's right, I'll do that myself.

47
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,469
Sounds like your private meeting
with Kuong Yen...

48
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:10,941
...was what you guys in State
called "a frank discussion of the issues."

49
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,578
What the hell is this,
some kind of a joke to you?

50
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,910
- You could say so.
- It's not to me.

51
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,812
Somebody's gotta take it seriously.

52
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,943
I told 'em I didn't need
any goddamn CIA help on this thing...

53
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,885
And they shove me down your throat!

54
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:27,449
We've been through this before, Morgan.
Now, what the hell is it this time?

55
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,524
How many of your CIA people
are the VC holding?

56
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,758
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,857
Save that bullshit for Congress.
How many?

58
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,458
150, maybe. Why?

59
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,332
They're dead.

60
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:44,165
The fact that we have positive information
to the contrary is irrelevant.

61
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,539
He wants a sacrifice.

62
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,614
Speak intelligently, Morgan.

63
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,810
As an addendum to the peace terms,
Kuong Yen wants a sacrifice.

64
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,819
Call Omaha and get a flock of sheep.

65
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,151
He claims he's lost a lot of family
to you people.

66
00:05:57,222 --> 00:06:00,453
This isn't important, of course,
but I also think he's a psychopath.

67
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,127
That makes him unique in this business,
doesn't it?

68
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:07,598
In any case, we agree to write off
those people as Missing in Action...

69
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,898
...and they agree to call off the war
and give us a lot of other people back.

70
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,231
And you agreed?

71
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,107
I didn't agree to anything.

72
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:20,274
You practical son of a bitch!

73
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:24,975
You're gonna cash in those people's lives
just for a shot at the Nobel Peace Prize!

74
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,348
Saunders, don't get sanctimonious
with me.

75
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,978
Nobody's gonna win anything
when this war's over.

76
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,990
If the VC want 'em dead so bad,
why don't they just kill 'em?

77
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:36,050
They won't because they're worth
too much as a bargaining point.

78
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,221
Wrong. They'll kill 'em...

79
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,924
...as soon as they sign the treaty...

80
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:45,332
...or they'll hold them as MIA
till they're through interrogating them.

81
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,868
In any case, what I'm trying to say is
we have to at least try...

82
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,876
...to get some of those people out of there.

83
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:54,810
I hate to think I've been misjudging you.

84
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,246
That would be unfortunate.

85
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,979
What do you call the commandoes...

86
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,886
...you're holding
under the Phoenix umbrella?

87
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,523
Black Tigers.

88
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,891
Who the hell thinks up names like that?
Black Tigers!

89
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,863
Actually, a group of us did,
some years ago.

90
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,393
Don't let anybody kid you, Harolds.
It's a great name.

91
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:21,838
- Can they get your people out?
- I don't know, it's very risky business.

92
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,233
Take at least a couple of weeks
for an operation like that.

93
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,402
Forty-eight hours.

94
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,910
Forty-eight hours? Right.

95
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,921
What about staging a major operation
in the middle of your peace talks?

96
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,453
I'll worry about the diplomacy.

97
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:51,926
I get the feeling I'm offending
some sensibility in you.

98
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:56,539
The American public is crying for peace.
I intend to achieve it for them.

99
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,812
Like I said,
you're practically a national treasure.

100
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,028
Saunders, when this war is over...

101
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,795
...you should get a job
as an advance man for cancer.

102
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,364
In support of the disease or the cure?

103
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,736
I sometimes find it difficult to understand...

104
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,901
...the American custom of joking
during a time of crisis.

105
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,872
How certain are you of your intelligence?

106
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,045
To be perfectly honest with you,
Maj. Mhin...

107
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:41,847
...the only thing certain about intelligence
is uncertainty.

108
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,982
As usual, you're a big help.

109
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,793
This better be as important
as your boys at headquarters said it was.

110
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,385
Let's go, Mhin.

111
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:58,394
What do you think Prince will say when
we come walking in there after him?

112
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,200
"You came a long way, Fred,
to collect your bread."

113
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:04,572
- That's what he's going to say.
- You'd better believe that, baby.

114
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,043
What makes them think Hanoi
will sit still for this kind of stunt?

115
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:10,707
It must make sense
or they wouldn't be sending us.

116
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:14,274
One camp. What good could it do?
The POWs are in dozens of camps.

117
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,821
It's the camp with the most guys in it.

118
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,087
I do not see how a raid at this time
can do anything but harm the negotiations.

119
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:24,421
Major, I thought
the goddamn war was over.

120
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,891
So did I, but it's not. What's your point?

121
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:30,594
The point is we don't want to be
the last guys killed in this war...

122
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,728
...if there's someone else available.

123
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:35,466
I think they've got us down
for second to last.

124
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,904
Whatever happened to the good old days
when Randolph Scott and John Wayne...

125
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:43,778
...were happy to get their asses blown off
for the good ol' US of A?

126
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,840
Who the hell is Randolph Scott?

127
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,510
Randolph Scott Key:
dude who wrote the national anthem!

128
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,546
Oh, that Randolph Scott!

129
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:54,524
You can joke if you want,
but I've got a score to settle.

130
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,925
That's the spirit, Gordie, an ear for an ear!

131
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:59,395
I said not to joke around
about my ears, didn't I?

132
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,598
You're gonna have a hard time
finding an ear that size.

133
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:06,331
Just give me a couple whole heads.
I'll use what I need.

134
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,434
What do you know? We can go first class!

135
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,567
- You gonna serve coffee, Randolph?
- Sure!

136
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:13,577
I want Lola Falana to serve my coffee!

137
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,170
- Gonna be a movie on this flight?
- Yeah.

138
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:44,990
Mhin?

139
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:05,821
- Major, over here!
- Get in!

140
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:43,687
Gordie, he's hit!

141
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:45,953
Get him.

142
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:51,162
- Come on!
- All right, let's get out!

143
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:54,964
- Get him!
- Come on!

144
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:57,734
- What's the matter?
- Goddamn thing won't start!

145
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:02,706
Come on!

146
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:11,551
Get out! Move out! Let's go!

147
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,281
Come on!

148
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,211
Come on, Gordie. We gotta run!

149
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,606
Where we running, Mike?

150
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:41,946
Are we late for the train or something?

151
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,696
Where the hell are the choppers?

152
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:01,738
The choppers aren't here.
Why don't we take the train?

153
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:04,696
Radio.

154
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:10,335
Nighthawk, this is Tiger 1. Over.

155
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,751
Somebody's going to pay for this screwup.

156
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:24,625
I think I know who.

157
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,822
Yeah, us.

158
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:34,027
Nighthawk, this is Tiger 1.
We're at LZ and waiting for pickup. Over.

159
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:40,368
I don't get it.

160
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:45,777
Everything went wrong by the numbers
and that takes planning.

161
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:52,150
What are you talking about?

162
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,620
I'm saying we've been set up.

163
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,330
Where are the choppers?

164
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,929
I just told you, Gordie, it was a screwup.

165
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,533
I like choppers. They're like birds.

166
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:13,906
- You like birds, don't you?
- Sure I do, Gordie.

167
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:16,676
Jesus.

168
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:18,813
Where are the choppers?

169
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:22,545
I like choppers. They're like birds.

170
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,986
I shot a bird once.
My daddy took my rifle away...

171
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:30,322
- Take care of him, Mike.
- Yeah.

172
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,658
- What do we do now?
- Survive.

173
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,527
Lou, the point. Walker, the rear.

174
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,090
- Where are you going, Mike?
- Going home.

175
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:42,002
- What do I do, walk out?
- lf you spot a taxi, flag it down.

176
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,986
- How'd it feel?
- A hell of a lot better!

177
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:43,387
Let's clean her out
and I'll give her another try.

178
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:51,232
I think our troubles with this baby
are just about history.

179
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,361
You spend one more minute with this car,
I think that baby there will be history.

180
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,766
Damn, can you believe
I forgot all about her?

181
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:02,368
Any man who forgets her
needs a lube job and oil change real bad.

182
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:04,309
I can't wait to get her on the rack.

183
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:11,650
Goddamn it, Booker, what's a girl
have to do to get your attention?

184
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:15,182
I'm sorry, Kelly.

185
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:25,362
You're really going to be mad.
I've got a class to teach in one hour.

186
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:26,826
Shit.

187
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,176
Come on, Booker, get in.

188
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,259
And so, as history slowly places it
into some kind of perspective...

189
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,858
...a few things about the Vietnam War
have become clear.

190
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:04,298
It was a war
that never should have begun...

191
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:06,568
...in a country
we never should have entered.

192
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:11,011
And its thousands of victims died
without really understanding why...

193
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:16,183
...mainly because the reasons for the war
were beyond any rules of logic.

194
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:23,186
On Wednesday, we'll sing patriotic songs
and pretend I said none of the above.

195
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:26,720
- Good lecture, man.
- Thank you.

196
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:28,695
- See you, Booker.
- Okay.

197
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,101
I hope you didn't mind my sitting in.

198
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:47,875
It seems a long way from the '60s,
doesn't it?

199
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,417
Yes, it does.

200
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:51,484
Can I take you to lunch?

201
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:55,589
I don't eat lunch. Who are you?

202
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:59,287
Let me take you to dinner and find out.

203
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:01,829
- You do eat dinner?
- I've been known to.

204
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,225
I'm on an expense account.

205
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:09,636
You're a reporter.

206
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:12,799
Why else would I fly all the way out
from Washington to see you?

207
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:14,341
I don't know.

208
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,476
Pick me up at 7:00?

209
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:20,207
7:00 is too late.

210
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,448
For us?

211
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:25,244
For dinner. How about 5:30?

212
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,045
At 5:30 in Washington,
they're still out to lunch.

213
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:30,752
In Washington, they're always out to lunch.

214
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:34,762
Besides, I have a feeling
this might be a very interesting evening.

215
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,058
You're the professor, Professor.

216
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:59,749
- That's it, mister.
- That's a good job.

217
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:01,387
Too bad you weren't born black.

218
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:04,220
There might have been a future
in this for you.

219
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:07,022
Hey, mister, you forgot your newspaper.

220
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:10,364
- 19 and 25.
- Thank you, my man.

221
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:56,035
Quite a car.

222
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:59,665
Not exactly ideal for going
from stoplight to stoplight, is it?

223
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:02,869
- Only if they're 200 miles apart.
- Pretty much for a grad student.

224
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:07,711
I do test driving, and like a damn fool,
I took the car instead of the salary.

225
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,688
What the hell is he trying to do?

226
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:57,889
Hang on!

227
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:17,011
You son of a bitch,
what the hell's going on?

228
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:18,814
Relax! The accelerator pedal stuck!

229
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:21,913
- What?
- I said, "The accelerator pedal stuck!"

230
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,015
Why didn't you kill the engine?

231
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:27,152
Because I thought
I could kick the pedal loose.

232
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,741
What the hell was that all about?

233
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:43,172
- I wish I knew.
- I think I need a drink.

234
00:29:43,243 --> 00:29:47,577
- Any place in particular?
- Your place. As long as you drive carefully.

235
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:52,714
<i>Are most of your days usually</i>
<i>as e</i>x<i>citing as this one?</i>

236
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:56,620
<i>Not quite, but I've got a feeling</i>
<i>things are about to change.</i>

237
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,225
<i>If you've got something to say, say it.</i>

238
00:29:58,225 --> 00:29:58,691
<i>If you've got something to say, say it.</i>

239
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,923
You were on a top-secret mission to rescue
some POWs at the end of the war.

240
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:07,265
No response?

241
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,392
I get it.
You're writing a book about the war.

242
00:30:13,173 --> 00:30:14,936
Something like that.

243
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:19,606
When you arrived at the camp,
there were no POWs, only Vietcong.

244
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,704
You lost most of your men.

245
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,344
I wonder who told you about that.
It was all top secret.

246
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:27,813
Shall I go on?

247
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,482
Are you married?

248
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,255
After the raid, you were to be met
and flown to safety with the POWs.

249
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:36,989
The helicopters didn't show...

250
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:40,521
...so you marched out of the jungle
with five of your men.

251
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,996
Do you fool around?

252
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:55,075
It took you three weeks
to get out of the jungle.

253
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:59,517
Then you were, as they say,
"debriefed" in the hospital for two months.

254
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:02,487
Nothing was ever printed
about that strange sortie.

255
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:04,781
Why not?

256
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:07,124
How about something to eat?

257
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:11,255
What ever happened to those POWs
who weren't there to be rescued?

258
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:13,864
Have they been returned? Are they MIA?

259
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,657
Are they dead?

260
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,038
Will anybody admit that they ever existed?

261
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,240
- Will you answer any of those questions?
- Now, what can you do with one egg?

262
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:33,816
Watch out.

263
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:40,960
Nice selection. We can sauté these.

264
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:43,518
I tried it once. I didn't like it.

265
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:47,395
How about some frozen halibut?

266
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:52,102
Your unit was a part of Operation Phoenix.

267
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:55,741
Its job was to neutralize,
I believe they called it...

268
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:58,073
...the Vietcong undercover agents.

269
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:01,079
You were also assigned
to rescue our own POWs.

270
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:04,343
You're very intense for a girl with such...

271
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:13,492
How about one egg
with oysters and sauerkraut?

272
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:18,630
Are you going to tell me anything?

273
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,698
There's really not much to tell.

274
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:26,400
In the hospital, they told us the VC
intelligence had cracked our security.

275
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:28,270
Reasonable possibility.

276
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:30,502
They said our choppers
had been shot down.

277
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:32,135
Reasonable possibility there.

278
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:36,409
Then by the time they got replacements
to us, there was nothing but bodies.

279
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:37,973
That's what they said.

280
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:40,485
And like an obedient soldier,
you believed them.

281
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:44,056
In the hospital,
I told myself the war was over.

282
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:46,115
I lived through it, now put it behind you.

283
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:49,992
I could spend years trying to find out
if somebody set us up.

284
00:32:50,297 --> 00:32:52,390
And if I found him, well...

285
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:56,363
...he most likely would be someone
I couldn't get to anyway.

286
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:58,495
What if he were someone you could get to?

287
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:03,504
I decided no to waste my life
to avenge something I'd survived.

288
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:07,074
It's over and I want to keep it that way.

289
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:11,079
I don't believe you really feel that way.

290
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:14,749
- Why are you asking all these questions?
- I can't tell you.

291
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:16,789
Then stop asking them.

292
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,382
I met a man at a cocktail party
in Washington.

293
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:24,863
He was what the newspapers refer to as
"a high-ranking government official."

294
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:26,694
He was also very drunk.

295
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,727
The scotch seemed to break
some barrier in his mind.

296
00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:33,800
- He mentioned the Black Tigers.
- How's the sauerkraut coming?

297
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:37,032
Coming nicely, thank you.

298
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:39,536
John T. Booker:

299
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:43,338
A man taking his Ph.D.
in Political Science...

300
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:46,813
...who used to be a member of the CIA.

301
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:50,218
- Sounds schizophrenic.
- I was never a member of the CIA.

302
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:52,215
The Black Tigers were CIA.

303
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:58,587
I didn't know the Freedom of Information
Act was that effective.

304
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,860
It isn't, but I am.

305
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:05,869
What do you think of Conrad Morgan
being named Secretary of State-Designate?

306
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:08,402
- Nothing.
- Doesn't interest you?

307
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:12,475
I'm only interested in finding out
what you're not telling me.

308
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:18,673
Who's going to tell who first
what he or she isn't telling?

309
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:23,821
Maybe I'll tell you after dinner.

310
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:27,059
Or maybe in the morning.

311
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:30,460
How about the morning?

312
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:34,218
- Bad dream?
- Yeah.

313
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:36,425
What?

314
00:35:50,477 --> 00:35:53,139
- You don't sleep well, do you?
- No.

315
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:55,176
I don't either.

316
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:01,615
Did I keep you awake?

317
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:04,045
I didn't mind.

318
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:07,857
- I'll make it up to you.
- You already have.

319
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:15,363
How do you turn this thing off?

320
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,535
Why does anyone who doesn't sleep well...

321
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:23,736
...have an alarm that sounds like Big Ben
that can't be turned off?

322
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,940
- Where are you going?
- To run.

323
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:32,582
I run, too.

324
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,014
Well, come along.

325
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:38,947
I think I had sufficient exercise last night.

326
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,554
- Breakfast?
- lf you can find anything.

327
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:47,122
Of course, you don't eat breakfast.

328
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,431
I'll see you in exactly 27 minutes.

329
00:36:56,543 --> 00:37:01,105
When I get back,
we can talk about breakfast, maybe.

330
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,979
Hey, Murray.
Why don't you get an honest job?

331
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:48,690
What, and give up my cloak and dagger?
John, I have to talk to you.

332
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:51,591
Pull over. Gas is expensive.

333
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,605
I know better than to ask
where you've been...

334
00:38:06,677 --> 00:38:08,770
...but that cigar smells like pure Havana.

335
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:11,974
Fringe benefits.
John, what did you and Marilyn talk about?

336
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:14,408
Do I know her?

337
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:17,249
The reporter who seems to have
more answers than questions.

338
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:20,154
You wouldn't be talking about a writer
named Margaret?

339
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:24,024
She told me "Marilyn."
Next guy'll get "Myrna" or "Marilee."

340
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,757
She's obviously in the "M's."
What did you tell her?

341
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:31,335
I told her about a long walk I took
a couple of years ago.

342
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:32,733
What did you tell her?

343
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:36,534
Somebody told her more about
that mission than even you and I know.

344
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,541
That scar is ugly, but it's healed.

345
00:38:39,076 --> 00:38:40,805
It's about to be reopened.

346
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:46,312
"Operation Sandstone."
I don't recall that one.

347
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:48,985
There was no Operation Sandstone.

348
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,145
You see that line with "D.A." on it?

349
00:38:51,222 --> 00:38:55,056
It means that sometime during
an operation which never happened...

350
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,289
...it was confirmed
that you were a double agent.

351
00:38:58,563 --> 00:39:01,031
See that "Sanction Authorization 1"?

352
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:04,501
There's a contract out on me.

353
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:05,968
- Correct.
- Why?

354
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:09,495
I think the reporter found out something
she shouldn't. What'd she say?

355
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,267
Someone talked to her about the mission.
I didn't want to hear about it.

356
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:15,812
That's why ostriches die young.

357
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,145
Whoever talked to her
has evidently decided to rectify his error.

358
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:22,778
Who the hell can get into
this machine and put out a hit on me?

359
00:39:23,754 --> 00:39:26,416
Only the President, the Secretaries...

360
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,550
...and a few
Undersecretaries of Defense and State.

361
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,352
The directors of the FBI, the CIA...

362
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,264
...the Chairman
of the National Security Council...

363
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,824
...and the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

364
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:40,301
Thank God it's nobody important.

365
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:44,334
Jesus, this is crazy.

366
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,610
It's not just you, John.

367
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:53,182
I had reason to check out all five of those
guys who came out of that jungle with you.

368
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,687
Holly Washington is dead.
I think Lou Goldberg is, too.

369
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:01,754
- Was it your people?
- I don't know.

370
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,524
Well, find out.

371
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:08,294
Look, first I get a tip on Holly and Lou.

372
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,902
Then I meet a girl who knows more about
that goddamn raid than anyone should.

373
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,962
Then there's the fact that
I'm the one that sent you on it.

374
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,801
It isn't on that computer,
but it's a good bet...

375
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:21,640
...that my name is there
with the rest of the Tigers.

376
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:25,038
- Can't you warn them? Protect them?
- You can.

377
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,684
Last known names and addresses.

378
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,149
Mhin Van Thieu?

379
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:38,658
What is his name doing on here?

380
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,225
He was killed on that last raid.

381
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,493
Evidently not.

382
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:48,232
First listed as MIA, then POW...

383
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:50,239
...released at the end of the war.

384
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:53,736
We obviously paid him off
by bringing him into this country.

385
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:57,508
He's cooking for some Peking-style
restaurant in San Francisco...

386
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,879
...specializing in fried dumplings.

387
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,977
That's great. What else do you know
that you may have forgotten to tell me?

388
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,082
There is something,
but I just can't remember what it is.

389
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:12,085
That helps a hell of a lot.

390
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:15,155
Look, John,
there's a lot I can't help you with.

391
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,763
The company has too many eyes.

392
00:41:18,836 --> 00:41:21,361
So you're going to have to
warn those guys yourself.

393
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,973
This is my life
you're screwing with, Murray.

394
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:26,974
It's mine too, friend.

395
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,031
<i>Hello?</i>

396
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,237
<i>- Gordie Jones, please.</i>
<i>- He's not home.</i>

397
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:38,846
<i>- Where is he?</i>
<i>- At his Uncle Sheffield's Travel Town.</i>

398
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,047
<i>Can I call him there?</i>

399
00:42:41,485 --> 00:42:43,612
<i>He ain't got no phone there.</i>

400
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:47,247
<i>God, we don't owe you any money,</i>
<i>do we, mister?</i>

401
00:42:47,925 --> 00:42:50,553
<i>Look, you can find him at his uncle's.</i>

402
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:04,972
<i>In Washington, Secretary</i>
<i>of State-Designate, Conrad Morgan...</i>

403
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:08,603
<i>... goes before his final Senate</i>
<i>subcommittee hearing this morning.</i>

404
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,547
<i>Morgan's approval by the committee</i>
<i>is virtually certain. At 41...</i>

405
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:46,843
- Good morning.
- Is Gordie Jones here?

406
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,283
All aboard!

407
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:16,937
Hey, Gordie!

408
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:20,381
Hey, Sammy! How ya doin'?
Not much business today.

409
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:23,610
- You doin' any?
- No, business isn't too good.

410
00:44:23,988 --> 00:44:26,320
It's Maj. Booker, Gordie. John T. Booker.

411
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:30,319
I thought you were Sammy.
You look just like Sammy.

412
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,819
Has anyone been to see you recently?

413
00:44:32,897 --> 00:44:35,092
Has anyone asked you about
that last mission?

414
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:37,895
What I wish we had is pelicans
instead of seagulls.

415
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:39,799
Who asked you about the last mission?

416
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,465
Just yesterday. A lady. Maybe today.
I told her about the pelicans.

417
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:45,038
How was the halibut?

418
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,914
Who the hell are you?

419
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:55,781
That's the lady, Major.

420
00:45:07,731 --> 00:45:08,857
<i>Where are we going?</i>

421
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:11,925
<i>Skiing. Maybe we can get to Mike Potter</i>
<i>before they do.</i>

422
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:13,560
<i>But I've got a rental car.</i>

423
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:15,571
<i>You're on an e</i>x<i>pense account.</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>

424
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:18,699
<i>- I don't have any ski clothes.</i>
<i>- We'll get something.</i>

425
00:45:33,323 --> 00:45:36,087
- Want some?
- No, thanks. Is it occupied?

426
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:37,960
Go find out.

427
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:10,020
Go to the bathroom.

428
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,759
No. 1 or No. 2?

429
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:16,832
The window seat, last row,
left side as you go down the aisle.

430
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,895
An Oriental. See if you recognize him.

431
00:46:56,773 --> 00:47:00,903
Looks like a waiter in a Chinese restaurant
I used to frequent in Des Moines.

432
00:47:00,977 --> 00:47:04,071
I'll bet Chinese food in Des Moines
is something to remember.

433
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:06,775
- Is he following us?
- I'm not sure yet.

434
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:08,641
Maybe it's that waiter.

435
00:47:08,718 --> 00:47:11,812
I don't think I tipped him
last time I was there.

436
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:15,516
Who did you talk to
at that cocktail party in Washington?

437
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:19,894
Please don't ask. I'm almost certain I'll lie.

438
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,185
Make a call.

439
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:57,028
There's another one.

440
00:48:32,402 --> 00:48:34,029
So much for that.

441
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:01,592
When you're silent, you're silent.
What are you thinking about?

442
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,230
Old friends.

443
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,797
Mhin.

444
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:10,336
That guy on the plane was Mhin.

445
00:49:12,008 --> 00:49:13,737
Maj. Mhin Van Thieu?

446
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:16,405
Another Black Tiger.

447
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,075
What don't you know?
What did you talk to him about?

448
00:49:22,018 --> 00:49:24,179
I never said a word to him in my life.

449
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:28,452
- What about Murray Saunders?
- I don't know any Murray Saunders.

450
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:30,250
You were someone named Marilyn.

451
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,593
That Murray Saunders.

452
00:49:34,664 --> 00:49:36,632
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

453
00:50:08,898 --> 00:50:11,025
Good evening. You got here just in time.

454
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:13,592
- For what?
- The snow is melting fast.

455
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,729
Is Mike Potter in? He's on the ski patrol.

456
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,968
Mike? No, try his house. I'll dial it for you.

457
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,911
Do you want to take it over there?

458
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,663
- He's not in.
- Tomorrow's his day off. He's jump-crazy.

459
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,827
He'll be on the jump
first thing in the morning.

460
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:49,962
We better spend the night.

461
00:50:50,607 --> 00:50:52,438
- Do you have a room?
- I think so.

462
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:54,443
Do you want to fill this out?

463
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:08,924
To what extent
are we speaking to each other?

464
00:51:09,526 --> 00:51:11,551
What do you want to talk about?

465
00:51:11,661 --> 00:51:13,526
I was wondering, for instance...

466
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:17,327
...if we're speaking enough
to share the only bed in the room.

467
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,493
Sure, we can share the bed.

468
00:51:37,253 --> 00:51:38,948
Any enemies out there?

469
00:51:39,022 --> 00:51:41,456
I'm just as worried
about the enemy within.

470
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,353
- Are you an enemy, Margaret?
- No.

471
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:49,223
You just happened to be there
when Gordie was killed today.

472
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:52,200
- Were you there when Lou and Holly died?
- No.

473
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:58,264
Are you some kind of finger-man
for whoever's doing this?

474
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:06,312
Finger-person.

475
00:52:12,522 --> 00:52:14,615
John, I haven't lied to you.

476
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,255
Including last night?

477
00:52:18,194 --> 00:52:19,718
Especially last night.

478
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,894
You fit in somewhere.

479
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:31,470
So do you.

480
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:35,970
<i>Mr. Morgan, I want to thank you</i>
<i>for the cooperation...</i>

481
00:52:36,045 --> 00:52:38,980
<i>... you're affording this committee</i>
<i>by your appearance here.</i>

482
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:40,447
<i>Thank you, Senator.</i>

483
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:43,680
<i>And I want to assure you</i>
<i>and the other members of the committee...</i>

484
00:52:43,753 --> 00:52:47,746
<i>... that I fully understand the necessity</i>
<i>for hearings such as these.</i>

485
00:52:47,824 --> 00:52:51,590
<i>And I want you all to feel free</i>
<i>to probe into any areas at all...</i>

486
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:53,288
<i>... that might be of interest to you.</i>

487
00:52:53,363 --> 00:52:55,831
<i>I'm sure I can speak</i>
<i>for the entire committee...</i>

488
00:52:55,899 --> 00:52:59,494
<i>... when I say, sir, that such an attitude</i>
<i>is deeply appreciated.</i>

489
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:00,830
<i>Because we've had to deal...</i>

490
00:53:00,904 --> 00:53:03,168
- Think he'll make it?
- Morgan?

491
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:05,498
- Yeah.
- Yes.

492
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:08,066
He's the new darling of Washington.

493
00:53:09,746 --> 00:53:13,204
<i>The attitude of the nation today is</i>
<i>far different from what it was...</i>

494
00:53:13,283 --> 00:53:15,444
<i>... in those early days before Vietnam.</i>

495
00:53:15,518 --> 00:53:18,885
<i>I think the American public today</i>
<i>is far less eager...</i>

496
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:20,855
We'd better get going.

497
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:59,988
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>and welcome to Squaw Valley, USA.</i>

498
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:04,525
<i>After being selected as the site</i>
<i>of the 1960 Winter Olympic Games...</i>

499
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,966
<i>... the Squaw Valley Comple</i>x
<i>was developed...</i>

500
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:11,529
<i>... into one of the world's greatest ski areas</i>
<i>at a cost of over $25 million.</i>

501
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,535
<i>You are now standing</i>
<i>in the lower terminal...</i>

502
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,704
<i>... of one of the world's most spectacular</i>
<i>aerial tramways.</i>

503
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:22,149
<i>The terminal alone cost</i>
<i>over $3.5 million in 1960 dollars.</i>

504
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,771
<i>What snow we had this year</i>
<i>is now melting rapidly.</i>

505
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:30,615
<i>So as we approach the top station,</i>
<i>we advise you to hurry out to the slopes...</i>

506
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:32,551
<i>... and make the most of what's left.</i>

507
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,748
<i>On behalf of Squaw Valley, USA...</i>

508
00:55:34,823 --> 00:55:38,088
<i>... I'd like to thank you for joining us,</i>
<i>and have a happy day.</i>

509
00:56:30,646 --> 00:56:33,479
- I'm looking for Mike Potter.
- You got him.

510
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,011
Major?

511
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:41,285
- What are you doing up here?
- Didn't you get my message?

512
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,120
You mean the Code Red?
I thought that was a gag.

513
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,420
Mike, you're up.

514
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,758
Let's go in the shack. We've gotta talk.

515
00:56:50,832 --> 00:56:53,733
Meet me at the bottom.
Bring these with you.

516
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,730
Mike, wait.

517
00:57:14,623 --> 00:57:15,783
Oh, Jesus!

518
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,454
Jesus Christ, I thought I'd never find you.

519
01:00:07,529 --> 01:00:10,191
There were cops
all over the place up there.

520
01:00:10,265 --> 01:00:13,428
I've got your clothes.
You can change in the car.

521
01:00:13,602 --> 01:00:14,762
Are you all right?

522
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:19,538
- It was Mhin, wasn't it?
- The woman he met at the airport.

523
01:00:21,276 --> 01:00:22,709
I'm sorry about Mike.

524
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,171
But you were right on the scene again.

525
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,979
I'm not the enemy, John.
I told you that last night.

526
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,182
- I think we better talk.
- Tell me!

527
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,985
Edgar Harolds.

528
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:45,295
- Childhood sweetheart?
- A drunk at a cocktail party.

529
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:47,927
- Who is he?
- Undersecretary of State.

530
01:00:48,003 --> 01:00:51,336
A career man at the end of his career,
maybe the end of his rope.

531
01:00:51,406 --> 01:00:53,306
Goddamn it, who are you?

532
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:58,441
Edgar Harolds worked for Conrad Morgan
during the Vietnam War and he hates him.

533
01:00:58,747 --> 01:01:00,510
Morgan on the TV?

534
01:01:00,715 --> 01:01:04,879
The Senate does more than question a man
who's nominated for Secretary of State.

535
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,854
Before Watergate,
it was generally a formality.

536
01:01:07,923 --> 01:01:12,860
Now, they do a pretty thorough job of it.
They even hire attorneys to investigate.

537
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:17,155
- What does that have to do with you?
- It's actually pretty funny.

538
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:21,031
I was invited to a cocktail party
by the head of the committee.

539
01:01:21,102 --> 01:01:24,560
Just a social event.
I had barely started to work for him.

540
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,698
You're a lawyer? An investigator?

541
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,901
I'd been standing for hours...

542
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:31,775
...when I noticed this man
sitting all alone at a table.

543
01:01:31,846 --> 01:01:35,873
He looked pleasantly drunk and harmless.
I went over and sat with him.

544
01:01:35,951 --> 01:01:38,146
- Is Morgan mixed up in this?
- I don't know.

545
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,189
Harolds never mentioned him,
but it seems there's a connection.

546
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,518
The papers keep saying
his approval is assured.

547
01:01:43,592 --> 01:01:47,221
- How, if you told the committee...
- I never told the committee anything!

548
01:01:47,295 --> 01:01:48,853
You don't survive in Washington...

549
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:52,491
...by attacking men like Morgan
without substantial facts.

550
01:01:52,567 --> 01:01:55,866
I just said I wanted to follow up
on some leads and they said, "Go."

551
01:01:55,937 --> 01:01:57,802
- They know nothing about this?
- Not yet.

552
01:01:57,872 --> 01:02:00,807
That's why we'll take the first plane east.

553
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:03,537
That may take days.
I have to get to Joe Walker in Mexico.

554
01:02:03,612 --> 01:02:06,274
- He's the only man left.
- You're left.

555
01:02:06,815 --> 01:02:09,010
And I want you to stay alive...

556
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,648
...for personal reasons.

557
01:02:13,255 --> 01:02:15,120
Do you believe me now?

558
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:25,855
<i>Your attention, please:</i>

559
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:30,801
<i>Will all passengers holding tickets for</i>
<i>Intermountain Flight 184...</i>

560
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:34,997
<i>... please contact the agent</i>
<i>at the Intermountain ticket counter.</i>

561
01:02:39,113 --> 01:02:42,446
Is there any space on 322
to San Francisco and Washington?

562
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:44,808
Yes, ma'am. Round trip or one-way?

563
01:02:44,918 --> 01:02:46,647
- One way.
- Round trip.

564
01:02:47,688 --> 01:02:49,713
You'll need it, back to LA.

565
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,619
You heard the man.

566
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,661
Make mine one-way to LA. Next flight out.

567
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,532
<i>Final call:</i>

568
01:03:01,668 --> 01:03:05,263
<i>Flight 2, now boarding at Gate No. 21.</i>

569
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:16,912
- How about a farewell cup of coffee?
- Why not?

570
01:03:16,984 --> 01:03:20,010
You better hurry.
They're beginning to board.

571
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,915
Have a good flight.

572
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:53,018
I'll do my damnedest
to get them to delay the confirmation...

573
01:03:53,086 --> 01:03:56,283
...but I'm gonna need you there to stop it,
if Harolds'll talk.

574
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:58,449
I'll be there day after tomorrow.

575
01:03:58,525 --> 01:04:02,552
<i>Flight 62, now boarding at Gate 21.</i>

576
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:04,094
That's me.

577
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:07,657
- You gonna wave goodbye?
- I have to turn in the rental car.

578
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:10,703
Oh, God, I left one
with the meter running in San Diego!

579
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:14,764
The committee will love you.
They can ask for a bigger car rental budget.

580
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:17,002
Don't worry about us taxpayers.

581
01:04:17,077 --> 01:04:18,135
Bye.

582
01:05:10,264 --> 01:05:14,291
Collect call, please.
John T. Booker calling Murray Saunders.

583
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:14,650
<i>The emergency over the runway</i>
<i>is causing no danger to the terminal area.</i>

584
01:06:15,462 --> 01:06:17,293
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

585
01:06:17,764 --> 01:06:20,927
<i>All persons in the terminal area</i>
<i>are asked to clear all gates...</i>

586
01:06:21,001 --> 01:06:23,697
<i>... and entrances to the field</i>
<i>so emergency workers...</i>

587
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:26,238
<i>...and equipment can get through.</i>
- Hold it!

588
01:06:26,306 --> 01:06:29,537
<i>Obey the commands of the airport guards</i>
<i>and police officers...</i>

589
01:06:29,609 --> 01:06:33,841
<i>... so that rescue workers may perform</i>
<i>their duties as efficiently as possible.</i>

590
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:37,247
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>there is no danger to the terminal area.</i>

591
01:06:38,085 --> 01:06:40,178
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

592
01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:17,922
What are you doing with that gun?

593
01:08:37,637 --> 01:08:38,865
Harolds!

594
01:08:40,607 --> 01:08:43,508
Jesus Christ, I should have figured it out.

595
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:46,741
In Paris.

596
01:08:49,983 --> 01:08:52,110
It was a setup all the way.

597
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:56,447
That's what Harolds
was trying to tell Margaret.

598
01:09:00,227 --> 01:09:02,718
John, are you okay?

599
01:09:03,396 --> 01:09:04,863
Yeah, thanks.

600
01:09:06,266 --> 01:09:09,429
She wanted me to talk to him
and get the proof we need.

601
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:13,768
I think our next stop is Washington.
Are you sure you've got Walker covered?

602
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,899
I still can't figure out
why they suddenly decide to kill us all off.

603
01:09:17,978 --> 01:09:21,072
Maybe Morgan found out
that Harolds was about to crack.

604
01:09:21,147 --> 01:09:23,172
Why didn't he arrange an accident
for Harolds?

605
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,617
Five'll get you ten
there's a damn good reason he didn't.

606
01:09:26,686 --> 01:09:28,313
Let's go ask him.

607
01:09:41,535 --> 01:09:42,797
Morning.

608
01:09:43,303 --> 01:09:46,966
- May I help you gentlemen?
- Yes, Mr. Harolds' apartment, please.

609
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,441
- May I have your name?
- We want to surprise him.

610
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,877
I'm afraid we're not allowed
to surprise our tenants.

611
01:09:55,015 --> 01:09:59,145
Even if you were J. Edgar Hoover himself,
I couldn't allow you upstairs.

612
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:02,052
It's not likely he could be Mr. Hoover
if he wanted to.

613
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:05,580
Not only is he the wrong color,
but Mr. Hoover is dead.

614
01:10:06,059 --> 01:10:07,822
I'm sure you get my meaning.

615
01:10:08,261 --> 01:10:09,785
Yes, we do.

616
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:12,859
We want to make sure
you get what we mean.

617
01:10:12,933 --> 01:10:15,629
You see, my friend here is very cranky.

618
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:18,704
In fact,
I'd say he's on the very edge of anger.

619
01:10:19,172 --> 01:10:23,734
And in about five seconds,
I'm going to ask him to kick your teeth in...

620
01:10:23,843 --> 01:10:27,438
...if you don't show us the way
to Mr. Harolds' apartment.

621
01:10:31,484 --> 01:10:34,521
Very well. Follow me.

622
01:10:35,889 --> 01:10:37,186
He must have good teeth.

623
01:10:46,232 --> 01:10:47,722
Remember what happened...

624
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,759
...the last time a Washington apartment
was broken into for political reasons.

625
01:10:51,838 --> 01:10:54,398
Think about it.
It altered the course of history.

626
01:10:54,474 --> 01:10:56,601
He will alter the course of your nose...

627
01:10:56,676 --> 01:10:58,871
...if you don't show us
where the apartment is.

628
01:10:58,945 --> 01:11:02,244
- lf you put it in that perspective...
- Now!

629
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,319
There it is.

630
01:11:08,588 --> 01:11:12,615
- Should we ring the buzzer or kick it in?
- No, I'll ring the bell.

631
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:20,223
Yes?

632
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:23,661
- Tell him it's you.
- It's me, Mr. Harolds.

633
01:11:24,938 --> 01:11:25,996
Who?

634
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:28,104
Louder. Be more specific.

635
01:11:28,308 --> 01:11:31,505
Albert, the doorman.

636
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:34,211
What do you want?

637
01:11:34,347 --> 01:11:37,316
- Package.
- I've got a package.

638
01:11:47,293 --> 01:11:51,662
- It's all right, Albert.
- Thank you. You've been quite civilized.

639
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:57,059
Good morning, Mr. Harolds.

640
01:11:57,136 --> 01:12:00,435
"My vengeance is swift, saith the Lord."

641
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:04,441
I expected it to be swift and very violent.

642
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:08,005
I haven't been disappointed.

643
01:12:09,048 --> 01:12:12,745
Since the day you walked out of
that hotel room in Paris...

644
01:12:12,986 --> 01:12:16,285
...l've been wondering
if I might not see you again.

645
01:12:16,556 --> 01:12:21,516
The fact that you are here now
is testimony to your powers of survival.

646
01:12:22,228 --> 01:12:24,423
The test is not over yet.

647
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,725
I'd like you to meet John Booker.

648
01:12:26,933 --> 01:12:30,528
Maj. Booker,
the shepherd of the betrayed flock.

649
01:12:30,737 --> 01:12:33,331
That's what we're here to talk about.

650
01:12:33,506 --> 01:12:37,875
Normally, I'd do what I've done
all the years I've served my country...

651
01:12:38,144 --> 01:12:40,442
...and feed you a line of shit.

652
01:12:41,948 --> 01:12:44,178
But I don't think I'll bother.

653
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:47,151
Perhaps you're doing me a favor.

654
01:12:49,022 --> 01:12:51,547
No, Major, there's no one else here.

655
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,697
My wife and children had the good sense
to go on about their own lives years ago.

656
01:12:59,499 --> 01:13:03,299
- Do you have a family, Major?
- I had plans, but they didn't work out.

657
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:09,437
Then perhaps you're fortunate.

658
01:13:12,578 --> 01:13:14,443
So this is what I get...

659
01:13:15,248 --> 01:13:19,742
...for having too much to drink
and finding a receptive ear.

660
01:13:21,254 --> 01:13:25,088
Can you imagine a career diplomat
getting drunk and babbling...

661
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:27,592
...at a Washington cocktail party?

662
01:13:28,795 --> 01:13:33,061
You don't get to be an old-timer here
without learning not to do that...

663
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:35,893
...unless you're over the hill.

664
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:41,103
An interesting phrase, "over the hill."

665
01:13:41,841 --> 01:13:46,175
Conrad has been telling me for years,
that's where I am.

666
01:13:47,346 --> 01:13:49,439
He's a brilliant man, Conrad.

667
01:13:50,349 --> 01:13:53,716
Most of us think we know
what we want out of life.

668
01:13:54,554 --> 01:13:59,082
But Conrad is one of those few
who knows how to get it.

669
01:13:59,826 --> 01:14:03,762
Of course, he learned immediately
of my drunken indiscretion.

670
01:14:04,464 --> 01:14:09,265
The captured indiscreet remark
is a source of power in Washington...

671
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:11,667
...a lesson Conrad learned well.

672
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:17,103
I may have been the one
who first taught him that.

673
01:14:17,577 --> 01:14:20,239
Perhaps I am over the hill.

674
01:14:21,981 --> 01:14:26,008
And she is a brilliant young woman,
quite lovely.

675
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:32,121
There was something about her.
I just wanted to talk to her.

676
01:14:32,892 --> 01:14:35,952
But, of course,
you must know that by now, Major.

677
01:14:36,963 --> 01:14:40,490
Your being the leader of the Black Tigers...

678
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,860
...I assume she must have gone
directly to you.

679
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,700
Of course,
Morgan assumed the same thing.

680
01:14:47,106 --> 01:14:50,906
His efforts to find out
just how much you knew...

681
01:14:50,977 --> 01:14:54,777
...and whom you might have told
have probably kept you alive.

682
01:14:55,348 --> 01:14:58,340
Four of the men who came back with me
weren't as lucky.

683
01:15:00,653 --> 01:15:03,850
My condolences, of course,
will seem meaningless.

684
01:15:05,424 --> 01:15:07,756
I was there in the beginning...

685
01:15:08,427 --> 01:15:11,863
...when they invented
the Phoenix Operation.

686
01:15:11,931 --> 01:15:15,867
Do you know what everyone
was most upset about?

687
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:21,033
Not the idea that we were
consciously structuring a group of men...

688
01:15:21,107 --> 01:15:24,907
...whose purpose was
the clandestine murder of other men.

689
01:15:26,512 --> 01:15:31,074
Not the moral ramifications
that might befall us in another life...

690
01:15:31,884 --> 01:15:35,479
...for the decision
based on political expediency.

691
01:15:37,223 --> 01:15:41,250
What we got most embroiled in
was an argument over what...

692
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:43,887
...a particular group of assassins...

693
01:15:43,963 --> 01:15:47,126
...we decided to call the Black Tigers...

694
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,226
...what that group of assassins
would wear...

695
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:55,035
...when they went out to relieve
selected individuals of their very lives.

696
01:15:56,008 --> 01:16:00,035
Finally, after a great deal
of bitter argument...

697
01:16:00,613 --> 01:16:05,209
...we determined
to dress the Black Tigers in all black.

698
01:16:06,018 --> 01:16:10,512
The commission was then paid to
a noted designer who shall be nameless...

699
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:15,951
...who designed the black clothing
the Black Tigers wore as they rolled out...

700
01:16:16,028 --> 01:16:18,189
<i>... on their holy crusades.</i>

701
01:16:18,531 --> 01:16:20,658
<i>You made quite a reputation</i>
<i>for yourselves.</i>

702
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:27,098
Mr. Morgan?
Mr. Harolds has some visitors.

703
01:16:28,641 --> 01:16:29,972
No, sir, I'm not sure.

704
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:34,240
I think one of them is Murray Saunders
from the Los Angeles office.

705
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:37,345
You want them stopped?

706
01:16:38,184 --> 01:16:40,812
Right, and a man on Harolds.
You've got it.

707
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:46,115
We were set up.

708
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:48,354
Yes.

709
01:16:48,694 --> 01:16:50,355
What was the deal?

710
01:16:50,696 --> 01:16:55,224
When I was a younger man, I knew
I was going to be Secretary of State...

711
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:57,496
...or perhaps even President.

712
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,603
If I tell you the answer to that question...

713
01:17:01,807 --> 01:17:06,767
...I may not even be afforded
the opportunity to retire next year...

714
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:09,906
...with the modicum of dignity left to me.

715
01:17:14,387 --> 01:17:16,355
But then, I suppose your life...

716
01:17:16,422 --> 01:17:19,789
...is not nearly so inconsequential to you...

717
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:22,054
...as it is to Mr. Morgan...

718
01:17:22,628 --> 01:17:24,596
...or even to me.

719
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:35,606
- I hope this letter's the answer.
- It's the best shot we've got.

720
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:04,258
Okay, Saunders, I want that letter.

721
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,045
Listen, Al.

722
01:18:16,315 --> 01:18:19,580
Somebody got into that computer
and this letter proves it.

723
01:18:20,519 --> 01:18:22,180
The letter, Murray.

724
01:18:24,623 --> 01:18:26,648
Come on.

725
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:35,532
- Get the letter. I'll cover you.
- Watch out!

726
01:19:14,707 --> 01:19:17,175
- Enjoy the fight?
- Terrific.

727
01:20:06,859 --> 01:20:08,258
Here it is.

728
01:20:09,428 --> 01:20:11,692
Why would this guy live
halfway to Baltimore?

729
01:20:11,764 --> 01:20:15,325
Who knows? Maybe it has
something to do with Spiro Agnew.

730
01:20:15,401 --> 01:20:18,234
It wasn't very hard
to get an appointment with the big man.

731
01:20:18,304 --> 01:20:21,569
Morgan's very interested
in what he thinks we might have to sell.

732
01:20:32,284 --> 01:20:35,310
- Good morning, Saunders.
- Good morning, Morgan.

733
01:20:35,387 --> 01:20:37,355
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

734
01:20:37,423 --> 01:20:40,654
A gentleman whom I'm sure
will add to our discussion.

735
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:42,253
I see.

736
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,124
John T. Booker.

737
01:20:54,273 --> 01:20:59,108
Saunders, I trust this rather unusual
meeting is as important as you indicated.

738
01:20:59,445 --> 01:21:02,846
Something you said had to do with
our last rather unusual meeting...

739
01:21:02,915 --> 01:21:04,610
...in that Paris hotel room.

740
01:21:04,683 --> 01:21:08,141
Something, yes.
But with one notable addition.

741
01:21:09,822 --> 01:21:11,585
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

742
01:21:11,657 --> 01:21:15,149
Can we get on with it?
I have a rather busy day ahead of me.

743
01:21:15,227 --> 01:21:19,323
You made a deal in Paris with Kuong Yen,
the North Vietnamese negotiator.

744
01:21:19,398 --> 01:21:21,559
Secret deals are the heart of diplomacy.

745
01:21:21,967 --> 01:21:24,367
This deal called for
the murder of the Black Tigers.

746
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:26,628
Murder, Mr. Booker?

747
01:21:27,406 --> 01:21:30,534
One other American knows about it
and he talked.

748
01:21:31,944 --> 01:21:33,138
Indeed?

749
01:21:33,245 --> 01:21:35,076
At first, I couldn't figure out...

750
01:21:35,147 --> 01:21:38,241
...why you didn't try to kill Harolds
along with the rest of us.

751
01:21:38,317 --> 01:21:39,682
He told me.

752
01:21:40,152 --> 01:21:44,282
He sent a registered letter to four lawyers,
none of whom you know.

753
01:21:45,024 --> 01:21:49,222
The letters were to be opened
in the event of his untimely death.

754
01:21:50,329 --> 01:21:51,660
Early Agatha Christie.

755
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:53,288
And just as effective.

756
01:21:53,365 --> 01:21:57,597
The letters explain what was known by you
and Kuong Yen as the Phoenix Solution.

757
01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:01,538
I couldn't figure out what Maj. Mhin
was doing popping in and out of my life.

758
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:04,906
At first, I assumed he worked for them,
whoever "they" were.

759
01:22:04,977 --> 01:22:09,505
But of course, "they" are you,
and you are all one.

760
01:22:09,748 --> 01:22:13,775
I see. "We have met the enemy
and they is us."

761
01:22:13,853 --> 01:22:15,753
Comic strip philosophy, Mr. Booker.

762
01:22:15,821 --> 01:22:18,654
Agreed, and now Kuong Yen
is manipulating you...

763
01:22:18,724 --> 01:22:21,284
...like the comic strip diplomat you are.

764
01:22:21,927 --> 01:22:25,328
He waited patiently until the moment
of your greatest vulnerability...

765
01:22:25,564 --> 01:22:28,829
...the eve of your confirmation
as Secretary of State.

766
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:30,693
Now he's blackmailing you...

767
01:22:30,769 --> 01:22:33,829
...into completing the deal
you never finished...

768
01:22:34,506 --> 01:22:37,134
...the extermination of the Black Tigers.

769
01:22:37,643 --> 01:22:40,635
They are very unforgiving people.

770
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:42,508
Toward you or the Black Tigers?

771
01:22:42,581 --> 01:22:46,847
- Toward us, Mr. Booker. "We" is us.
- Perhaps.

772
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,159
Interesting document.

773
01:23:05,304 --> 01:23:08,603
Morgan, you're gonna pick up that phone
and call the White House.

774
01:23:08,674 --> 01:23:11,040
Sudden personal problems
are going to prevent you...

775
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:14,568
...from accepting the nomination
as Secretary of State.

776
01:23:15,414 --> 01:23:18,474
If you don't,
the news media is going to have...

777
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:20,780
...one hell of a time with that letter.

778
01:23:21,553 --> 01:23:25,546
I understand, Maj. Booker,
that you were quite a jungle fighter.

779
01:23:25,758 --> 01:23:27,692
This is my kind of jungle, Major.

780
01:23:30,596 --> 01:23:34,726
No, I just don't think it would be...

781
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,030
...expedient for me to resign at this time.

782
01:23:37,102 --> 01:23:38,433
Expedient?

783
01:23:38,637 --> 01:23:41,868
Just like it was expedient
to send us on that POW raid?

784
01:23:42,675 --> 01:23:45,576
Expedience built this country, Maj. Booker.

785
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:51,272
It was expedient for this great democracy
to have legal slavery for half its existence.

786
01:23:52,051 --> 01:23:56,112
And it was expedient to keep the vote
from women for 150 years.

787
01:23:56,388 --> 01:24:00,484
Expedient to declare war on Spain
and Mexico and to invade Cambodia.

788
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:04,857
From the halls of Montezuma,
Maj. Booker, to the shores of Tripoli...

789
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:08,366
And it was expedient, goddamn it,
to get rid of the Black Tigers.

790
01:24:09,668 --> 01:24:12,034
The end still justifies the means.

791
01:24:12,104 --> 01:24:13,833
I don't buy that.

792
01:24:14,573 --> 01:24:18,475
It occurs to me that most of those
who follow your logic end up in places...

793
01:24:18,544 --> 01:24:20,569
...like Elba and San Clemente.

794
01:24:20,713 --> 01:24:21,805
Come now...

795
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,507
Check your history.

796
01:24:23,582 --> 01:24:26,710
Most of our expedient wars
ended up in failure.

797
01:24:26,852 --> 01:24:29,878
Our successes didn't just happen
because they were expedient.

798
01:24:29,955 --> 01:24:32,856
Those Americans you spoke of
gave up their lives willingly.

799
01:24:32,925 --> 01:24:34,984
Does that really make such a difference?

800
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,961
It makes all the goddamn difference.

801
01:24:39,398 --> 01:24:43,357
People like you never could see that
and maybe they never will.

802
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:48,932
It's not that you don't deserve
to be Secretary of State.

803
01:24:50,009 --> 01:24:52,034
You don't deserve to live.

804
01:24:53,412 --> 01:24:56,040
That's an interesting philosophy, but...

805
01:24:56,115 --> 01:24:59,983
But philosophy is bullshit, right, Morgan?

806
01:25:02,254 --> 01:25:04,017
That letter isn't.

807
01:25:05,824 --> 01:25:07,485
I tell you what.

808
01:25:08,227 --> 01:25:12,095
You take this letter over to
the <i>Washington Post</i> with my best regards.

809
01:25:12,164 --> 01:25:15,827
But tell them they're gonna have
a hard time verifying that with Harolds...

810
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:20,634
...because visitors are not allowed
in the Bethesda Hospital psychiatric ward.

811
01:25:24,276 --> 01:25:27,109
Yes, it was a shame.

812
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:29,409
They found him crawling on the floor...

813
01:25:29,481 --> 01:25:32,473
...and howling like a banshee.

814
01:25:33,285 --> 01:25:37,381
Took four men just to put him
into the straitjacket.

815
01:25:37,923 --> 01:25:42,155
Nervous disorder, they called it,
but actually, he's quite mad.

816
01:25:42,294 --> 01:25:45,695
Hello? I'd like to check on
the condition of a...

817
01:25:45,764 --> 01:25:47,925
...Mr. Harolds, Edgar J.

818
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,971
Thank you.

819
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:04,048
A letter written by a madman is...

820
01:26:04,116 --> 01:26:07,244
...hardly what they call prime evidence.

821
01:26:07,386 --> 01:26:08,853
Is it, Mr. Booker?

822
01:26:10,422 --> 01:26:13,084
As I told you,
I have a rather busy day ahead of me.

823
01:26:13,158 --> 01:26:17,219
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm sure you can find your own way out.

824
01:26:22,134 --> 01:26:24,227
By the way, Mr. Booker.

825
01:26:25,137 --> 01:26:28,766
Tragic news about your lady friend.
Margaret, was it?

826
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:32,837
All that information she had
must have been irreplaceable.

827
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:34,134
Tragic.

828
01:26:34,213 --> 01:26:35,544
You bastard!

829
01:27:02,774 --> 01:27:04,264
Wait a minute.

830
01:27:13,986 --> 01:27:16,546
Accelerator pedal working all right today?

831
01:27:23,328 --> 01:27:24,886
Work for Morgan?

832
01:27:26,398 --> 01:27:27,592
Do you?

833
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:49,712
<i>We're running a little late, Franklin.</i>

834
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:04,790
<i>Secretary of State Morgan will become</i>
<i>one of the youngest men ever...</i>

835
01:28:04,868 --> 01:28:06,631
<i>... to achieve this high office.</i>

836
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:10,230
<i>He's described as one of the new breed</i>
<i>of diplomats for the '70s.</i>

837
01:28:10,941 --> 01:28:13,466
<i>Although still in his early 40s...</i>

838
01:28:13,543 --> 01:28:16,478
<i>... Morgan has had</i>
<i>a long and distinguished career...</i>

839
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:18,980
<i>... as one of America's leading diplomats.</i>

840
01:28:19,049 --> 01:28:21,882
<i>His skill at top-level negotiations</i>
<i>has made him...</i>

841
01:28:21,952 --> 01:28:24,944
<i>... one of the few</i>
<i>State Department leaders to...</i>

842
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:52,976
<i>Franklin, where are we going?</i>

843
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,275
<i>I said, "Where are we going?"</i>

844
01:28:58,955 --> 01:29:00,752
What the hell is this?

845
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:03,418
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

846
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:06,055
Booker.

847
01:29:06,396 --> 01:29:09,058
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

848
01:29:09,132 --> 01:29:13,364
You said I was a good jungle fighter.
I'm also a fast learner.

849
01:29:30,387 --> 01:29:33,220
All right, now, you stop this car, you fool.

850
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:36,020
Relax, Morgan, we're just going to talk.

851
01:29:38,695 --> 01:29:41,027
All right, go ahead. Talk!

852
01:29:41,865 --> 01:29:45,266
What you said about expedience
made a hell of a lot of sense.

853
01:29:45,502 --> 01:29:50,337
I see there's only one way to deal with
people like you: expediently.

854
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:54,775
You won all the battles, Morgan,
but you're gonna lose this war.

855
01:29:55,078 --> 01:29:56,807
How would you like to be an MIA?

856
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,804
What're you talking about?

857
01:29:58,882 --> 01:30:03,319
When it comes time for your swearing in
today, you're not gonna be there.

858
01:30:04,354 --> 01:30:05,844
I'll be there.

859
01:30:06,523 --> 01:30:07,717
You're dreaming.

860
01:30:08,024 --> 01:30:09,013
Am I?

861
01:30:18,502 --> 01:30:21,562
Booker, they're going to come
looking for me.

862
01:30:21,972 --> 01:30:26,841
You can't just disappear a Secretary
of State without arousing someone's ire.

863
01:30:27,377 --> 01:30:28,469
Let 'em look.

864
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:31,746
All right. Tell me, what's your plan?

865
01:30:32,015 --> 01:30:33,880
If you get away with this...

866
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:37,977
...it'll betray every guy that ever died
in any war we ever had.

867
01:30:38,054 --> 01:30:42,013
And God knows how many more people
you'll kill in the future.

868
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:44,653
I'm not gonna let it happen.

869
01:30:45,662 --> 01:30:47,892
You're insane. It won't work.

870
01:30:48,064 --> 01:30:49,588
You can bet your ass it will.

871
01:30:49,966 --> 01:30:52,059
Crazy, goddamn idiot!

872
01:30:52,335 --> 01:30:54,633
You stop this car! You hear me?

873
01:30:55,138 --> 01:30:58,232
Stop this car or I'll kill you!

874
01:30:58,808 --> 01:31:00,241
You're panicking.

875
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:01,800
Stop the goddamn car!

876
01:32:22,826 --> 01:32:25,056
