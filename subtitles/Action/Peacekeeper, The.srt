1
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:22,513
You did it, John.

2
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:28,440
<i>All fighting has stopped.

3
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:35,290
<i>There's no more dying.

4
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:39,001
<i>And all of a sudden,

5
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:42,102
<i>three is not such
a scary number.

6
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,929
<i>But no matter
how wonderful this is,

7
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,265
<i>I will not accept it

8
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,012
<i>as a trade-off
for losing you.

9
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,688
I've got you.

10
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:37,607
Thank you ever so
for your kind assistance.

11
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,261
Always anxious to lend a hand
to a Dominar.

12
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:43,847
So often I've proclaimed having
a belly full of Crichton and Aeryn.

13
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:46,884
Never thought
it would be so literal.

14
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,032
What did you call
their species again?

15
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:56,746
This is Crichton.
He is called a Human.

16
00:03:56,814 --> 00:04:01,832
And Aeryn, Sebacean.
Definitely Sebacean.

17
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,396
Rygel, do you have
all the pieces?

18
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,478
From under every rock,
every crevice,

19
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:08,585
I sifted the bottom sand
with my bare hands!

20
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:11,273
Look at my nails!

21
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:13,066
Caa'ta, the Leviathan ship
has returned.

22
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,761
Their transport pod
is approaching.

23
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,198
Order the concealment
canopy lowered.

24
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:34,309
Sir, another deep-space contact
from Peacekeeper Strategic Command.

25
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,483
It's Grand Chancellor Maryk again.

26
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,995
Grand Chancellor.

27
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:50,256
Where the Hedsmana
in my orders did you find the phrase

28
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:51,981
"preemptive attack"?

29
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,130
<i>The Scarrans are massing

30
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:55,341
for an impending onslaught
we all know is coming!

31
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,671
<i>A conflict we are
ill situated to win.

32
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:01,455
By challenging them before they are
prepared, we have a fighting chance.

33
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:05,265
<i>- You were sent to gather surveillance
and... - With all due respect, sir,

34
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:09,455
I was sent here to perish

35
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:12,372
at the vanguard
of this inevitable conflict.

36
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:15,698
I simply refuse to participate
on their terms or yours!

37
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:16,746
<i>Because of your actions,

38
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,187
the Scarran Empire
has declared war against us.

39
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,384
Do you know what that means,
Scorpius?

40
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:24,363
<i>We are now officially engaged

41
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:27,187
in the last war of our era!

42
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:29,358
Congratulations.

43
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:40,749
- D'Argo!
- Chiana!

44
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,140
- Your eyes.
- I can see again.

45
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:49,102
- What happened? How?
- He, He gave me n-new eyes.

46
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:52,972
- We found one, yes.
- Stark and I found a Diagnosan.

47
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,069
What's wrong with him?

48
00:05:57,143 --> 00:06:01,138
Nothing's wrong with him!
He's fine.

49
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,722
Grunschlk, I thought
you were dead.

50
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:07,858
Me? Hardly at all.

51
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:17,716
Those crystals
are people's lives.

52
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:19,673
Stop waving that thing around.

53
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:20,914
This had better work.

54
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:24,116
You're lucky
to have him, mate.

55
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:27,186
Diagnosans,
they're at a premium.

56
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:30,356
Especially now
that there's a war on.

57
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,150
What war?

58
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,048
The Peacekeepers and the Scarrans
have declared war against each other.

59
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:38,512
Do the Peacekeepers know
what they're getting into?

60
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:41,817
The Scarrans didn't
give 'em much choice.

61
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:46,194
They were already taking
the galaxy by force. System by system.

62
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,056
A galaxy-wide war.

63
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:56,378
The Scarran vanguard has breached our
defense perimeter.

64
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,779
We've drawn them in
sufficiently. The trap is set.

65
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:01,691
Captain, initiate the plan
exactly as I instructed.

66
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:04,179
All pilots, deactivate
targeting in-flight systems.

67
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:06,261
We fly manual from here.

68
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,397
<i>Fly straight in.

69
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,259
Their targeting telemetrics
will be corrupted

70
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:14,077
at least two degrees off center
by the ambient magnetics.

71
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:17,689
<i>You dared them to hit you.

72
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:24,541
Red Team, move close to my
left flank. Blue Team, likewise.

73
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,232
Upon signal,

74
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,692
execute tier attack
on lead Scarran Dreadnought.

75
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,715
Confirm.

76
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,944
All armada ships
now taking heavy fire, sir.

77
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,763
Only for the moment.
Stay positioned.

78
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,964
And... fire!

79
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,658
Lower your weapons.

80
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:24,699
How long?

81
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:25,983
About 60 solar days.

82
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,962
Where?

83
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,464
Still on the water planet.

84
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,199
Put your weapons down now!

85
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,829
Bad guys?

86
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,388
Yes and no. They did help us
put you back together.

87
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,697
Put us back together?

88
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:41,344
They said it was an accident.
You were crystallized.

89
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,584
Crystallized?

90
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,523
Last warning.

91
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,758
- You said yes.
- I did?

92
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,935
- Sixty days. Any regrets?
- No. It's going really well.

93
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,534
Hey, we're gonna get married!

94
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,267
Congratulations.

95
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:09,408
Sir, you were
absolutely correct.

96
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,327
Their pilots and gunners
were no match for ours.

97
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:18,531
- Scorpius?
- Prepare to withdraw.

98
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,455
What?

99
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:24,611
The rest of the armada is to continue
to engage the enemy, covering our escape.

100
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,721
But, sir, we're winning.

101
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:31,234
- Without this carrier, all remaining units...
- My orders are clear.

102
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:34,601
Sir, you're asking us
to withdraw our troops,

103
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,811
our ships, our...

104
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,035
Close hangars!

105
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:46,441
Wait for maximum speed.

106
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,840
He is alive, Sikozu.

107
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,488
John Crichton is alive.

108
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:58,411
One more time.

109
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,298
Begin again.

110
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,666
Fine.

111
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:05,994
For the 89th time.

112
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:15,463
Once upon a time,
there was a boy named John.

113
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:18,829
And John was an astronaut.

114
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:21,709
<i>He lived in a faraway place
called Earth.

115
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:24,807
<i>Which is so far away,
you've never heard of it.

116
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:27,748
<i>One day when John was out
doing astronaut things,

117
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:31,686
<i>a big blue wormhole
gobbled him up and spat him out

118
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,028
<i>at the far end of the universe.

119
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:37,258
<i>- Things were looking grim in Mudville
- Canaveral?

120
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:41,833
<i>Till our hero met
an amazing living ship,

121
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,595
<i>made some nice new friends

122
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:46,730
<i>and he hooked up
with his dream girl.

123
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,482
<i>We could've lived happily ever
after, but the Peacekeepers

124
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:52,935
<i>raped, chased and tortured us
for years on end.

125
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,603
Fire!

126
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:58,349
Then two months ago, we got
our asses shot off again.

127
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,411
This time it was the Scarrans,
big reptiles. Oooh!

128
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:03,824
And Moya, our living ship,

129
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,956
limped her way to your
happy planet for a little R&R.

130
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:10,638
Because we figure, it's empty!
Hey, no one is gonna bother us.

131
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:13,967
We're gonna have a baby!

132
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:17,165
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

133
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:19,178
Next thing, me
and the future Mrs. Crichton

134
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:21,640
are having a private moment
when you guys fly by.

135
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:25,098
Boom bada-bing,
squiggly line, squiggly line.

136
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:28,433
Crystallized.
And it's two months later.

137
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:34,386
What?

138
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,175
Retreating.

139
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:38,252
Scorpius has powered off
his onboard beacon.

140
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:40,300
We have no way
of tracking him.

141
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,674
Broadcast this order.
Highest priority.

142
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,904
The instant his command carrier
is spotted, it is to be fired upon.

143
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,362
No hailing,
no offer to surrender.

144
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:51,601
I want this coward Scorpius
and all who fly with him

145
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,164
erased from existence!

146
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:54,285
Aye, Chancellor.

147
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:57,772
Scorpius is many things, Maryk.
None of them good.

148
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:00,019
But a coward? Never.

149
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:03,153
He has initiated this war,
and then turned and run!

150
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,907
How do you define
cowardice, Grayza?

151
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,730
Grand Chancellor,

152
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,345
please consider my counsel
on this carefully.

153
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:14,099
Hatred of the Scarrans

154
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:18,640
is Scorpius'
sole consistent trait.

155
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:20,851
There is something else.

156
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,603
Perhaps.
But my orders stand.

157
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,775
- Funny how?
- Different.

158
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,912
Different how? Like ice cream
cucumber different?

159
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,319
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

160
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,450
All right. Everything
is gonna be okay.

161
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,270
Do you know why?

162
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:40,501
Because we're done.
We're checking out.

163
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,400
Next Ferengi we see, we run.
No questions later.

164
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:49,363
From this moment on,
my one concern, my life

165
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,046
is you
and our baby.

166
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:01,722
Are you sure?

167
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:04,122
- What?
- Is she all right? The baby all right?

168
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:07,122
Doc says he doesn't know what you're
talking about. There is no baby.

169
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:10,099
What? Whoa, whoa!
What do you mean, no baby?

170
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:15,480
Ah, if there was
a little passenger before,

171
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:18,036
it ain't aboard the train
no more.

172
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,648
Doc says you
never were pregnant.

173
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:24,626
- I was.
- She was!

174
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,010
She was preg...
You were pregnant?

175
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:27,354
I was pregnant!

176
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:30,489
There is no baby.
No. Nothing.

177
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,216
Whoa!

178
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,039
We were in pieces,
thousands of pieces.

179
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,198
Rygel said he got every single
piece off of the ocean floor.

180
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,986
- Rygel.
- He was very thorough.

181
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,070
We made sure of it.

182
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:47,604
Even carried the pieces
up in his stomach

183
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:50,363
to make sure
he didn't drop them.

184
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:53,398
Congratulations, mate.
You are a mother!

185
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,131
- Oh, no!
- It's all right.

186
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,845
The wee babe
is doing just fine.

187
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:02,011
Yes, but it's doing
just fine inside me!

188
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,389
This is not happening.

189
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,398
- Do something.
- Hands off, missy.

190
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:09,880
The fee.
The fee is going up.

191
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:13,915
You take it out of him,
and you put it back in her.

192
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,967
Whatever it takes.

193
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:17,913
Won't do it.

194
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:22,264
Won't? I want this thing
removed immediately.

195
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,419
It's not a thing!

196
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:29,056
Fine. I want this miracle
of life out of me!

197
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,878
All right.

198
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:33,249
At the end of
the first quadmester.

199
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:37,089
The baby's too small now.
Fragile.

200
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:40,985
First quadmester?
Give me a drink!

201
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:48,338
Hey, princess, the nar's
in your stomach? Drad.

202
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,131
- What does it feel like?
- You tell me.

203
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,850
Hey!

204
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:57,576
Weeber eggs? I hate them.

205
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,175
Well, apparently babies
love them.

206
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,905
Actually, Rygel, what does
it really feel like?

207
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:04,498
Like having a parasite,

208
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,542
a large parasite
that's growing!

209
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,703
Okay, what did we do
to piss off the locals?

210
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,748
- They're paranoid.
- No, wrong, not paranoid.

211
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,582
I've been talking to many
of them.

212
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,558
Stark our ambassador?
No wonder they're avoiding us.

213
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:22,878
What's their problem then?

214
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:25,636
- Fear. Abject fear.
- Of what?

215
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,232
Their fear extends to the point
of not talking about their fear.

216
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:30,894
Perfect. Let's not exacerbated
it by staying any longer.

217
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:34,036
D'Argo, beyond that concealment
canopy is Armageddon.

218
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,896
Do we really wanna
fly into that right now?

219
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:39,617
I'll ask 'em if we can stay.
They're not gonna like it.

220
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:42,890
So what should we do
in the meantime?

221
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,335
We get married.

222
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,580
What?

223
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,214
Now.

224
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:52,349
You will make a beautiful bride.
I will see to it.

225
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,598
- Emperor Staleek.
- What is it?

226
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:01,460
We have received
a deep-space comm cipher.

227
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:05,396
- We receive tens of thousands...
- This is from a most unexpected source.

228
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:08,378
With a most
unexpected message.

229
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:11,241
It is about John Crichton.

230
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:14,247
The sender knows the Human's
current location.

231
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,590
An out-of-the-way water planet.
No defenses to speak of.

232
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:20,444
- Do the Peacekeepers have him?
- Not yet.

233
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,484
Your source, is it reliable?

234
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:25,504
At the moment,
impeccable.

235
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,136
Have a course plotted.

236
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:30,897
We will send
a full battle contingent.

237
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:33,940
A full contingent
for one man?

238
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:35,956
Not for the man.

239
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:38,404
For the knowledge
he possesses.

240
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:46,445
It's very generous
of you to do this for us.

241
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:50,072
It is the first time I have presided
over the union of soldiers.

242
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,192
We're not soldiers.

243
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:55,167
In fact, he's the only one
carrying a gun.

244
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,544
Either way, your petition to remain
among us is being denied.

245
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:01,134
On conclusion of your sermon,
you will all leave.

246
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:03,512
Right.

247
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:06,782
If you don't mind my asking,
who are you hiding from?

248
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:09,472
Everyone.

249
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:12,682
Aeryn's coming!
The bride! The bride!

250
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,647
Come on!

251
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,018
- Okay, are you relaxed?
- I am relaxed.

252
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,261
- I've heard the key is being relaxed.
- I am relaxed.

253
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,632
- Stand here. Stand.
- What about me?

254
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:22,195
You're right here.

255
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:23,992
- Good.
- Okay, perfect.

256
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,485
What are you doing?
No, no!

257
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:29,464
Stark!

258
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,923
Oh, she looks so...

259
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,564
Beautiful.

260
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:51,567
You look great.

261
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,332
- You owe me.
- I know.

262
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:57,333
Is there a particular invocation
you would like me to use?

263
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:01,977
Yeah, um...

264
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,636
Dearly beloved.

265
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:09,190
"Dearly beloved. "

266
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,395
We are gathered here.

267
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,315
"We are gathered here. "

268
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,830
Beneath
this magnificent...

269
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,948
Command Carrier.

270
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,186
Peacekeepers.

271
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,626
Lies. All lies!

272
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:29,171
They seem to know
exactly where we are.

273
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,015
How, if the concealment
canopy is still in place?

274
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:34,917
They know because
we have been betrayed.

275
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:38,038
Stark, go with them.
Witchiepoo, you go as well.

276
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,522
- What should we do?
- Convince them it's not our fault!

277
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:44,509
Hide Rygel.
Guard it with your life.

278
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:53,246
It's not our fault.
It's not our fault.

279
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,883
We knew nothing about this.
Crichton will fix it.

280
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:59,399
- He'll fix it. I assure you.
- Come on, old woman.

281
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,875
Now, that's familiar.
Why do I know that?

282
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:03,893
Now!

283
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:05,654
Oh.

284
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:15,821
Eidelons.
Of course!

285
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:17,831
Eidelons!

286
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:23,256
Eidelons.
You're Eidelons.

287
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:25,292
Yes, we are.

288
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,554
You know who
it's gonna be, don't you?

289
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:39,512
I know who it is.

290
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:42,392
Come on, "D," bet me.
How much?

291
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:46,187
You're on your own,
my friend.

292
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,317
Hello, John.

293
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,598
Easy money.

294
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,671
Apologies if this is
a bad time,

295
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:59,124
but I believe
we need to talk.

296
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,744
How did you find me?

297
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,372
Harvey?

298
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,275
- I would prefer to be called Albert.
- No.

299
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:12,361
Invisible sidekicks that only
I talk to get called Harvey.

300
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,530
How the hell
did Scorpius find me?

301
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,819
Scorpius is like God.

302
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:23,428
He does not play dice
with the universe.

303
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:27,000
He has a great plan, John.

304
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:30,157
But his mysteries
unfold slowly.

305
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:32,486
Perhaps they
will be answered

306
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:36,315
when the proper tribute
is provided to him.

307
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,685
The wormhole!

308
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,585
Or in your case,

309
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,120
the wormhole weapon!

310
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:51,590
Listen up, Strangelove,

311
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,460
I can find wormholes,
sense when they will open.

312
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:57,385
Push comes to shove,
I can even navigate one.

313
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:00,991
But I cannot make
a wormhole weapon!

314
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,660
That is true, John. But you do know
where to obtain the knowledge.

315
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:08,393
It does not take an Einstein
to figure that out, huh?

316
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:18,373
Make sure he gets
that message.

317
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:28,481
So how have you been,
Crichton?

318
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,310
- I'm good, Bob. You? The wife? The kids?
- Busy.

319
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:35,432
Yeah. I hear
business is booming.

320
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:39,926
You're right. The Scarrans
and Peacekeepers are at war.

321
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:41,777
And the Scarrans will prevail

322
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:45,096
unless you help us build
a wormhole weapon.

323
00:21:45,162 --> 00:21:47,999
Gee, that all sounds
reasonable, Bob.

324
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:51,762
Only two problems. No matter
what you may believe, I can't do it.

325
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:56,252
Just as important, I don't think Peacekeepers
are any better than the Scarrans.

326
00:21:56,322 --> 00:22:00,085
So make sure you validate
your parking... on the way out.

327
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:03,454
You will find no serenity
during this conflict, Crichton.

328
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,118
Examine your choices.

329
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,221
You are not listening.

330
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,958
Wormholes, no! Weapons, no!

331
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:12,959
Killing, no.

332
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,065
Crichton, no.

333
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:21,545
You want to see it?

334
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:25,079
<i>The thing you've been chasing
my ass all over the universe for.

335
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:29,359
<i>Torturing me, my wife,
my friends for.

336
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:31,803
<i>- You wanna see it?
- Yes.

337
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:34,455
<i>- Say please.
- Please.

338
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:36,046
<i>- Pretty please.
- Pretty please.

339
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,718
<i>- With a cherry on top.
- With a cherry on top.

340
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:43,767
<i>Happy birthday.
Now get out of my sight.

341
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:45,867
D'Argo, D'Argo, a miracle!

342
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:49,247
Eidelons, Jool, Arnessk, peace!

343
00:22:49,322 --> 00:22:52,126
Okay, what's
he talking about?

344
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:55,442
Eidelons, Jool, Arnessk,
peace!

345
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:58,118
Thank you.
Please.

346
00:22:58,188 --> 00:23:02,231
We are the last Eidelons.

347
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,606
- All others hunted to extinction.
- Hunted?

348
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:08,965
Our ancestors possessed
the means to influence peace.

349
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:11,865
A gift that sadly has
not survived to our generation.

350
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,551
I'm familiar
with the history.

351
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,360
Then you would also know
that 12,000 cycles ago

352
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:17,851
their great temple
was destroyed,

353
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,708
the conciliators
were murdered,

354
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,938
and all outposts
of our species, slaughtered.

355
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,844
Arnessk was the center
of our spiritual power.

356
00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:27,234
The sight of the long-lost
great temple,

357
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:29,116
upon which this very edifice
is modeled.

358
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:33,246
However, today, Arnessk
is a barren and lifeless world.

359
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:37,018
Perhaps not.
We've been there.

360
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,437
These images are part of a data
upload transmitted by Jool

361
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,136
before we left her on Arnessk.

362
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:49,112
<i>I have more in the archives
if you require.

363
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:50,364
Undoubtedly you will recall...

364
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,800
Except not you
because you weren't there.

365
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:56,132
It was right after Crichton realized
that he loved you more than anything.

366
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:59,232
- And you were as frizbot as a...
- Shh.

367
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,727
Hmm? Oh! Arnessk.

368
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,081
These ancient Eidelons were not
long dead as everyone assumed.

369
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:08,742
Just suspended in time
for 12,000 cycles.

370
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:11,084
When we reversed the device
that was holding them,

371
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:13,542
back they came into existence.

372
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:16,914
Right after I went swimming
with the creature from the black lagoon.

373
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:18,321
That sounds exciting.

374
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:22,187
There is no doubt that today's
Eidelons are a direct descendent

375
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:25,080
of the ancient peacemaking
Eidelons of Arnessk.

376
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:26,257
And?

377
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:28,533
They have a unique ability
tied to their physiology.

378
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:30,543
Which is latent
in our host Eidelons.

379
00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:34,003
Why can't their ancestors
reignite that ability?

380
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:40,159
Thus recreating the greatest
peacemaking race in history!

381
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:43,258
Am I going insane or is the crazy lady
starting to make sense?

382
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:45,667
- Yes. But I thought we were finished.
- So did I.

383
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,190
What happened to
"run first, no questions later"?

384
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:52,488
Scorpius. We wake up and he finds us
before we have our first cup of coffee.

385
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:54,943
- This is not our fight.
- I agree.

386
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:57,158
But as long as there's a war on,
everyone's after me

387
00:24:57,227 --> 00:24:58,722
'cause I'm the
winner-take-all weapon guy.

388
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:03,950
- Every time we get involved...
I know. People die.

389
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,295
We out of options?

390
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,148
This Eidelon
education program.

391
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:15,062
- What are the odds it'll work?
- Not good.

392
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:18,162
Not good is the best odds
we ever get.

393
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:29,432
The most exciting aspect
is the possibility

394
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:32,223
of learning how to influence
peace in others.

395
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:34,298
Noble aspiration,
High Priestess.

396
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:35,964
We have discussed it
amongst ourselves,

397
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,426
and would be most appreciative
if you would transport

398
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,627
Pikal and Caa'ta to Arnessk
for an introductory delegation.

399
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:46,113
- But we can take many more.
- As I have repeatedly said...

400
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:50,792
Centuries of hiding do not
melt away suddenly, Pikal.

401
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:53,797
We remain skeptical
about your motives.

402
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:57,352
And that's just on our side.

403
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:01,294
I know a little something
of the Leviathans

404
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:02,444
and their symbiotic Pilots.

405
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:05,169
Peaceful to a fault,
if I recall.

406
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:09,035
To Moya or myself,
violence is less than an option.

407
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,478
Then I have a simple query.

408
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:14,613
These beings that you ferry,
do you trust them?

409
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:17,586
Implicitly.

410
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,494
Then I entrust Caa'ta
and Pikal to your care.

411
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,919
Tissue transferal conductor.

412
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,225
The doc hasn't got
all the bits,

413
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:35,297
but you'll probably find everything
you need up on your ship.

414
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:38,150
And the doctor will give you
detailed instructions.

415
00:26:38,218 --> 00:26:40,040
That's unacceptable.
He's coming with us.

416
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:44,167
No, I'm sorry. The doctor and I do not
travel into Peacekeeper territory.

417
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:46,693
We have some previous issues
with them.

418
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:49,189
Aeryn, this is a relatively
simple procedure.

419
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,404
My baby is in a Hynerian.
It's nowhere near simple.

420
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:52,521
Of course it is.

421
00:26:52,593 --> 00:26:55,247
This part attaches to Rygel,
the other part to you.

422
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,171
Before you know it,
the baby's transferred.

423
00:26:57,237 --> 00:27:00,174
So elegantly designed.
Anyone can use it. Good luck.

424
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:02,102
- What? Where are you going?
- Not with you.

425
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,598
Why not?

426
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:05,909
These Eidelons have just
absorbed a thunderbolt revelation.

427
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:08,794
I know more about their
ancient culture than they do.

428
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,578
They can benefit from my
instructions until you return.

429
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:15,803
Can I do it myself?

430
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:19,104
No.

431
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,855
Right.

432
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:39,078
What the hell
is he doing here?

433
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:40,939
- We were invited.
- Just stay there.

434
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,597
I've thought this through.
We need him.

435
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,521
I don't like it.
Well, blame me.

436
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:47,213
I do blame you.
I don't like it!

437
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:48,877
I don't like it either.
But we are currently flying

438
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:51,372
through Peacekeeper
controlled space during a war

439
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:53,421
and he is a
Command Carrier officer.

440
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:55,536
Actually my most recent commission

441
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:58,608
was commander of
a full Peacekeeper armada.

442
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:01,269
Uh-huh. Among other things!

443
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,416
He knows all the current
pass codes.

444
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:05,211
I'll keep him away.

445
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,492
I hope so.

446
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:17,664
Oh, Aeryn, Rygel,
off-limits.

447
00:28:24,427 --> 00:28:27,330
- Good morning, Commander.
- Morning, Pilot.

448
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:30,667
Moya looks beautiful.
How much did you miss us?

449
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:34,348
We have received a message that appears
to have been hailing for some time.

450
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,660
First Arnessk.

451
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:38,828
I have enough of a fix
that we can begin our journey.

452
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:42,414
I will find the exact location from
Moya's data banks as we grow closer.

453
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:44,659
Excellent, Pilot.
Proceed.

454
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:48,471
- Their message?
- Sure, Pilot. Who is it?

455
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:51,189
Apparently the
Royal Palace of Hyneria

456
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:54,708
coming from someone
named Bishaan.

457
00:28:56,766 --> 00:29:00,312
What is really
happening there, Bishaan?

458
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:02,043
<i>It is this damned war.

459
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:07,035
<i>The Scarrans have already taken our
outer territories. Millions are dead.

460
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:11,332
<i>You are a direct descendent
of the royal lineage.

461
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,978
<i>If our people will unite under
anyone, it will be under you.

462
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,307
<i>Cousin Rygel, you are welcome
to return to Hyneria.

463
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:22,823
<i>You must return

464
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:29,228
If Bishaan thinks
I'll return to a shared throne,

465
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:30,826
he is beyond diluted.

466
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,361
Ow!

467
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:34,510
You're not going anywhere.
You rest.

468
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:36,688
Some mother
you're going to make.

469
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,654
Ship-wide announcement
for our new guests.

470
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:43,698
Prepare for starburst,
people.

471
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:10,561
- Chiana, Chiana!
- In here.

472
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:16,232
Blessed Eidelon, may
I enter the room and...

473
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:17,415
Enough!

474
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:21,898
What is it exactly
about these guys

475
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:23,533
that makes you
so faasbotten?

476
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:26,988
Are you serious? The Eidelons
are remarkable negotiators.

477
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,232
The Scarrans aren't
gonna be reasoned with.

478
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,509
But they will if...

479
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:32,688
If what?

480
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:42,045
Frell...

481
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:45,822
- Is he propositioning me?
- No.

482
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:49,086
That's a very special gland.

483
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:53,187
Smart.

484
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:57,283
- In a weird place.
- It's an antenna to feelings.

485
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:59,809
An inner eye.
Am I right, Pikal?

486
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:03,910
Yes. And our history
leads us to believe

487
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:06,054
substantially more.

488
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:07,882
It gets bigger?

489
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:12,362
Not that we know.
However, it vibrates.

490
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:17,006
We used to be able
to create an energy field

491
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,082
that had a calming effect
on individuals,

492
00:31:19,155 --> 00:31:21,460
allowing them to see reason.

493
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:24,375
Yeah, but your
little, limp thing.

494
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,416
It can't do
the trick anymore.

495
00:31:26,491 --> 00:31:28,280
Unfortunately not.

496
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:44,477
We've really
gotta get married.

497
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:52,003
Now.

498
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:58,410
She has a good strong kick.

499
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:01,740
Perhaps to remind you that you're
needed on the command deck.

500
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:07,629
There is nothing to be done
at the moment.

501
00:32:07,699 --> 00:32:09,840
You know the situation.

502
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:13,424
Situations change.

503
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,561
We are outnumbered,
out-gunned,

504
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:19,480
and our populace has grown
averse to hardship.

505
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:23,929
What are you trying
to say?

506
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:27,609
More to the point,
what are you not saying?

507
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:34,847
We have now lost every single battle
since the start of the war.

508
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:39,967
I seek your opinion

509
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,927
on a truce.

510
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:45,572
The Scarrans will accept
no truce.

511
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:48,958
Only surrender.

512
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:52,104
A surrender then.

513
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:55,307
When all is lost... only.

514
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,671
What are the signs,

515
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:00,878
my dear Grayza,

516
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,704
that all is lost?

517
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:08,654
A military leader
who broaches surrender.

518
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:18,487
Crichton has departed
the water planet.

519
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:21,757
My contact has provided
approximate coordinates to his destination.

520
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:23,680
Fearful flight
or purposeful journey?

521
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:26,048
He seeks the means
to end this conflict.

522
00:33:26,115 --> 00:33:27,708
- Wormhole weapon.
- Unknown.

523
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,434
Though he does now have
a traveling companion.

524
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:33,188
- Scorpius.
- How well do they guard Crichton?

525
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,197
The Leviathan travels
unescorted.

526
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:37,160
Though Peacekeepers now
protect the water planet,

527
00:33:37,227 --> 00:33:38,337
they have left.

528
00:33:38,408 --> 00:33:40,420
Order the remainder
of our battle contingent

529
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,922
to engage the enemy there.

530
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:44,300
Defeat them.

531
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:45,960
Then subdue the inhabitants.

532
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:48,873
<i>And this Decimator?

533
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:52,241
To follow Crichton,

534
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:54,991
and settle old scores.

535
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:56,739
Any good vibes
from the Eidelons yet?

536
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,589
Caa'ta is suspicious.

537
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:02,434
Imagine finding out your 12,000-cycle
old relatives are still alive.

538
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,700
I once thought
my Aunt Ruth was dead.

539
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:07,736
You can't believe the stuff
we found in her closet.

540
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:11,732
- Do you think they can do it?
- I don't know.

541
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:14,293
Think the Eidelons
can stop this war?

542
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:16,058
If they can't,

543
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:19,127
we get to find another galaxy
to live in.

544
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:23,704
John, between you and me.

545
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:27,926
- If this doesn't work, can you...
- No, I can't.

546
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,993
Ohhh, by Hedsmana's sight,
why me?

547
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:34,773
You're a Dominar.
It has to count for something.

548
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,742
Carry their baby.
Marry them off.

549
00:34:37,816 --> 00:34:40,751
What next?
Let them move in?

550
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:43,693
What?

551
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:46,797
Forget about it.
This is all wrong.

552
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:50,960
Stop! You are ruining
my wedding.

553
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:54,035
Honey?

554
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:57,264
- What?
- You're pointing a gun at the baby.

555
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:06,830
I've traveled with the two
of you for quite a while now.

556
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:09,285
Known you
since you first met.

557
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:11,051
Over the cycles,
there were times

558
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,869
when it looked like you were
gonna kill each other.

559
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:16,422
Other times we couldn't
have got you off each other

560
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:19,491
with a fire hose!

561
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:21,870
Sounds like a marriage
to me.

562
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:24,268
So,

563
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,761
upon my pronouncement,

564
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:29,382
may these two
be joined as one

565
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,963
and evermore
let nothing come be...

566
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:36,445
No!

567
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:45,245
Pilot!
What the hell is that?

568
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:47,684
We're under attack
by Tregans!

569
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,730
You, hide.

570
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:56,602
Reporting multiple
harpoon strikes.

571
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:58,202
<i>Each with
a hauling line attached.

572
00:35:58,275 --> 00:36:00,412
<i>- Can Moya free herself?
- There are too many!

573
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:02,525
The Tregan ship
is already pulling us in.

574
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:05,277
We're still in Peacekeeper territory.
Most likely they're mercenaries.

575
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:08,694
- What does that mean for us?
- They're probably less likely to take prisoners.

576
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:11,802
I've counted at least seven
two-man craft coming towards us.

577
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,433
They'll attempt
to incapacitate Pilot

578
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,030
and cripple Moya's
vital systems.

579
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,821
One way or another, this will
all be over in half an hour.

580
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:20,123
- These guys work for the Peacekeepers?
- Quite likely.

581
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:22,874
Right. You're with me.
I wanna hear those pass codes.

582
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:25,361
If the Dark Lord here can't convince
them we're a Peacekeeper vessel,

583
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:27,642
make sure you have
an outstanding plan "B."

584
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,366
We'll protect
neurocluster.

585
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:31,508
Chiana, Sikozu, go
find Caa'ta and Pikal

586
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,683
and keep them safe.

587
00:36:33,754 --> 00:36:36,655
- What about me?
- How best can you help?

588
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:39,412
- I can stay out of your way.
- Excellent.

589
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:49,136
This may not go
as smoothly as you'd hoped.

590
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,799
What? You don't do improv?

591
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,453
When I received the signal
you were still alive,

592
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:56,077
my departure from Peacekeeper
service was less than sanctioned.

593
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:57,131
Meaning what?

594
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:59,889
You there, hold position.

595
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:02,093
We're about to find out.

596
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,147
Do you know who I am?

597
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:10,382
Scorpius.

598
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:14,957
I take it, you are sentries
for this sector, yes?

599
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,855
I wasn't informed
you were out here, sir.

600
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:22,755
Nor do you know it now,
lest it cost you your life.

601
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:26,211
In special service
to the Grand Chancellor,

602
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:28,424
I order you to release
and vacate this ship.

603
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:30,466
That won't happen.

604
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,034
And you are?

605
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:33,482
Chief of my vessel.

606
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:36,197
Our orders are
to commandeer any ship

607
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:39,199
not broadcasting
a Peacekeeper ident.

608
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:44,094
My mission would be jeopardized
by advertising such a beacon.

609
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:46,435
Your mission is more
than jeopardized.

610
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:48,679
It is over!

611
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,538
Who is in charge here?
Whom should I be addressing?

612
00:37:56,613 --> 00:38:00,573
And who is going to take
the blame?

613
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,621
Chief, release the harpoons.

614
00:38:06,688 --> 00:38:10,235
On Scorpius' authority.

615
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,293
Your command code, sir.

616
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,871
767 decahelot.

617
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:22,359
Scorpius, it is an honor
to meet you face-to-face.

618
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:40,402
That's a damn nice set
of body armor.

619
00:38:40,474 --> 00:38:41,748
Does that come in blue?

620
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:46,610
What the hell did you do
when you left the fatherland?

621
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:50,421
- Kill the goose that lays the golden egg?
- Deserted my post.

622
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:52,527
What? For little ol' me?

623
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,762
It's amazing what a man will do
when he's in love.

624
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,513
Pilot, anything
you can do to help?

625
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:02,125
- Not without killing you also.
- Hold that thought and be ready to duck.

626
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:09,453
- Who's taking fire?
- Who isn't?

627
00:39:09,524 --> 00:39:10,863
You all right?

628
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:15,466
Other than being shot at by the
Electric Mayhem, I'm fantastic!

629
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,732
You must stay hidden.

630
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:27,213
And you?

631
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,187
Your sensitivity is
of much more value

632
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:30,887
when we are meeting
our ancestors.

633
00:39:30,957 --> 00:39:33,093
It is my function
to assure your safe arrival.

634
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,814
- But...
- There is no time to argue.

635
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,764
Three of them
heading parallel to us.

636
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:44,222
You can see that?

637
00:39:44,297 --> 00:39:46,272
I can with my new eyes.

638
00:39:50,984 --> 00:39:52,706
Two.

639
00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:21,305
Son of a bitch!

640
00:40:22,815 --> 00:40:25,629
- Pilot, stay down!
- I can't!

641
00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:27,832
We have to get outta here
before Pilot gets shot.

642
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:29,876
What we need is
the release transmitter.

643
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:32,851
- Where is that?
- Over there with the head Treg.

644
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:38,070
Fine. Surrender or die!

645
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,079
You enjoy this,
don't you, Crichton?

646
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:51,536
You know this species?

647
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:55,154
Then dead is okay.

648
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:11,534
You never struck me as the type
who would want children.

649
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,838
You either, huh?

650
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:24,612
He wants it so badly.
So I do.

651
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:28,712
You'll come around when you see the little guy
in person.

652
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:30,189
I hope so.

653
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:47,973
All right, lover boy,
get ready to cover me.

654
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:14,398
Are you having fun yet, John?

655
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:17,596
You call that covering fire?

656
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,224
No more Tregans aboard.

657
00:42:19,296 --> 00:42:21,751
That's good news, Pilot.

658
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,480
However, they're
still reeling us in.

659
00:42:23,551 --> 00:42:27,610
- Because we can't release the harpoons.
- Why not?

660
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,506
'Cause somebody sent
the transmitter down the abyss.

661
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:36,124
This transmitter,
what does it look like?

662
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,384
A star-shaped medallion.

663
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:52,592
<i>- Pilot?
- All lines disengaged.

664
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:54,488
We're free!

665
00:42:54,553 --> 00:42:57,005
Ooh! Guess they figured out
their captain's dead.

666
00:42:57,078 --> 00:42:59,314
Rygel?

667
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:01,588
Pilot, can Moya starburst?

668
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:03,082
She will try.

669
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:04,817
That's our girl.

670
00:43:14,388 --> 00:43:18,478
This is not good.
Rygel? Rygel?

671
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:20,551
Don't get your knickers
in a twist.

672
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:22,118
The baby is all right.

673
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:26,502
<i>I'm terribly upset
I failed to detect the Tregans.

674
00:43:26,577 --> 00:43:28,004
1812, pipe down.

675
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,657
I was so preoccupied with other
duties, they snuck up on us.

676
00:43:31,726 --> 00:43:35,685
That's all right, Pilot. You're a few
thousand mistakes behind the rest of us.

677
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:39,270
Hey, Pilot, how much is this gonna
slow us down getting to Arnessk?

678
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:40,485
<i>The answer, Commander,

679
00:43:40,557 --> 00:43:42,412
is not at all.

680
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,919
Excellent.

681
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,905
Okay, I'm lost.

682
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:38,103
Not lost.

683
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:04,239
- Your business?
- Hiya, Jool.

684
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:07,949
- You.
- Me.

685
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,291
- Crichton. You?
- Crichton.

686
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:14,827
- You are crazy.
- I knew you wouldn't forget me.

687
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,747
The more we were apart,
the more I knew you'd realize

688
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,469
that you are meant
to be with...

689
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,846
Aeryn.

690
00:45:20,913 --> 00:45:25,768
- Jool.
- Get your own fantasy, they're having my baby.

691
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:29,933
Baby?

692
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:43,778
And it goes without saying
you show deference and respect.

693
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:46,821
- Absolutely.
- Please, don't embarrass me.

694
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:56,003
Excellent acoustics,
are they not?

695
00:45:56,073 --> 00:45:58,855
Perhaps you'd care
to lead us in prayer.

696
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,530
Apologies, Hierarch Yondalao.
I was explaining to them...

697
00:46:02,598 --> 00:46:07,616
So you are the pilgrims
who purport to be our heirs?

698
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:11,579
Not us. Just him. Go.

699
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:15,131
We understood all
of our descendants to be gone.

700
00:46:17,382 --> 00:46:21,054
Though we trace ourselves
to your lineage, my people

701
00:46:21,122 --> 00:46:26,209
have lost the ability, but not
the desire to influence peace.

702
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:31,099
Troubling.
And exhilarating.

703
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:34,363
I shall confer
with the other conciliators

704
00:46:34,431 --> 00:46:37,178
and notify you
when the matter can be assessed.

705
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:40,114
I told you this was
a waste of time.

706
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:42,775
Myths are rarely satisfying
upon examination.

707
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:44,220
Hierarch, please.

708
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:46,227
You know me.

709
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:48,537
I know these travelers.
They are honorable.

710
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:50,196
Why do you send them away?

711
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:54,523
I do not. I simply require time
to examine the issue.

712
00:46:54,588 --> 00:46:59,092
But, but with great respect.
What is there to examine?

713
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,430
Pikal is an Eidelon
like you.

714
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:05,717
We have awakened
from 12,000 cycles of sleep.

715
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:10,091
What pertinence can we have
to your galaxy now?

716
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:12,687
But the war.
The deaths, the slaughters!

717
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:15,757
Peacekeepers, do your duty!

718
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:18,194
The horror!

719
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:23,596
Sit.

720
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:27,761
May I speak?

721
00:47:27,827 --> 00:47:30,989
The Peacekeeper
shall be heard.

722
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:33,445
We apologize for invading
your sanctuary.

723
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,107
And we understand
you have reason for caution.

724
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:38,890
But what could be
more pertinent in this time,

725
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:42,220
or any, than the ability
to inspire peace?

726
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:46,538
Even if he's Eidelon,

727
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:49,831
how can this one supplicant
help that cause?

728
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:53,160
You are few here,
and Pikal's people are many.

729
00:47:53,227 --> 00:47:55,268
With your instruction,
they could become

730
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,858
a great force for peace.

731
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:01,953
Though the Peacekeeper
provides sound counsel,

732
00:48:02,024 --> 00:48:06,433
I still sustain reservations
that must be meditated upon.

733
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:09,799
Peacekeepers, clear the temple.

734
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,931
Can you believe this?

735
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:14,972
Somebody wants us
to be Peacekeepers.

736
00:48:18,307 --> 00:48:21,024
Are you assassin?

737
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,352
No! I'm just the guy
without a brain.

738
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,134
The Lion here would like
some courage.

739
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:32,188
Tin Man, he needs a heart.
Toto here just wants an easy birth.

740
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:35,799
And Dorothy here, she is
just looking for a way home.

741
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:39,448
Now we're not gonna be here
tomorrow so I suggest

742
00:48:39,518 --> 00:48:42,170
you take a long hard look
at our broomstick.

743
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,971
He is your heir!
An Eidelon.

744
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:04,433
As youths, we open our faces
to the universe,

745
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:10,165
absorbing the joy and anguish
all creatures feel.

746
00:49:10,231 --> 00:49:14,899
Then upon maturation,
we step to the altar

747
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:19,304
to receive Hora Dalay:

748
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:23,091
The ability to encourage
rationality

749
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:24,844
and tranquility
in others.

750
00:49:28,337 --> 00:49:33,191
The capacity to influence
others toward peace

751
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:35,598
carries great
responsibility.

752
00:49:35,664 --> 00:49:40,235
Do you accept this burden
for the rest of your days?

753
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:43,273
It's going to work.
With training,

754
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:46,309
Pikal and his kind,
should be able to stop the war.

755
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,984
- No wormholes.
- Exactly what I was thinking, John Crichton.

756
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:54,629
Can we go back to Moya now?
I'm starving.

757
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:58,692
In a microt. Go and get Stark.

758
00:49:58,761 --> 00:50:03,300
- Is it just me or is he getting bigger?
- It's a geometric pregnancy.

759
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,303
Please tell me that means we're
gonna have a mathematician.

760
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:08,263
A soldier more likely.

761
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:12,156
But we will be having it
sooner than you think.

762
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:13,159
How sooner?

763
00:50:13,224 --> 00:50:14,466
With genetic modifications

764
00:50:14,535 --> 00:50:17,762
put into someone born into
a battle unit like myself,

765
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,738
essentially we're going
to be parents

766
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:22,975
in a matter of solar days.

767
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:31,712
Days?

768
00:50:33,314 --> 00:50:36,160
- We don't have a name.
- Already picked one.

769
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:38,613
Well, what?

770
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,792
- Excuse me?
- Do you not like it?

771
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:43,351
Uh, boy or girl?

772
00:50:43,423 --> 00:50:46,585
Either.
It works for both.

773
00:50:46,652 --> 00:50:48,627
You just made a joke.

774
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:52,758
Soldiers don't have
a sense of humor, John.

775
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,195
You better have my dinner ready
when I get back on that ship now.

776
00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:10,193
Is there nothing
they can do?

777
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:16,209
Then order retreat
from Alentro Quadrant.

778
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,768
Have Commander Spreddic
regroup

779
00:51:18,841 --> 00:51:21,426
in defense of our nearest outposts.

780
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:24,342
Sir, how have the Scarrans
moved so quickly

781
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:25,651
through our
forward positions?

782
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,848
Because they have been planning this for
many cycles,

783
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:29,809
Lieutenant.

784
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:32,811
And you have a design
to turn it around?

785
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,824
Of course.

786
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:36,752
In due time.

787
00:51:56,873 --> 00:51:59,237
<i>Thank you for
your assistance, Aeryn.

788
00:51:59,302 --> 00:52:00,580
<i>Independent verification

789
00:52:00,647 --> 00:52:03,613
of hull integrity is
invaluable to Moya and me.

790
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:06,910
<i>- It's the least I could do.
- If you'll close the thermal-imaging ports,

791
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:09,181
<i>I'll begin cycling
to numistatic distance

792
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,097
<i>calibration, completing
our harpoon repairs.

793
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:16,412
Back so soon?

794
00:52:16,478 --> 00:52:18,649
Why don't you tell Scorpius
that continuously asking me

795
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:19,962
will not change my opinion?

796
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:21,592
Peace is still a better option

797
00:52:21,663 --> 00:52:23,385
than trying to build
a wormhole weapon.

798
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:26,300
Not spoken like
a true soldier.

799
00:52:26,363 --> 00:52:27,792
Depends on your definition.

800
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:30,736
With all due respect,

801
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,143
Crichton is your inferior.

802
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:37,232
So why would you bear
his child?

803
00:52:38,678 --> 00:52:43,250
You should leave, Sikozu.
And I mean off this ship.

804
00:52:47,346 --> 00:52:49,255
I did not mean to offend.

805
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,663
When I first met Scorpius,

806
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:55,110
I naturally assumed
I was his superior.

807
00:52:55,183 --> 00:52:59,304
I have since learned there is
a reservoir to his abilities

808
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:02,188
that continually
overshadows my own.

809
00:53:02,254 --> 00:53:04,870
Same with Crichton.

810
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:09,917
You view Crichton
as your superior?

811
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,847
No, as my equal.

812
00:53:11,912 --> 00:53:15,206
Sikozu, perhaps your under
and over estimations

813
00:53:15,268 --> 00:53:16,796
of yourself are meaningless.

814
00:53:18,372 --> 00:53:22,596
Perhaps you're just meant
to be together.

815
00:53:31,966 --> 00:53:34,452
Interesting these Eidelons.

816
00:53:34,526 --> 00:53:38,135
Yep. Tell me
about it, Bob.

817
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:40,060
Despite the fable
around them,

818
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:42,063
these Eidelons
can only affect peace

819
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:45,202
when the combatants are willing
to let them get near them.

820
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:48,718
Am I detecting a little
professional jealousy?

821
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,059
The Scarrans for certain
will destroy these Peacemakers

822
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:54,091
long before they can get
close enough to have any impact.

823
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:57,424
Great! Then you won't mind
them doing their thing.

824
00:53:57,491 --> 00:53:59,792
Fine! But do yours
at the same time.

825
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:02,410
Me making weapons

826
00:54:02,481 --> 00:54:07,179
is just a means
to your ends.

827
00:54:07,246 --> 00:54:11,338
God! What is it
you really want, Scorpius?

828
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:15,745
Privacy achieved during peace
will always be challenged.

829
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,877
However, if ascended
during conflict,

830
00:54:19,947 --> 00:54:22,179
it can last a lifetime.

831
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:24,703
You wanna say that
in English?

832
00:54:24,776 --> 00:54:28,188
We've been hit.

833
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,985
I have a highly-developed
survival sense.

834
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:31,427
It's telling me to leave.

835
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:33,054
<i>John, it's a Scarran warship

836
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:35,130
<i>closing in on the planet
at maximum speed.

837
00:54:35,202 --> 00:54:36,729
Stryker or Dreadnaught?

838
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:38,556
<i>Neither. Something new
and much faster.

839
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,054
<i>How much time we got?

840
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,406
More like how little.

841
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:43,133
D'Argo!

842
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,368
I'm on my way
to get you now.

843
00:54:45,439 --> 00:54:48,339
Hey, where the hell
do you think you're going?

844
00:54:48,414 --> 00:54:50,716
To remove as much of
our presence as possible.

845
00:54:50,782 --> 00:54:53,944
The Scarrans will be hard enough
on these Eidelons as it is.

846
00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:55,865
Don't worry about it.

847
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,839
We're taking them with us.

848
00:55:00,984 --> 00:55:03,634
- Everyone has to go.
- That is impossible.

849
00:55:03,702 --> 00:55:06,636
Jool, will you explain
to him what is going on?

850
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:09,645
- He knows.
- Hierarch, listen.

851
00:55:09,718 --> 00:55:12,016
These are not chirpy Saturday
morning Sleestaks coming.

852
00:55:12,082 --> 00:55:14,317
The decision has been made.

853
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:17,352
The big hand says
I don't have time to argue.

854
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:20,523
And the little hand says,
Pikal, it is time to go.

855
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:23,437
He is not yet prepared
to instruct others.

856
00:55:23,502 --> 00:55:25,159
His education must continue.

857
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:28,074
We came here because
we need conciliators.

858
00:55:28,137 --> 00:55:31,237
There is an entire planet
of his people waiting.

859
00:55:31,306 --> 00:55:34,436
How the hell are we supposed
to bring them up to speed?

860
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:36,740
I will instruct them.

861
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:41,700
Fine. Fine.

862
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:46,328
Jool, you should come
as well.

863
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:50,881
I can't.
I belong here.

864
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,107
Go.

865
00:55:58,686 --> 00:56:01,075
You always made
the best mistakes.

866
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,403
This is not good.

867
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:13,648
No dren!

868
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:17,514
This frelling thing is supposed
to get the baby out of me.

869
00:56:17,588 --> 00:56:18,898
I don't think so.

870
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:21,812
- Not you, them!
- Who them? What?

871
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:25,256
You wanna worry about someone?
Worry about me.

872
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,312
The Eidelons.

873
00:56:26,387 --> 00:56:28,173
What about them?

874
00:56:29,617 --> 00:56:32,463
Their good give in peace.
Their good sleep in peace.

875
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:34,380
Their good die in peace!

876
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,354
- Why aren't we moving?
- Ask Pilot.

877
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:43,876
The Scarrans are close enough
to have targeted us.

878
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:45,831
<i>Initiate starburst.

879
00:56:45,897 --> 00:56:48,831
Moya refuses. Before she has time
to fully power up, we will be hit.

880
00:56:48,903 --> 00:56:51,522
<i>Any ideas for a diversion?
Scarran vessel.

881
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:54,852
<i>The inhabitants of Arnessk are peaceful.
We have no weapons and pose no threat.

882
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:57,436
<i>Do you wish to land?

883
00:56:59,555 --> 00:57:03,263
- What are they doing?
- Deciding how savage they want to be.

884
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,532
- Okay, come on.
- You'll be safe in here.

885
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,861
- Pilot, we can't just sit here.
- Moya's got to take the risk. Pilot?

886
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:11,197
At this range?
It's suicide!

887
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:14,773
<i>Scarran vessel, please respond.

888
00:57:17,755 --> 00:57:19,097
Bad feeling.

889
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:22,805
Jool, can you hear us?

890
00:57:24,598 --> 00:57:29,455
Get away from the temple.
Now, Jool!

891
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:37,513
The Scarrans have fired.

892
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,311
- Evasive!
- No time!

893
00:57:43,569 --> 00:57:45,479
Son of a bitch. Not us.

894
00:57:45,553 --> 00:57:47,371
Jool!

895
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:40,851
<i>Crew of Leviathan, you must
immediately abandon ship

896
00:58:40,922 --> 00:58:43,635
<i>and surrender to
the Scarran Imperial Forces.

897
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:45,905
<i>Noncompliance with this command
will result

898
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:49,290
<i>in the immediate
annihilation of your ship.

899
00:58:49,365 --> 00:58:51,566
<i>- Repeat, noncompliance with this command
- We're cursed.

900
00:58:51,633 --> 00:58:53,934
<i>Will result in the immediate
annihilation of your ship.

901
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:55,309
<i>Everything we touch.

902
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,140
Prepare for
emergency starburst!

903
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,416
<i>- Crew of Leviathan...
- Shouldn't I stay here?

904
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:16,708
If anyone stays behind the
Scarrans will destroy Moya. Come on!

905
00:59:16,775 --> 00:59:18,465
But I'm pregnant!

906
00:59:24,612 --> 00:59:26,846
Let's do it.

907
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:30,492
I cross-connected the power drive and the
fuel system so we can detonate ourselves

908
00:59:30,562 --> 00:59:32,186
should we choose.

909
00:59:32,257 --> 00:59:33,465
Comforting.

910
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:36,151
"D," last chance to bail.

911
00:59:36,222 --> 00:59:38,936
I'm fairly certain they can't
pierce Moya's invisibility shield.

912
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:41,754
But you give us the signal,
we'll be there.

913
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:43,063
We hope.

914
00:59:43,132 --> 00:59:45,847
Good fortune.
Now, get out of the way.

915
00:59:54,965 --> 00:59:59,124
Well, when this idiot plan dies,
I would say

916
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:01,967
I am the first one
you rescue.

917
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:02,701
Ask Aeryn.

918
01:00:02,772 --> 01:00:05,804
Rescue Yondalao first.

919
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:08,555
Isn't he supposed
to be rescuing us?

920
01:00:08,623 --> 01:00:09,639
Yeah, how about that?

921
01:00:09,713 --> 01:00:11,020
We stride onto the ship

922
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,836
and you convince the Scarrans
to smoke the peace pipe.

923
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:15,908
They are a species
unfamiliar to me.

924
01:00:15,982 --> 01:00:19,494
I must first sense their fears
and desires through proximity.

925
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:24,580
You're about to get all the proximity you
can handle. Scarran vessels straight ahead.

926
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,296
Probe the Leviathan.

927
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:33,731
If you discover any life
other than its pilot,

928
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,447
annihilate the vessel.

929
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:48,638
Oh, I must've
overlooked this.

930
01:00:48,704 --> 01:00:51,417
Sorry.

931
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:55,576
- You lived among the Scarrans.
- Most of my life.

932
01:00:55,644 --> 01:01:00,215
Assisted their dying rituals.
Passage to the other side.

933
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:03,763
- Then you know their psyche.
- As much as possible.

934
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,969
Assist me
with that knowledge.

935
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,844
Welcome to my flagship.

936
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:23,300
That was a temple
you nuked down there.

937
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,862
An act of precaution.

938
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:29,281
Requisite in times of war.

939
01:01:29,357 --> 01:01:32,356
As is truth-seeking.

940
01:01:32,428 --> 01:01:36,353
The Luxan and Nebari
who are traveling with you?

941
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:39,272
Gone... a short while
before we came.

942
01:01:44,778 --> 01:01:49,182
Strange. I always assumed
His Highness was male.

943
01:01:49,253 --> 01:01:53,211
A tumor. Not long to live.

944
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:55,069
I would agree.

945
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:57,306
Take the Hynerian
to separate barracks.

946
01:01:57,376 --> 01:02:00,888
Stop it. Let go of me!

947
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:05,497
I find it troubling that Humans
and Sebaceans can propagate together,

948
01:02:05,566 --> 01:02:07,506
and intriguing.

949
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:09,850
How could you know that he
was pregnant with their child?

950
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:12,728
The same way I knew
to find you here.

951
01:02:12,793 --> 01:02:15,662
- A traitor.
- But who?

952
01:02:15,737 --> 01:02:18,006
Grunschlk.

953
01:02:18,072 --> 01:02:22,324
Ah, they say one traitor

954
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:25,871
can always
recognize another.

955
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:29,134
If you hadn't facilitated
Crichton's earlier escape,

956
01:02:29,201 --> 01:02:32,648
there would be peace now.

957
01:02:32,721 --> 01:02:35,176
With you the Supreme Ruler?

958
01:02:35,248 --> 01:02:38,793
A position I know
you dream of, Scorpius.

959
01:02:46,923 --> 01:02:51,046
You, John Crichton, are alive
for one reason only.

960
01:02:51,113 --> 01:02:55,072
I will have the
wormhole technology you possess.

961
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:59,516
If not, War Minister Ahkna
will pleasure herself

962
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:00,767
torturing the Hynerian

963
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:04,183
and the abomination
in his belly.

964
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,715
You have one arn to decide.

965
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,919
Here, here.

966
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:18,359
Options?

967
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,316
It's not ready.

968
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:23,825
They have Rygel and the sand is
trickling though the hourglass.

969
01:03:23,897 --> 01:03:27,696
- We can't give them wormhole weapons.
- They don't know that.

970
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,900
And I can give them
the middle finger.

971
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:33,814
You don't know
what you're doing.

972
01:03:33,879 --> 01:03:35,820
I never do.

973
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:40,331
You, give them nothing!

974
01:03:40,402 --> 01:03:42,737
Let's make a deal.

975
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:49,734
One power source.

976
01:03:49,807 --> 01:03:53,799
Two compartments,
forward and last.

977
01:03:58,636 --> 01:04:01,734
More intense,
and smaller.

978
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:07,329
And here.

979
01:04:09,575 --> 01:04:14,297
That's it.

980
01:04:14,373 --> 01:04:15,835
Excellent.

981
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,288
I'll be able to stop 'em cold
with three perfect shots.

982
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:22,144
Why three? You usually
slay me with just one.

983
01:04:26,593 --> 01:04:30,419
Rygel's invited us
to Hyneria.

984
01:04:32,638 --> 01:04:35,319
Thought I could do
some work with my hands.

985
01:04:35,389 --> 01:04:37,592
Plant some food,
make some wine.

986
01:04:37,662 --> 01:04:40,723
Oh.

987
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:47,470
Hey, Godzilla,
let's get this over with.

988
01:04:47,543 --> 01:04:51,152
- You have something to give me?
- Yeah.

989
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:54,864
I got something you don't
get very often. The truth.

990
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:58,378
- I can't give you wormhole weapons.
- Then you will die.

991
01:04:58,449 --> 01:05:02,223
You're asking for a kilo of pure
wormhole technology which I don't have!

992
01:05:05,007 --> 01:05:08,899
But I can take you
to a guy that does.

993
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:11,426
In exchange,
you give me Rygel.

994
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,254
Undamaged, free and clear.

995
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,384
Give me the coordinates!

996
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:22,211
It doesn't work like that.

997
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,843
You are immune to the probing.

998
01:05:27,908 --> 01:05:30,146
'Cause I always speak the truth.

999
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:45,015
Okay, here's how it works.

1000
01:05:45,086 --> 01:05:48,913
We go in my module

1001
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:51,605
down a wormhole to the
source of ultimate power.

1002
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:54,390
It's a two-seater.
Me and one other.

1003
01:05:54,457 --> 01:05:56,529
It's the only safe way
to get there.

1004
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:00,013
The emperor will never go alone
with you in your craft!

1005
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:01,427
I will accompany him.

1006
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:04,341
Yes, always good to see who wears
the britches in a relationship.

1007
01:06:04,406 --> 01:06:06,609
No!

1008
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:10,288
Set a course to rejoin the battle group
at the water planet.

1009
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:12,808
We shall leave
as soon as I return.

1010
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:16,622
It's a question of balls.
The ball's in his court.

1011
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:36,097
How would they react?

1012
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:39,035
I see. If faced
with such a moral choice,

1013
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,694
the Scarrans would still choose
to slaughter innocents.

1014
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:46,518
A conundrum: How to tap into
their morality. I must think.

1015
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:52,638
- Is there progress?
- A great deal.

1016
01:06:52,703 --> 01:06:56,696
- I will soon be able to influence their passions.
- Excellent.

1017
01:06:56,766 --> 01:07:01,946
In the temple, you said,
"Peacekeepers, do your duty. "

1018
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:04,116
What did you mean?

1019
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,789
I had forgotten
that you had forgotten.

1020
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:14,354
At the dawn of our period of usefulness,
27,000 cycles ago,

1021
01:07:14,423 --> 01:07:18,828
we developed need of a guard,
a race no one had quarrel with.

1022
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:20,687
A force to insure
harmony prevailed

1023
01:07:20,754 --> 01:07:23,208
once negotiations
had finished.

1024
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:25,519
Peacekeepers.

1025
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:28,236
Apparently your forebears
attempted to carry on

1026
01:07:28,305 --> 01:07:29,767
once we vanished.

1027
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:33,154
However, lacking
our mediation abilities,

1028
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:35,880
they kept peace
the only way they could:

1029
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,923
At the muzzle of a weapon.

1030
01:07:37,995 --> 01:07:40,231
And that's why
they're hated.

1031
01:07:40,298 --> 01:07:42,183
It wasn't such
at the beginning.

1032
01:07:42,249 --> 01:07:46,339
We took great care to choose
a species no one had met before.

1033
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:51,195
We found your kind primitive,
barely clothed.

1034
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:54,399
Far removed on
the galaxy's outer spiral.

1035
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,370
Having brought some
of you back,

1036
01:07:57,444 --> 01:08:02,045
your evolution was accelerated
with generous alterations

1037
01:08:02,113 --> 01:08:04,861
until you became
our trusted acolytes.

1038
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:13,973
The emperor wants
this one maintained.

1039
01:08:14,044 --> 01:08:18,231
However, I would consider it
a personal favor

1040
01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:23,030
should he die
of explainable causes.

1041
01:08:49,676 --> 01:08:51,779
I grow weary.

1042
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,503
We'll stop for coffee
on the way back.

1043
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:00,135
There is a problem?

1044
01:09:00,198 --> 01:09:02,086
Take your hand off me.

1045
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:06,011
You know what
you have to do, John.

1046
01:09:06,085 --> 01:09:08,899
Yeah, I know exactly
what I have to do.

1047
01:09:08,964 --> 01:09:11,678
Just crash the module.
No more Staleek.

1048
01:09:11,745 --> 01:09:12,639
No more Crichton.

1049
01:09:12,706 --> 01:09:15,160
No more Aeryn.
No more anyone.

1050
01:09:15,233 --> 01:09:19,736
Do you think War Minister Psycho-Drama's
gonna be a kindler, gentler soul?

1051
01:09:19,808 --> 01:09:22,872
Somebody else's problem.
But you would've done your duty.

1052
01:09:22,942 --> 01:09:24,404
Get your hand off me.

1053
01:09:24,477 --> 01:09:27,410
Please take your hand off me.

1054
01:09:27,484 --> 01:09:29,936
Get your hand off me.

1055
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:34,865
We shall return to my ship.
There is no wormhole here.

1056
01:09:34,936 --> 01:09:38,068
We're catching the 7:15 to Enlightenment.
It's just a little late.

1057
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:46,351
I have been informed
you plot escape.

1058
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:49,484
- We are prisoners with no weapons.
- None here.

1059
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:52,204
But perhaps out there.

1060
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:59,494
I promise you. You will never
be reunited with your baby.

1061
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:03,972
I'm sure your mother wished
the same thing.

1062
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:06,409
How brave you are.

1063
01:10:08,299 --> 01:10:11,526
Ordinance Officer, fire!

1064
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:17,472
Fire!

1065
01:10:17,543 --> 01:10:20,357
- D'Argo!
- They know where we are!

1066
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:22,045
Fire!

1067
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:28,445
You can stop now.
You've proved your point.

1068
01:10:28,514 --> 01:10:31,195
The Luxans are
like Peacekeepers.

1069
01:10:31,263 --> 01:10:34,013
Soon to be enslaved or dead.

1070
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,695
Fire.

1071
01:10:40,026 --> 01:10:41,751
You...

1072
01:10:46,616 --> 01:10:50,065
Enshrine their souls,
end their suffering

1073
01:10:50,137 --> 01:10:52,949
and guide the passage
of D'Argo and Chiana

1074
01:10:53,013 --> 01:10:55,402
to their place of rest.

1075
01:10:56,438 --> 01:10:59,249
Cannot a Luxan survive
in space?

1076
01:10:59,316 --> 01:11:03,177
Quarter arn.
Maybe a little longer.

1077
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,192
Scarran brutality
surprises me.

1078
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:08,940
They will be difficult
to influence.

1079
01:11:09,008 --> 01:11:12,074
The Scarran blood
that runs through my veins

1080
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:14,442
knows more than
you'll ever know.

1081
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:20,830
The first scent of interference,
you'll be as dead as D'Argo.

1082
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:22,313
And then the...

1083
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:26,532
There is only one path
out of this prison.

1084
01:11:26,599 --> 01:11:29,859
We must fight our way out!

1085
01:11:32,839 --> 01:11:34,494
Bingo.

1086
01:11:36,452 --> 01:11:39,201
This is the source
of your knowledge?

1087
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:41,471
That and the back
of cereal boxes.

1088
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:43,131
Cinch up your diaper, big boy.

1089
01:11:43,202 --> 01:11:45,111
The first time is
always the worst.

1090
01:11:53,244 --> 01:11:55,763
This is normal?

1091
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:59,148
No. The module's overweighted.
We got a big bubba in 2-B.

1092
01:11:59,223 --> 01:12:02,005
Last chance, John. Veer into
the wall of the wormhole.

1093
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:03,119
It'll be over fast.

1094
01:12:03,192 --> 01:12:05,394
Nope. Child's gonna have
a father.

1095
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:07,500
I hope it's a boy.

1096
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,679
Boy, girl, either is fine.

1097
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:13,453
Buckle up.

1098
01:12:33,643 --> 01:12:37,089
Check it out. I'm Rudolph
the Red-nosed Reindeer.

1099
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:42,492
You have violated
our trust.

1100
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:44,353
He has my family.

1101
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:46,526
Unimportant
to the greater agenda.

1102
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:49,627
They are my greater agenda.

1103
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:53,048
- Why have you brought him here?
- Who is this creature?

1104
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:56,915
You can call him Einstein.
I suggest you do it nicely.

1105
01:12:57,916 --> 01:13:00,121
Staleek!

1106
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:05,172
Staleek, he can wrap time
round his little finger.

1107
01:13:05,243 --> 01:13:08,920
The whoo-doo voodoo
is not gonna work.

1108
01:13:08,987 --> 01:13:14,168
Einstein, do you possess
the knowledge of wormholes?

1109
01:13:14,232 --> 01:13:16,271
Yes.

1110
01:13:16,341 --> 01:13:19,124
Can these wormholes
be made into weapons?

1111
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:20,368
Yes.

1112
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:24,368
- Then you will give me that power!
- No.

1113
01:13:24,434 --> 01:13:28,710
Hang on. I can find a wormhole,
and fly down one.

1114
01:13:28,786 --> 01:13:30,279
Right?

1115
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:31,880
With the rudimentary knowledge
we have given you.

1116
01:13:31,952 --> 01:13:34,601
Can I make a weapon?

1117
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,166
You cannot.

1118
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:39,299
Why not?

1119
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,406
Because no one
should have that power.

1120
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:44,384
Exactly!

1121
01:13:45,866 --> 01:13:47,688
Listen up.

1122
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:54,587
This is your universe.

1123
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:58,591
This is your universe
on wormholes.

1124
01:13:58,661 --> 01:14:03,743
You mess with the natural order,
you destroy multiple time lines.

1125
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:06,809
I will have that power!

1126
01:14:09,313 --> 01:14:12,062
Humbling, ain't it?

1127
01:14:15,902 --> 01:14:18,716
Returning here was wrong.

1128
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,975
I have to protect
the people I love.

1129
01:14:22,043 --> 01:14:25,303
And you owe me for putting
that crap in my head.

1130
01:14:25,368 --> 01:14:28,402
It may soon be prudent
to remove it.

1131
01:14:28,472 --> 01:14:31,535
Amen. I wanna be
blond again.

1132
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:43,440
You truly cannot create
wormhole weapons.

1133
01:14:43,506 --> 01:14:48,073
We should get back
before Rygel damages your wife.

1134
01:14:52,845 --> 01:14:53,827
Absolutely not.

1135
01:14:53,901 --> 01:14:56,004
Our best opportunity
is when or if

1136
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,891
Crichton walks through those doors,
we must try to escape!

1137
01:14:58,955 --> 01:15:00,962
Not without my child.

1138
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:03,682
A disagreement past
its time.

1139
01:15:06,406 --> 01:15:09,188
- You should be dead.
- And how was your day?

1140
01:15:11,396 --> 01:15:13,816
I saw a wreckage
on the way in.

1141
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:22,397
They killed Chiana
and D'Argo.

1142
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:32,340
Is Yondalao good to go?

1143
01:15:32,413 --> 01:15:35,411
Apparently not.

1144
01:15:35,483 --> 01:15:38,329
Well, Staleek's
gonna give us Rygel.

1145
01:15:40,345 --> 01:15:44,815
You've traded ultimate power
for an unborn offspring.

1146
01:15:44,886 --> 01:15:49,773
No. I gave it to him.
You know why?

1147
01:15:49,844 --> 01:15:52,842
Because he's such a nice guy!

1148
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:56,045
But the funny thing is
I don't have anything to give.

1149
01:15:56,114 --> 01:15:58,599
So, Chiana and D'Argo,

1150
01:15:58,671 --> 01:16:01,288
me being chased around
the galaxy for years,

1151
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,003
everything,
it's all for nothing.

1152
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:12,228
Your ranting aside,
we still have no way out.

1153
01:16:14,316 --> 01:16:16,136
I wouldn't be so sure.

1154
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,048
You have to do something.

1155
01:16:30,115 --> 01:16:32,983
Time to transfer the baby.

1156
01:16:33,057 --> 01:16:35,992
When I am ordered.

1157
01:16:36,064 --> 01:16:38,450
However, I can
give you something

1158
01:16:38,526 --> 01:16:41,561
to eliminate the pain completely.

1159
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:45,369
Oh, that would be great. Hurry!

1160
01:16:48,217 --> 01:16:49,046
Aah!

1161
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:52,528
Whose orders override mine?

1162
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:55,697
War Minister Ahkna.
I had no choice.

1163
01:17:00,822 --> 01:17:03,503
You will die
when I order it.

1164
01:17:03,571 --> 01:17:06,287
Okay.

1165
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:13,064
If I knew my word
was useless...

1166
01:17:13,136 --> 01:17:15,688
The Luxan stealth craft,
I discovered and destroyed.

1167
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:18,627
The presence of Scorpius who
has already betrayed you once,

1168
01:17:18,702 --> 01:17:22,311
and the constant ability of these
creatures to plague us with resistance.

1169
01:17:22,381 --> 01:17:25,379
Add these up, and they should
die for our own security.

1170
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:28,612
Scorpius is a commander
in our enemy's armada.

1171
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:30,371
Officer Sun
a former pilot.

1172
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:33,604
Who knows what information
may be coerced from them!

1173
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:38,425
- It's not worth the risk.
- Stop seeing Vitubian vipers in every shadow.

1174
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:44,822
And never countermand
my orders again!

1175
01:18:45,544 --> 01:18:47,875
Here, have him!

1176
01:18:50,565 --> 01:18:52,354
Did they do anything
to you?

1177
01:18:52,419 --> 01:18:53,882
No.

1178
01:18:53,956 --> 01:18:55,418
This maintains my portion
of the accord.

1179
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:58,459
Beyond this,
I promise nothing.

1180
01:18:58,531 --> 01:19:01,081
With deference,
Your Eminence.

1181
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,607
- Who are you?
- Hierarch Yondalao.

1182
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,370
Triumvirate Council.

1183
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:08,819
Eidelon faction
of neutrality.

1184
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:11,029
There is no such thing
as neutrality.

1185
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,809
You travel with my prisoners,
you are a prisoner.

1186
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:19,150
Emperor Staleek,
you wish power,

1187
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:22,223
acknowledgement of
your personal intelligence,

1188
01:19:22,295 --> 01:19:25,010
and to gain acceptance

1189
01:19:25,078 --> 01:19:28,209
in the upper echelon
of civilizations.

1190
01:19:29,618 --> 01:19:32,107
What do you know of my aims?

1191
01:19:32,178 --> 01:19:35,493
Only that there are many
paths to accomplish them.

1192
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,504
War is our path.

1193
01:19:38,576 --> 01:19:42,502
At the peace table,
we know how we're viewed:

1194
01:19:42,573 --> 01:19:44,199
Brutish, ignorant.

1195
01:19:44,269 --> 01:19:47,650
Then what greater victory
than to prove them wrong?

1196
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:51,499
And without the loss
of a single Scarran...

1197
01:19:51,563 --> 01:19:52,737
life.

1198
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,643
I am listening.

1199
01:20:06,116 --> 01:20:09,693
Now you will tell me this one
Human holds such fascination

1200
01:20:09,762 --> 01:20:10,908
that Scorpius would desert,

1201
01:20:10,977 --> 01:20:13,116
the Scarran emperor
would pursue.

1202
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:17,176
And we would all tremble at the
power of his magical wormholes.

1203
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:20,345
Did you not tell me
Crichton was powerless?

1204
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,680
His doomsday weapon
a myth?

1205
01:20:22,747 --> 01:20:24,951
That was my belief.

1206
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:27,735
This moment, however,
is not without opportunity.

1207
01:20:27,804 --> 01:20:28,696
Agreed.

1208
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:31,247
Knowing the emperor's
whereabouts

1209
01:20:31,322 --> 01:20:33,939
allows us to negotiate
a peace proposal

1210
01:20:34,007 --> 01:20:37,302
before our position
becomes so eroded

1211
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:38,741
as to be laughable.

1212
01:20:38,805 --> 01:20:42,098
Yes, my love.
Of course.

1213
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:50,405
It also gives us the opportunity
to surprise the Scarran leader

1214
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,651
and decapitate his empire.

1215
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:57,321
The sudden chaos in their ranks
might tip the balance.

1216
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,298
And if that fails?

1217
01:20:59,373 --> 01:21:02,598
No, I will not be remembered
by history

1218
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:06,461
as the commander under whom
Peacekeeperdom fell.

1219
01:21:10,023 --> 01:21:13,283
No, my love.
You will not.

1220
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:19,069
Because despite your station,
you are weak.

1221
01:21:24,482 --> 01:21:26,999
I say again that which
I have said before.

1222
01:21:27,072 --> 01:21:31,325
Death is preferable to subjugation
under Scarran rule.

1223
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:35,315
They must be defeated.

1224
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:42,901
How?

1225
01:21:42,971 --> 01:21:46,229
Chiana.

1226
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:55,049
Father.

1227
01:22:00,977 --> 01:22:02,885
Not quite the
Luxan greeting, but...

1228
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,966
- What are you doing here?
- Right now?

1229
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:06,501
Saving your life.

1230
01:22:06,575 --> 01:22:08,134
Thanks.

1231
01:22:08,205 --> 01:22:11,367
Jothee, shouldn't we
be running?

1232
01:22:11,435 --> 01:22:14,751
Our concealment technology is
three generations beyond yours.

1233
01:22:14,827 --> 01:22:18,209
We could pull up beside 'em and
they wouldn't know we're here.

1234
01:22:20,841 --> 01:22:22,846
So, you're in command now.

1235
01:22:22,919 --> 01:22:25,285
- He's a cleaver.
- Cleaver?

1236
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,967
- Field officer.
- Which means he's got brains.

1237
01:22:28,037 --> 01:22:30,175
The rest of us
just like to fight.

1238
01:22:30,244 --> 01:22:32,796
What are you doing here?

1239
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:35,038
We've been following
the emperor for quite some time.

1240
01:22:35,108 --> 01:22:38,105
And then, there you were.

1241
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:40,249
We gotta take
the crown head out,

1242
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,798
but his ship
is pretty well impenetrable.

1243
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:45,112
One would think.

1244
01:22:54,778 --> 01:22:56,120
Is this accurate?

1245
01:22:56,186 --> 01:22:59,794
Looks like we could
take him out in four shots.

1246
01:22:59,863 --> 01:23:02,098
Three.

1247
01:23:03,927 --> 01:23:06,260
Yes, that sounds
quite reasonable.

1248
01:23:06,327 --> 01:23:09,551
Absolutely. We're walking
into Federationville here.

1249
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:11,527
You cross the T's.

1250
01:23:11,602 --> 01:23:15,213
You dot the lower case J's,
and we're good to go.

1251
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:18,092
Emperor,
could you review the accord

1252
01:23:18,157 --> 01:23:20,808
- that you wish all of us to agree to?
- Of course.

1253
01:23:20,878 --> 01:23:23,561
At the core of
the matter is the perception

1254
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,571
that Crichton can create
wormhole weapons.

1255
01:23:25,645 --> 01:23:28,579
If I propose an armistice
to the Peacekeepers

1256
01:23:28,652 --> 01:23:31,780
with Crichton by my side,

1257
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:33,409
they will naturally assume

1258
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,671
he has bestowed a military edge
upon the Scarran Empire.

1259
01:23:37,735 --> 01:23:39,938
The Grand Chancellor
is no gambler.

1260
01:23:40,005 --> 01:23:42,306
He would indeed
choose peace over a war

1261
01:23:42,372 --> 01:23:43,748
he knows he would lose.

1262
01:23:43,813 --> 01:23:46,911
Being benevolent,
I will then propose an accord

1263
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:51,801
which favors us in mining rights
and trade balance, whilst

1264
01:23:51,874 --> 01:23:55,801
allowing complete self-rule
of all Peacekeeper territories.

1265
01:23:55,872 --> 01:23:57,910
And I'm out, right?

1266
01:23:57,983 --> 01:24:01,209
You shall be released
upon the signing.

1267
01:24:01,276 --> 01:24:04,984
And a great many lives will be
saved by everybody sim...

1268
01:24:05,052 --> 01:24:06,227
Do you really wish

1269
01:24:06,298 --> 01:24:09,875
to broker peace with an enemy
you are certain to destroy?

1270
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:15,375
What is this?

1271
01:24:16,789 --> 01:24:21,392
It is the proper course
of action.

1272
01:24:30,223 --> 01:24:32,743
If your kind has a prayer
for the dying,

1273
01:24:32,814 --> 01:24:36,676
fill your mind with it now
that you may be comforted.

1274
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:48,712
He's passing over.
The secret of peace is lost.

1275
01:24:48,776 --> 01:24:51,143
It's not good.
Stark, give him last rites.

1276
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:53,889
Oh, I cannot.
I'm beneath him.

1277
01:24:53,957 --> 01:24:56,444
Astro Boy, you can take his power,
protect his gift.

1278
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:57,412
Oh, no, I cannot.

1279
01:24:57,477 --> 01:24:59,778
Stark, you can!

1280
01:24:59,842 --> 01:25:03,040
You're a Stykara.
I've seen you do amazing things.

1281
01:25:03,107 --> 01:25:06,204
When you pass someone over,
you take what they know.

1282
01:25:06,274 --> 01:25:09,982
- Help him help us.
- Quickly before he dies.

1283
01:25:10,048 --> 01:25:11,125
No, I cannot!

1284
01:25:11,197 --> 01:25:12,606
Aeryn, help me!

1285
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:14,709
No, no!

1286
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,573
No, no!

1287
01:25:30,646 --> 01:25:32,238
My mask!
Don't touch me!

1288
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:36,753
- What have we done?
- I don't know.

1289
01:25:36,818 --> 01:25:41,324
Something good
or something very bad.

1290
01:25:44,143 --> 01:25:46,533
Hey, hey.

1291
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,994
We're gonna have to
transfer the baby now.

1292
01:25:49,069 --> 01:25:50,017
Now?

1293
01:25:50,093 --> 01:25:52,581
- Can you remember what to do?
- I think so.

1294
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,204
- You stay with him. Where's the transfer kit?
- Over there.

1295
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,735
- Where?
- There!

1296
01:25:59,209 --> 01:26:01,891
- It's gas.
- What?

1297
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,416
- You gotta be kiddin' me!
- They're entombing us.

1298
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:06,524
Saleek, this is very unoriginal.

1299
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:08,704
What does this do?

1300
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:10,202
- Paralytic embalming agent.
- Stark.

1301
01:26:10,277 --> 01:26:12,956
Preserves living tissue
without harming the brain.

1302
01:26:13,026 --> 01:26:16,572
Scarrans use it on specimens
they wish to dissect

1303
01:26:16,642 --> 01:26:18,680
whilst they're still alive.

1304
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:23,925
Stay with me.

1305
01:26:28,379 --> 01:26:32,175
Breathe, Rygel, breathe.

1306
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:35,992
- You've ruined my life.
- I know.

1307
01:26:40,246 --> 01:26:43,627
This war is not your responsibility.

1308
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:46,088
How am I supposed to protect you
from the Peacekeepers

1309
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:48,978
<i>and the Scarrans and the Tregans
and the lions and tigers and bears?

1310
01:26:49,043 --> 01:26:50,984
<i>This is what you want.

1311
01:26:51,059 --> 01:26:53,806
<i>No, Aeryn, it is not
what I want!

1312
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:56,655
<i>It's just that fate keeps
blocking all the exits.

1313
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,410
<i>And no matter what I do,

1314
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,999
<i>I just keep circling
closer to the flame.

1315
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,684
Breathe, Rygel, breathe.

1316
01:28:43,757 --> 01:28:46,176
- Rygel?
- Rygel!

1317
01:28:46,248 --> 01:28:49,993
He's unconscious. I'm gonna have to
get him up, get him outta this gas.

1318
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:53,785
Gas. Is this stuff
flammable?

1319
01:28:53,852 --> 01:28:57,479
Preservatives?
Combustible.

1320
01:28:57,544 --> 01:28:59,588
At a very high temperature.

1321
01:28:59,657 --> 01:29:03,088
- You can ignite it?
- The gas is smothering my receptors.

1322
01:29:03,163 --> 01:29:05,364
Come on, we're gonna get you
to higher ground.

1323
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:09,403
On my count.
One, two, three!

1324
01:29:10,856 --> 01:29:13,062
So basically you're going
to blow us up.

1325
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:14,194
Whoa! Whoa!

1326
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:17,601
I can direct it. Find cover.

1327
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:40,361
- What was that explosion?
- Internal. Level 21.

1328
01:29:40,433 --> 01:29:43,915
Insurgency teams to containment
quarters. All teams, now!

1329
01:29:43,986 --> 01:29:47,880
<i>- Explosion at mid ship on the Decimator.
- Crichton.

1330
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:58,189
- Those are not internal.
- All systems off-line.

1331
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:04,208
Stark, weapons.
We all need weapons.

1332
01:30:07,065 --> 01:30:10,227
Feel like killing someone?
Okay, maybe not.

1333
01:30:10,296 --> 01:30:12,020
We need more than weapons.
We need a plan.

1334
01:30:12,086 --> 01:30:14,295
- We have to transfer the baby.
- Now?

1335
01:30:14,363 --> 01:30:16,304
His pulse is slowing.
He's dying.

1336
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:17,720
Okay, okay.

1337
01:30:17,786 --> 01:30:19,163
<i>John, Aeryn, are you there?

1338
01:30:19,229 --> 01:30:21,399
I'm hearing dead people.
"D," how are you alive?

1339
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:23,026
<i>Long story.

1340
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:24,594
Can I give you a ride?

1341
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,644
<i>- Absolutely. In what?
- It's gonna be a big surprise.

1342
01:30:26,714 --> 01:30:29,433
You stay put. We got a fix
on you. We'll come to you.

1343
01:30:29,502 --> 01:30:30,996
You heard him.
This is the Alamo.

1344
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:32,728
Brace.

1345
01:30:45,378 --> 01:30:46,720
Go!

1346
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:49,239
Chiana, call Peacekeeper Command,
confirm our coordinates.

1347
01:30:49,312 --> 01:30:51,069
Go!

1348
01:30:52,483 --> 01:30:53,434
Good luck.

1349
01:31:00,963 --> 01:31:02,752
Luxan commandoes
confirmed aboard, sir.

1350
01:31:02,818 --> 01:31:05,211
Secure my ship!

1351
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:08,580
Aeryn, we gotta hurry.
I'm losing a pulse here.

1352
01:31:08,645 --> 01:31:11,993
- Here they come!
- Ready when you are.

1353
01:31:13,381 --> 01:31:15,935
Man, am I glad
you're not awake for this.

1354
01:31:17,798 --> 01:31:20,865
All right. You might feel
a little pressure.

1355
01:31:22,505 --> 01:31:24,446
Hold still. Hold still!

1356
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,264
- War Minister Ahkna, report.
- Positioning to cut them off now!

1357
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,168
I'm really sorry
about this, baby.

1358
01:31:31,241 --> 01:31:32,901
Just get it right
the first time.

1359
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:35,719
- Nobody gets it right the first time.
- Wait!

1360
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,833
Are you okay?

1361
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:54,313
I'm pregnant.

1362
01:31:54,386 --> 01:31:56,806
- I'm running out of ammunition.
- As me.

1363
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:03,794
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1364
01:32:13,688 --> 01:32:15,987
Rygel, you all right?

1365
01:32:16,054 --> 01:32:18,739
Thank you.

1366
01:32:18,809 --> 01:32:21,457
- He's out again.
- What is this?

1367
01:32:21,528 --> 01:32:24,912
Whatever you put in
my head is gonna explode!

1368
01:32:24,985 --> 01:32:28,216
You're not gonna be the only thing around here
exploding if D'Argo doesn't show up.

1369
01:32:28,282 --> 01:32:30,702
Stop acting like a bunch
of losers and look down!

1370
01:32:30,776 --> 01:32:33,147
Hey, the cavalry's here.

1371
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:35,218
Okay, stand back.

1372
01:32:41,661 --> 01:32:43,669
It's no good.
We can't get through.

1373
01:32:43,741 --> 01:32:45,335
It's Dorian ore.
It's pulse resistant.

1374
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:47,828
How are we supposed
to get to you?

1375
01:32:47,903 --> 01:32:49,813
I don't know. All the lifts are sealed.
We better make it quick.

1376
01:32:49,888 --> 01:32:53,118
Our surprise is wearing off.

1377
01:32:53,184 --> 01:32:56,536
Stand aside!
Get back!

1378
01:32:59,169 --> 01:33:02,107
All right,
ladies and children first.

1379
01:33:07,653 --> 01:33:09,376
You look great.

1380
01:33:09,444 --> 01:33:11,682
- I'm pregnant again.
- Congratulations.

1381
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,245
Don't you touch me!

1382
01:33:15,718 --> 01:33:17,604
Catch!

1383
01:33:17,671 --> 01:33:20,801
Feel free to stay and cover our retreat.

1384
01:33:22,825 --> 01:33:25,671
Holy crap!
It's good to see you, Jothee.

1385
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:27,232
Yeah, who'd have guessed?

1386
01:33:27,304 --> 01:33:29,346
Good to see you too.
We done?

1387
01:33:29,418 --> 01:33:31,272
Quick! Go, go, go, go!

1388
01:33:32,903 --> 01:33:35,590
Get out! Go!
Get outta here! Move, move!

1389
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:41,197
Damage repair immediately.

1390
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:44,129
The Peacekeeper armada
is sure to be on its way.

1391
01:33:44,204 --> 01:33:46,596
And we are sitting fodder! Move!

1392
01:33:46,671 --> 01:33:48,296
Coming through!

1393
01:33:51,569 --> 01:33:53,575
Here.

1394
01:33:53,647 --> 01:33:56,017
Go, get in!

1395
01:34:04,626 --> 01:34:07,179
You guys are a mess.

1396
01:34:11,284 --> 01:34:14,067
Everybody hang the frell on!

1397
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:21,333
You've grown, dude.

1398
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,603
Yeah? Well, it's the armor.

1399
01:34:23,672 --> 01:34:26,161
I'll take over, Sergeant.
You take care of the engine.

1400
01:34:26,234 --> 01:34:27,312
Sir.

1401
01:34:27,382 --> 01:34:29,870
So was this
a planned reunion?

1402
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:42,295
You got any backup
out there?

1403
01:34:42,365 --> 01:34:46,708
Well, they can't maneuver
or fire so we're good to go.

1404
01:34:46,782 --> 01:34:47,863
Nice work, Cleaver.

1405
01:34:47,935 --> 01:34:51,000
Yeah. Well, the old man
had a lot to do with it.

1406
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:56,342
<i>Peacekeeper armada confirmed
on scanned perimeter.

1407
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:09,183
Tell me.

1408
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:11,805
When will we stop
following this Human

1409
01:35:11,876 --> 01:35:15,521
and start imposing
our agenda on him?

1410
01:35:18,468 --> 01:35:20,326
We already have.

1411
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:23,238
Crichton insists he will
not build a wormhole weapon.

1412
01:35:23,302 --> 01:35:25,985
He insists he can't.

1413
01:35:26,055 --> 01:35:30,595
Human insistence.
Nothing more than a futile attempt

1414
01:35:30,664 --> 01:35:33,983
to avoid action they insist
they will never take!

1415
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:40,450
He will help us?

1416
01:35:42,446 --> 01:35:44,419
Never.

1417
01:35:44,493 --> 01:35:49,611
But he will help Aeryn
and his new child.

1418
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:58,054
<i>Luxan penetrator out and away.
See you back in Kajargan.

1419
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:01,196
- Safe journey. Can I speak to Jothee?
- Sure.

1420
01:36:04,017 --> 01:36:06,702
You need a guide to get through
Peacekeeper-controlled space.

1421
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:20,590
Chiana was the first person
since your mother

1422
01:36:20,661 --> 01:36:22,288
that I really cared about.

1423
01:36:26,904 --> 01:36:29,806
I'm glad you and Chiana
are back together.

1424
01:36:29,878 --> 01:36:33,012
Day by day.
Trust takes time.

1425
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:35,504
Yes, it does.

1426
01:37:01,697 --> 01:37:04,992
I'm not worthy.
I'm not worthy.

1427
01:37:05,058 --> 01:37:06,846
I'm not worthy.

1428
01:37:06,913 --> 01:37:09,914
Can't do that, can't do that.
I can't do it.

1429
01:37:42,379 --> 01:37:43,786
John, where are you going?

1430
01:37:45,835 --> 01:37:50,061
We can see the comms are open.
Would you answer please?

1431
01:38:06,033 --> 01:38:07,854
Frell.

1432
01:38:09,553 --> 01:38:11,312
Scarrans continue to fight.

1433
01:38:11,379 --> 01:38:12,874
It is clearly
Staleek's vanguard.

1434
01:38:12,947 --> 01:38:14,574
<i>We're outnumbered
and under attack.

1435
01:38:14,642 --> 01:38:16,137
<i>The command carrier
is heavily damaged.

1436
01:38:16,211 --> 01:38:17,619
<i>We are unable to defend it.

1437
01:38:17,685 --> 01:38:20,589
Ma'am, the grand chancellor
is dead.

1438
01:38:20,662 --> 01:38:24,462
A great tragedy for our people.

1439
01:38:24,535 --> 01:38:27,154
Arrange a ship-wide
memorial service.

1440
01:38:27,224 --> 01:38:31,350
And set a course
for Captain Braca's location immediately.

1441
01:38:31,417 --> 01:38:32,627
With respect, ma'am,

1442
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:34,966
High Command is sending
Vice Chancellor Vosler...

1443
01:38:35,033 --> 01:38:37,038
Don't let the belly
fool you, Lieutenant.

1444
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,253
You were aware of my status?

1445
01:38:39,322 --> 01:38:41,111
Commandant, ma'am.

1446
01:38:41,178 --> 01:38:44,114
- Within this battle group, who outranks me?
- No one.

1447
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:46,772
Then send apologies
to the vice chancellor

1448
01:38:46,842 --> 01:38:49,180
for the extra distance
he will have to travel.

1449
01:38:49,245 --> 01:38:52,562
And set a course
for Captain Braca's location now.

1450
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:53,846
Ma'am.

1451
01:39:03,488 --> 01:39:06,334
Your assumptions
were correct, Excellency.

1452
01:39:06,401 --> 01:39:10,080
My spy informs me that the water planet
Crichton previously visited

1453
01:39:10,146 --> 01:39:13,344
was populated by a species
called Eidelon.

1454
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:14,940
Yes.

1455
01:39:15,011 --> 01:39:16,538
Same as the frelling creature

1456
01:39:16,611 --> 01:39:18,849
they brought on board
to cloud my mind.

1457
01:39:18,915 --> 01:39:21,598
Obviously a plan
to defeat us with trickery.

1458
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:23,459
All speed to the water planet.

1459
01:39:23,526 --> 01:39:25,829
Crichton is no longer
our only threat.

1460
01:39:25,897 --> 01:39:30,980
Inform me when every single
Eidelon is dead.

1461
01:39:44,107 --> 01:39:46,955
It's time!

1462
01:39:47,018 --> 01:39:49,509
Indeed.

1463
01:39:49,577 --> 01:39:52,485
Unlock the knowledge.

1464
01:39:52,557 --> 01:39:54,891
I have to make peace.

1465
01:39:57,326 --> 01:39:59,182
- Time...
- Flies.

1466
01:39:59,246 --> 01:40:02,183
- Time...
- Bandits.

1467
01:40:02,256 --> 01:40:05,125
- Time...
- Wounds all heals.

1468
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:08,613
- Time...
- Rosemary and...

1469
01:40:08,689 --> 01:40:11,146
Time...

1470
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:14,765
Time ends.

1471
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:36,560
Crichton, you possess it,
don't you?

1472
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:40,080
Don't... touch me!

1473
01:40:40,154 --> 01:40:43,538
The secret to victory.
The violent path to peace.

1474
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:58,396
Congratulations, John!

1475
01:40:58,464 --> 01:41:01,812
Damn, it's big!
It's bigger than big!

1476
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:05,528
These wormhole weapon plans
are complicated.

1477
01:41:05,597 --> 01:41:07,966
But I think we can build it
to budget.

1478
01:41:08,031 --> 01:41:10,621
- My head is killing me.
- Give the man a hard hat.

1479
01:41:13,473 --> 01:41:15,547
Oh, you MBA types.

1480
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:18,719
I didn't get this
for you.

1481
01:41:18,787 --> 01:41:22,105
Ladies.

1482
01:41:22,181 --> 01:41:25,826
This project, John,
is for both of us.

1483
01:41:25,892 --> 01:41:30,236
"Coming this year,
Wormhole weapons to the stars.

1484
01:41:31,977 --> 01:41:36,065
Harvey and John's Construction
and Engineering. "

1485
01:41:36,134 --> 01:41:37,118
John and Harvey.

1486
01:41:37,193 --> 01:41:39,017
I can make us a new sign.

1487
01:41:39,081 --> 01:41:41,951
You agreed to do the job.
Now we gotta build it.

1488
01:41:42,025 --> 01:41:44,480
We're on my time table.
You're fired!

1489
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:49,313
You went there, didn't you?

1490
01:41:49,388 --> 01:41:52,967
I went the whole way there.

1491
01:41:53,036 --> 01:41:55,854
- I didn't want you to do that.
- Yes, you did.

1492
01:41:55,919 --> 01:41:59,333
Everybody wants to see
the great big wormhole weapon.

1493
01:41:59,406 --> 01:42:01,293
I want to see war
turned into peace.

1494
01:42:01,358 --> 01:42:02,765
War and peace. War and peace.

1495
01:42:02,831 --> 01:42:04,459
Did you know that
Woody Allen's version

1496
01:42:04,527 --> 01:42:07,116
is better than Tolstoy's
because it is funnier?

1497
01:42:07,185 --> 01:42:09,935
And absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

1498
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:12,075
Where the hell's my pen?
Where's my pen?

1499
01:42:12,145 --> 01:42:14,413
This is what you want.
This is what you want!

1500
01:42:14,481 --> 01:42:16,936
No, Aeryn, it is not
what I want!

1501
01:42:17,011 --> 01:42:19,794
It's just that fate keeps
blocking all the exits.

1502
01:42:19,861 --> 01:42:23,505
And no matter what I do, I just keep circling
closer to the flame.

1503
01:42:23,572 --> 01:42:25,873
Then pull back.

1504
01:42:25,938 --> 01:42:28,759
This war is not
your responsibility.

1505
01:42:28,823 --> 01:42:31,024
You and the baby
are my responsibility.

1506
01:42:31,091 --> 01:42:33,166
And how am I supposed to protect
you from the Peacekeepers

1507
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:36,339
and the Scarrans and the Tregans and the
lions and tigers and bears?

1508
01:42:36,406 --> 01:42:38,578
With this?

1509
01:42:38,647 --> 01:42:42,771
This gun?
No gun is big enough.

1510
01:42:42,841 --> 01:42:45,459
We still have Stark
and the Eidelons.

1511
01:42:47,964 --> 01:42:49,656
It's not enough.

1512
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,662
This is enough.

1513
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:57,885
Wormholes.
What's inside my head.

1514
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:03,220
This is ugly,
and it is malignant.

1515
01:43:03,295 --> 01:43:06,588
- But it will protect you and the baby...
- Ah, you see?

1516
01:43:06,657 --> 01:43:10,682
You don't just protect me.
We protect each other.

1517
01:43:15,936 --> 01:43:18,330
Did you feel that?

1518
01:43:19,427 --> 01:43:21,120
It kicked.

1519
01:43:21,188 --> 01:43:24,801
I can really feel it
alive inside me.

1520
01:43:33,412 --> 01:43:35,651
Here, Starky.

1521
01:43:40,776 --> 01:43:43,199
I don't remember
him being like this.

1522
01:43:43,272 --> 01:43:46,722
Nobody does.

1523
01:43:46,794 --> 01:43:49,096
Toad, what's with
the waterworks?

1524
01:43:49,163 --> 01:43:52,995
- I miss the baby!
- What baby?

1525
01:43:53,068 --> 01:43:57,228
- He had a baby?
- It's kind of a twisted story.

1526
01:43:57,294 --> 01:43:59,681
It's the chemical imbalance
in his system

1527
01:43:59,756 --> 01:44:01,929
from carrying the child.

1528
01:44:01,997 --> 01:44:05,196
He will recover
eventually.

1529
01:44:08,275 --> 01:44:11,534
Are you all right?

1530
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,496
I'm quite fine.

1531
01:44:15,570 --> 01:44:18,703
I can't do this
without your help, Pilot.

1532
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:21,902
Or is it Moya's?

1533
01:44:21,972 --> 01:44:24,688
This will be used
as a weapon against others?

1534
01:44:24,756 --> 01:44:26,929
Worse case scenario, yeah.

1535
01:44:26,998 --> 01:44:28,883
If I understand correctly,

1536
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:32,269
it has the power to kill
tens of thousands.

1537
01:44:34,038 --> 01:44:35,500
For starters.

1538
01:44:35,574 --> 01:44:39,372
Are you capable
of using this?

1539
01:44:39,448 --> 01:44:42,384
Yes.

1540
01:44:42,456 --> 01:44:46,612
Then I don't know you
as I thought.

1541
01:44:50,296 --> 01:44:52,850
So you'll be starting
with me then?

1542
01:44:52,921 --> 01:44:55,226
Someone points a gun
at your head, what do you do?

1543
01:44:57,407 --> 01:45:00,670
You defend yourself.

1544
01:45:00,734 --> 01:45:03,897
And that is why
we have to build this.

1545
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:05,343
No one has a weapon pointed
to your head.

1546
01:45:05,406 --> 01:45:08,475
God, Pilot! Everybody's got
a weapon pointed at my head!

1547
01:45:08,544 --> 01:45:09,590
There are other options.

1548
01:45:09,662 --> 01:45:14,554
Explain that to the millions who will die
in the meantime.

1549
01:45:14,625 --> 01:45:16,536
Is that truly your concern?

1550
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:18,879
Or is it Aeryn and
your un-birthed offspring

1551
01:45:18,945 --> 01:45:21,118
you wish to protect?

1552
01:45:21,188 --> 01:45:24,056
That's my family, Pilot.

1553
01:45:26,693 --> 01:45:31,677
Everything begins
with family.

1554
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:42,652
Scarrans!

1555
01:45:52,363 --> 01:45:55,014
- What the hell is happening?
- We're in a crossfire.

1556
01:45:56,139 --> 01:45:58,027
What are the Scarrans
doing here?

1557
01:45:58,092 --> 01:46:00,002
Pilot,
get us out of here.

1558
01:46:00,077 --> 01:46:01,322
How're the Eidelons holding up?

1559
01:46:01,389 --> 01:46:03,429
Their city
is also under attack.

1560
01:46:06,351 --> 01:46:08,356
There are too many of them!

1561
01:46:08,430 --> 01:46:12,905
What? No hailing? Not even
on our part to surrender?

1562
01:46:15,633 --> 01:46:18,931
Pilot, what are you doing?

1563
01:46:18,995 --> 01:46:21,197
Not me! It's Moya!

1564
01:46:30,294 --> 01:46:32,235
She's heading
into the ocean!

1565
01:46:32,311 --> 01:46:33,870
Crank!

1566
01:46:35,318 --> 01:46:36,978
See? Fate.

1567
01:46:49,531 --> 01:46:51,919
Can Moya do this?

1568
01:46:51,996 --> 01:46:55,705
She's done it.
She should be watertight.

1569
01:46:55,773 --> 01:46:56,720
Should be?

1570
01:46:56,794 --> 01:46:58,261
Harpoon holes
notwithstanding.

1571
01:46:58,333 --> 01:46:59,446
Don't fool yourselves.

1572
01:46:59,516 --> 01:47:01,786
The pressure differential
down here

1573
01:47:01,851 --> 01:47:04,310
compared to the vacuum
of space is huge!

1574
01:47:04,381 --> 01:47:05,943
We will flood!

1575
01:47:06,014 --> 01:47:10,618
Pilot, where is Moya intending
to go exactly? Pilot?

1576
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,262
Welcome to the bottom.

1577
01:47:23,332 --> 01:47:25,272
Pilot, we have
light showers in here.

1578
01:47:25,345 --> 01:47:27,005
What are we seeing
everywhere else?

1579
01:47:27,076 --> 01:47:28,604
<i>Sikozu's assessment
is accurate.

1580
01:47:28,678 --> 01:47:30,498
<i>Many tiers
are taking on water.

1581
01:47:30,564 --> 01:47:32,833
If we're going to make peace, we have to get
Stark to the Eidelons.

1582
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:36,002
- Okay. How do we get back to the surface?
- Transport pod.

1583
01:47:36,070 --> 01:47:38,969
If Moya's not watertight, then
transport pods won't be either.

1584
01:47:39,046 --> 01:47:41,664
We'll have to make one
watertight. Come along.

1585
01:47:44,007 --> 01:47:44,989
Where is Stark?

1586
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:50,689
I can't locate him, Commander.

1587
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:53,796
<i>Yeah, right here.

1588
01:47:53,867 --> 01:47:56,104
Don't get
your minivox in a twist.

1589
01:47:56,171 --> 01:47:57,993
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1590
01:47:58,059 --> 01:47:59,173
But Stark went
completely fahrbot

1591
01:47:59,243 --> 01:48:01,449
<i>when he heard the Scarrans
blowing the Hedsmana

1592
01:48:01,516 --> 01:48:02,278
out of the Eidelons.

1593
01:48:02,346 --> 01:48:03,658
<i>- Where is he?
- Don't know.

1594
01:48:03,725 --> 01:48:05,158
I'm on tier 7.

1595
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:06,951
<i>Hard to track him
through the water.

1596
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:08,070
I'll check the lower tiers.

1597
01:48:08,143 --> 01:48:09,353
I got topside.

1598
01:48:09,422 --> 01:48:11,944
We're going to need
more weapons on the surface.

1599
01:48:12,015 --> 01:48:14,437
- I'll raid the armory.
- Right. Be careful.

1600
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:17,361
I'm pregnant,
not incapacitated, John.

1601
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,351
Right. Pregnant.

1602
01:48:21,427 --> 01:48:25,454
Come on, Stark!
Give it up!

1603
01:48:25,523 --> 01:48:27,666
You act like you're high
half the time,

1604
01:48:27,734 --> 01:48:31,563
but we got an ocean
ten feet above our heads.

1605
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:35,500
Holy crap.

1606
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:39,789
Anybody see him yet?

1607
01:48:39,864 --> 01:48:42,318
Nope, but when I do
you're gonna know

1608
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,398
because I'm gonna
rip his arm out.

1609
01:48:44,472 --> 01:48:46,292
He's not on the lower tiers.

1610
01:48:46,357 --> 01:48:47,822
All right.
You go to the bow.

1611
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:49,589
<i>- I got the aft.
- My pleasure.

1612
01:48:49,657 --> 01:48:52,789
Stark, I know
what you're feeling.

1613
01:48:52,858 --> 01:48:56,634
You got something in your head
that everybody wants.

1614
01:48:56,703 --> 01:48:59,959
Something that never should've
been there in the first place.

1615
01:49:00,026 --> 01:49:03,476
I promise you,
we'll get it out.

1616
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:07,900
We damn well
better get it out.

1617
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,875
<i>Approaching water planet.

1618
01:49:13,948 --> 01:49:16,703
One damaged command carrier
on scans.

1619
01:49:16,771 --> 01:49:18,458
Multiple Scarran ships
bombarding her.

1620
01:49:18,528 --> 01:49:19,871
Do we have surprise?

1621
01:49:19,937 --> 01:49:22,524
From all indications, no cannons
swiveling to our vector.

1622
01:49:22,592 --> 01:49:24,449
Have you isolated
the emperor's vessel?

1623
01:49:24,513 --> 01:49:25,562
Not yet.

1624
01:49:25,636 --> 01:49:27,327
Then target all craft equally.

1625
01:49:27,395 --> 01:49:29,568
Shock wears off quickly,
ladies and gentlemen.

1626
01:49:36,613 --> 01:49:40,258
You know how I change my mind
about things sometimes?

1627
01:49:40,326 --> 01:49:41,753
I get so excited.

1628
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:44,482
I say I'm gonna do it
and I really...

1629
01:49:44,551 --> 01:49:46,405
frelling mean it.

1630
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:49,060
And then I change my mind
completely.

1631
01:49:49,130 --> 01:49:49,991
Yes.

1632
01:49:50,057 --> 01:49:52,095
Hyneria.

1633
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:58,621
I'm gonna do it...

1634
01:50:00,809 --> 01:50:01,859
with you.

1635
01:50:03,947 --> 01:50:07,301
- You know why?
- Because you like Hynerians?

1636
01:50:07,373 --> 01:50:10,441
Not so much.

1637
01:50:10,512 --> 01:50:12,264
But I like you.

1638
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:28,264
Can you hear that?

1639
01:50:28,338 --> 01:50:30,792
That's just the sound of a DRD.

1640
01:50:33,685 --> 01:50:38,323
And that is the sound of
our ship, Moya, under pressure.

1641
01:50:39,702 --> 01:50:42,156
And this...

1642
01:50:42,228 --> 01:50:46,575
is the sound of an AKR maximum
load ammo pack being chambered

1643
01:50:46,648 --> 01:50:49,779
into a full-grade
field ranger pulse pistol.

1644
01:50:51,512 --> 01:50:52,855
Are you all right?

1645
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:55,635
Yes. The baby
is just kicking a lot.

1646
01:50:58,553 --> 01:51:00,594
I should go and help
find Stark.

1647
01:51:00,666 --> 01:51:03,004
We said no to John.

1648
01:51:04,603 --> 01:51:06,129
I know.

1649
01:51:06,203 --> 01:51:10,777
Moya and I will have
no part of mass murder.

1650
01:51:12,351 --> 01:51:14,522
None of us
want to, Pilot.

1651
01:51:14,588 --> 01:51:18,202
But if we don't,
the outcome will be worse.

1652
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:20,026
Are not Stark
and the Eidelons

1653
01:51:20,096 --> 01:51:21,757
preferable
to the wormhole weapon?

1654
01:51:21,826 --> 01:51:25,087
Of course, but I'm not sure
they can do it.

1655
01:51:30,276 --> 01:51:33,375
You know, we all want
the same thing, Pilot.

1656
01:51:34,467 --> 01:51:36,674
Peace.

1657
01:51:42,789 --> 01:51:44,035
Hello, D'Argo.

1658
01:51:44,103 --> 01:51:46,623
I found him. He's in
the lower maintenance bay.

1659
01:51:46,696 --> 01:51:50,110
I'm sorry I ran like I did.
It was mindless of me.

1660
01:51:50,182 --> 01:51:51,593
Are you okay?

1661
01:51:51,659 --> 01:51:53,925
Fine actually.

1662
01:51:53,994 --> 01:51:55,139
Remarkably fine

1663
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:58,689
given the responsibility
that now resides within me.

1664
01:51:58,761 --> 01:52:03,235
So it worked?
It's inside you?

1665
01:52:03,306 --> 01:52:06,091
Yondalao's knowledge.

1666
01:52:06,156 --> 01:52:09,124
We really
have to get outta here.

1667
01:52:11,564 --> 01:52:14,381
We're in awfully deep,
aren't we, D'Argo?

1668
01:52:14,445 --> 01:52:16,903
Please, Stark,
we have to go.

1669
01:52:16,976 --> 01:52:18,535
Water.

1670
01:52:18,606 --> 01:52:22,187
Yeah, there's lots
of water.

1671
01:52:23,759 --> 01:52:25,454
More water.

1672
01:52:25,522 --> 01:52:26,471
Get down!

1673
01:52:29,652 --> 01:52:33,328
Breach on the lower tiers
where D'Argo and Stark are!

1674
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:35,057
I'm close and moving.

1675
01:52:46,166 --> 01:52:47,628
Where are they?

1676
01:52:48,984 --> 01:52:50,543
Here. Over here!

1677
01:52:52,247 --> 01:52:53,776
D'Argo, no.

1678
01:52:53,849 --> 01:52:55,311
Look after him.

1679
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:14,045
Thank you.

1680
01:53:16,893 --> 01:53:17,754
Are you all right?

1681
01:53:20,254 --> 01:53:25,494
I saw the most amazing thing
before I almost died.

1682
01:53:25,568 --> 01:53:27,938
What?

1683
01:53:28,004 --> 01:53:30,305
The vision?
The light?

1684
01:53:30,370 --> 01:53:33,568
- Your ancestors?
- No.

1685
01:53:34,819 --> 01:53:37,787
I saw a big wall of water
and the ground

1686
01:53:37,863 --> 01:53:41,177
as my nose was scraping
along the floor.

1687
01:53:48,103 --> 01:53:51,234
You're lying.
It's not your regular brand.

1688
01:53:51,303 --> 01:53:55,614
Eidelon. Crichton,
I'm not afraid anymore.

1689
01:53:57,546 --> 01:54:01,822
Hold that thought 'cause
we're going to the surface.

1690
01:54:15,344 --> 01:54:18,471
Grand Chancellor Maryk.

1691
01:54:18,542 --> 01:54:21,127
Get us into that battle!

1692
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:24,681
Nothing matters
but the carrier.

1693
01:54:29,681 --> 01:54:30,629
You all right?

1694
01:54:30,704 --> 01:54:33,609
It's beyond me why women would choose
to do this more than once.

1695
01:54:33,683 --> 01:54:37,480
- They say three is the magic number.
- Three is a scary number.

1696
01:54:37,555 --> 01:54:39,760
Come on, move! Let's go!

1697
01:54:39,827 --> 01:54:42,446
Stark, come with me.

1698
01:54:44,596 --> 01:54:45,971
We're too late.

1699
01:54:46,038 --> 01:54:48,459
We don't know that yet.
Come on.

1700
01:54:48,533 --> 01:54:51,699
- Where are the Eidelons?
- The Scarran term is nullified.

1701
01:54:51,769 --> 01:54:54,038
Sergeant Learko,
this is Cleaver Jothee.

1702
01:54:54,104 --> 01:54:56,822
Sergeant, are you there?

1703
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,539
More like here, sir.

1704
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,041
What's the situation?

1705
01:55:06,107 --> 01:55:07,994
Scarrans control
the whole of the city.

1706
01:55:08,059 --> 01:55:09,466
Isolated pockets of
Peacekeepers,

1707
01:55:09,532 --> 01:55:11,125
but they're
being steadily neutralized.

1708
01:55:11,194 --> 01:55:14,395
- What about the Eidelons?
- Slaughtered, even in surrender.

1709
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:16,697
The rest of our men are
on the other side of the city

1710
01:55:16,765 --> 01:55:17,782
searching for survivors.

1711
01:55:17,856 --> 01:55:19,765
We have to get Stark to them.

1712
01:55:19,838 --> 01:55:21,725
Captain Braca,
are you still alive?

1713
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:25,142
- Very much so, sir. Good to hear your voice.
- Your location?

1714
01:55:25,217 --> 01:55:27,388
The great temple.

1715
01:55:27,456 --> 01:55:29,825
We're holding out
with a band of Eidelons.

1716
01:55:29,887 --> 01:55:32,346
<i>My requests for reinforcements
have been unheeded.

1717
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:34,176
There's some on the way.
Stay tight.

1718
01:55:34,243 --> 01:55:36,545
Yes, sir.

1719
01:55:36,613 --> 01:55:39,064
Let's move.
You're on point.

1720
01:55:39,137 --> 01:55:40,634
Sergeant Learko,
you go with him.

1721
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:42,137
Stark is now
our number-one priority.

1722
01:55:42,216 --> 01:55:45,857
Stark? How's that for
an inversion of normalcy!

1723
01:55:50,084 --> 01:55:51,995
Don't get shot up too much.

1724
01:55:52,069 --> 01:55:55,452
I was thinking the same thing
about you, old man.

1725
01:56:00,746 --> 01:56:04,094
Why can we not immolate
that city?

1726
01:56:04,172 --> 01:56:08,032
Weapons systems is inoperative from the
Luxan attack, Excellency.

1727
01:56:08,106 --> 01:56:10,117
Excuses aside,

1728
01:56:10,187 --> 01:56:14,118
I want every single Eidelon
eliminated.

1729
01:56:15,917 --> 01:56:17,925
It is being attended.

1730
01:56:22,418 --> 01:56:25,035
That chair becomes you.

1731
01:56:25,105 --> 01:56:28,400
Reports from prior
to our arrival suggest

1732
01:56:28,465 --> 01:56:32,589
that Crichton and the Leviathan
perished in the ocean below.

1733
01:56:32,657 --> 01:56:34,348
Would you agree?

1734
01:56:34,418 --> 01:56:38,095
I would rather have
his head as proof.

1735
01:56:38,163 --> 01:56:40,531
Once the Peacekeepers
have been defeated,

1736
01:56:40,595 --> 01:56:44,425
I intent do oversee larger
galactic governance issues.

1737
01:56:44,501 --> 01:56:47,918
Bring me Crichton's head

1738
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:51,056
and all differences between us
will be resolved.

1739
01:56:51,126 --> 01:56:56,276
Paving the way for you
to assume my position,

1740
01:56:57,751 --> 01:57:00,272
Empress Ahkna.

1741
01:57:06,363 --> 01:57:09,012
Why no opposition
on this path?

1742
01:57:09,083 --> 01:57:12,696
Scarran shock teams containing
a small number of troops,

1743
01:57:12,763 --> 01:57:14,706
delivering a high body count.

1744
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:18,743
Looks like they went street by street.
Extermination pattern.

1745
01:57:18,815 --> 01:57:20,726
Now they're down there.

1746
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:25,656
How hard's it gonna be for everybody to leave
each other alone?

1747
01:57:25,727 --> 01:57:26,709
Impossible, I'd say.

1748
01:57:26,784 --> 01:57:29,400
I would like you
to name the baby Rygel.

1749
01:57:29,471 --> 01:57:31,481
Maybe... if it's a girl.

1750
01:57:31,554 --> 01:57:35,134
All right, folks, when things
go to hell in a hand basket,

1751
01:57:35,202 --> 01:57:37,240
we meet here.

1752
01:57:37,315 --> 01:57:40,512
It's a good spot for Moya to
pick us up with the docking web.

1753
01:57:40,578 --> 01:57:43,549
Okay, everyone,
let's move out.

1754
01:57:52,007 --> 01:57:54,048
Very impressive subjugation.

1755
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:57,184
I dread my cities
looking like this.

1756
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:19,719
Hi, Grunschlk,
going somewhere?

1757
01:58:19,791 --> 01:58:22,539
Oh, I suspect you have
some serious issues.

1758
01:58:22,605 --> 01:58:24,615
- Shoot the traitor.
- I'm not a traitor.

1759
01:58:24,687 --> 01:58:28,365
Someone relayed our location
to the Scarrans after we left.

1760
01:58:28,433 --> 01:58:29,840
Someone else.

1761
01:58:29,905 --> 01:58:32,873
Have you signaled to anyone
that we're here?

1762
01:58:32,947 --> 01:58:37,867
Signaled?
I'm trying to get away.

1763
01:58:40,337 --> 01:58:41,964
From a Scarran weapon.

1764
01:58:42,037 --> 01:58:43,888
So? We use that trick
all the time.

1765
01:58:43,956 --> 01:58:47,119
Look, Missy New Eyes,
my dealings with the Scarrans

1766
01:58:47,188 --> 01:58:49,740
are purely financial.

1767
01:58:49,812 --> 01:58:52,682
Okay, enough talk. Either we
kill him or we take him with us.

1768
01:58:52,759 --> 01:58:56,073
- Take him.
- Scarrans.

1769
01:58:56,151 --> 01:58:59,085
- Okay, down.
- Go! Go!

1770
01:59:10,682 --> 01:59:13,399
We can take
those Dreadnaughts on.

1771
01:59:13,468 --> 01:59:15,925
A pulse blast
would bring 100 Scarrans.

1772
01:59:15,996 --> 01:59:18,928
They don't know where we are.
I wanna keep it that way.

1773
01:59:26,848 --> 01:59:29,948
Don't move.

1774
01:59:30,018 --> 01:59:32,506
There's enough here
for both of us.

1775
01:59:38,051 --> 01:59:39,456
Go.

1776
02:00:00,873 --> 02:00:03,458
<i>Scorpius, there's
movement outside the temple.

1777
02:00:03,527 --> 02:00:06,826
Yes, Captain, we're on
approach so hold your fire.

1778
02:00:06,889 --> 02:00:08,264
<i>Thank Juka.

1779
02:00:08,329 --> 02:00:10,787
<i>We were worried it was another
Scarran insurgency team.

1780
02:00:10,861 --> 02:00:12,385
Braca, open the door!

1781
02:00:12,457 --> 02:00:16,714
Good to see you.
You're the reinforcements?

1782
02:00:16,779 --> 02:00:18,242
No, we're the band.

1783
02:00:18,314 --> 02:00:20,423
Looks like Kiss
was your opening act.

1784
02:00:20,495 --> 02:00:23,722
Frell, I'm in the wrong band.

1785
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:27,787
Report.

1786
02:00:27,853 --> 02:00:29,197
Six of our troops,

1787
02:00:29,264 --> 02:00:32,840
two trained Eidelons, four
others who refuse to bear arms.

1788
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:35,848
The Diagnosan,
minimal munitions.

1789
02:00:35,922 --> 02:00:37,741
At least the Scarrans don't know
we're here.

1790
02:00:37,806 --> 02:00:39,184
Let's keep it that way. Sergeant?

1791
02:00:39,249 --> 02:00:41,737
He's a spy.
Watch him.

1792
02:00:41,810 --> 02:00:43,600
I am not a spy!

1793
02:00:45,107 --> 02:00:48,304
I report, my spy is trapped

1794
02:00:48,372 --> 02:00:51,026
inside one of the city's
largest edifices.

1795
02:00:51,094 --> 02:00:53,231
Most interestingly,
with Crichton.

1796
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:56,878
<i>- So, he lives.
- Rectified shortly.

1797
02:00:56,948 --> 02:01:01,740
I continue to keep
your future seat warm for you.

1798
02:01:02,935 --> 02:01:05,785
Stark, you're the reason
we came.

1799
02:01:05,848 --> 02:01:09,199
Is Muoma here?

1800
02:01:09,274 --> 02:01:11,926
Yes, she's
around the corner.

1801
02:01:11,996 --> 02:01:13,938
Do you have a plan?

1802
02:01:14,012 --> 02:01:16,914
We had a good plan
till your guys shot us down.

1803
02:01:16,988 --> 02:01:19,158
I don't suppose they'd loan us
a ship, would they?

1804
02:01:19,225 --> 02:01:22,393
No, I'm afraid Commandant Grayza's focusing
on other issues.

1805
02:01:24,348 --> 02:01:26,260
The grand chancellor's dead.

1806
02:01:26,334 --> 02:01:30,199
I suggest we observe operation silence.
Fortify our defenses.

1807
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:35,098
Doc!

1808
02:01:36,706 --> 02:01:39,386
Your water just broke.
That means the baby's coming.

1809
02:01:39,457 --> 02:01:41,147
Doc!

1810
02:01:46,882 --> 02:01:49,307
- Big baby. That's good.
- The timing isn't.

1811
02:01:49,381 --> 02:01:51,417
Considering the amount
of fire power it takes

1812
02:01:51,488 --> 02:01:53,248
to drop a single Scarran,
we're in trouble.

1813
02:01:53,317 --> 02:01:57,280
We should disassemble the weaker munitions.
Make our own shot grenades.

1814
02:01:57,349 --> 02:02:01,954
Arts and crafts.
She's gonna be a great mom.

1815
02:02:02,022 --> 02:02:03,398
She's right about
the fortifications.

1816
02:02:03,463 --> 02:02:05,701
Captain Braca, Scarrans.

1817
02:02:06,663 --> 02:02:07,973
Take cover!

1818
02:02:08,039 --> 02:02:10,432
Small arms,
but a lot of weaponry.

1819
02:02:10,504 --> 02:02:12,679
Everyone, help me
close up this door.

1820
02:02:15,085 --> 02:02:16,578
War Minister,

1821
02:02:16,652 --> 02:02:19,333
the structure is surrounded
and prime for takeover.

1822
02:02:19,404 --> 02:02:21,741
Excellent.

1823
02:02:21,805 --> 02:02:26,344
When we attack, the Peacekeeper
female is to be left for me.

1824
02:02:50,164 --> 02:02:52,683
I just spoke to Pilot.

1825
02:02:52,757 --> 02:02:54,798
Said he won't be ready
till dawn.

1826
02:02:54,867 --> 02:02:56,624
At least a couple of arns.

1827
02:03:00,982 --> 02:03:03,023
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1828
02:03:03,094 --> 02:03:04,240
You've done enough already.

1829
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,253
If this was a Sebacean
child, a pure one,

1830
02:03:06,327 --> 02:03:08,021
it would've
been born long ago.

1831
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:11,221
So, how long
is this going to take?

1832
02:03:11,288 --> 02:03:13,178
On Earth it can last days.

1833
02:03:14,359 --> 02:03:17,080
I have killed men for less.

1834
02:03:21,403 --> 02:03:27,001
Hey, baby birthing was not
part of the original deal.

1835
02:03:27,070 --> 02:03:31,293
Hey, we will be renegotiating.

1836
02:03:31,359 --> 02:03:32,699
How's it going?

1837
02:03:32,768 --> 02:03:35,035
I'll explain the processes
as best I understand it.

1838
02:03:35,103 --> 02:03:38,815
- When they finish meditating...
- We are ready.

1839
02:03:42,465 --> 02:03:46,723
High Priestess,
prepare yourself.

1840
02:04:15,053 --> 02:04:17,603
The legends are true.

1841
02:04:17,675 --> 02:04:20,774
Our heritage,

1842
02:04:20,845 --> 02:04:24,422
Yondalao's knowledge,
lies within me.

1843
02:04:28,045 --> 02:04:29,901
It has left me completely.

1844
02:04:29,965 --> 02:04:32,933
- Will you be able to educate the others?
- Of course.

1845
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:34,697
And make peace?

1846
02:04:34,768 --> 02:04:37,900
Our numbers are too few.

1847
02:04:37,968 --> 02:04:41,895
Many more are necessary
to make a lasting contribution.

1848
02:04:41,967 --> 02:04:44,554
We might be able
to do something about that.

1849
02:04:44,625 --> 02:04:47,047
<i>- Jothee, pick up the phone.
- Hello, Crichton?

1850
02:04:47,122 --> 02:04:49,328
Noranti, what the hell
are you doing?

1851
02:04:49,396 --> 02:04:50,956
Rescuing Eidelons.
What are you doing?

1852
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:52,455
Where's Jothee?

1853
02:04:52,533 --> 02:04:55,463
<i>Gone on reconnaissance with
his men. Their comms are off.

1854
02:04:55,538 --> 02:04:56,784
What's the situation there?

1855
02:04:56,852 --> 02:04:59,986
Any Eidelon that isn't dead
appears to be hiding with us.

1856
02:05:00,052 --> 02:05:03,730
<i>Upwards of 100, I'd say.
I'm in charge, Crichton.

1857
02:05:03,797 --> 02:05:06,702
Jothee has made me
an honorary commando.

1858
02:05:06,774 --> 02:05:09,198
<i>- Tell me he didn't give you a gun.
- Most certainly.

1859
02:05:09,273 --> 02:05:11,541
<i>But pulse packs are in short
supply so it's not loaded.

1860
02:05:11,606 --> 02:05:14,392
Moya won't be able to pick them
up all together.

1861
02:05:14,457 --> 02:05:16,432
She'll barely
be able to take us.

1862
02:05:16,506 --> 02:05:18,710
Listen, Grandma,
call us when Jothee gets back.

1863
02:05:18,781 --> 02:05:19,857
<i>There's a lot happening.

1864
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:22,715
I'll try and remember.
I have to go now.

1865
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,692
We can get you 100.

1866
02:05:24,764 --> 02:05:29,435
If we were all to be reunited,
peace is possible.

1867
02:05:29,504 --> 02:05:32,284
Just keep doing your thing.
We'll get you there.

1868
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,209
Fantastic job.

1869
02:05:38,274 --> 02:05:41,020
You're the Johnny Appleseed
of detente.

1870
02:05:42,241 --> 02:05:45,656
Thank you. Thank you.
Johnny Appleseed?

1871
02:05:54,915 --> 02:05:57,372
Enough! Don't touch me!

1872
02:05:58,311 --> 02:05:59,969
Everything he does causes more pain.

1873
02:06:00,036 --> 02:06:02,460
This woman could chew
her own arm off.

1874
02:06:02,534 --> 02:06:03,711
What is going on?

1875
02:06:05,256 --> 02:06:07,973
<i>No, no. No hablo Diagnosan.

1876
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:09,633
What the hell's he saying?

1877
02:06:09,705 --> 02:06:11,079
The baby's turned round.

1878
02:06:11,147 --> 02:06:14,528
In a bad way.
Tangled in the cord.

1879
02:06:14,602 --> 02:06:18,343
And the translation
is extra!

1880
02:06:18,604 --> 02:06:23,174
Entangled. Breached.
Must manipulate.

1881
02:06:23,243 --> 02:06:25,927
But you can fix it,
right?

1882
02:06:27,022 --> 02:06:28,264
They're here!

1883
02:06:29,133 --> 02:06:30,083
Return fire!

1884
02:06:30,159 --> 02:06:33,507
Aeryn, get down!
You have to give birth!

1885
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:38,158
Key for
their muzzle fire.

1886
02:06:41,262 --> 02:06:42,857
Frelling Scarrans!

1887
02:06:46,513 --> 02:06:50,411
They will charge!
Use your weapon!

1888
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:54,762
Need your help.

1889
02:06:56,561 --> 02:06:58,220
Stay down!

1890
02:06:58,293 --> 02:06:59,603
We're way outnumbered.

1891
02:06:59,669 --> 02:07:02,738
Our number's about to grow
by one. Can you help Aeryn?

1892
02:07:02,808 --> 02:07:04,431
- I'll do it myself.
- The baby is breached.

1893
02:07:04,501 --> 02:07:06,642
I can't birth her narl.

1894
02:07:06,712 --> 02:07:08,235
I don't want a narl.

1895
02:07:08,312 --> 02:07:11,215
I hate narls.
I'm still a narl myself.

1896
02:07:11,288 --> 02:07:14,702
- You helped Moya give birth.
- I blew out a wall and three tiers.

1897
02:07:14,777 --> 02:07:15,758
I concur.

1898
02:07:15,832 --> 02:07:18,170
The baby's head is up.
It has to be down.

1899
02:07:18,235 --> 02:07:22,739
Don't make any structural
changes. I'll be right back.

1900
02:07:30,589 --> 02:07:32,976
Mind if I borrow your knife?

1901
02:07:33,053 --> 02:07:34,364
Careful, it's sharp.

1902
02:07:34,430 --> 02:07:37,814
- How are we looking?
- Stay here. We're not looking too good.

1903
02:07:37,887 --> 02:07:40,253
Scarran experts, what are
our tactical options?

1904
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:42,108
In this position,
very limited.

1905
02:07:42,173 --> 02:07:45,885
A distraction and a break.
Some make it, some don't.

1906
02:07:45,953 --> 02:07:48,375
We've got to stay. We've got
no choice. Pilot isn't ready.

1907
02:07:48,449 --> 02:07:51,418
You heard the man. Batten down
the hatches. We stay and defend.

1908
02:08:00,099 --> 02:08:02,884
Uncooperative.
Twisted up.

1909
02:08:02,948 --> 02:08:04,858
She's having it.

1910
02:08:04,933 --> 02:08:08,449
- I need you. I need you to reload my weapon.
- I'm here, baby.

1911
02:08:08,519 --> 02:08:11,486
- If she keeps firing it past my head, I quit!
- Fine!

1912
02:08:11,558 --> 02:08:14,857
If she doesn't stay still,
I can't do this.

1913
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,614
If I don't fire, we're dead.

1914
02:08:16,685 --> 02:08:18,950
Sweetheart, for once
let me cover you.

1915
02:08:19,018 --> 02:08:22,793
- Can you do this?
- Yes. Maybe if she stays still.

1916
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:24,681
Shooting makes me
feel better.

1917
02:08:24,748 --> 02:08:26,787
Honey.

1918
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:29,860
All right!
But do it quickly.

1919
02:08:29,934 --> 02:08:32,386
Come on.

1920
02:08:32,459 --> 02:08:34,468
One, two, three.

1921
02:08:35,789 --> 02:08:36,774
Jothee, you're back.

1922
02:08:36,844 --> 02:08:38,603
<i>We were worried about you.

1923
02:08:38,671 --> 02:08:41,737
Biggest threat so far is this
crazy old witch you travel with.

1924
02:08:41,807 --> 02:08:44,810
- How're things going?
- We're deep in it.

1925
02:08:44,879 --> 02:08:47,665
We're gonna try to make a break
for Moya. You guys got a plan?

1926
02:08:47,730 --> 02:08:49,835
Found a nice Scarran
transport vessel.

1927
02:08:49,909 --> 02:08:51,912
Should hold
all the Eidelons.

1928
02:08:51,985 --> 02:08:53,578
Good luck!

1929
02:09:03,447 --> 02:09:06,413
I believe one of our empty troop
vessels is under attack.

1930
02:09:06,486 --> 02:09:10,608
Comms went silent after
an initial transmission burst.

1931
02:09:10,677 --> 02:09:13,099
We have others.
Ignore it.

1932
02:09:13,174 --> 02:09:15,541
How long before your
engineers are ready here?

1933
02:09:15,607 --> 02:09:16,534
Moments, Minister.

1934
02:09:18,361 --> 02:09:19,442
They're charging!

1935
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:25,080
Fall back! Reinforce
the defense perimeter.

1936
02:09:26,908 --> 02:09:31,001
Move back! Move back!

1937
02:09:31,070 --> 02:09:32,499
Hey, all right, listen.

1938
02:09:32,572 --> 02:09:34,742
- We gotta get you in the fountain.
- What?

1939
02:09:34,812 --> 02:09:38,129
- Into the fountain.
- You get in. It's the most exposed position.

1940
02:09:38,206 --> 02:09:41,369
It's better for the baby.
It's cleaner, safer.

1941
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:44,824
Hey, do you want this thing
out of you or not?

1942
02:09:47,233 --> 02:09:51,576
Hold your positions
and fire!

1943
02:10:31,021 --> 02:10:32,907
John, get these!

1944
02:10:32,972 --> 02:10:34,915
Come on, hurry up!
Move it!

1945
02:10:40,652 --> 02:10:43,971
- Hey, you all right?
- You all right?

1946
02:10:48,272 --> 02:10:49,768
Okay.

1947
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:50,822
- We're gonna get you up, in the fountain.
- No.

1948
02:10:50,896 --> 02:10:53,169
- Build a barricade.
- Yes, sir.

1949
02:11:02,227 --> 02:11:04,596
Learko.

1950
02:11:05,942 --> 02:11:09,554
Say hello to the... cleaver
for me.

1951
02:11:11,703 --> 02:11:12,752
Tell him...

1952
02:11:12,823 --> 02:11:15,606
Tell him
it was an honor to serve.

1953
02:11:29,702 --> 02:11:31,741
Up.

1954
02:11:31,815 --> 02:11:36,355
Soldier, your wounds
mean nothing!

1955
02:11:36,425 --> 02:11:38,180
Attend to your position!

1956
02:11:40,617 --> 02:11:42,821
Untie me. Give me a weapon.

1957
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:45,478
I'll only shoot myself.
Honest!

1958
02:11:45,549 --> 02:11:47,434
Leave the dead!
Reload.

1959
02:11:47,501 --> 02:11:48,962
Careful.

1960
02:11:49,037 --> 02:11:50,632
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

1961
02:11:50,704 --> 02:11:54,000
We need as many weapons as
possible to the breach holes.

1962
02:11:57,391 --> 02:12:01,189
Sikozu, I have something
for you to do.

1963
02:12:04,724 --> 02:12:07,438
- Astro.
- We're...

1964
02:12:07,504 --> 02:12:10,575
Just a few scratches.

1965
02:12:10,644 --> 02:12:12,913
How long
till first light here?

1966
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:14,924
Another arn at most.

1967
02:12:19,897 --> 02:12:21,457
<i>Pilot, where are you?

1968
02:12:21,530 --> 02:12:22,543
I am here, Commander.

1969
02:12:22,615 --> 02:12:24,791
Yeah, and when
are you gonna be here?

1970
02:12:24,859 --> 02:12:26,613
<i>Preparations are almost
complete.

1971
02:12:26,682 --> 02:12:27,892
Perhaps in an arn.

1972
02:12:27,961 --> 02:12:29,556
Hopefully we'll be there.

1973
02:12:29,629 --> 02:12:31,636
- Come on, in you go.
- No!

1974
02:12:31,704 --> 02:12:32,855
Come on.

1975
02:12:36,926 --> 02:12:38,071
Come on.

1976
02:12:38,143 --> 02:12:40,695
Come on, in the fountain.

1977
02:12:40,766 --> 02:12:43,735
Listen, we need raslak.
Lots of it.

1978
02:12:43,808 --> 02:12:47,257
Come on, in the fountain.
Here we go, here we go.

1979
02:12:52,419 --> 02:12:55,103
Okay. I've untangled
the baby.

1980
02:12:55,172 --> 02:12:57,059
You gotta get her
in the fountain.

1981
02:12:57,126 --> 02:13:00,901
She pushes, you pull.
I'm done.

1982
02:13:00,967 --> 02:13:01,980
You're fired!

1983
02:13:02,053 --> 02:13:05,186
In the fountain.

1984
02:13:12,875 --> 02:13:14,696
You like this?

1985
02:13:14,763 --> 02:13:18,148
It's very inventive.

1986
02:13:18,895 --> 02:13:20,616
I've never met a spy

1987
02:13:20,683 --> 02:13:22,660
more resourceful,
more tenacious.

1988
02:13:34,419 --> 02:13:36,940
Scarran comms device.

1989
02:13:37,012 --> 02:13:41,549
What did you expect?
How long have you known?

1990
02:13:41,618 --> 02:13:44,173
Long enough for you
to service my desires.

1991
02:13:44,245 --> 02:13:50,447
Unfortunately, your desires
no longer serve my needs!

1992
02:13:55,066 --> 02:13:58,100
They promised
to free my people

1993
02:13:58,169 --> 02:14:01,333
from their servitude!

1994
02:14:02,716 --> 02:14:06,032
They will not,
and you

1995
02:14:06,107 --> 02:14:11,229
have blown something unique.

1996
02:14:19,395 --> 02:14:21,630
What are you doing?

1997
02:14:21,698 --> 02:14:23,325
Hold still.

1998
02:14:23,396 --> 02:14:27,865
All right, Aeryn,
we have to get ready.

1999
02:14:27,938 --> 02:14:29,698
Great. I'll cut it out.

2000
02:14:29,765 --> 02:14:33,248
No! It's for your clothes
and for the cord.

2001
02:14:33,317 --> 02:14:35,687
Oh. Right.

2002
02:14:43,245 --> 02:14:45,132
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy.

2003
02:14:45,197 --> 02:14:48,774
All right, breathe.
Breathe with me. Inhale.

2004
02:14:48,845 --> 02:14:53,417
Exhale. Does anybody have a plan
that doesn't involve the word surrender?

2005
02:14:53,486 --> 02:14:56,389
There's absolutely no way we
can withstand another assault.

2006
02:14:56,462 --> 02:14:58,733
Agreed. Let's go on
the offensive.

2007
02:14:58,801 --> 02:15:00,458
Bring me every weapon
we have.

2008
02:15:00,529 --> 02:15:03,843
I'm gonna create
a little diversion.

2009
02:15:03,922 --> 02:15:06,441
Exhale.
With me, with me, inhale.

2010
02:15:08,405 --> 02:15:11,437
Sir, where's Sikozu?

2011
02:15:11,509 --> 02:15:14,640
On her final mission

2012
02:15:14,708 --> 02:15:16,498
for the Scarrans.

2013
02:15:17,654 --> 02:15:19,563
Get down!
Everyone get down!

2014
02:15:21,529 --> 02:15:23,634
Too much fun.
Can we go now?

2015
02:15:27,674 --> 02:15:29,428
I think it's time to push.

2016
02:15:29,499 --> 02:15:32,282
- I can't!
- You can! You can!

2017
02:15:32,346 --> 02:15:33,973
Push!

2018
02:15:34,045 --> 02:15:35,868
Here.

2019
02:15:35,933 --> 02:15:38,903
- I'm helpless.
- You're not helpless. I'm here. Come on, push!

2020
02:15:41,919 --> 02:15:43,829
- Wait. Stark!
- What?

2021
02:15:49,665 --> 02:15:51,870
- Come here.
- Do you want me to take your pain?

2022
02:15:51,937 --> 02:15:54,429
No. I want you
to marry us.

2023
02:15:54,499 --> 02:15:55,582
What?

2024
02:15:55,653 --> 02:15:57,951
- Now.
- Aeryn, we can go to Vegas tomorrow.

2025
02:15:58,019 --> 02:15:59,647
- No!
- Marry us!

2026
02:15:59,719 --> 02:16:01,058
Wait, wait, wait.

2027
02:16:01,125 --> 02:16:02,685
What?

2028
02:16:06,022 --> 02:16:08,261
Ah. Here.

2029
02:16:09,799 --> 02:16:14,723
It was with the crystals.
I kept it moist for you.

2030
02:16:14,797 --> 02:16:17,961
- It's my mom's ring.
- That's wonderful!

2031
02:16:18,029 --> 02:16:21,442
You didn't think I'd go back
into that cold ocean for nothing!

2032
02:16:24,269 --> 02:16:26,248
Quick, quick!

2033
02:16:26,321 --> 02:16:29,166
Come on!

2034
02:16:32,337 --> 02:16:35,502
Idiot! That's a Shayan
prayer for the dead.

2035
02:16:35,569 --> 02:16:36,999
What?

2036
02:16:42,999 --> 02:16:44,851
Dobian puberty right.

2037
02:16:47,477 --> 02:16:49,846
Okay, okay.
You two love each other?

2038
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:51,057
Yes!

2039
02:16:51,127 --> 02:16:52,949
Enough to
be married forever?

2040
02:16:54,584 --> 02:16:55,532
Yes!

2041
02:16:55,607 --> 02:16:58,326
Then you are.
Congratulations.

2042
02:17:05,498 --> 02:17:07,127
Thank you!

2043
02:17:20,129 --> 02:17:21,176
He's alive!

2044
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:24,993
Here, stick him in this bag.
We'll carry him.

2045
02:17:27,492 --> 02:17:30,243
Father, I don't think we're
gonna be able to get to you.

2046
02:17:30,310 --> 02:17:33,441
If we're gonna make it to Moya, it's gonna have
to be further away from the battle.

2047
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:35,933
Can you get past
the Scarran lines?

2048
02:17:36,007 --> 02:17:38,976
Yeah, we got a chance. Yes.

2049
02:17:39,048 --> 02:17:40,707
Just one more time!

2050
02:17:43,275 --> 02:17:45,444
Oh!

2051
02:17:45,512 --> 02:17:49,825
Now push!
Push, push, push, push!

2052
02:17:49,899 --> 02:17:51,725
Push!

2053
02:17:52,849 --> 02:17:55,235
Its head.

2054
02:18:04,817 --> 02:18:07,439
Wow!

2055
02:18:24,794 --> 02:18:26,166
We have a son.

2056
02:18:28,952 --> 02:18:30,995
We have a son!

2057
02:18:32,985 --> 02:18:35,287
- We did it.
- I love you.

2058
02:18:35,354 --> 02:18:37,330
I love you too.

2059
02:18:48,127 --> 02:18:51,515
Hey.

2060
02:18:51,587 --> 02:18:54,336
- Could you do me a favor?
- You name it.

2061
02:18:54,402 --> 02:18:58,397
Can you get us
out of here?

2062
02:18:58,467 --> 02:19:00,124
Done.

2063
02:19:52,757 --> 02:19:55,029
Fall back!
Take high positions!

2064
02:19:55,098 --> 02:19:57,814
Ambush them in the street.

2065
02:20:12,254 --> 02:20:13,813
Fool.

2066
02:20:23,971 --> 02:20:26,428
Where are they?

2067
02:20:32,322 --> 02:20:34,465
Pilot, we're on the move.

2068
02:20:34,536 --> 02:20:35,743
<i>I have to bring Moya's
propulsion

2069
02:20:35,812 --> 02:20:38,599
up to maximum to break free
of the seabed.

2070
02:20:38,665 --> 02:20:40,607
<i>No one I'd rather have
in charge.

2071
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:41,956
We'll be there.

2072
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:48,290
How's your honeymoon?

2073
02:20:48,363 --> 02:20:50,402
Well, the brochure was better.

2074
02:20:55,756 --> 02:20:58,660
There's too many boot prints,
and they're fresh.

2075
02:20:58,733 --> 02:21:00,427
We're not alone.

2076
02:21:05,775 --> 02:21:07,304
Inside!

2077
02:21:12,371 --> 02:21:13,615
Get back! Get back!

2078
02:21:15,603 --> 02:21:18,704
There's too many! Take cover!
Come on, go, go, go!

2079
02:21:29,817 --> 02:21:33,265
I hear Bolivia
is perfect for a honeymoon.

2080
02:21:33,337 --> 02:21:35,609
They're pinned down,
War Minister.

2081
02:21:38,268 --> 02:21:41,335
Supply the troops
in the buildings with missiles.

2082
02:21:41,403 --> 02:21:44,787
We get hit with any more of
those missiles, and we are Spam!

2083
02:21:48,446 --> 02:21:52,411
We'll try for that building. Set
up a crossfire so we can move.

2084
02:21:52,482 --> 02:21:55,002
Go! Cover fire now!

2085
02:21:55,075 --> 02:21:56,766
Go! Move out!

2086
02:22:03,141 --> 02:22:04,571
I'm out!

2087
02:22:09,926 --> 02:22:11,813
All right, one through twenty.

2088
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:13,820
We are lifting off now!

2089
02:22:13,894 --> 02:22:16,450
- You can be at the cliff when Moya arrives.
- Not 'til we clear this path!

2090
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:18,430
Oh, that'll be easy.

2091
02:22:21,322 --> 02:22:23,331
<i>- Sounds like you guys could use some help.
- Son!

2092
02:22:24,525 --> 02:22:25,867
We thought you were gone.

2093
02:22:27,563 --> 02:22:30,600
<i>- How far away are you?
- A lot closer than you think.

2094
02:22:30,670 --> 02:22:33,289
Okay, everyone down, down.
Get down!

2095
02:22:42,100 --> 02:22:44,684
Again!

2096
02:22:44,755 --> 02:22:47,372
<i>You're good to go.

2097
02:22:47,444 --> 02:22:49,002
I wish I could pick you up.

2098
02:22:49,075 --> 02:22:50,868
But along the way,
I rescued some stragglers.

2099
02:22:50,935 --> 02:22:52,111
You gonna be all right?

2100
02:22:52,182 --> 02:22:54,834
Yeah. Moya's on the way.
Thanks for the help.

2101
02:22:54,904 --> 02:22:56,845
I'm proud of you, son.

2102
02:22:56,920 --> 02:22:58,831
It's all genetics, Father.
It's like the Luxan lottery.

2103
02:22:58,902 --> 02:23:01,142
Okay, get outta here.

2104
02:23:01,208 --> 02:23:04,474
<i>I'll see you weightless.

2105
02:23:04,541 --> 02:23:08,117
Y'all be careful out there.
That means you.

2106
02:23:11,198 --> 02:23:13,052
Let's move.

2107
02:23:13,117 --> 02:23:15,191
We'll wait for a signal.

2108
02:23:19,585 --> 02:23:21,307
Now you cry?

2109
02:24:01,292 --> 02:24:03,750
I'm fine. Fine.

2110
02:24:20,437 --> 02:24:22,641
At least you die.

2111
02:24:31,932 --> 02:24:35,476
It's a boy... in case
you were wondering.

2112
02:24:51,678 --> 02:24:55,258
We're gonna have to get to the meeting point.

2113
02:25:11,495 --> 02:25:14,595
Can you make it?

2114
02:25:14,666 --> 02:25:16,837
Hurry up!

2115
02:25:18,635 --> 02:25:20,489
D'Argo, hurry up.

2116
02:25:24,395 --> 02:25:27,080
Come on.

2117
02:25:31,278 --> 02:25:36,068
None of that. Someone has to
be here. May as well be me.

2118
02:25:36,143 --> 02:25:39,462
No way. Hey.
We'll fix you up.

2119
02:25:39,538 --> 02:25:42,919
- We have to go.
- You'll be fine.

2120
02:25:42,991 --> 02:25:45,811
- Come on.
- More Scarrans will be here before Moya is.

2121
02:25:45,875 --> 02:25:48,264
I'll stay, you go.

2122
02:25:48,339 --> 02:25:50,761
No!

2123
02:25:50,837 --> 02:25:53,292
Yes. This won't heal.
It won't fix. It won't...

2124
02:25:58,901 --> 02:26:00,695
I'll take your pain.

2125
02:26:00,763 --> 02:26:03,958
No. Pain is good.
Means I'm still alive.

2126
02:26:04,025 --> 02:26:07,768
Then let me help you
to the other side.

2127
02:26:07,834 --> 02:26:11,316
This is the other side.
I was hoping to go back.

2128
02:26:11,390 --> 02:26:12,948
Come on, Rygel.

2129
02:26:15,676 --> 02:26:19,159
Hey, hey.
Come on, let's go.

2130
02:26:19,231 --> 02:26:20,573
- No.
- Let's go!

2131
02:26:20,639 --> 02:26:23,900
Give me some pulse rifles.
Give me some pulse rifles!

2132
02:26:23,967 --> 02:26:25,792
Okay.

2133
02:26:31,492 --> 02:26:34,426
It's gonna get uglier soon.
You better get going.

2134
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:36,607
You're the closest friend
I have.

2135
02:26:36,678 --> 02:26:39,068
You could've done better.

2136
02:26:40,359 --> 02:26:42,661
Nowhere in the universe.

2137
02:26:44,422 --> 02:26:48,737
You got a lot of life
to lead, John.

2138
02:26:48,809 --> 02:26:50,696
Two big things.

2139
02:26:53,194 --> 02:26:56,513
Do me a favor?

2140
02:26:56,587 --> 02:26:57,866
Name it.

2141
02:27:01,677 --> 02:27:03,336
I'll look after her.

2142
02:27:03,405 --> 02:27:06,122
I'll take care nothing's
gonna happen to her.

2143
02:27:06,192 --> 02:27:10,187
Go away.
I wanna speak to Chiana.

2144
02:27:14,834 --> 02:27:17,552
I'm gonna miss you.

2145
02:27:17,619 --> 02:27:21,614
Stop it. No laughing.
Don't make him laugh.

2146
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:24,466
Hey.

2147
02:27:28,375 --> 02:27:31,308
Please don't die.

2148
02:27:31,384 --> 02:27:35,130
- We all die.
- No.

2149
02:27:35,195 --> 02:27:37,530
- I love you.
- No, no...

2150
02:27:39,676 --> 02:27:40,788
Take this.

2151
02:27:40,858 --> 02:27:44,440
- Take this, take this.
- I don't want it.

2152
02:27:44,509 --> 02:27:47,959
Take it!

2153
02:27:48,033 --> 02:27:50,746
John.
Take it.

2154
02:27:50,813 --> 02:27:52,604
- Don't leave me.
- I'll find you.

2155
02:27:52,673 --> 02:27:54,361
- I love you.
- I'll find you.

2156
02:27:54,433 --> 02:27:57,367
The first Scarran you see,
you tell him who his daddy is.

2157
02:27:58,368 --> 02:28:00,061
Tell him, D'Argo!

2158
02:28:00,131 --> 02:28:01,536
I'm almost to the surface.

2159
02:28:01,602 --> 02:28:04,922
Moya senses there are still many
Scarran attack ships out there.

2160
02:28:12,070 --> 02:28:13,793
Get ready to jump.

2161
02:28:13,862 --> 02:28:15,422
What?

2162
02:28:15,494 --> 02:28:18,629
It's safer to fall into the web than risk being
scooped up by it.

2163
02:28:18,695 --> 02:28:20,070
- Give me the baby.
- No.

2164
02:28:20,137 --> 02:28:22,985
I'll be hovering.
I won't fall.

2165
02:28:23,051 --> 02:28:25,570
He's safer with me.

2166
02:28:41,424 --> 02:28:42,833
I'm your daddy!

2167
02:28:52,949 --> 02:28:53,897
Let's do it.

2168
02:29:03,831 --> 02:29:05,686
Good luck.

2169
02:29:05,752 --> 02:29:07,545
We'll need it.

2170
02:29:14,552 --> 02:29:16,249
On my count.

2171
02:29:16,316 --> 02:29:20,859
One, two, three... jump!

2172
02:29:33,123 --> 02:29:35,937
<i>- Pilot, have we heard from Jothee yet?
- Safe.

2173
02:29:36,002 --> 02:29:38,874
As is the ship they commandeered
to rescue the other Eidelons.

2174
02:29:38,948 --> 02:29:42,330
How soon can we rendezvous?
We have to get Muoma into play.

2175
02:29:42,404 --> 02:29:44,794
We can't, Commander. We're on opposite
sides of the battle zone.

2176
02:29:44,869 --> 02:29:49,509
<i>I'm doing all I can to keep us
from being destroyed as it is.

2177
02:29:52,074 --> 02:29:54,857
I don't care what you say.
He's got my nose.

2178
02:29:57,386 --> 02:29:59,658
The frellings
killed my D'Argo.

2179
02:29:59,724 --> 02:30:03,947
He wanted you to survive.
You have to keep your wits.

2180
02:30:04,012 --> 02:30:06,381
Come on.

2181
02:30:07,695 --> 02:30:09,580
Even if these three Eidelons on board
are enough,

2182
02:30:09,644 --> 02:30:11,207
- I propose...
- Not now!

2183
02:30:11,277 --> 02:30:14,029
Pilot, have we heard from Staleek
or the grand chancellorette?

2184
02:30:14,096 --> 02:30:15,627
<i>No, Commander.

2185
02:30:17,359 --> 02:30:20,015
How the hell
did this get here?

2186
02:30:21,331 --> 02:30:25,129
<i>The DRD's built it
to your specifications.

2187
02:30:25,205 --> 02:30:27,410
What changed your mind?

2188
02:30:27,478 --> 02:30:28,493
<i>Not what.

2189
02:30:28,566 --> 02:30:30,027
Who.

2190
02:30:33,397 --> 02:30:35,189
It's operational?

2191
02:30:35,258 --> 02:30:39,316
<i>As far as I can tell.

2192
02:30:39,385 --> 02:30:42,202
This will make
a wormhole weapon, yes?

2193
02:30:42,268 --> 02:30:45,530
I thought this
is what you wanted.

2194
02:30:45,596 --> 02:30:50,714
At the time. Not now.
Not ever really.

2195
02:30:50,781 --> 02:30:52,059
Pilot, can we run?

2196
02:30:52,127 --> 02:30:53,850
We're too damaged to starburst.

2197
02:30:53,917 --> 02:30:56,155
<i>And the Peacekeepers
and Scarrans seem as intent

2198
02:30:56,222 --> 02:30:59,541
<i>on annihilating us
as they are each other.

2199
02:31:02,018 --> 02:31:03,546
Jothee, can you hear me?

2200
02:31:03,619 --> 02:31:06,203
Pretty tight over here.
I can't make it to you.

2201
02:31:06,273 --> 02:31:07,683
Cut loose. Get clear.
You understand me?

2202
02:31:07,749 --> 02:31:09,823
Copy. Everybody safe?

2203
02:31:11,876 --> 02:31:14,461
It's a little crazy around
here for roll call now.

2204
02:31:14,531 --> 02:31:16,324
Just get as far away as you can.
We'll catch up.

2205
02:31:24,684 --> 02:31:28,161
Hey, come here.
Kill the frellings.

2206
02:31:28,234 --> 02:31:30,952
And kill them others too.

2207
02:31:32,077 --> 02:31:35,907
If you can
kill them slowly, do it.

2208
02:31:35,981 --> 02:31:37,030
Back off.

2209
02:31:39,214 --> 02:31:40,458
Keep away!

2210
02:31:40,528 --> 02:31:45,285
D'Argo's dead. Do you think
I frelling care what I do to you?

2211
02:31:45,362 --> 02:31:47,630
Yes.

2212
02:31:47,695 --> 02:31:51,977
D'Argo is dead?

2213
02:31:53,430 --> 02:31:56,877
Yes, Pilot. Saving us.

2214
02:32:14,972 --> 02:32:18,681
Is there another way?

2215
02:32:18,749 --> 02:32:21,401
I don't see one.

2216
02:32:21,471 --> 02:32:24,088
Do you?

2217
02:32:26,017 --> 02:32:29,014
It's worse than you think.

2218
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:34,360
Is it worse than D'Argo
being blown to pieces?

2219
02:32:36,803 --> 02:32:40,546
Is it worse
than our son dying?

2220
02:32:42,886 --> 02:32:46,431
Is it worse
than living with this?

2221
02:33:30,002 --> 02:33:31,120
Come here.

2222
02:33:34,810 --> 02:33:36,214
Closer.

2223
02:33:38,938 --> 02:33:40,910
You wanna see it?

2224
02:33:40,985 --> 02:33:44,501
The thing you've been chasing my
ass all over the universe for?

2225
02:33:44,571 --> 02:33:47,704
Torturing me, my wife,

2226
02:33:47,773 --> 02:33:50,357
my friends for?

2227
02:33:50,425 --> 02:33:53,625
Formidable weapon.
You wanna see it?

2228
02:33:53,693 --> 02:33:55,288
Yes.

2229
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:57,814
- Beg.
- I beg you.

2230
02:33:57,887 --> 02:34:00,443
That's not good enough.
Say please.

2231
02:34:00,515 --> 02:34:01,787
Please.

2232
02:34:01,854 --> 02:34:03,132
- Pretty please.

2233
02:34:03,201 --> 02:34:05,887
- With cherry on top.
- With cherry on top.

2234
02:34:05,955 --> 02:34:10,043
Happy birthday.
Now get outta my sight.

2235
02:34:47,218 --> 02:34:50,065
Behold, the wormhole weapon.

2236
02:34:51,792 --> 02:34:52,690
That?

2237
02:34:52,754 --> 02:34:54,642
Yeah.

2238
02:34:56,116 --> 02:34:58,572
Ain't it beautiful?

2239
02:35:03,703 --> 02:35:05,428
Is this some kind
of joke?

2240
02:35:05,498 --> 02:35:07,470
Cosmic.
Keep watching.

2241
02:35:07,544 --> 02:35:10,030
Blink and
you'll miss it.

2242
02:35:10,105 --> 02:35:14,134
There.
Isn't that sweet?

2243
02:35:16,119 --> 02:35:18,741
Baby's gonna grow.

2244
02:35:18,811 --> 02:35:21,365
Pilot, are my comms open?
It's time for a birth announcement.

2245
02:35:21,435 --> 02:35:23,325
<i>Comms are open, Commander.

2246
02:35:23,391 --> 02:35:26,588
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,
and all ships at sea.

2247
02:35:26,654 --> 02:35:28,664
If you look out your
front window,

2248
02:35:28,735 --> 02:35:32,054
<i>you will see,
by special request,

2249
02:35:32,128 --> 02:35:34,201
<i>your very own
wormhole weapon.

2250
02:35:36,290 --> 02:35:38,046
Crichton, what's happening?

2251
02:35:38,114 --> 02:35:40,504
The end of all this crap.

2252
02:35:40,578 --> 02:35:44,063
Hey, Emperor Sleestak,
you big upright iguana.

2253
02:35:44,137 --> 02:35:46,239
What does it look like
from the Death Star?

2254
02:35:46,310 --> 02:35:49,310
Sir, do you wish
to respond?

2255
02:35:49,383 --> 02:35:53,125
Yes. Increase fire power.

2256
02:35:53,191 --> 02:35:54,372
Increased rate of fire.

2257
02:35:54,441 --> 02:35:56,612
And begin reverse thrust.
Pull us out of here.

2258
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:58,623
Reverse thrust,
one quarter.

2259
02:35:58,696 --> 02:36:02,592
Can I get a huzzah from
the grand Peacekeeper bitch?

2260
02:36:02,667 --> 02:36:04,804
Wormhole at 12:00, Lucy.

2261
02:36:04,878 --> 02:36:06,980
Ignore that hail.

2262
02:36:07,053 --> 02:36:09,706
Continue all guns
against the Decimator.

2263
02:36:09,777 --> 02:36:13,420
That object is beginning to exert
a gravitational pull on us.

2264
02:36:13,485 --> 02:36:16,587
Steady retreat
while continuing to fire.

2265
02:36:25,652 --> 02:36:27,789
Unbelievable.
Nobody has anything to say.

2266
02:36:29,139 --> 02:36:32,492
How big is that thing
gonna get?

2267
02:36:32,564 --> 02:36:33,515
Big.

2268
02:36:38,616 --> 02:36:41,398
Okay, boys and girls,
here are the rules.

2269
02:36:41,463 --> 02:36:44,083
Find a penny, pick it up.
Double it.

2270
02:36:44,153 --> 02:36:46,424
You've got two pennies.
Double it again. Four.

2271
02:36:46,490 --> 02:36:50,484
Double it 27 times,
and you've got a million dollars

2272
02:36:50,554 --> 02:36:52,924
and the IRS all over
your ass.

2273
02:36:52,988 --> 02:36:55,064
Round and round
and round it goes.

2274
02:36:55,135 --> 02:36:56,728
Where it stops, nobody knows.

2275
02:36:56,798 --> 02:37:00,507
But it all adds up... quick.

2276
02:37:00,575 --> 02:37:03,325
What do you mean
we cannot reverse thrust?

2277
02:37:03,392 --> 02:37:06,177
Because it's just
not working.

2278
02:37:14,243 --> 02:37:16,733
We're trapped here, ma'am.

2279
02:37:19,078 --> 02:37:20,451
Pilot, how you doin'?

2280
02:37:20,518 --> 02:37:22,428
<i>Acceptable, Commander.

2281
02:37:22,504 --> 02:37:24,803
Though Moya and I
are beginning to question

2282
02:37:24,873 --> 02:37:26,247
whether it makes any difference.

2283
02:37:26,312 --> 02:37:27,622
We have tried to retreat

2284
02:37:27,687 --> 02:37:29,893
<i>from the wormhole,
but are unable to escape.

2285
02:37:29,961 --> 02:37:31,874
I know.

2286
02:37:31,947 --> 02:37:34,816
Our destinies are no longer
in our own hands.

2287
02:37:44,078 --> 02:37:47,145
Give me my world.

2288
02:37:58,354 --> 02:38:01,971
Cease fire!

2289
02:38:02,036 --> 02:38:06,674
Ma'am, your orders?

2290
02:38:06,741 --> 02:38:11,218
Hold all salvos.
Silence the guns.

2291
02:38:32,128 --> 02:38:34,549
What have you done,
Crichton?

2292
02:38:34,624 --> 02:38:39,098
What did you ask me to do,
Sparky?

2293
02:38:39,170 --> 02:38:43,711
"Crichton, please make the wormhole so we
can all have peace.

2294
02:38:43,780 --> 02:38:46,779
"Crichton, you gotta make the wormhole.
We all want peace!

2295
02:38:46,852 --> 02:38:50,334
"Crichton, make the damn wormhole.
We gotta have peace!"

2296
02:38:50,404 --> 02:38:53,255
How many times
did you say that, Sparky?

2297
02:38:53,321 --> 02:38:57,447
Wormhole. Peace.
Peace. Wormhole.

2298
02:38:57,516 --> 02:39:02,054
How many times, mister, I beg you,
"Please with a cherry on top"?

2299
02:39:06,507 --> 02:39:09,803
I'm sorry.
I tried to explain it.

2300
02:39:09,867 --> 02:39:12,969
I tried to tell them all.

2301
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:16,717
You do what
you have to do.

2302
02:39:19,664 --> 02:39:21,704
Kiss me.

2303
02:39:53,918 --> 02:39:56,763
Here's how it lays out.

2304
02:39:58,752 --> 02:40:01,206
Are you listening, Staleek?

2305
02:40:02,594 --> 02:40:04,501
I am listening.

2306
02:40:06,881 --> 02:40:07,831
Yes.

2307
02:40:09,152 --> 02:40:11,227
Wormhole weapons

2308
02:40:11,298 --> 02:40:14,911
do not make peace.

2309
02:40:14,978 --> 02:40:18,112
Wormhole weapons
don't even make war.

2310
02:40:19,877 --> 02:40:21,853
They make total destruction.

2311
02:40:21,929 --> 02:40:25,222
Annihilation.

2312
02:40:25,287 --> 02:40:27,043
Armageddon.

2313
02:40:28,678 --> 02:40:31,882
People make peace.

2314
02:40:33,834 --> 02:40:34,783
Can you stop it?

2315
02:40:34,856 --> 02:40:37,031
I don't know.

2316
02:40:37,099 --> 02:40:41,771
Maybe.
It eats the whole galaxy.

2317
02:40:41,839 --> 02:40:44,654
Monumental black hole.

2318
02:40:44,718 --> 02:40:48,428
Giant, swirling headstone
marking the spot

2319
02:40:48,493 --> 02:40:50,665
where we all used
to live and play

2320
02:40:50,735 --> 02:40:51,750
and slaughter the innocent.

2321
02:40:51,825 --> 02:40:53,998
This is insane.

2322
02:40:54,068 --> 02:40:56,042
God!

2323
02:40:56,114 --> 02:40:58,568
Four years on
and you're finally getting that.

2324
02:41:04,659 --> 02:41:07,148
You will not go through
with this.

2325
02:41:07,219 --> 02:41:09,644
<i>- I already have!
- I agree.

2326
02:41:09,718 --> 02:41:11,859
You are weak.

2327
02:41:11,927 --> 02:41:15,091
You will not sacrifice
the woman and your offspring.

2328
02:41:15,161 --> 02:41:18,478
Our son will be raised
in peace.

2329
02:41:18,554 --> 02:41:20,660
Amen.

2330
02:41:22,078 --> 02:41:26,585
You hear that, you bastards?
All or nothing.

2331
02:41:29,150 --> 02:41:32,250
Wormhole doubles two more times,
Moya goes first.

2332
02:41:32,317 --> 02:41:35,187
Twenty seconds later,
you join us.

2333
02:41:37,025 --> 02:41:41,336
Either way, this war is over.

2334
02:41:42,881 --> 02:41:44,345
Peace.

2335
02:41:58,376 --> 02:42:02,598
For the sake
of our children,

2336
02:42:04,202 --> 02:42:06,344
I will agree
to a settlement.

2337
02:42:17,293 --> 02:42:23,084
May the spirit of peace
descend on Staleek.

2338
02:42:23,153 --> 02:42:26,982
Save some for me.
I don't know.

2339
02:42:27,058 --> 02:42:30,952
If it is the largest
black hole,

2340
02:42:31,026 --> 02:42:34,448
then it's a death
worthy of a Dominar.

2341
02:42:46,588 --> 02:42:50,134
Peace.
Agreed.

2342
02:42:50,204 --> 02:42:52,091
The Eidelons participate?

2343
02:42:52,154 --> 02:42:54,129
A real peace?

2344
02:42:54,204 --> 02:42:56,377
Agreed.

2345
02:42:56,444 --> 02:42:58,419
Stop this thing.

2346
02:43:46,765 --> 02:43:48,937
Somebody help me!

2347
02:43:50,704 --> 02:43:53,158
Somebody help me!

2348
02:43:54,799 --> 02:43:56,713
Somebody help me!

2349
02:43:56,786 --> 02:44:00,561
Wake up!

2350
02:44:01,589 --> 02:44:04,273
Wake up.

2351
02:44:05,233 --> 02:44:06,991
No!

2352
02:46:02,749 --> 02:46:05,718
Whenever we cross paths,

2353
02:46:05,789 --> 02:46:09,337
I leave the encounter
transformed.

2354
02:46:09,408 --> 02:46:13,116
And no more so
than on this occasion.

2355
02:46:14,628 --> 02:46:19,997
Thanks to you, I have found
my own internal peace.

2356
02:46:34,472 --> 02:46:36,741
Remember me, John.

2357
02:46:48,527 --> 02:46:50,631
Till we meet again.

2358
02:47:14,168 --> 02:47:16,852
Did he suffer?

2359
02:47:16,920 --> 02:47:20,300
Are you kidding?

2360
02:47:20,374 --> 02:47:22,616
They suffered.

2361
02:47:32,926 --> 02:47:35,130
Are you going to Hyneria?

2362
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:50,051
He wanted you to have this.

2363
02:48:14,958 --> 02:48:17,957
I had toyed with
Slim Pickens on the bomb.

2364
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:28,109
But this feels far more
appropriate to the moment.

2365
02:48:28,173 --> 02:48:30,283
Don't you think?

2366
02:48:32,273 --> 02:48:36,432
Now that Einstein has removed
all wormhole weapon knowledge,

2367
02:48:36,498 --> 02:48:38,409
my purpose is fulfilled.

2368
02:48:40,692 --> 02:48:43,759
We've done everything
we can together, John.

2369
02:48:43,829 --> 02:48:45,072
Somehow

2370
02:48:45,142 --> 02:48:49,552
you'll have to make all your
future decisions on your own.

2371
02:48:52,152 --> 02:48:54,968
My eradication program

2372
02:48:55,034 --> 02:48:57,786
has begun to remove
all vestiges of me.

2373
02:48:57,851 --> 02:49:02,457
Soon... I'll be nothing
but a pleasant remembrance...

2374
02:49:04,317 --> 02:49:06,229
of the good old days.

2375
02:49:13,955 --> 02:49:15,578
Good-bye, John.

2376
02:49:17,217 --> 02:49:20,865
Thanks for your memories.

2377
02:49:25,411 --> 02:49:28,315
You did it, John.

2378
02:49:28,390 --> 02:49:30,463
There's no more dying.

2379
02:49:33,513 --> 02:49:36,579
You know, it's strange.

2380
02:49:36,649 --> 02:49:38,984
It almost took me losing
this little one

2381
02:49:39,050 --> 02:49:41,864
to fully understand
motherhood.

2382
02:49:44,298 --> 02:49:46,688
And I love it.

2383
02:49:51,022 --> 02:49:53,573
And all of a sudden

2384
02:49:53,643 --> 02:49:57,772
three is not such
a scary number.

2385
02:50:06,130 --> 02:50:07,790
Here we go.

2386
02:50:13,428 --> 02:50:16,846
But no matter
how wonderful this is,

2387
02:50:20,346 --> 02:50:25,942
I will not accept it
as a trade-off for losing you.

2388
02:51:12,877 --> 02:51:15,080
What are you doing here?

2389
02:51:26,863 --> 02:51:28,938
Did I scare you?

2390
02:51:30,928 --> 02:51:33,068
'Cause you scared me.

2391
02:51:36,243 --> 02:51:39,212
Crichton's don't cry...

2392
02:51:40,788 --> 02:51:43,507
often...

2393
02:51:45,174 --> 02:51:46,964
or for very long.

2394
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:53,232
Where's your mother?

2395
02:52:04,059 --> 02:52:06,452
That's it,
open your eyes.

2396
02:52:09,150 --> 02:52:12,599
You see all these stars?

2397
02:52:12,672 --> 02:52:14,877
They're yours.

2398
02:52:14,943 --> 02:52:16,090
Except that one.

2399
02:52:16,161 --> 02:52:18,549
That one's yours.

2400
02:52:20,514 --> 02:52:22,370
Hi. Let's do this.

2401
02:52:22,437 --> 02:52:24,540
There you go.

2402
02:52:24,610 --> 02:52:27,994
Come here, buddy.
Yep.

2403
02:52:40,328 --> 02:52:42,983
Your father and I

2404
02:52:43,051 --> 02:52:45,921
want you to have the name
that means courage

2405
02:52:45,994 --> 02:52:49,410
and strength.

2406
02:52:52,174 --> 02:52:55,492
So we have chosen

2407
02:53:00,687 --> 02:53:04,619
Little D, we don't know what
life has in store for you,

2408
02:53:04,691 --> 02:53:09,611
but whatever it is,
you'll figure something out.

2409
02:53:11,763 --> 02:53:15,180
But you will never
walk alone.

2410
02:53:15,254 --> 02:53:18,833
And God willing,
you'll never know war.

2411
02:53:21,048 --> 02:53:23,503
Instead...

2412
02:53:23,578 --> 02:53:25,365
Come here.

2413
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:30,582
Your mother was right.

2414
02:53:30,650 --> 02:53:32,855
Your mother is always right.

2415
02:53:32,924 --> 02:53:34,745
Get used to that.

2416
02:53:34,812 --> 02:53:37,717
You ready?

2417
02:53:37,791 --> 02:53:40,758
This is your playground.

2418
02:57:29,389 --> 02:57:31,945
