00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,964
- First time to France?
- Yes.

3
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,626
Purpose of your visit?

4
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,963
- Business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

5
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,940
Do you like this music? No?

6
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,619
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,263
You can put your things over there.

8
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,993
How long are you
planning on staying?

9
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,456
Not very long.

10
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,537
Message for Mr. Smith.

11
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:03,385
- Smith?
- Yes.

12
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:09,783
Smith.

13
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:24,735
He's here.

14
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:55,368
Monsieur, good evening.
Anything to drink?

15
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:57,288
- Water.
- Sparkling or flat?

16
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,746
Flat.

17
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:12,397
- Last one for the road.
- A beer?

18
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:14,470
Oh, yes.

19
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,399
So, how are you, pal?

20
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:20,554
Just a little
pre-takeoff takeoff.

21
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:23,921
Gives new meaning to
"flying the friendly skies."

22
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:27,695
- Can I buy you a drink? A serious drink?
- No, thank you.

23
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,609
- Where are you from? Ah, China.
- Beijing.

24
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,682
My favorite. I love China.

25
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:34,764
I love the food-- Chinese food.
It's the best.

26
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:37,422
Yeah, the way they cut things
in little pieces...

27
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:41,270
so that you don't have to
use all that heavy silverware.

28
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,498
Brilliant invention, the chopstick.
Not like us barbarians.

29
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:47,437
I mean, there we are,
sticking our forks into the food...

30
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,928
and hacking it up
with our knives.

31
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,975
- First time in Paris?
- Yes.

32
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:56,343
Mmm. Great.

33
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,723
Men's toilet, now.

34
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:06,489
You're gonna have
the time of your life.

35
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,376
Hands up, please.

36
00:08:41,463 --> 00:08:43,407
My boss is dying to meet you.

37
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:25,370
Gun, please.

38
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:28,226
You won't need it.
You're safe with us.

39
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:36,571
So, you came all the way from China
to keep an eye on us.

40
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,940
- To help you.
- Yes, of course.

41
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:42,943
To help us,
since we are so incompetent.

42
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:45,121
'Cause after all,
what is our miserable history...

43
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:47,429
compared to yours?

44
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:53,578
Since we have to work together,
I don't want to spend half the day
killing your name.

45
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:56,165
- You got a nickname?
- No.

46
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:59,083
Why don't we give you one.
How about John?

47
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,003
I like that.

48
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,398
Richard.

49
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:07,115
Inspector Richard.

50
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:12,395
Welcome to Paris, Johnny.

51
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:32,084
So, what's on the menu tonight?

52
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,463
They're talking about
the stock market.

53
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,839
What fuckin' time do you call this?
Don't ever keep me waiting.

54
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,947
You got me?
Come on. Let's go.

55
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,404
Ah, there you are.

56
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,445
Smile, girls. Smile.

57
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:07,833
Welcome to gay Paris.

58
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,904
This is a few friends of mine.
This is Veronica, Susan.

59
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:13,015
Say hello.

60
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,917
Yeah, sit, sit.

61
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,581
Hey, cool it.
Hey, fuckin' cool it, all right?

62
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,691
I think we have a situation.

63
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,587
One man, two girls.

64
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,564
- You see them?
- Yes, I do.

65
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,287
Want to go to Heaven?

66
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,236
Want to go to Heaven?

67
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,304
Let's go.

68
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,393
- I'm going up.
- But, boss, the meeting.

69
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:56,390
I flew 12,000 miles for a cocksucker
of a contact. He can wait for me!

70
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:58,601
I don't know if I can do this.

71
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:01,965
Don't worry.
Let Mama run the show.

72
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,201
- Hmm?
- Okay, let's go to Heaven.

73
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:10,060
He's leaving with the two hookers.
What should I do?

74
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:13,642
Come up... and enjoy the show.

75
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,392
- Boss, we didn't check the room.
- One minute.

76
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:35,790
Let's party, big boy.

77
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,699
Come on, baby. Let's have some fun.

78
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:47,989
- I don't feel so good.
- Want a fix?

79
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,257
- No! I told you, I quit.
- More for me.

80
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:21,860
Your meeting's up, guys!
Everybody, out!

81
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:24,226
But, boss, we didn't
finish searching.

82
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:27,294
- Get out!
- Okay, guys, let's get out of here.

83
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,390
I have to go to the bathroom, okay?

84
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:09,069
- Okay. Come back soon.
- Sure.

85
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:17,427
Oh, hey, Johnny. Just in time.

86
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,892
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- It is now. Don't worry.

87
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:23,698
It's all under control.
He'll do his thing, then we'll do ours.

88
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:27,061
- Where's the other girl?
- Prettying up in the bathroom.

89
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:51,000
- You want to go to Heaven?
- Take me to Heaven!

90
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:56,343
I'm going! Yes! Yes!

91
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:59,763
I'm going!

92
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:05,308
No!

93
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:24,836
You mother fucker! Let me up!

94
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:34,846
She stabbed me!
The dumb bitch stabbed me!

95
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,604
Stay calm.

96
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:39,845
Stay calm. Stay calm.

97
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,826
I'm dying.

98
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,687
Stop recording.

99
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,180
- Fuck!
- We need to get him to the hospital.

100
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:00,906
He doesn't wanna go to a hospital.

101
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,464
He wants to go to Heaven.

102
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:12,363
- Why did you kill him?
- The question is, why did you kill him?

103
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:15,054
Richard, look what he did to me!
Help me!

104
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,824
Thanks for the help,Johnny.

105
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,734
I was just in here.

106
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:42,869
I felt a little sick, and then there was
all this screaming and shooting and--

107
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,275
Shut up!

108
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:46,901
There!

109
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:59,319
He's on the fifth floor.
Everyone, down.

110
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,536
He's on the eighth floor.
Everybody, back up!

111
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:07,566
I want him dead!

112
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,315
He's in the laundry room!
Everyone, down!

113
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:43,098
- He's down in the laundry room!
Everybody, down!
- You, down!

114
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,172
But I think--

115
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:49,177
You! And don't think!

116
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:59,839
You and you, go to the next level!

117
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:08,538
You know, the Chinese have the best
roasting methods in the world.

118
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:11,482
I prefer the French one.

119
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:13,760
Give me your lighter.

120
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:17,316
What do they say, Johnny?

121
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:20,961
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

122
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:30,728
- Get 'em out of here!
- Go!

123
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,607
Down, you piece of shit!

124
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:43,404
- You're still with us,Johnny?
- Yes.

125
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:51,050
All right,Johnny. You wanna play?

126
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,973
Give me a green one.

127
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:05,425
No!

128
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:08,459
Oh, shit!

129
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,364
Go!

130
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:28,212
You're dead.

131
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:07,690
Shit!

132
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:40,019
- He's gone.
- I can see that.

133
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:44,061
He-- He got the cassette.

134
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:46,102
So what?

135
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:49,624
They show nothing but a fat degenerate
with some hooker killing him.

136
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:53,692
- Except that--
- What?

137
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:56,096
One-One machine was still running.

138
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:58,138
Fuck!

139
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:02,593
Turn the city inside out.

140
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,595
I don't care! Find it!

141
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,156
- Get the cassette!
- And kill him?

142
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,434
No, bring him to me. I want him alive.

143
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:12,392
I'll kill him myself. Go!

144
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:24,674
Nothing's on one.
We're still looking. Shit.

145
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:10,288
Gare de l'Est.
It's a train station.

146
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:15,575
Take the direction Bibliotheque
until Chatelet. You change.

147
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,766
And you take line number four and--
Yes, yes.

148
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:23,161
Direction Porte de Clignancourt,
and you're right there.

149
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:25,528
Okay? Yes.

150
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,931
Excuse me.

151
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,398
Thank you for coming.

152
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:22,169
In the name of the president, I want
to personally apologize for this mess.

153
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:25,171
I want to stress that we would
not want anything like this...

154
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:29,239
to jeopardize the warm relation
and successful economic ties...

155
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:31,197
shared by our two countries.

156
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,676
So...

157
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:38,939
we have assigned our best man
to supervise this case.

158
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:44,345
He handled the Tehran incident
for us masterfully.

159
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:47,288
There is no one more qualified
to bring this...

160
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:49,567
to a mutually
beneficial conclusion.

161
00:26:49,636 --> 00:26:52,635
- Inspector Richard. Bonjour.
- Sir Minister.

162
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:57,410
This is Minister Tang, our liaison
from the People's Republic of China.

163
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:00,062
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.
- The honor is ours.

164
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:03,489
The minister tells us
you are the best of the best.

165
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:05,894
Well, the minister is too kind.
If that were true,

166
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,262
I might have been able
to avoid this tragedy.

167
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,199
I'm hoping that you might help us
understand what went wrong...

168
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:13,128
so that we can avoid
further bloodshed.

169
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:16,423
And hopefully, bring this matter to
a quick and satisfactory conclusion.

170
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:18,497
If we could be showed the facts.

171
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,742
Yes, of course. Please.

172
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:24,964
Uh, as you know,
as soon as you informed us...

173
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:29,446
of the criminal activities of the gangster
Sung, we set our operation in motion.

174
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:31,939
We identified his heroin
smuggling routes into France.

175
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:35,364
And in the spirit of cooperation,
we graciously accepted your offer...

176
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:40,938
to have one of your people,
Liu Jian, come over...

177
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:44,522
to assist us in Sung's arrest as he
was meeting with his French contact,

178
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:47,759
who unfortunately
we haven't yet identified.

179
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:49,933
Here...

180
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:54,609
he is surveilling Sung as we were
waiting for the contact to arrive.

181
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:58,473
And here, he's observing
along with us.

182
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:02,542
And then, for some reason we still can't
understand, he went completely insane.

183
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,469
Left the room to pee,
and next thing we know...

184
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:08,430
he's knocked out the bodyguards,
killed Sung and the prostitute.

185
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,493
This is the gun
he used to murder Sung.

186
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:16,016
Chinese police issue.
Do you recognize it?

187
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:18,359
- Yes.
- Good.

188
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:21,177
Oh, we have also verified
his fingerprints on the weapon.

189
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,055
Well, please, feel free to verify
our findings with your own people.

190
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:30,974
We assume that your man was
part of the conspiracy--

191
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,855
that he murdered Sung to
keep him from being captured...

192
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,288
and testifying in your courts,
as you had requested.

193
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:38,425
But that is only an assumption.

194
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,415
We are hoping you could give us
some background on him...

195
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,717
which would help us in his capture.

196
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:46,168
Inspector Liu Jian was top in
all his classes at the academy.

197
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:49,921
He received the highest training
in martial arts,
weapons and police tactics.

198
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:53,120
He's been decorated for bravery
in the line of duty six times,

199
00:28:53,188 --> 00:28:56,865
been promoted five times,
and has never lost a case.

200
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:58,789
He has no wife, no children.

201
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:01,025
His only dedication is to his work.

202
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:03,484
He's our best,

203
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,821
which is why this is all so confusing.

204
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,402
Well, you know, sometimes
the best are also the worst.

205
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:12,361
It's really sad.

206
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:16,769
Any surveillance cassettes?

207
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,265
Destroyed as he made his escape.

208
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:22,374
Do you know if he has any relatives
in Paris? Any friends or--

209
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,867
He has no one.

210
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,797
Well, then we should be able
to wrap this up very soon.

211
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:29,859
Excuse me.

212
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,702
I found the emergency phone.

213
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:37,777
Oh, that's good news.

214
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,947
Stay by the phone.
I'll call you back later.

215
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:46,572
Inspector Richard, we are very sorry...

216
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:49,131
that the operation was sabotaged.

217
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:53,231
I will report back to my superiors
and get you any help I can.

218
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,920
- Thank you.
- Let me show you out.

219
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,127
I want them followed.
I want their phones tapped.

220
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:06,935
I want to know every move they make,
every word they speak.

221
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:11,345
There must be a sleeper he's
staying with in Paris. Find him.

222
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:14,490
So, I guess you will be staying...

223
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:16,442
longer than you expected.

224
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:18,995
A little longer.

225
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,850
Paris is a nice city once you get used to it.

226
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,731
And the French are nice people
once you get used to them.

227
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,473
- Are you hungry?
- No.

228
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:43,649
Family recipe. Very tasty.

229
00:30:57,543 --> 00:31:01,373
Fifty men on the street,
and you can't find this son of a bitch?

230
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,328
- Did you try his hotel?
- The fuck never checked in.

231
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:06,465
"The fuck never checked in."

232
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:09,353
That means he has a friend in Paris,
or family. Even better.

233
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:12,736
- Who tried Chinatown?
- Here. But it's hard to be discreet.

234
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:16,423
So put on a wig and a kimono.
I don't care how you do it.
Now, get out. Get out!

235
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:20,268
Get out! I want that little prick
in my office by tonight!

236
00:31:24,654 --> 00:31:26,957
Oh,Jessica, my love.

237
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:28,910
Come to Papa. Come.

238
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:33,836
Richard, I tried.

239
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:36,623
I really tried.
I was only in the bathroom for a minute.

240
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,920
You know, I was getting
ready to do my part--

241
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:42,060
Getting ready to do what it was
that I said that I would--

242
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:44,620
What you wanted-- I really-- I really--

243
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:47,311
I really was ready to do what it was--
what you wanted--

244
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:49,235
Jessica.Jessica.

245
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:52,116
I know you were. I know, I know.

246
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,702
Coming from such a quiet place
as North Dakota,

247
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:56,945
you must have been so scared.

248
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:59,471
- Richard, I tried. I- I--
- I know.

249
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:01,464
- I tried. I really did.
- I know you did.

250
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,002
All that noise.
My poor little farmer's daughter.

251
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,809
Don't be scared.

252
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,739
You're the best girl I have.

253
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:15,321
And you know how I treat my best girl.

254
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,203
I know.

255
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:22,430
So you'll keep your promise?

256
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:26,325
Promise?

257
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,854
Did I make a promise?

258
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,744
Yes-- Yes. You said that
if I did it one more time,

259
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,208
that you would let me--
let me have my daughter back.

260
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:37,602
- You said that you'd help me
get the papers to get her out.
- Did I say that?

261
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:42,560
- Yes.
- Did I say that, Max?

262
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,484
Oh, yes, you did.

263
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:48,381
Well, there you go. Two to one.

264
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:55,010
I guess you're right. So I'll have
to let you go,you and your precious.

265
00:32:58,888 --> 00:33:01,988
Do you realize how much I must trust you
to let you go just like that?

266
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:05,670
With everything you know?
Everything you've seen?

267
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,067
One phone call from you,
one word, and I'd be locked up
for the rest of my life!

268
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:12,361
I'd never do that!
I'd never give you up, ever!

269
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:15,745
I know that. If I didn't
trust you, would I let you go?

270
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:20,294
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. What are you doing, Max?

271
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:23,400
- I'm preparing a fix.
- He's preparing a fix. Do you want a taste?

272
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:25,993
Richard, I told you I quit. You know I quit.

273
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,928
I don't want it anymore! I quit!

274
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:33,842
You don't tell me when
you're gonna quit! I tell you!

275
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:37,322
You don't tell me what you want! I tell you!

276
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:41,202
How long will it take for a fucking junkie
like you to betray me for a lousy fix?

277
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:43,438
I won't betray you! Please, don't!

278
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:47,154
"I won't betray you! Please, don't!"

279
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,004
Put her back to work.

280
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:13,110
Come on. Come on.

281
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:24,313
Get the fuck out. Come on.
Move your fuckin' ass.

282
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:34,751
Get to work, you fuckin' animals!
You cock sucking pigs.

283
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:02,247
Youplaymah-jongg?

284
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:04,290
A little.

285
00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:06,305
I love mah-jongg.

286
00:35:06,378 --> 00:35:08,353
Keeps the mind sharp.

287
00:35:08,428 --> 00:35:11,528
It's hard to find good players around here.

288
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:14,380
That's why I play by myself.

289
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,101
This way, I always win.

290
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,124
This way, I always win.

291
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,300
Bitch!

292
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,856
I'm gone for five minutes,

293
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,988
and you think you can park
your skinny ass in my spot?

294
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:31,181
Fuck off! You want some more?

295
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:37,133
She--

296
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,887
She broke my nose!

297
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:41,844
Come on! Look at you!

298
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:47,732
I haven't been home for 15 years.

299
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:50,701
That's a long time.

300
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,679
- You stupid piece of shit.
- I have seven grandchildren.

301
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:59,503
You are a fucking dog.

302
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:01,465
All right?

303
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,865
Get back to work.

304
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,294
And one big girl 14 years of age.

305
00:36:10,364 --> 00:36:13,115
Almost a woman now.

306
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:15,999
She wants to come to Paris.

307
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:18,933
She goes to university.

308
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:21,047
Hey! Go away! Go away!

309
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,416
- Please.
- You don't know these women.

310
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,263
They say they want to use the bathroom
to pee, and next thing they're shooting up.

311
00:36:27,362 --> 00:36:30,940
She only hurts herself.
Please, don't draw attention.

312
00:37:17,678 --> 00:37:19,851
Excuse me.

313
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,237
- Can I use your toilet?
- No.

314
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:26,446
Oh, please. I just--
I only have to pee. I won't be long.

315
00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:29,298
No!

316
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:32,462
Okay.

317
00:37:35,668 --> 00:37:39,410
Wait!
What are you doing?

318
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:41,747
Well, if you're gonna treat me
like a dog, I'm gonna act like a dog.

319
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:44,532
- I'm gonna pee right here.
- Stop!

320
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,055
Okay.

321
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:50,095
There.

322
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,209
Thank you. Thank you.

323
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:55,411
Thank you so much.

324
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:02,234
- But nothing else.
- I'm not gonna do anything else, I promise.

325
00:38:02,301 --> 00:38:04,211
- Do you wanna check?
- No.

326
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,770
- Just hurry.
- I'm sorry to have to force you to.

327
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:10,619
It's just I have got to go so bad. I really--

328
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:12,988
- I'm only-- I'm only gonna be a minute.
- Okay.

329
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:21,470
I'm Lo, the chef. I came for my order.

330
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:24,572
Oh! That feels so good.

331
00:38:27,523 --> 00:38:30,371
- How many?
- Uh, one, two,

332
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:34,626
uh, three, four--

333
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:38,075
- I owe--
- Don't worry about paying.
Come back later, okay?

334
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,249
Come back later. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:49,731
Miss, you have to finish now.

336
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:52,552
Minute's up.

337
00:38:52,618 --> 00:38:55,171
You have to leave!

338
00:38:55,242 --> 00:38:57,097
Miss?

339
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:02,019
Miss? Please.

340
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,271
Miss?

341
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:25,003
- I slept long?
- Only a minute.

342
00:39:25,074 --> 00:39:26,985
Oh, that's good.

343
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,002
I've gotta get back to work.

344
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:32,175
Every 15 minutes they come by in a
fuckin' car, and if I'm not out there--

345
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,507
It's just that I'm so tired.
They gave me this shot and--

346
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,509
Oh, my God.
Are you gonna finish this?

347
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:42,965
- This is pretty good.
Did you make this yourself?
- Yes.

348
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,998
- Is that what you do, then? You cook, huh?
- No.

349
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:48,472
- But you make these chips, right?
- My uncle does.

350
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:51,256
I love those chips. Do you mind?
I love the pink ones.

351
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,518
My daughter loves the blue ones.
That's her favorite color.

352
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:56,758
Miss, you really have to go now.

353
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:01,020
Delicious. I'm sorry.

354
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:03,190
- It's not every day I get to eat
in a Chinese restaurant.
- Here.

355
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,433
One for you
and one for your daughter.

356
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:09,048
Oh, my God. This is so nice.

357
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,494
You're the first person that's been
kind to me since I've been in Paris.

358
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:16,450
Look, I- I-- I don't like
to take things from people.

359
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:19,098
Usually I like to pay my own way, so...

360
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:22,465
maybe later on, if you wanna, you know--

361
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:27,040
- No charge?
- No. Thank you.

362
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:28,962
I don't have any other way to repay you.

363
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:32,575
- Don't worry.
- I'm not your type. Is that it?

364
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:34,653
I don't have type.

365
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:40,479
Miss?

366
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,039
I'm sorry for hitting you.

367
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,343
That's okay. I'm used to it.

368
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:28,212
Kittana in one hour.

369
00:41:51,546 --> 00:41:53,140
Follow me.

370
00:42:23,556 --> 00:42:25,498
He's on board.

371
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:28,387
Let's go.

372
00:42:44,873 --> 00:42:46,945
Tell me everything.

373
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:51,204
Richard, the cop in charge,
set up the whole thing.

374
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:56,455
- He is the connection.
- Do you have proof?

375
00:42:57,804 --> 00:42:59,661
They recorded everything.

376
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:03,503
They said that, uh,
you destroyed all the cassettes.

377
00:43:03,568 --> 00:43:06,056
Except one.

378
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:10,725
Hand it to me, carefully.

379
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:27,501
The main thing now is to get you
out of the country. I have a car.

380
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:29,713
We can go to the airport,
and from there we can--

381
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:08,791
Shit! He's under the bridge!

382
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:18,561
Get out!

383
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,564
Block the north side!
I'll cover the south!

384
00:47:07,218 --> 00:47:09,105
Go! Go!

385
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:49,644
Will this be a problem?

386
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:52,678
With a billion of them,
do you think they'll miss one or two?

387
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:56,396
The embassy's asking for the release
of his personal effects.

388
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:06,542
Send them a big wreath of flowers...
with my condolences.

389
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,945
How much should I spend?

390
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:11,499
This much.

391
00:49:13,844 --> 00:49:17,227
Here are your assistant's
personal effects, and here...

392
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:20,751
are some photos of your hero
killing another Chinese citizen...

393
00:49:20,856 --> 00:49:23,060
on the French soil.

394
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,650
There's a time for diplomacy
and a time for action.

395
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,072
Diplomacy is dead.

396
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:45,498
- You should go to the hospital.
- Do you have a needle and thread?

397
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:05,983
You know, since I began my work...

398
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:09,086
I have received five of you young men.

399
00:50:09,157 --> 00:50:12,223
Fast, proud-- like you.

400
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:16,222
Four have died--

401
00:50:16,295 --> 00:50:19,557
the last one right in my arms.

402
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,186
Before my time is up here,
I would like to send one home alive.

403
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:32,041
I'll go for some bandages
and disinfectant for you.

404
00:50:41,484 --> 00:50:43,340
Hi.

405
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,409
- Need any help?
- No.

406
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,343
I have some experience.

407
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,614
You know, the longer that
that thing stays open,

408
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:09,808
the more risk there is of infection
setting in, and then you are in for it.

409
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:13,139
I once had a scrape I ignored.
I let it go for a couple days.

410
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,410
- It turned into staph infection.
- All right!

411
00:51:18,135 --> 00:51:20,307
But only to sew it.

412
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:23,474
- Then you must leave. Okay?
- Yeah.

413
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:29,013
Doesn't like me standing outside, huh?
Your uncle.

414
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:32,186
Well, I don't blame him.
If I were him,

415
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:34,520
I wouldn't like me
standing out there either.

416
00:51:34,586 --> 00:51:36,954
Now, this is gonna sting.

417
00:51:40,477 --> 00:51:42,746
Believe me, if I had any other
place to stand, I would.

418
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:45,433
It's just all the good spots
get taken by the others and--

419
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:49,758
You would not believe how much business
some of these girls do.

420
00:51:49,824 --> 00:51:52,191
- Guess how much some of them do in a day.
- I don't know.

421
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:54,941
- Well, guess.
- I can't.

422
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:57,497
- Sure you can. Pick a number.
- Five.

423
00:51:57,603 --> 00:52:00,504
Five? How about 25?

424
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,033
- Twenty-five?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:52:03,139 --> 00:52:06,009
That's the record.
But at least 15.

426
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:08,091
- Can you believe that?
- No.

427
00:52:08,165 --> 00:52:12,868
Yeah. Me? I'm lucky
if I can do five in a week.

428
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:16,383
- You ever been with a hooker?
- No.

429
00:52:16,455 --> 00:52:19,522
- Not even once?
- No.

430
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:22,755
- Are you gay?
- No.

431
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:25,639
That'd be okay if you are. I think
everyone should be who they want to be...

432
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:28,039
- and do it with who they want to do it with.
- I'm not gay!

433
00:52:28,105 --> 00:52:30,954
All I'm saying is, I don't hold
nothin' against nobody that way.

434
00:52:31,018 --> 00:52:33,476
- Are you finished?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,434
There.

436
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:39,555
Mmm. Here you go.
Good as new.

437
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:43,848
Oh, my God. Look at that scar.
Let me see.

438
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:47,629
I'm fine. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

439
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:53,577
You did a very good job.

440
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,560
I used to sew up pigs.
That was my specialty.

441
00:52:55,635 --> 00:53:00,654
Used to have this big, fat mama sow, and
she tore herself along the barb wire when...

442
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:03,179
she was trying to get to the other side
of the fence to get at these apples.

443
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:08,172
- You gonna be around long?
- No. I go home as soon
as my business is over.

444
00:53:08,278 --> 00:53:10,164
Hmm. And so,
what is your business,

445
00:53:10,261 --> 00:53:13,075
- if you don't mind me asking?
- Shrimp.

446
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:15,696
Oh, yeah.
Pretty aggressive shrimp.

447
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:18,702
You should probably be
more careful.

448
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:22,039
- No wife?
- No.

449
00:53:22,106 --> 00:53:23,959
Haven't met the right girl, I bet.

450
00:53:24,024 --> 00:53:26,841
- Right?
- My work-- It's hard to meet any girls.

451
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:30,355
Any interest in an ex-junkie hooker...

452
00:53:30,427 --> 00:53:34,420
who can cook, clean, sew
and who likes Chinese food?

453
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,346
No, thank you.

454
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,748
I'm just kidding.

455
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:40,669
Hey, look.

456
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,063
See? My daughter.

457
00:53:49,568 --> 00:53:53,792
- My angel. Sweet, huh?
- Yes.

458
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:59,708
Why do you do this kind of...job?

459
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,463
Well--

460
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:08,101
There was this guy, and, uh,

461
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:11,426
I met him after I had my baby.

462
00:54:11,494 --> 00:54:14,758
And where I come from, girls without
husbands just do not have babies.

463
00:54:14,824 --> 00:54:16,678
And if they do, well,
it's kinda hard on 'em.

464
00:54:16,743 --> 00:54:19,647
So, anyway, this guy I met--
He's this French guy.

465
00:54:19,721 --> 00:54:22,405
He's really cool
with this great accent...

466
00:54:22,474 --> 00:54:24,959
and always talking about art and books
and movies and everything.

467
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:28,995
And, boy, when you're, you know--

468
00:54:29,068 --> 00:54:31,882
When you're young and really desperate,
you know, this--

469
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,854
And this guy could really--
I mean, he could talk. You know?

470
00:54:38,957 --> 00:54:40,966
And so-- I don't know.

471
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:44,651
The next thing you know,
you're on the street.

472
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:49,070
Why don't you just... quit?

473
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:52,745
It's a little more complicated than that.

474
00:54:52,818 --> 00:54:55,949
What do you mean?

475
00:55:05,431 --> 00:55:08,780
I should probably get back. See you later.

476
00:55:13,879 --> 00:55:15,822
Nice talking to you.

477
00:55:15,928 --> 00:55:19,922
- Lupo!
- Practicing embroidery on the clients?

478
00:55:19,993 --> 00:55:22,896
No, no, he's not--

479
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:25,971
Lupo, he was just--
He had a cut on his arm.

480
00:55:26,043 --> 00:55:29,044
I thought he was gonna call the medics,
and they'd be blocking off the street,

481
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,506
and then the clients couldn't come,
and I couldn't be standing on my spot,

482
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:35,158
and I couldn't make any money for you,
so I thought if I just took five minutes, then--

483
00:55:35,229 --> 00:55:39,965
Shh. Get back to work.

484
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,448
Lupo, he had nothing to do with--

485
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:46,520
I said, get back to work!

486
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:50,686
Excuse me.

487
00:55:55,074 --> 00:55:58,425
I'm really sorry to interfere in your business.

488
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:02,908
But I would really appreciate it...

489
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:06,179
if you...

490
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:09,543
don't do that again.

491
00:56:11,207 --> 00:56:13,029
The little statue speaks.

492
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:16,904
You know, I don't care
if you fuck her, bleed on her.

493
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:20,548
You're still using her time,
and her time is my money.

494
00:56:20,618 --> 00:56:22,506
You've kept her busy for 20 minutes.

495
00:56:22,571 --> 00:56:26,946
- Do you know the going rate for 20 minutes?
- No.

496
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,374
Five hundred francs.

497
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:50,767
Ah! Five for her time, now five for mine.

498
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,557
My kind of client.

499
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:09,809
Lupo, we should get back--

500
00:58:08,872 --> 00:58:10,726
Hello, Max?

501
00:58:41,712 --> 00:58:43,568
Fuck!

502
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,190
What happened?

503
00:59:04,055 --> 00:59:05,943
Down!

504
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:36,830
Fuck!

505
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:02,567
Ah! Damn-- F-- Oh!

506
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:09,062
Oh, God!

507
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:16,106
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

508
01:00:17,642 --> 01:00:20,099
Oh, God. Oh, God.

509
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:22,855
What're we gonna do?
What're we gonna do?

510
01:00:22,925 --> 01:00:25,740
Respect his wishes.

511
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,543
Listen.

512
01:01:35,617 --> 01:01:38,781
The longer you keep information from me
about this psychopath you sent over,

513
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:41,305
the longer my city will bleed
innocent blood.

514
01:01:41,377 --> 01:01:43,550
I assure you, Inspector,
we have kept no information from you.

515
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:46,523
Good.

516
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:56,037
- What're we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

517
01:01:56,102 --> 01:01:58,885
- I can't walk the streets all night.
- Walking helps me think.

518
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:01,701
- Walking hurts my feet.
- Then go home.

519
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:03,939
Oh,just like that.
First you put me in this mess,

520
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:06,181
and then you think
you can just get rid of me.

521
01:02:06,249 --> 01:02:08,105
I put you in this mess?

522
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,374
You were the one
who came to the shop to pee.

523
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:12,713
You were the one
who offered to sew me up.

524
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,984
I didn't ask you for anything!

525
01:02:15,052 --> 01:02:18,086
I only asked to be left alone.

526
01:02:18,156 --> 01:02:21,158
Oh, yeah, that's you--
don't need anything, don't need anybody.

527
01:02:21,261 --> 01:02:23,782
Just have yourself and your stupid job
selling shrimp chips.

528
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,086
I don't sell shrimp chips.

529
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:29,966
Yeah, I figured that out. I mean,
I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid.

530
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:32,454
- I'm a cop.
- I'm Santa Claus.

531
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:34,416
Who is Santa Claus?

532
01:02:34,481 --> 01:02:37,035
A big fat guy, red suit, flying reindeer?

533
01:02:37,106 --> 01:02:39,659
Jesus, God, don't you know anything?

534
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:44,755
Take me here.

535
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,552
Why do you want to go there?

536
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:53,299
The best thing to do. When you lose
your way, you go back to the beginning.

537
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,570
Beginning? Beginning of what?

538
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:57,908
My work. Last night.

539
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,927
You-- You were there last night?

540
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:07,190
Working with the French cop.

541
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:09,747
- Richard?
- You know him?

542
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:12,918
Yeah. I was there too.

543
01:03:12,988 --> 01:03:15,257
The redhead.

544
01:03:16,765 --> 01:03:19,100
Yeah. No, it was a wig. It was--

545
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:22,483
- Come on.
- Wait a minute!

546
01:03:22,558 --> 01:03:25,906
- A second ago you couldn't wait to get rid of me.
- You're my proof.

547
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:28,797
I will take you to the embassy,
and you will tell them everything.

548
01:03:28,864 --> 01:03:32,215
No, no. I'm in deep enough.
I'm not gonna be your witness.

549
01:03:32,321 --> 01:03:34,394
You're the only one who can save me.

550
01:03:34,466 --> 01:03:36,354
Don't you listen?

551
01:03:36,418 --> 01:03:38,621
Richard has my daughter.

552
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,513
But you don't think about that,
do you? No!

553
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:43,166
You don't think about what's gonna
happen to her, what's gonna happen to me.

554
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,505
Of course not! You only think of your job.

555
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,802
That's all that matters to you, because that's
all you've got in your crummy cop's life.

556
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,838
You take Richard down, and it's just
gonna leave a space for another bastard,

557
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,214
one who we pray will be less of
a bastard than the one before him.

558
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,135
And that's reality!

559
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:01,569
Maybe it's not your reality,
but it's my reality every day, 24-7.

560
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:06,081
And there's nothing you or anybody else
can do to change that.

561
01:04:06,154 --> 01:04:08,009
Wait.

562
01:04:08,075 --> 01:04:11,141
If I get your daughter back,
will you help me?

563
01:04:11,211 --> 01:04:15,272
I'm-- I'm-- I'm really screwed this time.

564
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:18,920
My government will protect you.
They will give you safely away.

565
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,838
Away where? To China?

566
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:25,417
I mean, I like the chips, but no, thank you.

567
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:28,454
Listen to me.

568
01:04:28,528 --> 01:04:33,199
I know you've had some bad experiences
trusting people.

569
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:36,136
But if I gave you my word,

570
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:38,348
you will be safe.

571
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:43,473
Yes, Minister.

572
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,907
We're doing all we can, Minister.

573
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:49,836
But we are not magicians who can pull
killers out of hats like they're rabbits,

574
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:53,172
especially one who is trained like this.

575
01:04:53,238 --> 01:04:56,022
I'm just a cop trying to do his job. Yes.

576
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:00,180
I'll call you back.

577
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:03,665
Richard! My God, Richard!
You're not gonna believe this.

578
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:07,931
Try me.

579
01:05:11,068 --> 01:05:13,240
I-- This crazy little Chinese--

580
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:17,238
Lupo picked the perfects pot,
except its melled like shrimps.

581
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,515
And how can I get any clients
when I smell like a shrimp?

582
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:23,894
So anyway, I was trying to work,
and Max and Lupo come along.

583
01:05:23,968 --> 01:05:26,935
They went into the shop,
and the next thing I know,

584
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:30,751
the little fucker goes nuts,
you know, and-and-- I mean--

585
01:05:30,817 --> 01:05:34,267
Max tried to protect me,
and the Chinese guy killed both of them.

586
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,793
I believe you.

587
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,348
And then?

588
01:05:40,452 --> 01:05:42,592
And then he takes me as a hostage.

589
01:05:42,661 --> 01:05:46,491
He made me carry this stuff, and he
dragged me all the way up to that church--

590
01:05:46,566 --> 01:05:48,639
You know, the big church
on the top of the hill?

591
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,621
And then-- You know-- And he made me...

592
01:05:50,694 --> 01:05:54,241
help him do these things-- these weird
things with incense and pajamas.

593
01:05:54,312 --> 01:05:57,990
- And everytime I tried to run--
- He stopped you?

594
01:06:00,555 --> 01:06:02,698
Yeah.

595
01:06:02,698 --> 01:06:02,719
Yeah.

596
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:05,128
You know-- You know those movies...

597
01:06:05,226 --> 01:06:08,163
with that Chinese guy who's always
kicking and screaming all the time and--

598
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,919
- He used kung fu on you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

599
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:14,153
He did. Look.

600
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:18,220
Wow.

601
01:06:21,456 --> 01:06:24,327
And then he made me go to this
restaurant while he ate this goop...

602
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,656
with weird things in it, you know,
like snails and frogs' legs and--

603
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:31,275
That is when you escaped
out of the bathroom window?

604
01:06:31,345 --> 01:06:34,794
- When he fell asleep.
- In the restaurant?

605
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:37,737
He-- Yeah.

606
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:41,076
Richard.

607
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:44,011
Please, don't-- don't do that.

608
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:54,607
Do you think he is still there
in the restaurant?

609
01:06:56,857 --> 01:07:01,910
Well, he drank a whole lot ofbeers.
That's why I came here.

610
01:07:01,978 --> 01:07:04,947
- 'Cause I thought if I helped you--
- What?

611
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,410
I could show you where he is.

612
01:07:07,485 --> 01:07:12,920
- You're not too tired?
- Oh, yeah, for sure.
I could probably sleep for a week.

613
01:07:13,021 --> 01:07:16,120
But, I don't know. I--

614
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:19,869
You want me to come?

615
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,172
I don't know. What do you think?

616
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,748
I think... I should come.

617
01:07:26,816 --> 01:07:29,022
I think you should stay.

618
01:07:30,691 --> 01:07:34,686
Okay. He's-- He's at
the Mandarin in Belville.

619
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:37,146
But-- But I'll do whatever you want,
though. I mean, I just--

620
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,457
I want you to trust me.

621
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:43,586
I trust you.

622
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:45,956
Ow! Wait. Wait.

623
01:07:48,712 --> 01:07:52,541
And if I discover I can't,
I know where to find you.

624
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:01,226
What about my daughter?

625
01:08:02,859 --> 01:08:05,859
She's safe,just like her mother.

626
01:08:05,932 --> 01:08:07,788
Watch her.

627
01:08:37,525 --> 01:08:42,261
So, what's a girl gotta do
to get fed around here?

628
01:08:45,911 --> 01:08:48,400
Okay. Okay.

629
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,517
Wait a minute. What do you think I am,
the village idiot?

630
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:57,172
No. First you go get mysandwich,

631
01:08:57,242 --> 01:08:59,893
and then I give you your dessert.

632
01:10:01,357 --> 01:10:03,942
Hello?

633
01:10:04,011 --> 01:10:05,835
Hello?

634
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,066
- Don't do that!
- You get it?

635
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:12,233
No, I always walk around handcuffed to
a steam pipe with a turtle for company.

636
01:10:12,303 --> 01:10:14,159
So you didn't get it.

637
01:10:14,224 --> 01:10:17,607
Is it just you, or do all cops
lack a basic sense of humor?

638
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:19,820
Now will you help?

639
01:10:19,889 --> 01:10:21,929
Relax your arm.

640
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:25,450
I can't relax it anymore.
Come on, you know about handcuffs.

641
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:29,101
- You sure you got all of them?
- The deal was I get you all the tapes in his office.

642
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:32,237
Are you gonna live up to your end
of the bargain or what?

643
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:35,059
Are you listening? Hello!

644
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,801
- No, no. No needles.
- No needles. No.

645
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,488
- How did you do that?
- Chinese magic.

646
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,732
- Let's go to the embassy.
- No.

647
01:10:47,801 --> 01:10:50,704
- First we get my daughter.
- No, first the embassy, then I get your daughter.

648
01:10:50,778 --> 01:10:54,225
Bullshit. I'm not gonna sit someplace
safe while my kid's life's in danger,

649
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,187
so forget it!

650
01:11:02,461 --> 01:11:04,316
Which way?

651
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:11,672
She escaped?

652
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:14,079
What do you mean she escaped?

653
01:11:15,966 --> 01:11:17,823
How could she escape?

654
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,297
It's here.

655
01:11:37,446 --> 01:11:39,302
See you around.

656
01:11:41,223 --> 01:11:43,646
What is this place?

657
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,663
It's an orphanage.

658
01:11:46,952 --> 01:11:48,169
- Do you mind?

659
01:12:07,087 --> 01:12:09,543
Oh, no.

660
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:11,623
Shit.

661
01:12:13,425 --> 01:12:15,281
Oh, come on.

662
01:12:19,313 --> 01:12:21,703
There it is.
Section "B," bed 13.

663
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:23,634
Okay.

664
01:12:38,711 --> 01:12:41,296
What's wrong?

665
01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:44,566
I don't know. I guess I'm kinda nervous.

666
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:47,667
I mean, I haven't seen her in almost a year.

667
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,746
Then don't make her wait.

668
01:12:49,818 --> 01:12:51,476
Go.

669
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:00,983
- Are you okay?
- I don't think so.

670
01:15:31,623 --> 01:15:33,379
Somebody help me!

671
01:16:15,732 --> 01:16:17,586
Here, sweetie.

672
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:20,968
That's for boys.
Don't you have any Barbies?

673
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,662
All my Barbies are working.

674
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:29,813
I had a turtle,
but your mother took it.

675
01:16:32,696 --> 01:16:34,867
When am I going to see my mommy?

676
01:16:34,936 --> 01:16:36,791
Soon, darling.

677
01:16:37,851 --> 01:16:40,600
Very soon.

678
01:16:42,651 --> 01:16:45,270
My daughter?

679
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:48,090
Calm down. Everything's gonna be okay.

680
01:16:48,157 --> 01:16:50,099
But he has my daughter.

681
01:16:50,204 --> 01:16:52,408
And we have them.

682
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:55,062
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.

683
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:59,992
No. You don't understand.

684
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:02,235
My life is not some fairy tale.

685
01:17:02,305 --> 01:17:04,639
My life is hell.

686
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:06,679
Richard is the devil,

687
01:17:06,753 --> 01:17:09,471
and he has my daughter,
and he's gonna kill her,

688
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:11,426
and then he's gonna kill me.

689
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:15,168
And then he's gonna find a way
to get out ofit clean.

690
01:17:15,267 --> 01:17:18,563
You're wrong. They will arrest him,

691
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,890
and they'll take care of you and your daughter.

692
01:17:21,957 --> 01:17:24,511
"They"? "They"?

693
01:17:24,582 --> 01:17:28,260
I don't give a shit about them.

694
01:17:28,327 --> 01:17:31,328
I don't trust them.

695
01:17:33,545 --> 01:17:35,785
I trusted you.

696
01:17:37,801 --> 01:17:42,657
For the first time in--
God, I don't know, forever--

697
01:17:42,731 --> 01:17:45,415
I don't know why I trust someone.

698
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:50,377
You promised you'd take care of her.

699
01:17:50,444 --> 01:17:53,479
Yes.

700
01:17:55,566 --> 01:17:59,659
You're tired. I think you should sleep.

701
01:18:35,865 --> 01:18:38,735
- Hello?
- I want the child.

702
01:18:41,403 --> 01:18:43,859
- I want the cassette.
- I gave the cassette to my government.

703
01:18:43,931 --> 01:18:48,341
- They will know what to do with it.
- Bad move,Johnny Boy.

704
01:18:48,446 --> 01:18:50,935
Now that the kid has no value,

705
01:18:51,038 --> 01:18:53,526
what am I going to do with her?

706
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:55,998
She's too young to work.

707
01:18:56,063 --> 01:18:58,431
Maybe not.

708
01:18:58,496 --> 01:19:02,653
- What do you think?
- I think you should come to the window.

709
01:19:12,388 --> 01:19:16,130
Now I know where you are. I'm coming up.

710
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:24,513
He's coming up.

711
01:19:30,376 --> 01:19:32,712
Hey, monsieur--

712
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:39,657
Sound the alert!

713
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:31,408
Fight!

714
01:21:36,268 --> 01:21:39,302
Come on! Come on! Get those out!

715
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:41,893
Move it!Move it! This is not a drill!

716
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:43,787
Go now!

717
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:15,361
Ah,Johnny,Johnny,
I'm disappointed in you.

718
01:25:15,432 --> 01:25:19,524
Coming to Paris for the first time,
and instead of enjoying yourself,

719
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:21,731
you're doing all this useless running around.

720
01:25:21,801 --> 01:25:25,664
- I don't like to get bored.
- Me either.

721
01:25:25,738 --> 01:25:28,806
And right now I'm finding you very boring!

722
01:25:28,908 --> 01:25:30,402
Wait!

723
01:25:32,683 --> 01:25:35,051
You're making a big mistake.

724
01:25:35,116 --> 01:25:37,190
- Ah, really?
- In the second...

725
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:39,303
it takes for you to kill her,

726
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:42,310
I will have all the time I need to kill you.

727
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,856
I got you.

728
01:25:50,929 --> 01:25:52,937
Yes, you did,

729
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:55,345
but I also got you.

730
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:03,794
Isabel?

731
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,065
I'm a friend of your mom.

732
01:26:06,133 --> 01:26:09,363
Can you wait outside?

733
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,536
Okay.

734
01:26:18,906 --> 01:26:20,759
Good-bye, mister.

735
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:32,883
What did you do to me?

736
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:35,641
I put a needle in your neck.

737
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:41,079
- That's it?
- In a certain point, very forbidden.

738
01:26:41,151 --> 01:26:44,087
It's called "The Kiss of the Dragon."

739
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,291
Kiss my ass!

740
01:26:47,361 --> 01:26:50,330
The blood from your whole body
goes to your head.

741
01:26:50,401 --> 01:26:53,850
It stops there, never comes down.

742
01:26:55,107 --> 01:26:58,653
But soon it will come out from your nose,

743
01:26:58,724 --> 01:27:03,548
your ears,
even from your eyes.

744
01:27:03,653 --> 01:27:08,607
And then... you will die, painfully.

745
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,510
You're really a smart guy, Johnny Boy.

746
01:27:13,608 --> 01:27:17,155
My name is notJohnny.

747
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:19,667
- I slept long?
- Only a minute.

748
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:28,700
My daughter?

749
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:37,955
THE END
