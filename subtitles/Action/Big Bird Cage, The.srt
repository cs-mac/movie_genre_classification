00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,530
I'm back.

3
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,760
Kang Dong Suk.

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Aren't you glad to see me?

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,810
You're waiting for
President Cho, right?

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,750
Before he gets here

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,810
you can talk to me first.

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,660
What?

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,220
Didn't you say you'd need
to sell the company?

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,390
President Cho gave me
all authority in this matter.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,580
You can talk to me.

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,390
What nonsense is that?

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,680
Nonsense?

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,660
You don't seem to be in
the position to say that.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,370
I'm your client right now.

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,690
Are you in your right mind?

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,020
Do you seriously think you
can talk to me about business?

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,160
If you fail to sell off the company

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,240
I heard Hyun Sung, even
the headquarters will get hit hard.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Think carefully...

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,770
which one of us has the upper hand.

22
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,990
You want to fight me with
the help of President Cho, huh?

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,350
Scared?

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,890
If I get involved

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,890
it's like selling weapons
to your enemy, huh?

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,500
I'm sorry, but...

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,330
I don't consider you as my enemy.

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,960
You're less than scum
under my toe nails.

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,100
You called that scum under
your toe nails brother, didn't you?

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,920
Since we're here

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,580
let's talk business.

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,970
You're good enough to
be my business partner.

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,430
You're easy to control.

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,630
Oh, hello.

35
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,400
Is everything going alright?

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,490
Yes, everything is going fine.

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,500
You two have met before, right?

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,840
Yes.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,470
According to what I heard

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,580
things went sour between you two.

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,340
But this is business, right?

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,930
It's irrelevant, don't you think?

43
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,740
Yes, I agree.

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,630
Does he want to sell?

45
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,450
He will sell.

46
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,100
He thinks I'm a very
good business partner.

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,440
I understand.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,160
First, come back with
all the conditions met.

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,380
I will take a look and make a decision.

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,310
I heard that we didn't have
to come up with the terms.

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,120
What we're trying to sell
off is not Hyun Sung.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,570
It's only a branch attached
to a giant tree, Hyun Sung.

53
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,150
Of course, you're right.

54
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,810
Just because a tiger is hungry

55
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,030
it shouldn't look down to its babies...

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,980
We will tell you our terms first.

57
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,780
I'd appreciate that.

58
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,430
In a battle for money

59
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,090
you will definitely lose
if your feelings get involved.

60
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,030
That's the reason why
I let them see you.

61
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,520
Good job.

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,540
Get on his nerves.

63
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,950
By the way

64
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,350
what if he decides not
to sell it to us?

65
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,160
He will sell it.

66
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,940
Plus for a dirt cheap price.

67
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,970
From now on, that's what
you and Manager Gu will do.

68
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,750
If this deal goes well

69
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,060
You will become the president
of Hyun Sung Distribution and...

70
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,800
I will be the owner of the company.

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,910
Isn't that what you wanted?

72
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,090
Going back to being
the president again.

73
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,550
Yes sir.

74
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,680
Gosh, he's one persistent man.

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,130
The one you thought you
saw was him after all.

76
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,540
I guess.

77
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,360
What are you going to do to him?

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
What do you mean?

79
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,140
What I mean is...

80
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,730
I want to kill him.

81
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,820
Dong Suk.

82
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,930
I was kidding.

83
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,050
I'm just saying that's
how I feel right now.

84
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,770
What is it?

85
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,700
Gosh, he's one tough man.

86
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,880
What is he doing on the phone?

87
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,140
Okay.

88
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,450
Hey, he's leaving.

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Follow him.

90
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,180
Gosh, you scared me.

91
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,010
Hey.

92
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,790
Who are you guys?

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,700
You asked for me, sir?

94
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,560
Why did I have to see that guy again?

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,160
Pardon?

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,940
I'm asking what happened.

97
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,720
Why did I have to see the
face of Kim Ji Hyuk again?

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,180
Are you saying that
Kim Ji Hyuk is alive?

99
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,490
Damn, this is frustrating.

100
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,850
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

101
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,220
I will say this for the last time.

102
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,860
Kim Ji Hyuk, that bastard has returned.

103
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,850
- Now do you understand?
- I'm sorry.

104
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,720
I will take care of it...

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,600
I told Mi Ra that he left for America.

106
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,480
Now I have to make
another excuse again!

107
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,950
Don't keep embarrassing
me in front of Mi Ra.

108
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,640
Do you know what I'm saying?

109
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,280
Yes, sir.

110
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,070
It won't happen again.

111
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,070
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,220
Why are you working with
such a dangerous man?

113
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,430
When I was at Hyun Sung

114
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,070
it was much more dangerous.

115
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,530
That was crazy...

116
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,530
What's so important
about having a family?

117
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,820
Honestly, it doesn't matter
if something happens to me.

118
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,480
But people around me were hurt.

119
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,940
The only way to make up
for their loss is...

120
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,890
to take from those
bastards and give it back.

121
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,120
One by one...

122
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,970
Shall I be frank with you?

123
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,030
Compared to those guys

124
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,210
you're no better than
a speckle of dust.

125
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,580
Don't be mistaken because
you were once the president.

126
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
The position was given to you by them.

127
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,580
You didn't earn it by yourself.

128
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,330
Now you're back to being
the punk you used to be.

129
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,220
Correct.

130
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm a punk.

131
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,210
But I cannot give up.

132
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,720
This is not a battle for myself, but...

133
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,120
a battle for the people around me.

134
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,660
So I can never give up.

135
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,500
Even if that's the case

136
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,310
this is a meaningless fight.

137
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,230
You will be the only one who will hurt.

138
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,390
I'm more worried about you.

139
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,720
Do you still think Hyun
Sung will protect you?

140
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,330
Hyun Sung will protect
their family only.

141
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,160
All the rest besides themselves...

142
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,550
I think you know better than I do.

143
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,650
Get out of there, please.

144
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,280
What happened?

145
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,050
It's been a while since
you started looking.

146
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,540
You haven't found him yet?

147
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,200
Well, it's just that...

148
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,530
We did find him, but...

149
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,890
<i>I will not do this any more.</i>

150
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,200
I can't do it. I won't do it.

151
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,180
We won't do anything to
Kim Ji Hyuk any more.

152
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,440
Just know that.

153
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,520
Happy?

154
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,830
If you're around that man ever again

155
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,600
what did I say will happen?

156
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,240
I will die.

157
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,040
How will you die?

158
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,670
In great pain.

159
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,850
Good job.

160
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,700
Seal.

161
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,190
He did irritate a powerful person.

162
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,880
Besides, he is now being hated.

163
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,910
There will be more coming after him.

164
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,940
Please take care of him
be his shadow.

165
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,250
Seeing Kang Dong Suk care

166
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,210
he must be worthwhile.

167
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,820
Then to me...

168
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,010
is he the set of black plant or...

169
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,500
a bundle of money?

170
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,930
Hey, wake up.

171
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,960
Wake up now!

172
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,370
- What is it?
- Where is the coffee?

173
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,700
Gosh, coffee is in the
cupboard over there.

174
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,390
Not that instant coffee...

175
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,500
Do you have any brewed coffee?

176
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,010
We don't have that here.

177
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,620
What kind of house doesn't
have proper coffee?

178
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,240
Hey you.

179
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,450
Since you're up, go
clean up the toilet.

180
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,720
It's too dirty to sit on.

181
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,610
What?

182
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,700
This has gotten too much. Hey!

183
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,570
Am I your servant or what?

184
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,630
Where do you think you
are to be playing princess?

185
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,270
How dare you speak to me so rudely?

186
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,270
When you look like a mole, seriously!

187
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,020
Hey, how old are you?

188
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,970
Me?

189
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,150
I'm as old as your fat cheek, why?

190
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,580
Seriously! Man!

191
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,890
Ji Hyuk, can you kick her out?

192
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,280
Who is kicking out whom?

193
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,120
- This is my house.
- What?

194
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,690
You were trying to sell this, right?

195
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,900
I signed the contract with
the landlord directly.

196
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,430
Now you guys are living
here rent free, okay?

197
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,620
You get out!

198
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,040
If you're not going to
listen to me, get out!

199
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,550
I will start with cleaning.

200
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,560
How is it so simple?

201
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,090
I thought Cho Wha Soo was well known.

202
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,930
There are all kinds of
rumors about him, but...

203
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,990
there is only little known about him.

204
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,510
It's known that he used to
be a gang member, but...

205
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,100
it's not confirmed, either.

206
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,840
About his estate, it's all rumors, too.

207
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
But no one knows for
sure how much they are.

208
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,360
Wow, he's one scary man.

209
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,020
Or he might turn out to be some nobody.

210
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
But the most reliable rumor is...

211
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,790
he hates losing his money.

212
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,790
If he suffers a loss

213
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,640
he punishes the one responsible.

214
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,560
How?

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,280
The punishment is quite simple.

216
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,970
The person dies.

217
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,560
I see.

218
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,090
Interesting.

219
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,940
We might not have to get
our hands dirty after all.

220
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,480
Whether it's a building or a company

221
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,220
I've never paid the full price.

222
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,150
You, the previous president of
Hyun Sung Distribution, and...

223
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,680
the main player, Manager Gu

224
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,750
that's why I hired you two.

225
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,420
Insiders know where it's rotting
better than the outsiders.

226
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,950
Take out the rotten area.

227
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,070
Take it out and bring it to me.

228
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,870
I will do the rest.

229
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,990
I understand.

230
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,410
Be careful.

231
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,620
Don't make me suffer a loss.

232
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,870
Didn't you say you
sent him off overseas?

233
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,030
Not overseas...

234
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,360
It's not important.
What matters now is...

235
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,570
Cho Wha Soo is working with him.

236
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,240
What?

237
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,350
Are you saying he won't
buy Hyun Sung distribution?

238
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,840
We don't have to make that
much of an effort yet.

239
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,700
Man, Hyun Sung Energy is bottoming out!

240
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,010
Banks are asking for
the loan back early.

241
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,270
The core of Hyun Sung is shaking, man.

242
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,060
I will talk to Dae Sam again.

243
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,900
Will that work?

244
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,770
Jin Ah blew it all off.

245
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,980
I am close to Myung Ho, so...

246
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
I will go talk to him personally.

247
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,100
Damn it.

248
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
How did this happen to Hyun Sung?

249
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,050
Now we have to beg Dae Sam
who's smaller than us?

250
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,360
What is Ji Hyuk up to?

251
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,230
You don't have to worry
about him, father.

252
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,740
Hey, don't underestimate him.

253
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,930
He rebuilt the company
you brought down.

254
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,780
He took care of the union matter
and even got Zaroque to join us.

255
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,400
Frankly

256
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,180
for three months, he did 100 times
better than you did for five years.

257
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,670
Then what should we do?

258
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,770
Should I go ask him to
take over the company?

259
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,870
Alright.

260
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,180
It's all my fault.

261
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,950
It was all my fault for having
him involved in the first place.

262
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,530
Don't kill him.

263
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,890
Keep him alive.

264
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,720
Keep him alive and I will
make him live like a bug.

265
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,630
Like a bug...

266
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,420
What do you think a big company
like Hyun Sung is afraid of the most?

267
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,800
- Prosecution?
- Well...

268
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,840
Most people will assume
it's the prosecution.

269
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,110
But...

270
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,700
to a company

271
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,380
they fear the IRS or an audit.

272
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,650
Why?

273
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,250
They can take their money away easily.

274
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,280
If they are afraid, it means
they are guilty of something.

275
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,820
We have to find out
what that something is.

276
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,130
When it's a distribution
company like Hyun Sung

277
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,580
it's the collusion.

278
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
If we can prove Hyun Sung
was involved in collusion

279
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,030
we can definitely grab
hold of their lifeline.

280
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,030
You still have it, Manager Gu.

281
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,730
- That's what we need to do.
- Yep.

282
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,560
By the way, what is a collusion?

283
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,530
Collusion?

284
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,050
According to Fair Trade Act

285
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,260
between companies

286
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,890
What it means is that...

287
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,750
in a village

288
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,320
if there are ten stores that sell Ramen

289
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,000
they all charge 100 won for one.

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
One day, suddenly...

291
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,560
The store owners get together.

292
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,070
They decided to charge
200 won for one Ramen.

293
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,430
Now people in the village
have to pay 200 won.

294
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,540
But it was originally 100 won.

295
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,780
It's bad, right?

296
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,250
Manager Choi.

297
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,040
Please help us this once.

298
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,830
I want to help you out too, but...

299
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,210
I don't know much to help you.

300
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,680
As you already know

301
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,770
As for the person in
charge of collusion

302
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,210
it's only known to people above
directors' level within the company.

303
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,210
When you were with the company

304
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,270
you didn't know, either.

305
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,260
Did you know?

306
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,000
I didn't know either.

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,740
See?

308
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,750
How am I supposed to know
what you didn't even know?

309
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,610
Plus...

310
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,470
what would you do with
that information?

311
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,870
You're trying to bring
down the company?

312
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,630
Hyun Sung Distribution
will be sold soon.

313
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,890
President Kang Dong Suk
already made up his mind too.

314
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,560
If it's sold off to us

315
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,270
we will provide you with
the maximum settlement.

316
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,000
We won't make you regret it.

317
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,210
About the sale it off

318
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,770
it's not a game between kids.

319
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,110
Why would Hyun Sung do that?

320
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,750
Of all people...

321
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,310
would they sell the company to you?

322
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,870
What are you talking about, huh?

323
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,230
When we had a problem
with the union last time

324
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,530
who took care of it when
the heads of the company gave up?

325
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,190
- He did.
- Didn't he?

326
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,710
When the deal with Zaroque
wasn't going well

327
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,340
who got the deal in the end?

328
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,930
He did.

329
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,450
I wasn't going to say this, but...

330
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,360
When you took the bribe last time

331
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
who forgave you?

332
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,390
Who was it?

333
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,730
It was him.

334
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,660
Don't speak rashly.

335
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,980
Manager Choi.

336
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,800
Please help us this once.

337
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,610
If you help us this once

338
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,080
we won't forget what you've done.

339
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,060
I'd really like to help too, but...

340
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,250
I don't have the
information that you need.

341
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,490
I really don't know.

342
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,510
I really know nothing.

343
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,090
I will pay for our drinks and go.

344
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,090
I don't know.

345
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,450
Don't worry about
paying for the drinks.

346
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,630
Just watch your mouth.

347
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,290
He really doesn't seem to know.

348
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,290
What do we do now?

349
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,920
Nothing we can do.

350
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,500
We will have to try
to find it ourselves.

351
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,570
Our terms are quite simple.

352
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,120
If you show us your cash power that's
large enough to buy our company

353
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,930
Do you

354
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,470
have the intention
to sell it to us?

355
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>Of course.</i>

356
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,070
But I would like it if we
could speed up the process.

357
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,110
There is a need for
funds at our headquarters.

358
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,950
Well, I'm not sure.

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,700
Usually, the price tends to go down
when there is an urgency to sell.

360
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,900
First, show us that
you have enough cash.

361
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,000
We have to sell off
our real estate, too.

362
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,320
If there is not a guarantee

363
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
there is no reason not to sell.

364
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,850
I guarantee.

365
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,850
There is no other person to sell it to.

366
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,850
Yes, I understand.

367
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,060
Sooner or later

368
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,520
We will stop by.

369
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,700
Sure, I will expect you.

370
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,600
- Are you done?
- Yes.

371
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,570
Let's go.

372
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,400
There is a place I want to take you.

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,760
Where?

374
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,670
Just follow me.

375
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,490
Why does he suddenly want
to bring a girl over?

376
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,570
Anyway, Dong Suk says he's
bringing over his mate.

377
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,560
Doesn't this feel like a dream?

378
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,990
What if he brings someone weird?

379
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,130
No way.

380
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,390
He's not the kind of person
to make rash decisions.

381
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,290
He will definitely bring someone
who is a good match for him.

382
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,180
I'm home.

383
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,620
Oh, there you are.

384
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,460
How come you came alone?

385
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,300
Hi.

386
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,430
You said you'd bring a
girl you'd like to marry.

387
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,640
I will introduce her to you properly.

388
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,470
This is the woman I'll marry.

389
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,910
Dong Suk.

390
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,830
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,490
You might resist, so I
didn't tell you sooner.

392
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,580
Dong Suk.

393
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,870
What is this about suddenly?

394
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,210
It's not suddenly.

395
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,400
We've been going out for a long time.

396
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,160
We just haven't told you.

397
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,230
It's something you can't talk about.

398
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,220
Then you should've
never talked about it.

399
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,910
No.

400
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,020
I should tell you now.

401
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,630
No!

402
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,000
This is not you...

403
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,410
I will pretend I didn't hear any.

404
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,680
Mi Ra.

405
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,870
In my opinion

406
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,420
Dong Suk was drawn to you temporarily.

407
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,910
He was playing with you.

408
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,520
You can understand that, right?

409
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,310
Instead of my son

410
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,060
I'm sorry, so...

412
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,060
Mother.

413
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
Please just accept it.

414
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
She will be your daughter-in-law.

415
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,110
I will never change my
mind about her ever.

416
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,540
Dong Suk, are you
thinking clearly or not?

417
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,230
You're the one and only
son in our family.

418
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,900
You're the heir to Hyun Sung.

419
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,860
Then you should've brought
the right woman for that.

420
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,780
Father.

421
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,190
Can't you let me do what I want?

422
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,430
We never know when my
heart will stop again.

423
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,670
Are you threatening me now?

424
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,810
- Honey.
- So what?

425
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,470
Since you're sick, we should let
you do whatever you want, huh?

426
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,740
Whether your parents get upset or...

427
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,130
our family gets crushed.

428
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,820
Are you saying you don't care?

429
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,360
Do you know what we went
through to save you?

430
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,230
You did that to save me, right?

431
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,390
So if I die, it becomes
all useless, right?

432
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,140
What?

433
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,740
I will do my work at the company.

434
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,860
I will do it diligently.

435
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,620
Not for you two

436
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,130
I will work hard for myself.

437
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,130
I have to be the best.

438
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,430
Whether it's work or love.

439
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,280
Fine. Do whatever you like.

440
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,440
I will not consider Jin Ah
or you as my children.

441
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,950
Whether you move out of
the house to live with her

442
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,340
do whatever you like.

443
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,190
Instead, do not show
your face ever again.

444
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,920
Damn it!

445
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,960
You don't have to look like
you've done a terrible thing.

446
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,470
It's okay to be brave.

447
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,930
You're like my other heart.

448
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,540
She's a daughter of the driver
who worked at our house.

449
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,940
Of all women, why her?

450
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,070
He's determined to ruin our family.

451
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,280
Let's approve of them.

452
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
What?

453
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,330
Are you crazy?

454
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,330
We have to keep our son safe first.

455
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,840
We shouldn't irritate him.

456
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,650
What if something goes wrong?

457
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,340
Where would we send
him again this time?

458
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,340
China or the Philippines?

459
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,210
Should we send him even to Africa?

460
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,390
Marriage means nothing.

461
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,750
If he gets bored

462
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,890
we can send her away.

463
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,730
Like Ji Hyuk recently...

464
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:40,010
We will dispose of her after using her.

465
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,600
I...

466
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,200
you give me the creep sometimes.

467
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,010
You're scary.

468
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,170
What is this?

469
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,410
It's not much.

470
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,420
It's his security deposit.

471
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,560
This won't be enough at all.

472
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Just take it back.

473
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,950
First, go help the ones
who are desperate.

474
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,490
It will make me feel better at least.

475
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,990
Where are you going to live then?

476
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,550
I never had a place to
live to begin with.

477
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,310
If this is what you want

478
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,550
there is nothing I can do.

479
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,670
How is everybody doing lately?

480
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,790
Don't get me started.

481
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,320
Mr. Song gave up the store and...

482
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,960
has been drinking every day.

483
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,950
Because of the loan
interest, Mrs. Oh...

484
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,660
has been in and out of the bank to beg.

485
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,050
Because of the tuition,
Myung Ran's mom...

486
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,430
she's in tears all the time.

487
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,950
Tell them to wait a little longer.

488
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,310
A little bit.

489
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,630
According to what I heard

490
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,310
A meeting takes place during work
time, not during their lunch time.

491
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,560
So he should be among the
ones who are leaving now.

492
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,920
He's the one.

493
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,470
Pardon?

494
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,360
We should follow that man.

495
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,840
No, he's not the one.

496
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,400
When it comes to a meeting

497
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,330
they are supposed to use the public
transportation to avoid a tail.

498
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,790
So he's not the one.

499
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,850
He's the one.

500
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,850
Who is he?

501
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,070
How can you tell by just looking?

502
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,040
- What took you so long, honey?
- Sorry.

503
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,900
He's having an affair.

504
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,450
He's the one.

505
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,640
Who is he?

506
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,000
The one in the black suit?

507
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,220
He's a car salesman.

508
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,930
He's the one.

509
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,320
Who is he?

510
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,880
Wait a second.

511
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
He's Manager Song from the
purchasing department...

512
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,620
If it's Purchasing department...

513
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,080
It's possible.

514
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,110
I can sense it.

515
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,280
Can't you?

516
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,540
It's definitely him.

517
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,880
You came for massage, huh?

518
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,690
We will give you a special treatment.

519
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,820
Will you take one?

520
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,650
The terms of sale aren't bad.

521
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,580
Just tell me whether
Dae Sam will consider it.

522
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,430
Well, there is no reason not to.

523
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,650
With one condition.

524
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,720
Keep this between us
until the deal goes through.

525
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,180
When the contract is ready, call me.

526
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,440
I will convince my
father in the meantime.

527
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,500
- Sure.
- I will go.

528
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,610
This is driving me crazy.

529
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,890
As far as I know, the secret meeting
takes place only once a month.

530
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,910
If we miss it this time

531
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,400
we will have to wait a month for it.

532
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,740
We have a problem.

533
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,700
In the meantime, Dong Suk...

534
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,650
he will try to sell it
to someone else.

535
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,050
I finally found him.

536
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,050
What?

537
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,800
It's Manager Choi.

538
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,090
Where is he going during his work hour?

539
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,760
Wait.

540
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,010
When we met up with Manager Choi,
actually I felt something.

541
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,670
Manager Gu.

542
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,580
Did he ever buy us drinks before?

543
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,110
He's not someone who
would do that, right?

544
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,730
Now I think about it,
you are right.

545
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,080
But that day, he definitely
said he'd buy us the drinks.

546
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,710
It was because something
was bothering him.

547
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,990
Someone who acts kind
all of a sudden...

548
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,580
is usually in the wrong.

549
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,540
I'm positive this time.

550
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,350
Follow me quietly.

551
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,040
He's from Dae Sam.

552
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,000
He's from Kang Sang Food.

553
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,790
I even know his name.

554
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,300
That's Park Yong Chul at Yi Ban Group.

555
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,070
I think this is it.

556
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,870
Thank you.

557
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,940
Dong Suk has gotten stable now.

558
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,540
Especially gaining his sense
of mental stability...

559
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,850
As his mother, I am
relieved to see that.

560
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,680
It's all thanks to you.

561
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,300
No, I didn't do anything.

562
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,530
But it will be hard.
You know that, right?

563
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,010
Yes, I understand, ma'am.

564
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,320
Mi Ra.

565
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,480
You've been very good to my family.

566
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,110
You will be good to Dong Suk too.

567
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,770
However...

568
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,200
is this marriage a
future you can handle?

569
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,070
Whether this is for you or not

570
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,850
think carefully.

571
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,410
I will.

572
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,850
How much is it?

573
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,360
It's 53,000 won.

574
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,680
Let's eat before we start.

575
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,610
Good job.

576
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,900
Tell your boss that you lost the bowls.

577
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
Be careful.

578
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,080
By the way

579
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,490
What price are you
thinking of at Bum Yang?

580
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,840
We will follow the price
that Hyun Sung decides on.

581
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,430
We'd appreciate it.

582
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,890
It's gotten a lot brighter.

583
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,630
What kind of emergency is this?

584
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,840
It wasn't even that dark.

585
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,680
You just don't understand, do you?

586
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,250
Without this, it's dark here.

587
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,210
I will go.

588
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,760
- Already?
- Why not?

589
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,930
What do you want me to do?

590
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,640
Since you helped me, I
will give you food.

591
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,480
I brought the meat and...

592
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,670
I even bought the rice and the sauce.

593
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,330
I got most of the food here.

594
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,890
What did you really make?

595
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,420
All good?

596
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,930
Do you think I'd do
that for just anyone?

597
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,570
It's your lucky day today.

598
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,830
Man, it's weird.

599
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,020
I always seem to pay for everything.

600
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,880
But every time you take
the credit for it.

601
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,810
The reason is your face.

602
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,530
What?

603
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,850
You are a fat squid
and I'm the princess.

604
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,610
If you want to close the
gap between us and...

605
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,580
try to go out with me

606
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,240
this is not much of an investment.

607
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,890
I never said I'd want
to go out with you.

608
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,650
You're giving up too easily.

609
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,110
Have courage. You can do it.

610
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,420
There will be lots of
mountains to climb.

611
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,970
The only merit you offer is that
you work at a meat restaurant.

612
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,850
But I've decided to give you a chance.

613
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,740
You and I are the only people in here.

614
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
If you let this chance go by

615
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,610
you might regret it for
the rest of your life.

616
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,750
Oh my, I might be drunk.

617
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,130
Oh my, I'm dizzy.

618
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,370
Are you dizzy?

619
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,470
Oh my goodness!

620
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,270
So Hae Ra, what are you doing in here?

621
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,270
Mom.

622
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,230
Hello.

623
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,390
With someone who looks like a thief

624
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,880
what were you doing in here?

625
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
- It's just that...
- And you!

626
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Didn't you say you'd gone
to Australia to study?

627
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,170
Why are you here?

628
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,860
You, come here!

629
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,790
- You lied to your mother?
- I won't do that again.

630
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,460
How long will you live off your mother?

631
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,500
Mom!

632
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,800
I had my reasons.

633
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,540
What reasons?

634
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,910
Why didn't you go to
Australia to study?

635
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,950
What's the reason?

636
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,840
It was because of him over there.

637
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,380
What?

638
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,150
That man talked me into staying here.

639
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,530
I lost all the money because of him.

640
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,190
- You bastard.
- No.

641
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,930
I only bought her meat...

642
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,540
You hit on Hae Ra with meat, huh?

643
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,850
You.

644
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,490
Oh no.

645
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,970
- Ouch!
- You thief!

646
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,310
You stop right there!

647
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,910
No, ma'am.

648
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,050
I'm the victim.

649
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,940
I only bought her things...

650
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,780
You bought her meat?

651
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,780
I only ate meat.

652
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,720
You bastard.

653
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,910
Mi Ra.

654
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,450
I replaced the light bulbs and...

655
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,460
Hae Ra wanted to have
pork belly, so I got her some.

656
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,700
But she walked in and...

657
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,810
Mom.

658
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,010
<i>By the way</i>

659
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,160
<i>What price are you
thinking of at Bum Yang?</i>

660
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,850
<i>We will just follow the
price Hyun Sung decides.</i>

661
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,340
<i>I'd appreciate it.</i>

662
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,550
We got it.

663
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,550
With this, we can throw a
big punch.

664
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,610
Mister.

665
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,270
I won't make victims like you again.

666
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,200
Absolutely not.

667
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,300
What? Wedding?

668
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,010
Oh my, congrats, sister.

669
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,330
You finally made it.

670
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,000
Get back into position.

671
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,900
How dare you?

672
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,820
Did you make that decision
after careful thoughts?

673
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,990
Yes.

674
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,870
You got his parents' approval?

675
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,900
Yes, almost...

676
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,450
Mom, why are you worried?

677
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,530
Now you won't have to drive a bus.

678
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,600
Dong Suk will not let you
drive a bus, will he?

679
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,860
Stay out of it.

680
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,250
If you want

681
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,830
I won't stop you.

682
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,750
You've been good at living on your own.

683
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,810
Considering the fact
that Dong Suk chose you

684
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,940
he doesn't seem like a bad guy.

685
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,080
But, Mi Ra.

686
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
If you marry him

687
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,240
do you think you will
be happier than now?

688
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,380
So now

689
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,310
after selling the buildings
and properties

690
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,770
how much money did we get so far?

691
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,610
So far

692
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,120
we have half of the
money suggested.

693
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,030
We only have that much?

694
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,840
Because we're in hurry,
we have no choice.

695
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,550
If this deal doesn't go through

696
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,810
we will end up losing
about ten billion won.

697
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,230
What do you think?

698
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,840
Isn't this a solid evidence?

699
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,730
If we hand this over to
Fair Trade Commission

700
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,850
they will get charged with
a large penalty.

701
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,130
Then who else will buy such
Hyun Sung Distribution?

702
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,600
Naturally...

703
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,490
Hyun Sung Distribution will come to us.

704
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,360
What do you think?

705
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,890
Who came up with this idea?

706
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,750
Ah, it was obviously him.

707
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,750
- It was all thanks to him.
- Don't do that.

708
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,290
If you submit this

709
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,750
you will be arrested instead.

710
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,240
Pardon?

711
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
For illegal wiretapping.

712
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,720
Without such knowledge

713
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,560
how can you work?

714
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,700
To make this work with Hyun Sung

715
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,000
we have to have someone
in this conversation as our witness.

716
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,620
Did you know that?

717
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,900
That's how it becomes effective.

718
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,240
That sounds right now.

719
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,020
Go get someone as our witness.

720
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,560
I will say this one more time.

721
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,530
Don't make me suffer a loss.

722
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,180
<i>About the life you've
been living until now</i>

723
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,740
you can't erase it all.

724
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,130
It'll make us uncomfortable too.

725
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,650
Perhaps you will be most uncomfortable.

726
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,200
<i>- Lady, what are you doing?
- Sir!</i>

727
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,290
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Lady!

728
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,700
Please, sir.

729
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,210
Let her come in.

730
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,720
Sir.

731
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,150
How can you possibly charge the
deceased with such a ridiculous crime?

732
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,150
My husband would not have done that.

733
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,690
He couldn't possibly have
embezzled the company money.

734
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,320
Do you have evidence that he didn't?

735
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,560
- About that...
- Think carefully.

736
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,180
Driver Song has already passed away.

737
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,790
We can't send him to prison.

738
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,100
But still...

739
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,040
How could you charge him wrongly
when he's already dead?

740
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,910
Ma'am.

741
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,440
You said you have two daughters, right?

742
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,580
Without any recommendation letter

743
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,770
are you sure you can support
them in the future?

744
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,690
Pardon?

745
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,890
Their tuition until college
and living expenses...

746
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,970
Hyun Sung will provide them.

747
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,630
If your daughters want

748
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,260
they can come work at Hyun Sung too.

749
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,310
<i>More than Driver Song who passed away</i>

750
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,150
<i>keeping your daughters safe</i>

751
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,810
<i>isn't that what he
would have wanted too?</i>

752
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,770
Thank you.

753
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,090
Are you asking me to
betray Hyun Sung now?

754
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,280
What betrayal are you talking about?

755
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,920
You deceived us first.

756
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,560
That's true.

757
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,940
I was wrong, but...

758
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,250
this is a separate issue.

759
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,250
If I come forward as a witness

760
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,480
would Hyun Sung leave me alone?

761
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,020
Obviously, I will get fired.

762
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,380
Where else will I get a job?

763
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,210
Would Hyun Sung let me
go on and live my life?

764
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,420
How could you say that
when you know what it's like?

765
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,180
When we buy Hyun Sung

766
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,660
We will definitely give you a good
position within the company.

767
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,600
Sir.

768
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,770
If you do this

769
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,100
will you be able to
take over Hyun Sung?

770
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,210
Don't think so rashly.

771
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,270
I understand where you are coming from.

772
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,490
Can't you just trust us this once?

773
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,320
Between you and me, we had loyalty.

774
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,570
Loyalty?

775
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,260
Because of it

776
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,470
me, my wife, and my kid

777
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,850
what if we have to live on the street?

778
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,420
If you go against a big company

779
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,190
you could ruin your life.

780
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,190
Just go back to living
your previous life.

781
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,460
I'm begging you, Manager Choi.

782
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,150
Please help us this once.

783
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,760
This is the only way to save
everybody and Hyun Sung.

784
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,190
I'm begging you.

785
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,400
No...

786
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,870
Please don't call me again.

787
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,370
I'm going abroad for my
vacation today, anyway.

788
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,200
I won't be able to answer your calls.

789
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,430
Jung Sun.

790
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,350
How did it go?

791
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,630
I gave the president
the contract today.

792
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,590
It sounds like he's signing
the contract with Dae Sam tonight.

793
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,750
Tonight?

794
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,580
Okay, thank you.

795
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,030
She said President Kang will sign
the contract with Dae Sam tonight.

796
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,110
If he signs the contract with Dae Sam

797
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,560
we will lose the deal for good.

798
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,300
Dae Sam is also all about
making money, too.

799
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,830
Including the compensation
for the people at the marketplace

800
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,220
we may have lost it all.

801
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,390
We will have to think
about another method.

802
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,070
Isn't it too late?

803
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,820
You can't say that now.

804
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,360
Cho Wha Soo is a scary man.

805
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,780
He has his own set of laws.

806
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,320
Don't worry about people
at the marketplace right now.

807
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Worry about yourself.

808
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,460
So you can't let this deal fall apart.

809
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,650
I might have a way.

810
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,540
Hi, Manager Gu.

811
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm sorry to ask you such a favor.

812
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,880
We're in a jam now, so...

813
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,670
Did Ji Hyuk ask you to do this?

814
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,980
No, it was my idea.

815
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,120
Since you are on the FB team

816
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,130
I thought you had access
to such information.

817
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,320
What do you think?

818
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,730
I'm not in charge of
that, to begin with.

819
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,020
Even if I know how

820
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,960
I wouldn't want to do that.

821
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,020
It was too much to ask.

822
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,460
Manager Gu.

823
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
It's reckless to fight
against Hyun Sung.

824
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,670
Go stop him.

825
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,280
He will never win.

826
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,810
I also know it's reckless.

827
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,200
But it's not only for him.

828
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,290
You know that.

829
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,400
He's not someone who is
after his own interests.

830
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,070
If Hyun Sung distribution
gets sold off to Dae Sam

831
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,360
who will get hit hardest?

832
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,520
It's the people at the marketplace.

833
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,540
The people at the marketplace
who are like family to Kim Ji Hyuk.

834
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,510
Dae Sam will not
compensate them properly.

835
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:29,480
Then the people will get
kicked out to the street.

836
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,360
<i>One of them already killed himself.</i>

837
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,230
<i>To prevent any further damage</i>

838
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,020
<i>in my opinion</i>

839
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,970
<i>it's right that Kim Ji Hyuk
takes over Hyun Sung Distribution.</i>

840
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,760
Let's go.

841
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,830
- Get ready.
- Yes, sir.

842
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,730
<i>[Someone is hacking
into your computer.]</i>

843
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,320
Stop the elevator.

844
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,250
Why are you in a hurry?

845
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,370
So Mi Ra.

846
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,040
Mi Ra.

847
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:27,120
- Dong Suk.
- Here you are.

848
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,780
I've been looking for you.

849
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,220
Let's go. You need to come with me.

850
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,930
Sir.

851
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,920
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with her.

852
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,430
- If you don't mind...
- I'm in a hurry too.

853
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,040
Sir, it's about...

854
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,360
Talk to her tomorrow.

855
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,360
Let's go, Mi Ra.

856
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,970
Where are you?

857
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,990
You should've told me
about this earlier.

858
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,930
I wanted to see you like
this as soon as possible.

859
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,450
You look so beautiful.

860
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,710
Although I am the one
who made this gown

861
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,080
I had no idea it would be this pretty.

862
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,110
Is it because of her?

863
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,460
It's true.

864
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,840
That's why.

865
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,610
Would you like to see any others?

866
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,850
<i>[Mi Ra, where are you?]</i>

867
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,990
<i>[Mi Ra, we have to get it now.
We don't have time.]</i>

868
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:38,720
<i>[Mi Ra, please.]</i>

869
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,320
I like this gown.

870
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,130
I don't think I should try others on.

871
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,750
What are you talking about?

872
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,510
One gown won't be enough for me.

873
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,600
It's just that...

874
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,440
We will be ready quick.

875
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,680
Please wait a little bit.

876
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Let's go.

877
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,510
- Manager Gu!
- Mi Ra!

878
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,870
Here it is.

879
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,160
Thank you.

880
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,150
Mi Ra, by the way...

881
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,330
Thank you.

882
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,760
What's taking this long?

883
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,840
Wow, it's pretty.

884
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,620
I like this one better.

885
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,710
What took so long?

886
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,960
- What?
- Well, the size didn't fit well.

887
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,870
We had to fix it a little bit. Sorry.

888
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,020
- Would you like to see the back?
- Sure.

889
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,320
Turn to the front.

890
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,860
Would you like to see one more?

891
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,040
What do you think?

892
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,010
Okay.

893
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,360
Let's go on a plane now.

894
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
Shall we take off the jacket?

895
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,830
- Not taking it off?
- Take it off.

896
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,570
Yes, I just came in to gate 12.

897
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,610
Where? K?

898
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,800
- Here!
- I see.

899
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,910
- Where is Manager Choi?
- Over there.

900
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,420
Manager Choi!

901
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,050
Long time no see.

902
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,090
How have you been?

903
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,930
Sorry. There was an
urgent matter at work...

904
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,190
Can we talk to you?

905
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,150
Did you secure the cash now?

906
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,710
Yes.

907
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,650
I can even show it to you now.

908
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,060
I see.

909
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,060
Then I will talk to you
later this afternoon.

910
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,020
As soon as we confirm it,
let's sign the contract.

911
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,130
By the way

912
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,970
about the price for the sale.

913
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,490
We are in such a hurry.

914
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,070
We will meet the reasonable
price you offer.

915
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,360
I understand.

916
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,390
Now it's time to throw
in our last hand.

917
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,790
What do you think?

918
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:39,560
Your wife can go on vacation
all happy if she sees this, right?

919
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,350
How could you?

920
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,460
FB team.

921
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,680
Scary, huh?

922
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,740
This is how things work in a company.

923
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,100
Did you really have to go this far?

924
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,470
Can't you understand why?

925
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,470
So please help us, Manager Choi.

926
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,470
Why would I pull this
dirty trick on you?

927
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,350
What are you doing, sir?

928
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,420
Manager Gu.

929
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,600
When you said you could convince him

930
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,560
you meant blackmailing
him with this trash?

931
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,140
I wouldn't do this
even if I'm a punk.

932
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,350
Go ahead.

933
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,610
Your family is waiting for you.

934
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,090
Have a good trip.

935
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,420
Sorry about your trouble.

936
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,800
- Let's go now.
- Daddy!

937
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,820
Let's go.

938
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,800
Even if we are in a jam

939
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,930
we shouldn't destroy a family.

940
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,170
Families are off-limit.

941
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,470
Now Hyun Sung Distribution
has gone over to Dae Sam.

942
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,020
What about President Cho?

943
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,250
He won't leave us alone.

944
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,920
We will still need to go see him.

945
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,920
I swear!

946
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,600
In my life, the only president is...

947
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,890
President Kim Ji Hyuk.

948
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,500
You're the only one for me.

949
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,230
What do we do now?

950
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,560
Can we trust that?

951
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,850
Excuse me.

952
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,140
Yes, sir.

953
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,010
<i>When will you sign the
contract with us?</i>

954
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,720
What price are you thinking about?

955
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,300
How about four hundred billion won?

956
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,970
Oh my.

957
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,810
There is a big difference
from what we have in mind.

958
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:37,420
I'm sorry, but let's
just forget about this.

959
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,520
I don't think you can
just forget about this.

960
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,680
What do you mean?

961
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,500
<i>In our hands</i>

962
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,020
we have evidence and a witness
about your collusion.

963
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,980
We are thinking about submitting
this to Fair Trade Commission.

964
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,110
Of course, we will share
this with Dae Sam too.

965
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,460
Then...

966
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,400
will Dae Sam try to buy
Hyun Sung Distribution?

967
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,280
<i>They will have to pay the
penalty on top of it.</i>

968
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,500
Do you really need to do that?

969
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,750
I think four hundred billion
won is a fair price.

970
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,690
I understand.

971
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:22,060
I lost.

972
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,360
Okay.

973
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,620
Come by my office with
the contract tomorrow.

974
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,800
I will.

975
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,410
I will see you tomorrow then.

976
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,380
He wants to sign the contract tomorrow.

977
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,570
Good work.

978
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,290
Yes!

979
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,360
Congrats.

980
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,610
Thank you.

981
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,430
I'm sorry.

982
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,820
Let forget about the deal.

983
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,030
Really?

984
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,760
Are you sure you've become
the president of Hyun Sung again?

985
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,310
That's right.

986
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,340
I will become the president
of Hyun Sung Distribution again.

987
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,920
You're sure, right?

988
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,610
If this turns out to be a lie again

989
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,000
you will die in my hands.

990
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,460
Gosh, have you always
been lied to or what?

991
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,600
If I go and sign the contract tomorrow

992
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,800
I will become the president
of Hyun Sung again.

993
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,360
You're the same porcupine I know.

994
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,800
Hooray for porcupine!

995
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,080
I knew that he would
take care of it all.

996
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,080
It really happened.

997
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,320
Thank you all.

998
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,180
You trusted me and waited for me.

999
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,240
Now your struggles are
really over!

1000
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,330
I really feel like that.

1001
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,660
We will have 30% off on
Ddukbokgi and sausage.

1002
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,780
Hey, what are you doing?

1003
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,250
Wow, you made all this?

1004
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,250
I was bored, so I made this.

1005
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,250
- Wow.
- Hey, watch it!

1006
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,490
You won't spit it out?

1007
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,680
Good.

1008
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,640
I didn't mean to spit it out.

1009
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,600
My tongue rejected it.

1010
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,470
What?

1011
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,240
What smells so good in here?

1012
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,210
Ji Hyuk.

1013
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,720
- Wow.
- You're home.

1014
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,460
- What is all this?
- Try.

1015
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,250
I tried so hard...

1016
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,590
- It should be good.
- Really?

1017
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,700
Ji Hyuk...

1018
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,270
Is it good?

1019
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,020
Try this one too.

1020
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,450
Hey.

1021
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,550
What happened to your hands?

1022
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,510
It hurts.

1023
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,910
Hold still.

1024
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,150
All better.

1025
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,980
Don't try to cook again.

1026
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,660
Doesn't this look like a ring?

1027
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,660
What?

1028
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,040
About the witness

1029
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,540
they seemed to have used our
personnel information from FB team.

1030
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,910
What are you talking about?

1031
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,760
So Mi Ra pulled out some private
information on Manager Choi.

1032
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,670
How is it related to this
deal with President Cho?

1033
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,830
He's in charge of our
company's collusion.

1034
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,910
If they blackmailed him with
his private information

1035
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,330
he may be cooperating with them.

1036
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,740
When was that?

1037
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,320
It was the day when I ran
into you at the lobby.

1038
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,190
Turn to the front.

1039
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,020
How are you, sir?

1040
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,570
How are you?

1041
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:17,100
In my opinion

1042
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:23,060
it was a reasonable price for the sale.

1043
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,150
What do we do?

1044
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,930
I can't sell off the
company for this price.

1045
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,990
Why are you doing this?

1046
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:39,120
Does this old man have to
involve a dirty trick?

1047
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,170
Hyun Sung Distribution filed for
chapter 11 earlier today.

1048
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,340
What do you mean?

1049
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,270
I heard that you even sold
all your properties.

1050
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,700
That became useless, huh?

1051
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,030
I even heard that you suffered
a loss in the process.

1052
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:15,350
