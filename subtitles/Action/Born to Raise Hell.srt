1
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:23,276
Bucharest, Romania.

2
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:33,870
The evil exist
in every man,

3
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:37,875
while some may contain it,

4
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,128
as far it's easier to embrass it.

5
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:44,632
By the way.

6
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:46,050
Keep your eyes open.

7
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,220
Stay alert.

8
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,198
Where's your friend Castell?

9
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:08,658
Where's the fucking warrant?

10
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,911
This is my warrant bitch,
you come with me.

11
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,080
Sorry, can't read.

12
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:22,381
Drop your weapons!

13
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:40,359


14
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,525


15
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,528


16
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:20,533
After 9 / 11 the U.S. realize the narcotics were

17
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,995
responsible for financing majority of the terrorist cell.

18
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:27,665
That's why they created the international drug task force.

19
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,129
This task forces were fully funded and overseeing by the U.S. government.

20
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:35,299
They took the top narcotics officers

21
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:38,594
and created an additional team .... agent.

22
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:51,483
Six months ago, my partner was killed.

23
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,903
Now, the headquarters has sent me a replacement.

24
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,282
I will find the men responsible,

25
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,201
and bring them to justice.

26
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,169
What a shock.

27
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,213
Sorry aout not pick it up earlier,
It's just

28
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:14,216
I have been tried to call you since.

29
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:16,593
Really?

30
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:18,721
I don't have a missed call Bobby.

31
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:22,224
Yeah, I have been tried to call you but I mean,

32
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:25,228
As usual the work come before me, right?

33
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:29,566
It's nothing like that, I've been tied up,
I'll be home soon.

34
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,651
All right?

35
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,866
Shit.

36
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:48,670
Thanks.

37
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:58,263
Steve, right?

38
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:00,474
My name is Ronnie.

39
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,477
I am the team leader officer on Bobby task forces.

40
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:05,480

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,981
Where's Bobby?

42
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,067
Just received an order for a record.

43
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,278
He asked me to find there.

44
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:12,654

45
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,072
Hey, put his bags in the lock up.

46
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,532
We ride.

47
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:20,454
This way.

48
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,964
Thank you.

49
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,468
- You want some juice?
- Yes, sure. Thank you.

50
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,183

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,922

58
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,885

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,293
Get Down!

00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:12,831
You got this stuff?

62
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,377
So let's get out of here.

63
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,392
Appropriate.

64
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:39,610
Hey let me see your hands.

65
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:44,782
Hands up. Down!

66
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,713
Man, that hurts!

67
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,262
Put it on.

68
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:06,723
We clear in.

69
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:31,124
Cuff him.

70
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,134
No one else lives here?

71
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,636
- I want a lawyer.
- Just answer.

72
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,931
Sit him down.

73
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:47,892
Check the cabinet.

74
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,733
Why she is not handcuffed?

75
00:11:58,237 --> 00:11:59,613
We got product.

76
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:03,117
Okay, put that shit down,
go to the car and get the test kit.

77
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,127
Hey, there's somebody under the bed.

78
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:14,504
Let me see your hands.

79
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:18,008

80
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:22,471

00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:27,685

82
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:31,606
Turn around,

83
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:35,110
Get back!

84
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,864
Listen to me.
Are you listening?

85
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:41,992
I got this 45 pointing to your brain.

86
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:43,828
You got lof of guns on you rught now.

87
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,332
- Now, put the fucking gun down and everything will be ok.
- What?

88
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:49,209
Motherfucker, I'm speaking in English.

89
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,337
It's simple, put the fucking gun down!

90
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,341
- Put the gun down.
- OK

91
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,930
Cuff him.

92
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,977
Hands.

93
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:12,817
What the fuck is this?

94
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:15,612
You called this room safe?

95
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,157
You d'ont take the covered, you don't look under the bed.

96
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:19,867
If you want to be police for living

97
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,870
You go to be on be careful!

98
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,580
You put everyone's life a risk.

99
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:26,958
What the fuck is wrong with you boy?!

100
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:05,398
You're late.

101
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:09,527
I had a little problem in my neighborhood, I needed to address it.

102
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,530
I thought you were interested ...

103
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,243
in making money.

104
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,365
It's a little short.

105
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:56,703
Midgets are little short.

106
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,498
- Money should never be.
- I get it.

107
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,126
Once I delivered it, you'll get your money.

108
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,936
Damn, look at this.

109
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:21,230


110
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,529
This will work.

111
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,241
I expect to see you in a few days ...

112
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,286
with the rest of my money.

113
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,788
Yes, nice dealing with you too.

114
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,540
Motherfucker.

115
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:53,765
- Have you called us?
- No.

116
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,768
Any advance?

117
00:16:57,603 --> 00:17:00,356
You were right, the bullets are from a 9mm Scorpion.

118
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,858
Focus on, has just pulled up.

119
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,488
We'll check this place down to see if anyone saw or heard something.

120
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:11,534
I think I know the motherfucker.

121
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:35,602
She runs up too much, keep you shut during the flight to London.

122
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:02,923
Hey.

123
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:06,302
Asshole.

124
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:28,201
Just tell the gentleman your name.

125
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,954
Bruce Sony.
Bruce

126
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:36,710
Now Bruce, can I ask you a personnal question,
because you seem like a really smart guy.

127
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:39,797
You wait too long,

128
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:44,719
but if you have something really good for me I may be only half

129
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:47,680
or perhaps something much better.

130
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,182
I like your style.

131
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,935
- Will cut through the branches.
- Do you agree?

132
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,561
I've been in the U.S., I know his style.

133
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:54,521
Really.

134
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,732
Yes, I spent a lot time there, in jail.

135
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,986
I met many Americans, intelligent.

136
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:04,031
No offense, I just want us to understand.

137
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:06,534
If I help, it might help me.

138
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,494
Got something good or not?

139
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,581
Buk want to catch this guy forever.

140
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:16,294
Let sigh office for something.

141
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:19,840
Christian, I'm taking this guy to my desk I'll be with you in a minute.

142
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,510
Tell me when you want to shut him.

143
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:27,598
It seems you're excited.

144
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,144
Listen to me boy.

145
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:33,563
Why you hitting while..?

146
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,233
You're not suppose to hit when I'm holding a man.

147
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:37,818
Take this guy down.

148
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,947
Put him in a piss tank man.

149
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,169
He has the look of sexual repression. Is it french?

150
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:02,386
What do you have?

151
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:06,599
The assault was made by a man named Costel.

152
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,435
He and his men like to make raids on the homes.

153
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:15,734
Pajero usually the young and rich.

154
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,696
When you see something that catches is eye,

155
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:23,576
follows the woman, beats her, rapes her and then killed.

156
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,786
The guy is fucking sick.

157
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:30,708
But this is not all.

158
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:33,753
The guy also use females

159
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:35,297
as mules to London.

160
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:39,510
But when Costel found his man, caught him and killed him.

161
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,265
- Steve?
- Yes?

162
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:45,975
Do me a favor.

163
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:49,312
Take off the handcuffs on this man and give him a coffee.

164
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:51,397
I really need a coffee.

165
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:54,109
Ronnie you get the coffee, I get the cuffs.

166
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,903
No problem.

167
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:58,405
I hope you vomit.

168
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,365
How can we get to this guy?

169
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:02,534
By Russian, a really bad ass.

170
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:05,037
People say he trained with the military.

171
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:07,248
Why Russian special forces?

172
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:10,001
Traffics in drugs and arms, in droves.

173
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,258
Provides all the dust in the market, believe me.

174
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:19,636
Trust is not one of my most spectacular attributes.

175
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,723
If you catch Dimitri, the Russian

176
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,518
Costel will come up.

177
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,235
Would you bring me one of those too?

178
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:36,655
What is the problem? Got the seat stuck to butt?

179
00:21:36,905 --> 00:21:38,782
Look it up yourself, I'm working.

180
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,493
There's good news and bad.

181
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,748
The good news is that will take me to that address.

182
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,668
The bad news is that you do not drink coffee.

183
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:50,128
Come on!

184
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:52,213
But Dimitri knows that I got pinch.

185
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,758
That's why I'm giving you a little bonus.

186
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:22,538
Let's move.

187
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:24,665
Come on, let's go!

188
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:32,882
There you go.

189
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:36,303
- Are you sure there is no problem?
- Yeah I'm sure

190
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,180
You can not play with this guy.

191
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:40,182
You think I like to play?

192
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:42,226
I just try to cover my ass.

193
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:44,729
You better get up Costel.

194
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:47,398
Find the truck and go.

195
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:50,234
- I'm nervous.
- You should be.

196
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:51,736
I have not usually this lucky.

197
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:53,947
Nerves are good, keep you alert.

198
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:56,074
Psychics make it.

199
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,745
You watch to many American movies.

200
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:21,018
Don't worry, we'll be watching you at the park.

201
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:16,434
What?

202
00:25:17,102 --> 00:25:18,603
I need to recharge.

203
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:24,652
How do you get arrested by the Americans yesterday?

204
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:27,488
I was released. The police are fools.

205
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:31,117
Bring a copy of the processing slips, then we'll talk.

206
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:58,397
It was what you asked me, what more do you need?

207
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:01,650
I don't need anything,
you're the one who need something.

208
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:04,987
Look, I'm just trying to do business, trying to stay in the game.

209
00:26:05,404 --> 00:26:07,156
- How much?
- A thousand.

210
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,534
You doubled your business overnight.

211
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:13,246
Not like that,
it's about making up for my losses.

212
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,457
Work hard, sleep less.

213
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,000
Price is going up.

214
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,545
I'm cool with that, I have no choice.

215
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:23,215
You're a trusted man.

216
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,217
Yes, I'm in therapy for that.

217
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,768
We'll have to continue this conversation later.

218
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:35,979
Come see me in two days.

219
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:37,689
That will close the business.

220
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:39,066
I need the shit now.

221
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:41,693
I said, two days.

222
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:48,826
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

223
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:02,758
Frank is walking aways.

224
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:04,593
Let's see if you're lucky.

225
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:07,972
That was why I brought you,
'cause you're so fucking lucky.

226
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:32,040
There are about 4 players in this side.

227
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,960
Shit, looks like they coming this way.

228
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:37,462
Yes, we burned. Do not move.

229
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:43,052
What she doing?

230
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:52,103
I lost it. Where is che?

231
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:56,441
Don't move.

232
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,152
Shit we're burned, you were right.

233
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,912
Come out wherever you are.

234
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:09,497
We know you're in there.

235
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:12,750
Motherfurckers man.

236
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,929
Listen guys, I think you know what we're doing

237
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:28,392
and if you don't get the fuck out of here,
I take you all to the jail.

238
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:30,603
Fuck American police.

239
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:07,435
Let me see your hands,
Give it to me!

240
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:30,877
- We go extra pair to handcuffs.
- Good work.

241
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:33,671
Ronnie we were burned.

242
00:29:35,465 --> 00:29:36,758
Copy that.

243
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,445


244
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,371


245
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:14,799


246
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:21,014


247
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:24,476


248
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,521


249
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:12,987


250
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:15,448


251
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,731
What do you think?"
- Let's do it.

252
00:32:14,888 --> 00:32:16,514
Step out the vehicle.

253
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:24,481
Can I see your license and registration?

254
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:27,568
For what?

255
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:29,487
You're part of an investigation ...

256
00:32:29,654 --> 00:32:31,572
- You're an American?
- Ya

257
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:34,492
Why is my license and registration in any way concerned?

258
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:37,662
Well, as I was about to say before I was so rudely interrupted by
your personnal interest

259
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:42,042
but it is an investigation with the IDTF,

260
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,670
and we need to talk to you.

261
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,633
- Feel free.
- Thank you so much.

262
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,135
Do you mind if I looking at your car?

263
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,596
- No problem.
- Good.

264
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,983
Becare, it's Armani.

265
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,171
He's safe.

266
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,508
Is it yours?

267
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,510
Never seen it.

268
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:32,513
So I guess that you do not have a licensed to carry firearms.

269
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:34,474
I told you, I never seen it.

270
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,559
Ok, cuff him and put it back please.

271
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,275
Watch your head.

272
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:50,742
We're going to look what's the serial number on that.

273
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,164
You're not from this country

274
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:58,542
Why live this way?

275
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,254
You should be chassing terrorists in Afghanistan, not me.

276
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:04,715
I already done that, now I moved here to have fun.

277
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,134
The same as that found at the scene.

278
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:08,469
That what I thought.

279
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,639
Do you want to call the locals?

280
00:34:12,223 --> 00:34:16,353
- You should be careful with your.
- I will.

281
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:20,816
Holly Shit.

282
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,819
This asshole did us good.

283
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:41,797
You know I'll be filling a complaint to your American superiors
about you doing this to me.

284
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,257
Go for it.

285
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:49,472
You Americans, are known for your brutality.

286
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,974
Yeah, but you know, we're proud of it too.

287
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,602
- You want to get rid of the gun charges?
- How?

288
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:58,607
You know, there's this piece of shit named Castello that you're dealing with,

289
00:34:58,774 --> 00:35:00,525
- Is in this damn shit.
- Like what?

290
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:05,906
Oh like home invasion, murdering people for fun,

291
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:09,035
rapping womens before and after there dead

292
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:10,286
it's a nice guy

293
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:13,248
The perfect man to join him.

294
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:14,958
I am a family man.

295
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,462
My wife and my kid are sacred to me.

296
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:24,134
Sound like you should be chasing this gipsy piece of shit
instead of me.

297
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:29,098
You have a problem with this guy

298
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,684
you handled it on your own.

299
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:33,853
I plan to do.

300
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:43,781
I talked the old man ...

301
00:35:44,698 --> 00:35:46,200
about Costel you know.

302
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,161
He got really cold really quick.

303
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,206
Maybe a night in jail will suffer him up and he'll talk.

304
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:56,294
I feel in Siberia are lot of worse than here.

305
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,712
That's right

306
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,297
In the U.S. you see on TV,

307
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:01,133
the Russian that moterfucker is watching you.

308
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,135
Oh Ya? You talking from experience now?

309
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:06,680
It is self-harm to blame,

310
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,393
- A smart move.
- It's going to sue,

311
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:12,395
saw the trick in the book, so what?

312
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,690
He does not want a lawsuit, want us to depart.

313
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,776
What We Do We dropped into Russian?

314
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:21,822
Dimitri going to press, he takes us to Castell.

315
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,618
- There is something I want to say.
- What's that boy?

316
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:27,953
How much you admire me,
How much you want to be like me.

317
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,455
Yes, that too.

318
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:31,666
But more importantly.

319
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:35,253
- I'll be dad in a month.
- Really?

320
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:37,130
I was not expecting.

321
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,300
Relax, I'm not the first that works in one case

322
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:42,094
when his wife is about to give birth.

323
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:45,431
I guess we'll be more careful.

324
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,977
Sorry I'm late, you know how it is.

325
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:52,939
It's ok, you know I love you.

326
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,649
What's going on honey?

327
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:56,818
How did hear about your sister?

328
00:36:56,985 --> 00:36:59,196
Well, the man got the job.

329
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,073
You want a drink?

330
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,366
You want something to drink?

331
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,204
The usual.

332
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:09,749
- Ok, cool.
- Thank you baby, thank you.

333
00:37:19,342 --> 00:37:21,887
Look at that. You still remenber me?

334
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:25,321
Ya I remenber you.

335
00:37:26,364 --> 00:37:28,269
It's kind of amazing how a piece of shit like you can get on the street so fast.

336
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:48,332
Come here.

337
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,709
You see why I hate going to dinner?

338
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:21,994
You get the fuck out!

339
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:24,872
Don't forget whose house is this, bitch!

340
00:38:24,997 --> 00:38:26,790
Don't forget who pays the rent, you fagot.

341
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,043
Asshole.

342
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,795
Unconsciously, I wanted to fail,

343
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:32,880
- I call you later.
- Don't bother.

344
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:50,775
Damn!

345
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,652
Who taught you to drive?!

346
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:54,404
Looks like it was my bike!

347
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,158
That is, come here!

348
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:01,286
Leave the car!

349
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:19,347
He's done.

350
00:39:23,185 --> 00:39:26,480
It is the nature of this business we have some shit.

351
00:39:26,772 --> 00:39:29,275
But we've had enough.

352
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:30,610
It's not going to happen again.

353
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:34,364
It should not happen in the first place!

354
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:37,367
Is this country look like us.

355
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:40,954
They're feeding police information because there have pression.

356
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,875
Not more shit.

357
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:06,065
Well, she didn't screw the jog.

358
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:08,317
Thank you for your health.

359
00:40:09,235 --> 00:40:11,696
His personality has not changed anything.

360
00:40:12,196 --> 00:40:15,074
Just like we planned.

361
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:16,701
Just what I wanted to hear.

362
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:19,746
Let's go!

363
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,758
Come over here.

364
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:46,775
I'm ready to go.

365
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,489
You do not have to worry about.

366
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:54,534
I hate to admit it, but good work.

367
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,454
We need to find information

368
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,290
on women who are taking the drug to London.

369
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,044
What?

370
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,923
Dead people are my life.

371
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,217
Who died now?

372
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,596
An informant of yours, according to the record.

373
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:57,978
Can't remenber his name, a biker style.
You signed im, two days ago.

374
00:41:58,144 --> 00:41:59,145
When he died?

375
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:01,022
About 9, this morning.

376
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:03,525
It looks like a professional job.

377
00:42:03,692 --> 00:42:05,903
Double shot to the head. There were no witnesses.

378
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:07,988
Any idea of the suspect?

379
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:10,825
Yeah I do, the only problem he is in custody.

380
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:13,411
You may not have anything better than that.

381
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,163
No, they don't.

382
00:42:26,884 --> 00:42:28,469
That's the last, have you tryed?

383
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:32,640
No, Adrian didn't make his god damn drug this morning.

384
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:34,684
This son of a bitch is late again.

385
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:38,146
You wrong your kindness for weakness.

386
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:41,149
Now, you're going to start preaching?

387
00:42:41,316 --> 00:42:43,527
We are negotiating with Adrian.

388
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:45,946
Tomorrow we pick up the cash take im out.

389
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:47,990
And we take care of Dimitri.

390
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,992
Come on baby, let's go.

391
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:10,139
Let me do that for you.

392
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:21,860
Listen, when we started I said

393
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:28,242
you understood when I told you I'm a cop,

394
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:32,789
and police must work hard outside the home ...

395
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:39,379
you know, not ideal for a relationship

396
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:41,548
but you seems to be ok with that.

397
00:43:41,715 --> 00:43:43,967
I understand you're passion for the job, sweetheart

398
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:46,553
I just wish that were to put the work before me.

399
00:43:46,762 --> 00:43:49,181
And I do not.

400
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:51,475
I know it's hard, as soon as I finish this case ...

401
00:43:51,726 --> 00:43:54,395
Don't say something we both know is not true.

402
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:57,315
You know I love you.

403
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:00,360
You're right, don't worry about anything.

404
00:44:05,157 --> 00:44:09,453
I did not want to make a scene, I just wanted to apologize.

405
00:44:09,787 --> 00:44:11,873
That's why I love you.

406
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:16,753
- Well, I have something for you.
- You have something for me?

407
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:03,220
Ok guys,
Listen up.

408
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:05,889
The target is located by the university.

409
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:09,602
Caroline Side Boulevard.

410
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:12,730
Today, people will be work up by the locals,

411
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:16,067
indicate tat this place maybe a Stashpad,

412
00:45:16,234 --> 00:45:18,028
probably related to our main target,

413
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:20,489
Costello, who want to catch.

414
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:24,034
One thing we do know that one of their riders, Adrian, will be there today.

415
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:27,538
These are the most recent photos we have of some of his known accomplices.

416
00:45:28,038 --> 00:45:29,915
There is more to the table, if you guys look at

417
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:31,876
But, we don't have one of Adrian yet.

418
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:33,503
Now, hhe one thing that I want you all to remember,

419
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,838
this is a street level case.

420
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:38,008
Which means, even know if we have surveillance

421
00:45:38,258 --> 00:45:39,384
depending on the time of the day

422
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:44,097
this place can be anything from a stashpad to, well a day care center.

423
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:45,808
Anything else boss?

424
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:48,185
I want you guys in uniforms two soldiers back.

425
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:51,647
If we can not break resistance,

426
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:55,735
abort code word is "Eco" Any questions?

427
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:00,240
What can of weapons are we runing into?

428
00:46:00,448 --> 00:46:02,826
We know they have Scorpions 9mm

429
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,330
and several assault rifles in the house.

430
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:07,957
Everybody is good?

431
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:09,834
Are left behind

432
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,044
if we pursue someone.

433
00:46:12,295 --> 00:46:14,380
Let's go get them.

434
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:28,187
Don't play with this thing, pack it up.

435
00:46:29,313 --> 00:46:30,523
Do we have enough ammunition?

436
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:32,608
I have 6 clips for each guys.

437
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,153
- What backup?
- We got a lots.

438
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,034
Listen, I'm going to make you in gard today,

439
00:46:41,243 --> 00:46:43,954
I will put you in the rear.

440
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:46,540
It's better, you got a baby and everything.

441
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:50,503
Are you serious?

442
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,590
Do I look like a fucking comedian, boy?

443
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:52,718
Police!

444
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,968
Come on,
Come on pick up the phone.

445
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:38,309
What the hell does he want?

446
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:42,063
Come on man, take the fucking phone!

447
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,316
Ya.

448
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,152
Costel, police are all over!

449
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:49,530
The guys get me paint down, man!

450
00:49:57,622 --> 00:49:59,749
Back up.

451
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:04,713
Fuck. A Stashpad, now!

452
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,358
Stay down!
Down,

453
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,001
Damn, Costel

454
00:50:40,752 --> 00:50:42,087
Are you still there?!

455
00:50:47,217 --> 00:50:48,469
Drop the gun.

456
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:51,180
Don't move, don't fucking breath, drop the gun.

457
00:50:52,974 --> 00:50:54,225
-Please.

458
00:50:54,392 --> 00:50:56,102
- Come here.
- All right.

459
00:50:58,104 --> 00:51:00,482
Come here.

460
00:51:02,943 --> 00:51:04,361
Cuff him and search him.

461
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,697
Shit.

462
00:51:07,656 --> 00:51:09,700
Suave.

463
00:51:14,247 --> 00:51:15,707
They got Adrian.

464
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:20,670
Turn us around, we going back.

465
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,633
Good job.

466
00:51:27,094 --> 00:51:28,345
Where's Costello?

467
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:31,140
- Find it yourself.
- I'm going to do that.

468
00:51:58,211 --> 00:51:59,170
You get it?

469
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:02,716
Yeah, the vest out there, thanks god.

470
00:52:24,323 --> 00:52:25,824
Dimitri is here.

471
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,803
Can I get something else for you, sir?

472
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:47,765
No, it's fine, thank you.

473
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,683
Mr Costello will be here in a moment.

474
00:52:53,354 --> 00:52:55,231
Look at this place.

475
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:57,400
Do you think that what the police told you is true?

476
00:52:57,901 --> 00:52:59,486
Not my buisness.

477
00:52:59,903 --> 00:53:02,364
At least until I have my money.

478
00:53:05,742 --> 00:53:07,244
Have aSit.

479
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:15,044
I feel like our relationship is fading, man.

480
00:53:15,586 --> 00:53:17,839
We used to do buisness at your apartment

481
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:19,382
then at the park

482
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:21,760
and now you make me the host.

483
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,136
Where is my money?

484
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,806
Well, there's a little problem.

485
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,100
There was a raid on one of my apartments.

486
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:30,561
And this is my problem? Why?

487
00:53:30,728 --> 00:53:32,563
It was your agent friend.

488
00:53:32,855 --> 00:53:35,483
He probaly pick up my deal because I do business with you.

489
00:53:35,775 --> 00:53:39,529
I lost a lot of money, so because of you, I lost 50 thousand.

490
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:56,881
If I don't get all my money back by tomorrow,

491
00:53:57,257 --> 00:53:58,925
you're a dead man.

492
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:01,136
You want to threaten me, in my own place?!

493
00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:19,155
The IDTF agent ...

494
00:54:19,614 --> 00:54:22,242
specifically asked for you,

495
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:25,245
and it was not just about selling drugs.

496
00:54:25,454 --> 00:54:27,831
I know you do, who we fight among ourselves.

497
00:54:28,207 --> 00:54:30,000
The shit he told me,

498
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:33,129
make me sick to my stomach.

499
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:40,470
If I find out that is true,

500
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:44,141
I'll come back and I'll kill you myself.

501
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,332
Later.

502
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:11,587
Later.

503
00:55:57,178 --> 00:56:00,932
The hosts suffered three casualties, will you.

504
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:03,977
Well, I put three rounds.

505
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:07,022
I think I know who shot Adrian.

506
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:08,732
Do you think it Costel?

507
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:11,694
A million percent that he was sure.

508
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:08,112
Stop.

509
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,531
Ok, back up.

510
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:11,615
This is the street.

511
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:20,125
Ok boys, get down.

512
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,600


513
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:28,365
All right, hide the body and grap the keys.

514
00:59:28,615 --> 00:59:32,411
Expected to return. Let's get this done.

515
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:09,600
Get back to the house, now.

516
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:31,999
Wat the fuck you think you can hide from us?!

517
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,960
Where's the old man?!

518
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:46,974
No one told you to kill her yet!

519
01:01:47,182 --> 01:01:48,767
I had to tell us where the money is!

520
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:52,021
Go outside and watch for him, both of you!
I'll handle the kid!

521
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:57,402
Nobody from, close the door behind you!

522
01:03:12,525 --> 01:03:14,527
Surrender.

523
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:01,077
My family!

524
01:04:07,334 --> 01:04:08,961
Stupid gypsy.

525
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:26,104
It's ok, It's ok my boy, I'm here.

526
01:04:27,856 --> 01:04:29,483
Your father is here.

527
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:33,821
Take it.

528
01:04:47,336 --> 01:04:49,421
Will not you die?

529
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,609
Where are you?

530
01:05:08,775 --> 01:05:10,402
Two blocks west, behind the building.

531
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:12,029
You in the corner.

532
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:15,324
Shit.

533
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,659
Are you really that fucking stupid?

534
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,161
Where is Costello and the other man?

535
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,039
I don't know.

536
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:18,226
You smell like fear, bitch.

537
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:29,571
Fuck, bitch!

538
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:39,582
They're fucking dead!

539
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:43,128
Do you want really want to die this way?

540
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:45,797
And for what?!

541
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,182
Do not stay here, go park outside.

542
01:08:14,935 --> 01:08:17,688
This is the address registered.

543
01:08:58,024 --> 01:09:00,318
Looks like somebody already passed through here.

544
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:46,827
Drop the gun!

545
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,151
Damn!

546
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,405
8-25 quarters ahead.

547
01:10:22,782 --> 01:10:24,951
I have code red, officer down.

548
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:27,746
We are in the First Floor club.

549
01:10:27,913 --> 01:10:29,665
I need help and fast.

550
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,670
Make pressure there.

551
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:37,715
Go after the bastard.

552
01:10:37,882 --> 01:10:39,926
I'll be right back, you ear.

553
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:13,128
No way!

554
01:11:37,405 --> 01:11:40,158
Hey, come to the front, right now.

555
01:12:00,638 --> 01:12:01,848
God damn it, man.

556
01:12:24,497 --> 01:12:25,540
Hi boss.

557
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:29,253
I just heard what happened. I'm really sorry.

558
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:32,423
So just you know, Headquarter sent you an investigator,

559
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:35,259
who have questions about what you two are doing in the club.

560
01:12:36,302 --> 01:12:38,971
My superiors are looking for the same answers.

561
01:12:39,263 --> 01:12:40,890
I just wish you had asked for backup.

562
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:42,642
So do I.

563
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:03,498
You have a major crime task force dedicated to justice.

564
01:13:04,124 --> 01:13:06,960
You got all these guys walking around,

565
01:13:07,127 --> 01:13:11,298
this man is no command.

566
01:13:12,591 --> 01:13:15,010
You know, I don't get it.

567
01:13:16,095 --> 01:13:18,848
I'm here to see Robert Samuels.

568
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:29,276
Just wait here.

569
01:13:30,194 --> 01:13:32,738
This guy is not a magician, he's not a commander

570
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:35,700
or a trained soldier, he is not Jesus

571
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:37,952
he's just a fucking gypsy.

572
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:40,121
As these two types.

573
01:13:42,165 --> 01:13:44,167
Chief, Dimitri is here to see you.

574
01:13:46,253 --> 01:13:49,673
If you do not solve this find someone else.

575
01:13:54,595 --> 01:13:56,889
Send him in.

576
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:15,534
What's going on?

577
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,328
I need to talk to you.

578
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:18,955
Sit down.

579
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,543
About what?

580
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:28,590
What about him?

581
01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:31,844
He's responsible for killing my wife.

582
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,055
And from what I heard, your partner,

583
01:14:36,015 --> 01:14:39,018
I think we both want revenge.

584
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,356
- I'm listening.
- I veteran, thou Costel.

585
01:14:43,523 --> 01:14:46,902
And I can take revenge on this man for the death of my wife.

586
01:14:50,155 --> 01:14:51,365
Are you serious?

587
01:14:52,866 --> 01:14:55,953
I shall soon know where you are.

588
01:14:56,412 --> 01:14:57,496
When I do,

589
01:14:57,705 --> 01:14:59,123
I will tell you everything

590
01:14:59,457 --> 01:15:00,959
where he hiding up,

591
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:04,295
where he keep the rest of his cash money and drugs.

592
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:07,048
All I ask, is you turn blind eyes

593
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:10,552
on what I do to this "dada".

594
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,935
This is not the place to have this conversation,

595
01:15:18,978 --> 01:15:21,147
but I understand very well,

596
01:15:21,272 --> 01:15:24,150
even better than you think about the futur may bring.

597
01:15:24,776 --> 01:15:25,902
Do me a favor.

598
01:15:26,987 --> 01:15:29,281
Call me soon.

599
01:15:30,324 --> 01:15:31,867
And let's see what happens.

600
01:15:31,992 --> 01:15:34,578
The call you on your cell in the next 24 hours

601
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:36,914
with the time and the location.

602
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:30,931
Tell me you found this motherfucker.

603
01:16:32,015 --> 01:16:34,602
We found one of his booker and partner.

604
01:16:34,894 --> 01:16:36,937
Is in a complex.

605
01:16:37,355 --> 01:16:39,482
I want you to stand alone this.

606
01:16:40,274 --> 01:16:43,069
It's just me and the agent, understand?

607
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:44,779
Until we have finished.

608
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:47,032
I want you to take my son back home.

609
01:16:47,574 --> 01:16:50,869
This country has taken too much from him.

610
01:17:14,186 --> 01:17:15,479
I have a place.

611
01:17:15,896 --> 01:17:18,900
Come alone tonight, understand?

612
01:18:10,706 --> 01:18:11,748
Are you alone?

613
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,834
I have people close behind,

614
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:16,670
but they'll not interfere with what we do.

615
01:18:16,879 --> 01:18:20,258
Let me tell you something, you're a gangster,

616
01:18:20,758 --> 01:18:23,511
So technically, we really can't be seen together

617
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:26,890
hang around togheter or even doing anything

618
01:18:27,432 --> 01:18:28,975
That's all I'm saying ...

619
01:18:29,768 --> 01:18:32,104
- Keep your words.
- I will

620
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:35,065
My people told me that within the apartment complex.

621
01:18:35,608 --> 01:18:37,443
How many?
4.

622
01:18:37,777 --> 01:18:40,446
If you do not go out in 10 or 15 minutes

623
01:18:40,822 --> 01:18:43,575
happens, it will be all yours.

624
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:49,831
Just remember our deal.

625
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:20,198
What are you doing here?

626
01:19:52,357 --> 01:19:54,818
- You're all right?
- I'm fine

627
01:19:56,237 --> 01:19:57,405
Freeze

628
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,907
Hey, remember our deal.

629
01:21:17,074 --> 01:21:19,702
I'm no trying to kill him, just try to slow him down.

630
01:21:37,388 --> 01:21:38,556
Is in there.
Do what you need to do.

631
01:22:05,877 --> 01:22:07,254
Fuck,
Shit!

632
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:43,710
Direct drive to north on the Dutch street.
Get up there and set a containement.

633
01:23:41,606 --> 01:23:43,483
I hear you breathing.

634
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:17,561
It wasn't me who killed her, it was Costel.

635
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:19,897
Where's Costello?

636
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,444
Shit!

637
01:24:28,865 --> 01:24:30,033
Shit!

638
01:24:30,909 --> 01:24:33,328
Romance in the bar,

639
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,750
Romance Bar, East Side,

640
01:24:38,459 --> 01:24:41,379
is awaiting pickup.

641
01:24:49,763 --> 01:24:52,850
My son told me he shot his mother.

642
01:25:02,652 --> 01:25:09,451
And the one he described to me ... was you.

643
01:25:37,273 --> 01:25:39,692
My guys are close behing, coming fast

644
01:25:40,109 --> 01:25:41,903
you better to leave.

645
01:25:43,321 --> 01:25:44,489
Just go.

646
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:49,244
Romance is in the bar.

647
01:26:17,608 --> 01:26:18,776
Get out of my way.

648
01:26:20,403 --> 01:26:22,321
Keep your eyes open.
Stay alert.

649
01:26:37,588 --> 01:26:38,714
Where is your friend Costel?

650
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:40,466
Where is the fucking warrant?

651
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:42,593
This is my warrant bitch,
you come with me.

652
01:26:43,595 --> 01:26:45,054
I'm sorry, I can't read.

653
01:26:53,564 --> 01:26:54,481
Drop your weapons!

654
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:43,868
Shit!

655
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:31,253
Let's see what you got for.

656
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:15,342
Damn!

657
01:29:32,486 --> 01:29:34,530
That's all you got bitch.

658
01:29:37,992 --> 01:29:41,579
You win, you win.

659
01:30:10,944 --> 01:30:12,863
As a team commander,

660
01:30:13,113 --> 01:30:15,407
the worst thing that can happen is to lose men.

661
01:30:16,325 --> 01:30:17,910
I lost two men,

662
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,163
my partner and now his replacement Steve.

663
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:26,169
Since I came here,

664
01:30:27,337 --> 01:30:29,422
I hope it's all worth it.

665
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,568
Only a brilliant strategist

666
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,738
could beat me in a move.

667
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:55,993
Those can only be the hands of one person.

668
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,459
A man of honor

669
01:31:03,668 --> 01:31:05,211
always keeps his word.

670
01:31:06,296 --> 01:31:07,756
That was the deal.

671
01:31:10,467 --> 01:31:11,969
I was thinking ...

672
01:31:12,135 --> 01:31:13,679
men like us

673
01:31:13,887 --> 01:31:18,434
there are things that are hard to say and listen,

674
01:31:19,101 --> 01:31:24,148
but I have to say I'm sorry for your loss.

675
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,986
I thought it would be really nice

676
01:31:28,153 --> 01:31:32,366
if you take your child to their country,

677
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:37,788
and it would be good for you too.

678
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:40,124
Funny you should say that.

679
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:42,919
It's exactly what I was thinking.

680
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:52,262
- Great minds think alike.
- What is that?

681
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,181
Tickets.

682
01:32:04,609 --> 01:32:07,821
You know you know you are a man of means,

683
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:12,242
this is just a gesture of respect.

684
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:16,872
Neither belong here, my friend.

685
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:21,544
My job is done, now I can go,

686
01:32:21,878 --> 01:32:25,131
find a nice warm place.

687
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:28,134
Take a break.

688
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:31,680
You've been one of the good.
