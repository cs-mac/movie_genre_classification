1
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,960
Over here, hon.

2
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,745
- What's wrong, baby?
- Shh, hold on.

3
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,419
Stacey's down.

4
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,678
Target's loose.
West alley. West alley.

5
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,719
On your knees.
On the ground.

6
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,254
Hands behind your head.

7
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,127
Who are you?

8
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,865
Interpol? CIA? Mossad?

9
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,934
None of the above.
Target acquired.

10
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,569
<i>Do you have the package?</i>

11
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,836
Affirmative.

12
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,272
Dispose of the target.

13
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,410
No! Please.

14
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,246
I have information.

15
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,114
We have what we need.

16
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,716
It's not on there.

17
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,652
What I know, no one knows.

18
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,222
It's a thousand times more valuable

19
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,257
than anything on that drive.

20
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,926
Please. Have mercy.

21
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,333
<i>You were supposed to kill this guy.</i>

22
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,034
What part of that wasn't clear?
You were clear.

23
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,603
It's just that...
It's just what?

24
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,438
Your guys went soft?
Or is it just the one guy?

25
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,940
The new guy, what's his name?
Mercy Callo. Is that a name?

26
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,343
It's a crutch.
He's the one who caught the guy.

27
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,545
Yeah. And then
he didn't follow orders.

28
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,180
We're slipping, John.

29
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,383
Stacey's dead, and now we got this.

30
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,319
I know it's your ass in the
world, but it's my ass in D.C.

31
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,855
And in case you haven't noticed,
it's not going well.

32
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,925
He got us information.
Valuable information.

33
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,760
I'll be the judge of that.

34
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,995
Now, in 30 seconds or less,

35
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,830
tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

36
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,735
Colonel, if this intel is right,
and he is who we think he is,

37
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,270
this is a game changer.

38
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,172
If we could get him and flip him,

39
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,141
it would set the terror business
back decades.

40
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,943
Not to go after him, not to try,

41
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,579
not an option.

42
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,981
Colonel?

43
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,684
<i>I agree.</i>
As do I.

44
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,019
Kyle, can your team be ready
in 48 hours?

45
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,222
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,158
Colonel Harding
will lead this operation.

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,826
Kyle, you'll be support.
Excuse me?

48
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,161
Thank you, colonel.

49
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,762
<i>All right.</i>

50
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,732
This is black ops, not military.

51
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,001
Colonel Harding is black ops.

52
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,670
Yeah, a lifetime ago.
It's not the same out there now.

53
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,505
This came from on high, Kyle.
My hands are tied.

54
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,874
These are my people.
We got this intel.

55
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,277
I know you did.

56
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,126
Kid, I'm sorry.

57
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,396
Mercy!

58
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,965
Yes, sir?

59
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,333
What happened out there?

60
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,402
He just started talking, sir.

61
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,838
They're all gonna talk.
You can't question orders.

62
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,639
I know.

63
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,508
Look, you weren't everybody's
first choice, Callo.

64
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,909
You were mine.
You got it?

65
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,514
All right. New assignment came
in. We head out in the morning.

66
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,649
Captain.

67
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,184
This assignment
have something to do

68
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,886
with the guy's information?

69
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,288
Doesn't mean you were right.

70
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,598
Approximately 24 hours ago,

71
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,667
we received information
that a high value target

72
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,103
had been captured
and was being held

73
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,806
inside a Chechen prison.

74
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,108
But the Chechens are denying it.

75
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,346
The target's name
is Rudolph Martin.

76
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,319
Can I help you?

77
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,921
Yes.

78
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,891
Agent Black,
I asked her to be here.

79
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,660
Natalie, grab a chair and join us.

80
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,495
Of course, sir.

81
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,879
So why are the Chechens
denying they have him?

82
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:31,650
Because they want him
for themselves.

83
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,585
Why?

84
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,555
During the second Chechen War,

85
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,391
Martin was hired by Shamil Baseyev,

86
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,727
the militant separatist leader,
to conduct a series of attacks

87
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,830
on civilian targets inside Moscow.

88
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,965
Martin took their money
but reneged,

89
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,034
never going through with
the attacks. He conned them,

90
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,735
he humiliated them
and stole their money,

91
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,637
and, as a result,
they lost the war.

92
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,040
Many of the old hard-liners

93
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,175
blame Martin for the tide turning.

94
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,845
He is their
public enemy number one.

95
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,083
Our mission is to
infiltrate the prison,

96
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,152
extract Martin, alive,

97
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,387
and bring him back
to the United States.

98
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,690
Any questions?

99
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,394
All right, you're dismissed.

100
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,000
Let me just have a word with her.

101
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,935
You know how to make an entrance.

102
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,872
Too much?
Maybe for some. CIA?

103
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:30,242
Oh, I'm something like that.

104
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,280
<i>What's Insight?</i>

105
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,948
It's a global intelligence company.

106
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,184
Basically the CIA for businesses.

107
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,387
What's she doing here?

108
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,422
I have no idea.

109
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,131
I could tell by the way those
soldiers were staring at me,

110
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,034
they haven't a clue
as to why I'm here.

111
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,803
They were staring at you because
you're an attractive woman

112
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,207
and they've been running
around the desert for months.

113
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,876
You're here because
I ordered you to be here.

114
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,380
You know Rudolph Martin.

115
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,315
No one knows Rudolph Martin.

116
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:13,051
Then why did England,
Germany, Israel,

117
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,987
Spain and the United Nations
ask you to advise

118
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,424
their counter-terrorism
division regarding Martin?

119
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,429
How did you know about that?

120
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,432
Well, these medals
aren't just for show.

121
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,036
Yes, I've studied Martin,

122
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,004
but if anyone says
they truly know him,

123
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,806
they're full of shit.

124
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,609
Every sentence regarding Martin
should come with a disclaimer.

125
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,545
In your expert opinion,

126
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,915
what are the Chechens
going to do to Martin?

127
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,851
It's been a long time

128
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:50,755
since my own country sought
my counsel, Colonel Harding.

129
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,757
Well, the slate is clean here.

130
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,092
Is it?

131
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,860
With me it is.

132
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,800
Well...

133
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:05,437
I think the Chechens are
going to give him a trial,

134
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,273
something public, and then
they're gonna execute him.

135
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,075
Probably within the same hour.

136
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,177
I agree.

137
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,912
But he's too valuable to kill.

138
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,880
Which is why you're here.

139
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:20,452
Natalie, your father
was my best friend

140
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,921
and the finest soldier
I ever served beside.

141
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,024
Why is that relevant?

142
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,259
It's relevant to me.

143
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,095
You are in a unique position.

144
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,364
You not only know the enemy,

145
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,100
you have my faith
and trust as well.

146
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,870
What do you need me to do?

147
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,439
Once we get that
son of a bitch back here,

148
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:45,377
you'll verify his identity
and lead the interrogation.

149
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,779
You'll break him.

150
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,148
Until then, educate the team.

151
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,817
Make sure they know
who they're going to get.

152
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,619
What is this?

153
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,656
It's good to know
who you're talking to.

154
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,935
Martin ascended to
the top of the FBI's

155
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:14,172
and Interpol's Most Wanted list
a decade ago.

156
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,242
He has no birth certificate,
no passport,

157
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,445
and claims residency
in no particular country.

158
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,480
Rudolph Martin is the man
behind the man.

159
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,183
He puts people together,
he moves money,

160
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,686
and provides intel
on possible targets.

161
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:31,523
He's not the face of terrorism,
he's the brain.

162
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,091
<i>The prison is located</i>

163
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,827
at the base of
the Caucasus Mountains.

164
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,697
This totally isolated
maximum security facility

165
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,899
is nicknamed Inferno.

166
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,601
The prison is built down, not up,

167
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,236
and there are eight levels.

168
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,406
So you won't find any signs.
No prison yard.

169
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,576
Once you're in, you don't come out.

170
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,712
Your initial point of entry
is a boiler room.

171
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,414
This gives you access
to the northern stairway.

172
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,550
From there, it's a straight shot
to solitary.

173
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,719
We want you in and out of there
in three hours.

174
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,821
The first four are
administrative offices,

175
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,656
lockers and so on.

176
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,492
Then there are three levels
of general population.

177
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:11,496
There are approximately 60 to 70
prisoners in this area.

178
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,132
And then finally, the eighth level,

179
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,101
is solitary confinement.

180
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,604
Martin is likely here,
although we can't confirm this.

181
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,046
Percy Kendall.

182
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,483
<i>This is the only known photograph</i>

183
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,951
ever taken of Martin.

184
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,986
It was taken in South Africa
five years ago.

185
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,755
It's never been authenticated.

186
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,324
He is hyper intelligent
and extremely paranoid.

187
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,826
He puts out false information
about his whereabouts,

188
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,295
he fakes leads, he employs doubles.

189
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,598
That might not even be him.

190
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,567
You gentlemen will be the first
to know that for certain.

191
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,671
The guards, approximately 40,

192
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,741
live in fear of their warden,
Ivan Rudovsky.

193
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,244
Born and raised in Lebanon,
but of Chechen descent,

194
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,513
he's a former SAS officer

195
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,715
charged with the murder of a POW.

196
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,384
Before sentencing,
he fled Chechnya,

197
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,454
and now oversees
all Inferno's operations.

198
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,023
Once the package is secured,
you're gonna proceed

199
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,125
a half klick east
to the extraction point.

200
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,227
Listen, gentlemen,
you're gonna go in soft,

201
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,163
you're gonna come out heavy.
I expect it's gonna take

202
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:19,697
a lot of noise to break Martin out.

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,475
<i>No one has ever escaped Inferno</i>

204
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,043
and you better believe
they are going to do

205
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,678
everything in their power

206
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,881
to stop you from taking
its most famous guest.

207
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,316
It's just you, gentlemen.

208
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,418
No plan B.
No back-up plan.

209
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,188
No cavalry coming from behind
to save the day.

210
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,158
Success or failure of this mission

211
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,661
lies solely in your hands.

212
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,882
Pretty impressive.

213
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,521
Sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

214
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,623
You didn't.
Can I help you?

215
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,692
You know, I don't think
I've ever met anyone

216
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,560
with the name Mercy.

217
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,395
Well, it wasn't the easiest name
to grow up with as a kid,

218
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,097
but I survived.

219
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,066
It's interesting.

220
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,968
Your parents must've been
interesting people.

221
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,404
I didn't know them very well.

222
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,373
I read about how they died.
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,277
It was a long time ago.

224
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,580
It's a remarkable
coincidence, isn't it?

225
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,249
What was?

226
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,817
Well, the Russian
that you apprehended

227
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,386
had ties to the United
National Defense Front.

228
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,854
But I'm sure you knew that

229
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,689
before the mission
even started, right?

230
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,258
Excuse me?
That's why you didn't kill him.

231
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,059
You needed info from him.

232
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,129
I'm not allowed to discuss
details of my missions with you.

233
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,269
How exactly did it go down?

234
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,104
I mean, did he
offer it up right away

235
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,374
or did you have to lean on him
a little bit?

236
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,509
Conversation's over.

237
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,548
<i>All due respect, colonel,
she's a civilian,</i>

238
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,617
with no authority
to go digging around

239
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,320
into classified information.
This is a decorated sergeant.

240
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,922
Who you just cited in your report

241
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,857
after he failed to follow orders.

242
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,192
Look, according to
Sergeant Callo's file,

243
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,695
when he was 13 years old
both of his parents were killed

244
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,664
along with 300 other people

245
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,199
when a Sierra Air jet
exploded over the Atlantic.

246
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,869
The group that claimed
responsibility

247
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,671
was the United National
Defense Front.

248
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,006
The same group that your
Russian source belongs to

249
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,608
and that has been linked to Martin

250
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,543
several times in the past.

251
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,647
And you think Sergeant Callo
is hunting Rudolph Martin?

252
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,149
I think that Sergeant Callo

253
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,784
may be hunting every single person

254
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,019
that was responsible
for his parents' death.

255
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:58,156
The mission, gentlemen,
is to get Martin here alive.

256
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,092
You're suggesting that Sergeant
Callo can't follow orders?

257
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,361
I'm not. But he did.

258
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,197
Look, I can only imagine
how one would feel

259
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,932
when coming face-to-face
with the man who killed

260
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,867
someone they loved.

261
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,537
I don't know how I'd react,
but if I had a gun handy

262
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,072
when I was standing next to them,

263
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,740
it might make my decision
more clear.

264
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,809
Okay. Enough. Okay.

265
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,546
Captain Wilkes, Agent Black,
get your team ready.

266
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,082
Thank you, sir.
Sir.

267
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,019
I gave you those files
to familiarize yourself

268
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,787
with the men,
not psychoanalyze them.

269
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,889
Look, this man's past
is his present.

270
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,592
And resolve is within his reach.

271
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,928
I'm sorry,
but if you want my opinion,

272
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,230
he should not be
a part of this team.

273
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,703
Yes?

274
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,406
Is that confirmed?

275
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,177
All right, get the men ready.

276
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,183
Change of plans.

277
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,919
We received intel that
an armored division

278
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,255
departed a military base
outside of Grozny

279
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,723
about 90 minutes ago.

280
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,626
Unless they're about
to invade Georgia,

281
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,496
they're en route
straight to Inferno.

282
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,097
They're planning on moving him?

283
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,932
Or maybe they just realized
there are folks like us

284
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,668
who might just want
to try to come and get him,

285
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,637
and they're taking precautions.

286
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:23,141
Either way, we can't
have you fight an army.

287
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,777
Obviously,
this moves up our timetable.

288
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,679
The convoy should arrive
in approximately two hours.

289
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,083
Our entire operation can last
no more than 90 minutes.

290
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,485
We need 15 minutes
on either end for travel time,

291
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,087
so that leaves
60 minutes to get in,

292
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,989
get Martin and get out.

293
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,725
Well, what are we waiting for?

294
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,894
Go.

295
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,710
They're through the fence.

296
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,268
What's Sergeant Callo doing?

297
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,403
It's a signal booster for when
the guys go underground.

298
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,306
Helps with the radio,
EKG and video relays.

299
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,624
<i>Bogey guard, 12 o'clock.</i>

300
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,599
He sees them.

301
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,958
They're in.

302
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,728
Something's wrong.

303
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,233
Take it down.

304
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,001
Take it down.
Take it down.

305
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,942
The key is not working.
Gonna blow the door.

306
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,131
Callo, where are you?

307
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,966
I'm in the hallway.

308
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,868
What the hell's going on up there?

309
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,669
I heard something.

310
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,631
<i>Return to your position. Now.</i>

311
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,846
Captain...

312
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,314
Callo, repeat that.

313
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,083
Almost there.
Stand by.

314
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,319
What did Callo just say?

315
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,822
<i>Did not copy, Callo. Repeat.</i>

316
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,403
Perfect.

317
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:10,915
I'm on to you, you wanker.

318
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,517
I know you're the grass
in this prison.

319
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,020
We're watching.

320
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,193
Now your turn.

321
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,031
Let's see what you've got.

322
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:42,079
I offer you your freedom,
and this is all you've got?

323
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,714
You're weak!

324
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,420
Now my turn.

325
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,308
Burn that body
and clean this shit up.

326
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,424
And that's how you maintain
order within the inmates.

327
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,961
With all due respect, warden,

328
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,430
that was not order, that was chaos.

329
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,467
Fuck you and your respect.

330
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,936
If you'd sorted this out right
in the first place,

331
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,938
I wouldn't be here
wiping your Chechen ass.

332
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,475
Now, I know you're pissed off
that I got your position.

333
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:47,378
But I suggest you get over it
very quickly.

334
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,550
I was quite content

335
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,986
never to visit the homeland
of my father ever again.

336
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:59,790
But what you saw out there,
that was my mother's side.

337
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,527
That was British blood
flowing through my veins.

338
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,263
And I suggest
if you ever see it again,

339
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,098
you should avoid it at all costs.

340
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,967
Now get out.

341
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,638
I've got things to do.

342
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,034
You comfy there?

343
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,678
Almost there.

344
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,047
Standby. Standby.

345
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,684
So where are they now?

346
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,487
Southwest stairwell.
Everything's set.

347
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:06,423
Just awaiting your orders.
Perfect.

348
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,268
So, what are you waiting for?

349
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,404
Let the show begin.

350
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
Go, go, go!

351
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,247
Aah!

352
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,784
Whoa, what just happened?

353
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,827
What's going on?
Sergeant, who's shooting?

354
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,329
I don't know, sir.

355
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,132
Are the cameras on night vision?

356
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:51,168
- Take us off infrared.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,721
Revolver Actual, this is
Revolver Main, do you hear me?

358
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:14,291
Revolver Actual, this is
Revolver Main, do you read?

359
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,553
Shit!

360
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,455
I want him dead now!

361
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,967
We need an image.
Let's go!

362
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,235
Something's wrong.

363
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,981
I'm on it.

364
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,342
Got it.

365
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,627
Colonel?

366
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,462
They're calling in now.

367
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,798
Okay.

368
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,867
Excuse me, sergeant.

369
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,870
Yes, ma'am.
Hi. Would it be possible for me

370
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,572
to look at the video footage again?

371
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:43,240
We can't tie up those monitors up.

372
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,008
It's important.

373
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,415
Warden Rudovsky?

374
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,817
<i>Five confirmed dead.</i>

375
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,320
I'm not interested in
the five that are dead.

376
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,556
I'm only interested in the one
that's still alive.

377
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,291
I have men checking
every single access door,

378
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,093
but there are literally dozens.

379
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,362
<i>There's barely enough room</i>
<i>to breathe in there,</i>

380
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,432
<i>let alone move. He's most</i>
<i>likely caught inside somewhere.</i>

381
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,234
Warden, look.

382
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,554
So much for most likely, Alexi.

383
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,092
Switch all these monitors
to Level Two feed.

384
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,697
All guards on Level Two,
secure your stations.

385
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,070
<i>I want this rat found now!</i>

386
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,951
Revolver Main,
this is Revolver Actual,

387
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,486
do you read me?

388
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:09,226
Revolver Main, this is Revolver
Actual. Do you read me?

389
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,661
Everything that's out there

390
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,029
is in here on these back-up
servers.

391
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,464
Should only take me
a second to sync up.

392
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,938
What's this?

393
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,841
That's transmitting
the team's frequency.

394
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,510
Did you hear that?

395
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:27,878
Ma'am?

396
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,513
I thought I just heard something.

397
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,715
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I didn't hear anything.

398
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,050
Stop calling me ma'am.

399
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,584
Can you roll this back
a few seconds?

400
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:36,553
We're no longer recording.

401
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,460
Revolver Actual, do you read me?

402
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,325
<i>What the hell's going on out there?</i>

403
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,427
<i>In the hallway, I heard something.</i>

404
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,129
<i>Return to your position, now.</i>

405
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,997
<i>- Almost there.</i>
<i>- Standby!</i>

406
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,969
<i>Standby! Aah!</i>

407
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,301
<i>I'm told we can have a team there</i>

408
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,303
<i>and ready to go</i>
<i>in less than four hours.</i>

409
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,439
With all due respect,
Mr. President,

410
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,574
I'm not so sure
how much good it will do.

411
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,078
Latest satellites confirm
the Chechens have mobilized

412
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,281
an armored division
from the north toward Inferno.

413
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:47,651
They will be arriving
in approximately 90 minutes.

414
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:50,821
Any second team
would not simply be fighting

415
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:54,224
a group of guards,
but an army as well.

416
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:57,127
<i>Thank you, colonel.</i>

417
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,566
They're not all dead.

418
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,947
Do you have a weapon?

419
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,415
I'm going to take my hand away.

420
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,351
You make a noise or move, you die.

421
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,019
You understand?

422
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,890
I do not wish to die.

423
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,493
You will get no fight
from me. I promise.

424
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,928
Good to know.

425
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,530
I know why you're here.

426
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:36,900
Yeah? Why is that?

427
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:39,536
Do not kill me,
and I will take you to his cell.

428
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,238
Whose cell?

429
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,373
Rudolph Martin.

430
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,044
You're basing your theory
that Callo's alive on this?

431
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,814
Primarily, yes.

432
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,582
Also, a few moments ago,

433
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,485
someone tried contacting us
on the team's secure channel.

434
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,954
What did they say?

435
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,456
Well, it was just static,

436
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,291
but I know that something
was there.

437
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:05,295
That's my man. If he's alive,
we're gonna go get him.

438
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,264
Hold on.

439
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:10,200
Nobody's going to get anyone, okay?

440
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,903
Even if this could be
authenticated,

441
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,539
there's still not enough
evidence to warrant any action.

442
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,974
I'm sorry.

443
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,351
What are you doing?

444
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,088
You heard the man.
He needs evidence.

445
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,295
I knew he was big shot.

446
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:40,096
He's terrorist, right?

447
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,666
Heh. Americans,
it's always terrorist.

448
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,634
You people must miss the Cold War.

449
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,937
Why do you say that?

450
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:49,239
At least we wore uniforms.

451
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,713
You no trust me?
Don't take it personally.

452
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,784
That's why you are lucky

453
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:02,519
you ran into me
when you did, my friend.

454
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,256
I can show you the way.

455
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:09,259
How do you say, not normal way,
but back way, the back...

456
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,461
I understand.

457
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,198
And you take me with you
to America?

458
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,700
What?

459
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,034
That is the deal.

460
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,203
We're making deals?

461
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,872
I do for you, you for me.
Is fair?

462
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,275
No. Not fair.

463
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,444
Then you can find him yourself.

464
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:30,280
Should be easy, all alone,

465
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:33,583
with the entire prison guard
population looking for you.

466
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,086
And you absolutely know
where he is?

467
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:37,687
I bring him his medicine every day.

468
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,489
What medicine?

469
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:42,726
Needles and insulin
for blood sugar. You know.

470
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,961
He's diabetic?
Yes.

471
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,698
If you're not being
straight with me...

472
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,768
I don't understand.
"Being straight"?

473
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,508
If you take me anywhere
besides Martin's cell...

474
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,777
I understand.

475
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,447
So we have a deal?

476
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,419
Let's go.

477
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,168
Lev?

478
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,569
Yes, sir.
Get in here.

479
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,439
What the fuck is that?

480
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,408
That's north stairwell,
between Two and Three.

481
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,776
I will have it fixed immediately.

482
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:34,244
It's not broken.

483
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,279
He's not trying to get out.

484
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,386
Is okay here.
No video.

485
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,854
How much further?

486
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,990
Not much now. Just here.

487
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,858
At the end, on the right.

488
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,861
That door, then into another.

489
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,839
Hey. I thought solitary
was in the basement?

490
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,975
I don't know what you know.
I only know he's here.

491
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,055
The key?

492
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,626
Never mind.

493
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,796
This opens all doors.

494
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:02,465
Is better than Black Amex.

495
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,669
Not another step.

496
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,503
<i>The American is in the gym.</i>

497
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,542
Who just said that?

498
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,390
You better hurry.
Alexi! Come in.

499
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,159
<i>Copy, warden.
What are your instructions?</i>

500
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,594
Change of plans.

501
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:57,574
This way!

502
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:31,274
<i>Alexi, come in.
Are you there? Report!</i>

503
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,112
<i>Alexi!</i>

504
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,481
I'll give you my car
if you answer him.

505
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,322
Colonel, may I have a word?

506
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,790
What is it?

507
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,628
You said you wanted evidence.

508
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:59,068
Here, this is moments
before the attack.

509
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,037
Okay, um...

510
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,645
Here, the keycard
that got us inside the prison

511
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:11,180
and through the first three doors,

512
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:15,084
suddenly stops working.
And then...

513
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,254
Here.
The lights turn on.

514
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:21,924
Blinds the team
and the guards enter, blasting.

515
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:23,726
They knew we were coming.

516
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,762
They let us in.

517
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,697
They knew which route
we were going to take.

518
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,867
They waited for the entire team
to get inside the stairwell

519
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,769
and then they attacked.

520
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,941
Colonel,
there's an informer among us.

521
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,211
Hmm.

522
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,415
Did I ask you to do this?

523
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,651
No. You said you wanted...

524
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,753
Have you shown it to anyone?

525
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:53,056
No.

526
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:56,259
Have you told anyone
what you just told me?

527
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,194
No.

528
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,065
Don't.

529
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:15,411
Your father was a great hero
here in Chechnya, Alexi.

530
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,149
You must be a great
disappointment to him.

531
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,553
We should alert
the perimeter guards

532
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,822
the American is on his way.

533
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:27,423
He's not going to the perimeter.

534
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,525
Yeah?

535
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:38,167
Sasha, take two of
your best men to solitary.

536
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,336
Bring the prisoner here,
I want him in my quarters.

537
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:42,305
Yes, warden.

538
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,377
Are you still here?

539
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,170
Yuri!

540
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,873
Where is that fat son of a bitch?

541
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,075
Stand back.

542
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,807
Which one is he in?

543
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,241
I don't know.

544
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,193
Shit, no signal.

545
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,436
That good, huh?

546
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,605
Oh. Heh. Yeah.

547
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,140
Pentagon will spend
$500 on a hammer

548
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,108
but when it comes to coffee,

549
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,271
that's where they're gonna
ease the tax payers' burden.

550
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:33,649
Look, we got off on
the wrong foot, all right?

551
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,218
I'm not usually this big a prick.

552
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,087
How big of a prick are you usually?

553
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,257
Right.

554
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:43,426
Look, you impressed me
in there. All right?

555
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:46,762
You convinced me.
Thanks.

556
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:48,431
How well do you know the colonel?

557
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,066
Pretty well, actually.

558
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,401
He and my father served together.

559
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,270
We haven't spoken in years, so...

560
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,905
Did you know his son?

561
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:59,442
Yeah.
Do you know Robert?

562
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,078
Well, no. I mean, I heard
the stories of his death.

563
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,346
What?

564
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,682
I'm sorry. I figured
you would have known.

565
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,554
How did he, uh...?

566
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,422
Suicide.

567
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,263
Special Agent Black.

568
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,931
The colonel would like to see you.

569
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,701
Sorry.

570
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,300
Natalie Meyers.

571
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,702
<i>This is Sergeant Mercy Callo.</i>

572
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:01,437
I'm sorry, could you speak up?

573
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,240
This is Sergeant Mercy Callo.

574
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:06,609
Look, I'm sorry,
but you're breaking up.

575
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,879
Could you just repeat yourself?
<i>Mercy Callo.</i>

576
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:11,714
Is this a joke?
<i>No.</i>

577
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:14,116
You ask me insulting questions
about my dead parents

578
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,652
and you think
I'm going to ignore orders.

579
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:19,088
<i>Can we just skip to the part</i>
<i>where you believe me now?</i>

580
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,457
Holy shit.
I knew you were alive.

581
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,760
I'm in solitary,
I'm about to intercept Martin.

582
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:32,268
Huh?

583
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,707
Warden Rudovsky!
Warden Rudovsky!

584
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:40,109
Something's wrong.
What's wrong?

585
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,158
Code Red.
Prisoner's escaped.

586

Lose something?

592
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,809
Yuri!

593
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,145
Where is that fat son of a bitch?

594
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,013
Stand back.

595
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:19,001

00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,204

<i>Warden Rudovsky!</i>

00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,043

00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,346
What's wrong?

600
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:33,015
Mercy, stay on the line, okay?

601
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,323
Code Red.
Prisoner's escaped.

602
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,450
Colonel Harding?

603
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:11,520
Colonel Harding, I have
Sergeant Callo on the line.

604
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,888
Come again?

605
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,124
I have Sergeant Callo on the line.

606
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,195
Hello, Mercy?

607
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,933
Mercy, are you there?

608
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,903
Sir?
He's gone.

609
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,405
Not so tough.

610
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,083
Tough enough.

611
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:16,118
Martin!

612
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,053
Hands where I can see them.

613
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,959
What did he say exactly?

614
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,995
He said he was in solitary,

615
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,030
attempting to intercept Martin.

616
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:30,799
Was that all?
Yes. Uh, no.

617
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,601
He said something was wrong.

618
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,603
No shit. What did he say?

619
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,472
He didn't say what it was.

620
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:37,873
Sir, we traced the number.

621
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,708
The call definitely came
from Inferno prison.

622
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,345
Thank you, sergeant. Why do
you think he called you?

623
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:44,947
I gave him my card before he left.

624
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,850
Maybe it was the only number
he had handy.

625
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:51,053
And you believe it was him?
Yes, sir, I do.

626
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:53,022
Obviously he's trying
to finish the mission.

627
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,957
We can't let him do this alone.

628
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,495
Well, you got me at a
disadvantage. You know my name.

629
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:03,699
Now, who exactly are you?

630
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:07,503
Okay. Guessing by your accent,
I would say you're American.

631
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:10,105
Marines? CIA?

632
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:13,108
None of the above?

633
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,244
The cuff's on the ground,
by the guard.

634
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:17,513
Take 'em and lock your wrists.

635
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,982
That explains why
they were coming for me.

636
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,684
To move me to keep you
from getting me.

637
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:23,452
What happened out in the world?

638
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:26,588
Take the cuffs
and lock your wrists.

639
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,257
And what if I don't?

640
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,863
Wow, you shoot the floor,
that's very impressive.

641
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,534
Here's what I think
is gonna happen.

642
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:40,202
The big boy here
already sounded the alarm.

643
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:43,005
So right now, there's more
guards coming as we speak.

644
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,441
You want me alive,
so you're not gonna shoot me.

645
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:47,776
And if they wanted me dead,
they would've already killed me.

646
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,845
So...

647
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,983
I'd say you're screwed, buddy.

648
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,827
That was some really pretty
kicking.

649
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,331
Very nice.

650
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,833
You like that?
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty.

651
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:46,568
You might like this.

652
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,644
Don't go nowhere.

653
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,421
I told you they would come.
Shut your mouth.

654
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,297
This is bullshit!

655
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,479
Why don't you do some more kicking?

656
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,316
Oh, that'll work.

657
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,073
I need a clear path out of here.

658
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,110
If you think I'm going to help
you get out, you're insane!

659
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:37,212
How many guards
have I already killed?

660
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,715
How many more do
you want to see me kill?

661
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,650
You can spare them.

662
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,927
There is a passage.

663
00:59:00,304 --> 00:59:02,371
Put it on speaker.
No shit.

664
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,709
Sergeant Callo?

665
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,111
<i>This is Natalie Meyers.</i>

666
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:10,546
<i>Can you hear us?</i>
<i>Is that you?</i>

667
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,347
Yes, it's me.

668
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,550
<i>Mercy, it's Kyle.
Are you okay?</i>

669
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:16,218
I'm fine.
I may have a way out

670
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,020
that should have
minimal resistance.

671
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:21,056
<i>Sergeant Callo, this
is Colonel Harding.</i>

672
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,559
- Do you have the package?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

673
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,827
But he has assured me
he will not go willingly.

674
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:28,297
<i>Can you subdue him?</i>

675
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:30,799
I can, but if I have to go up
eight flights,

676
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:34,436
carrying a 200-pound man,
I don't like my odds, sir.

677
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,240
Hang on the line, sergeant.

678
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,075
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Martin has to believe

679
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,210
that we're his only
chance for survival.

680
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:44,179
How is he going to do that?

681
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,481
Natalie, this is a terrorist.

682
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,650
A good one.
He won't believe you

683
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:51,420
if you're thinking about
some bullshit immunity deal.

684
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,522
I wasn't going to suggest that.
May I?

685
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,696
Sergeant Callo,
does Martin know where he is?

686
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:02,698
He knows he's in prison.

687
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,734
Does he know he's in Chechnya?
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

688
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:07,636
He's heard a bunch of folks
speaking Russian.

689
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,673
So he probably thinks
he's in Russia.

690
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:13,008
He has friends there that remember

691
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,644
how he helped them during the war.

692
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:18,480
He's probably just waiting
to talk to somebody in charge.

693
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:22,451
Mercy, you tell him
he's in Chechnya,

694
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:26,421
he knows it's only a matter
of time before he's killed.

695
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:28,423
Okay. Is the extraction plan
still in place?

696
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,492
Yes. Look, you have 40 minutes.

697
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:32,961
Chechen ground forces
will be there in 55 minutes.

698
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,564
- I know it's cutting it close.
<i>- We'll be there, sir.</i>

699
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:36,999
<i>How can we contact you?</i>

700
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:39,034
I swiped a cell phone.

701
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:42,137
Once I can get some reception,
I'll text you the number I have.

702
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,474
Mercy, this is the only shot we
have to get you out of there.

703
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:47,009
Once the window closes,

704
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:49,811
<i>you're on your own.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

705
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,347
Yes, sir.
Good luck, Mercy.

706
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,082
<i>Ms. Meyers?</i>

707
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,418
Yes?

708
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,487
Thanks for answering the phone.

709
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,656
Of course.

710
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,767
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

711
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,706
If the warden find out
I helped you escape,

712
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:22,177
he'll not only kill me,
he kills my entire family.

713
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,451
I understand.

714
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,846
You know, you kicked me,
I punched you.

715
01:01:57,848 --> 01:01:59,915
I think I deserve
a first name at least.

716
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,291
What is this?

717
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:14,062
When you were brought in,
were you blindfolded?

718
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,363
Maybe unconscious?

719
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:18,300
Why do you care?

720
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:19,634
You tell me.

721
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:21,002
Check the IDs again.

722
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,342
You're in Chechnya.

723
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:29,978
Seems as though
this prison ain't enough.

724
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,280
The Chechens have
ground forces en route.

725
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,483
We have 40 minutes
to get you out of here.

726
01:02:34,485 --> 01:02:36,485
So you can either cooperate with me

727
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:39,121
or I'm gonna leave
your ass to them.

728
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,589
It's your choice.

729
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,726
Untie me.

730
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,000
Come out, come out,

731
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:53,802
wherever you are.

732
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,372
Warden, we found him.

733
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,812
Kyle, it's him.

734
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:06,214
They're moving through
the cell block now.

735
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:07,749
They? Does that mean
he has Martin?

736
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,418
Well, this is all it says.
All right. May I?

737
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,220
Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?

738
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:14,823
I'm going to input the cell,

739
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,692
and track it through
the phone's GPS.

740
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:20,195
How do you do that?
Really?

741
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:21,963
CIA spy stuff.

742
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,665
I can read his text,
check his email,

743
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:26,568
even listen to his music
if I want to. Thanks.

744
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,308
I can't get service at my apartment,

745
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,411
but five floors below ground
in Chechnya, no problem.

746
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:38,680
You know, I'm not a terrorist.

747
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:41,750
You keep telling yourself that.
You really believe

748
01:03:41,752 --> 01:03:44,152
that the United States
are the good guys, don't you?

749
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,154
Compared to you, we're angels.

750
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,722
Oh, yeah? What about
the Native Americans?

751
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:49,624
Or, hey, what about
the African slaves?

752
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:52,027
Or what about the wives
of the guards you just killed?

753
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:54,362
You really think
they would call you an angel?

754
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:57,399
Would you just lower your voice?

755
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:57,999
Sure.

756
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,506
You have absolutely no idea
where we're going, do you?

757
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,209
I know exactly where I'm going.

758
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:08,643
It doesn't look like it.

759
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,914
Why do think terrorism exists?

760
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:15,450
You believe al Qaeda
likes sleeping in caves

761
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:18,553
and living in fear?
They live in fear?

762
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:20,755
Of course they do.

763
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:22,357
What about the United
National Defense Front,

764
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,559
they live in fear too?
Yeah, naturally so.

765
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,562
No. They hide like roaches

766
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:29,831
because they put bombs on children

767
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,968
and send them into restaurants
and soccer stadiums

768
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,870
and airplanes.

769
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,805
They don't live in fear.

770
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:39,674
You need to be human to be afraid.

771
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:42,177
They're evil,

772
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:44,546
just like you.

773
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,583
Now whose voice needs lowering?

774
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,056
Wakey, wakey!

775
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,062
You know why you're here,
now talk to me.

776
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,698
Why are you the only guard
he left alive?

777
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:20,248
I don't know what their plans were.

778
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,850
Their plans?

779
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:24,152
So they're a team now, are they?

780
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,821
They've been looking for an exit

781
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:29,024
with the least
amount of resistance.

782
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,461
There it is.

783
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:36,998
The exit on Level Seven.

784
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,767
Leads straight out of the prison.

785
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:41,369
This is it. This is
the fire exit. Come on.

786
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,208
They'd have been home free,

787
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,378
except I had the guards
seal all the exits.

788
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,847
I think I forgot
to mention it to you.

789
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:57,185
Lev, switch all these monitors
to the Level Seven feed.

790
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,192
It's welded shut.

791
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:06,361
So don't you guys carry C4

792
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:08,096
or something to blow shit up with?

793
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:10,732
Got a grenade.
I could blow up the door

794
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,702
but it's gonna take down
the wall and the ceiling.

795
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,572
Hello, fellas.

796
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,579
We gotta go.

797
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,416
Now how do you think
I knew about that exit?

798
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:31,586
Detailed information, satellites.

799
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:35,390
So that's your story.

800
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,728
Shut down all electronic locks
on the main population.

801
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,162
Yes, warden.

802
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,338
Come on.

803
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,176
What's the matter?
Card's not working.

804
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:56,911
What do you mean
the card is not working?

805
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:59,414
You're not swiping it right.
I swiped. It's not working.

806
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,716
Then push the numbers,
something. Punch it.

807
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:04,185
Warden Rudovsky.

808
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,389
We have reinforcements
arriving within the hour.

809
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,923
I fail to see how sending in

810
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:11,092
what few guards
we have left will do.

811
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:13,261
With twice as many,
we could not stop them.

812
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:19,334
Who said anything about
sending in the guards?

813
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:25,006
Now sit your arse down there
and keep out of my sight!

814
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,553
Attention, all Inferno staff...

815
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:42,390
<i>report to the main entrance,
Level One, immediately.</i>

816
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,840
This can't be good.

817
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:00,675
Attention, all prisoners.

818
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:03,711
<i>This is Warden Rudovsky.</i>

819
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:06,347
<i>We have two strangers</i>
<i>in our prison.</i>

820
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:10,685
<i>The man that brings me</i>
<i>these men, dead or alive,</i>

821
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,353
will receive a full pardon.

822
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,058
Shit.

823
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,896
Unlock all the cells.

824
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,598
All of them?

825
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,534
Every single one.

826
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,097
Rudovsky, you've gone insane.

827
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:31,599
We will never be able to get
control of this prison again!

828
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,902
Never!
Maybe.

829
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:37,305
But that is no concern of yours.

830
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:38,773
Guards.

831
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,308
What is the meaning of this?

832
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,076
Get this piece of shit out!

833
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:44,312
Rudovsky, what are you doing?

834
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,748
Get him out of here.
What you are doing?

835
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,483
What you are doing?

836
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,952
Rudovsky!
Rudovsky!

837
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,221
Rudovsky!

838
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,592
Look, not to insult
your kung fu or anything,

839
01:09:57,594 --> 01:10:00,061
but I think those AKs might
have really helped us there.

840
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,963
I checked all the AKs,
the AKs are out.

841
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:03,865
Oh, you checked every single
one of those hundred guns?

842
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,700
They were all out?
Not a single bullet.

843
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,468
We've got 30 minutes
to get out of here...

844
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,431
The key!

845
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,136
Do something!

846
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,411
You ever wish you would have
gone to dental school?

847
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,620
Look, if you want to survive this,

848
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:00,855
you got to start trusting me.

849
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:07,028
All right.
Making deals with the devil.

850
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:10,398
Well, we each our own devil,
and we make this world our hell.

851
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,367
You make that up yourself?

852
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:14,435
No, that was Oscar Wilde.

853
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,037
All right.

854
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,008
All right.

855
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:22,610
We got four bullets left,

856
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,512
we got 30 minutes until extraction

857
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,682
and the entire Inferno
prison's out to kill us.

858
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:29,083
You're ready?

859
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:31,519
Yeah, yeah, I feel pumped.
Let's go.

860
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:38,593
Let me go!
Get your hands off me!

861
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,942
Open the gate!

862
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,544
Open the gate!

863
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,716
There he is.

864
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,043
Have they crossed in yet?

865
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:30,878
Yes, sir.

866
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,547
And do they have line of sight?

867
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:34,182
Yes, sir.

868
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:35,850
Hey, what's going on?

869
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,286
We're going in to get them.

870
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,224
They're radio silent
right now, right?

871
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:45,159
- Yes, sir.
- They're in whisper mode?

872
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:52,033
Come in.

873
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:55,203
Colonel, I'm so sorry
to disturb you.

874
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,206
How can I help you?

875
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:02,009
Well, I heard we're going
to pick up Mercy and Martin.

876
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:04,979
Yes. They got the go-ahead
only a few moments ago.

877
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:07,048
Still working on the plan.

878
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,617
How does that usually work?

879
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:12,253
Who decides on the location?

880
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,621
Who gives the order?

881
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,290
Why are you asking?

882
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,928
Sir, I strongly believe
there's an informer among us,

883
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,764
who knew our plans going in.
Natalie...

884
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,766
If that's the case,
then any extraction plan

885
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:27,468
could also wind up in enemy hands.

886
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,905
I came up with the location
and I alone will relay that

887
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,474
to the extraction team
and Sergeant Callo

888
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:35,676
only after they've departed.

889
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:38,980
I will also be ordering
all mobile devices confiscated

890
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:41,849
10 minutes prior to departure time.

891
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,651
While simultaneously shutting down

892
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:48,289
Internet access
on the base. Satisfied?

893
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:50,124
Yes, sir, thank you.

894
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,999
Colonel, I was sorry
to hear about Robbie.

895
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:02,670
I didn't know.

896
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,675
If you'd please
prep the interrogation room

897
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:10,144
in anticipation of our guests.

898
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:11,646
Of course.

899
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,569
Not good.

900
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,805
Really not good.

901
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:41,075
That one's mine.

902
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:43,544
Save the bullets.
Are you sure?

903
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:45,480
No.

904
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,850
All right.

905
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:51,953
Here we go.

906
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,774
What's going on?

907
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:48,209
You done?

908
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,912
I'm done.

909
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,856
Oh, shit.

910
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,959
You can use those bullets now.

911
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,334
Come on, come on.

912
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,203
Hold the door.
Hold it.

913
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,007
A little help.

914
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,011
That club won't hold
for long. This way.

915
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:27,114
Which way now?
Through the main cell block?

916
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,082
Oh, great. Awesome!

917
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:35,356
Extraction team leader,
you are go for launch.

918
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,295
<i>Power control levers going to fly.</i>

919
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:43,431
<i>Revolver Actual, Revolver 16.</i>

920
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:45,700
<i>We have departed for extraction.</i>

921
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,537
Almost out of here.

922
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:55,142
All right.

923
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:57,211
Fellas...
Tony, Frank...

924
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,750
All right.

925
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:04,251
We don't need to do this, do we?

926
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:07,054
We do? We gotta do it.
Okay, two at a time.

927
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,027
All right, well...

928
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:19,433
We were given an option
to bring you in

929
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:23,904
dead or alive.

930
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:25,573
Choose.

931
01:17:25,575 --> 01:17:27,274
Anyone ever chosen dead?

932
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,345
That's Kong, king of the inmates.

933
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:33,280
Look, I don't think we...
Hold up.

934
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:36,450
Are you afraid of me?

935
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,722
What?
You can't hear me up there?

936
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:43,824
I said, are you afraid of me?

937
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:50,498
When I was a boy,
a gang broke into my home,

938
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,969
murdered my father,
raped my mother and sisters,

939
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:58,339
tortured me, left us all for dead.

940
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,775
I was the only survivor.

941
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:03,277
When police found me,
they said the gang

942
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:05,012
would most likely come back
to kill me

943
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,248
because I was witness.

944
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,683
I was 10.

945
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,621
I wasn't scared then.

946
01:18:13,623 --> 01:18:16,223
I am not scared now.

947
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,221
That was a very touching speech.
Just give me a second.

948
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,165
You and me.

949
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,434
You keep these others back.

950
01:18:26,436 --> 01:18:28,769
If you win, you get me dead

951
01:18:28,771 --> 01:18:30,337
and him alive.

952
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,175
As you wish.

953
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:39,847
All right.
Um, can I talk...?

954
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:42,750
Can I just talk to you
for a second?

955
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:44,285
I think you got
hit on the head a lot.

956
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:45,786
Keep an eye on the other one.

957
01:18:45,788 --> 01:18:49,323
This is a terrible idea.
You got four shots left.

958
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:52,093
Anything happens to me,
you get to the extraction point.

959
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,664
Trust.

960
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,340
Sir, satellites confirm
the Chechen Army

961
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:08,876
should arrive at Inferno
in approximately 30 minutes.

962
01:19:08,878 --> 01:19:11,746
They've picked up their pace.

963
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:18,886
Should be over very soon.

964
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:38,405
Boom! Finish him.

965
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,599
Are you kidding me!

966
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,870
Hold it.

967
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,208
All right.

968
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,677
How about instead of one pardon,

969
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,078
we all get out of here?

970
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:57,084
What are you talking about?

971
01:20:57,086 --> 01:21:00,154
I got the key to the front door.

972
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:02,189
Right here.

973
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,572
Robert was sick.

974
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:21,475
After returning from Afghanistan,

975
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:24,778
he complained of headaches, nausea,

976
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,047
but mostly nightmares.

977
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:30,284
I told him it was just stress.

978
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:32,553
Of being in combat.

979
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:37,258
That I had gone through what he had

980
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,893
and it would all pass.

981
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,963
But they didn't.

982
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:45,566
I brought him in for tests,

983
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:49,069
and the doctors at the VA
pronounced him healthy.

984
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:52,973
That all he needed was some rest.

985
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,111
I believed them.

986
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:58,946
Robert didn't.

987
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,550
He would act out, lose his temper.

988
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:08,689
I told him, you got to stop
acting like this and...

989
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,860
grow up.

990
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:19,099
Ah. It was two weeks
before we found his body.

991
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,970
I'm so sorry.

992
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,509
Right.

993
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:35,115
Worse than losing a child, Natalie,

994
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:40,854
is having someone convince you
to side against him.

995
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,755
Warden, there's been an
explosion by the front entrance.

996
01:23:47,757 --> 01:23:50,991
The prisoners are escaping.

997
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:53,827
Warden?
Did you hear me?

998
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,401
The guards are outnumbered.

999
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:01,969
Warden!

1000
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:01,395
All right, the extraction point
is approximately one mile north,

1001
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:03,997
through that forest,
in a burned-out village.

1002
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:05,499
We got about 10 minutes.

1003
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,249
Get the fuck up!

1004
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:03,824
Well, I guess your new friend
just took off.

1005
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,659
Let me tell you something.

1006
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:09,696
These terrorists,

1007
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:12,199
they're not as loyal
as they used to be.

1008
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:16,203
So you think you defeated
my prison single-handedly.

1009
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:19,840
Well, you forgot about one thing.

1010
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,228
Sierra Air Flight 19.

1011
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,131
Your tattoo.

1012
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:45,933
That's the flight number.
Yeah?

1013
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:48,735
You also mentioned the United
National Defense Front

1014
01:26:48,737 --> 01:26:50,704
and bombs on planes.

1015
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,606
It's the only airline
to be hit by that group.

1016
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,020
Who did you lose?

1017
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,257
My parents.

1018
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,695
I'm sorry for your loss.

1019
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:19,666
I think you should hold on to this.

1020
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:21,134
They'll shoot me on sight.

1021
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:24,137
Let's go.

1022
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:39,386
This is an Eagle .50.

1023
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:52,833
Revolver Actual,

1024
01:27:52,835 --> 01:27:55,335
Revolver 16 is 10 minutes out
from extraction.

1025
01:27:55,337 --> 01:27:56,770
<i>Roger.</i>

1026
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,139
This way.

1027
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,054
I thought you said we had time.

1028
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:15,422
We did.

1029
01:28:15,424 --> 01:28:17,291
Oh. So they're just early.

1030
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,692
They're not just early.

1031
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:20,661
They're not even
supposed to be here.

1032
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,000
Are you texting?

1033
01:28:27,002 --> 01:28:29,503
We need to find another route.

1034
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:42,916
Colonel!

1035
01:28:42,918 --> 01:28:44,418
Let's go.

1036
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:56,323
Almost there, Rudolph.

1037
01:29:58,394 --> 01:29:59,726
Hang in there.

1038
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,605
Get us out of here!

1039
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:36,496
Sir, no bullet exit.
How far out?

1040
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:39,266
Roger. Stop what you can,
push fluids as needed.

1041
01:30:39,268 --> 01:30:42,102
Rudolph, you're gonna be
fine, Rudolph.

1042
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:43,603
You're gonna be okay.

1043
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,376
What?

1044
01:30:49,378 --> 01:30:53,213
Not Martin.

1045
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:20,574
<i>We're still in the process</i>

1046
01:31:20,576 --> 01:31:22,375
of gathering
all pertinent information.

1047
01:31:22,377 --> 01:31:25,745
At this time, it appears
the man currently in custody

1048
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:28,181
is not Rudolph Martin.

1049
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:30,183
It is someone
employed to be his double.

1050
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:49,703
Did you lose something?
Yes, thank you.

1051
01:31:49,705 --> 01:31:51,137
Come in.

1052
01:31:53,474 --> 01:31:56,243
It's a Gobrecht. 1836?

1053
01:31:56,245 --> 01:31:58,645
It's worth a few thousand dollars.

1054
01:31:58,647 --> 01:32:00,480
Yes. You know your coins.

1055
01:32:00,482 --> 01:32:03,149
I collected as a kid.

1056
01:32:03,151 --> 01:32:04,618
Did you?

1057
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,953
No. My father did.

1058
01:32:06,955 --> 01:32:08,388
This was his coin.

1059
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:14,294
So, heh, how are you feeling?

1060
01:32:14,296 --> 01:32:17,330
Pretty crappy, to be honest.

1061
01:32:17,332 --> 01:32:20,133
But I'll be okay.

1062
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:24,037
How's, uh...

1063
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,306
I don't know
what you're calling him.

1064
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:30,277
Oh, we're calling him
the Martin Double.

1065
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:34,314
He's not good.
Actually, um,

1066
01:32:34,316 --> 01:32:36,983
he's in critical condition.

1067
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:40,186
What does it matter anyway?

1068
01:32:40,188 --> 01:32:42,856
Mercy, it matters a great deal.

1069
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:49,195
Listen to me, okay?

1070
01:32:49,197 --> 01:32:52,866
This could be
a very high value asset.

1071
01:32:52,868 --> 01:32:54,968
If he survives...
I mean, you said yourself,

1072
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:56,903
he knows Martin's work.

1073
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:59,940
He could know his location,
his connections,

1074
01:32:59,942 --> 01:33:03,143
possible targets,
I mean, the list goes on.

1075
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:05,345
We won't know for sure
until we talk to him,

1076
01:33:05,347 --> 01:33:08,782
but this could be
a very good thing.

1077
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:14,154
I don't want to take up
too much of your time.

1078
01:33:14,156 --> 01:33:16,923
But I just, um...

1079
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:18,959
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1080
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:23,830
I was wrong about you.

1081
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:27,934
And what you did was nothing
short of a miracle.

1082
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,870
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1083
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:33,640
You saved my life.

1084
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:39,679
Feel better.

1085
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:48,722
Mercy, what exactly happened
at the extraction site?

1086
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:07,841
Do you have a sec?

1087
01:34:07,843 --> 01:34:09,963
Yeah. I was gonna stop by
the infirmary on my way out.

1088
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:13,847
You're leaving?

1089
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:15,615
Already called back to Washington.

1090
01:34:15,617 --> 01:34:17,517
But I have a couple of minutes.
What's up?

1091
01:34:17,519 --> 01:34:20,086
I don't really know how to begin.

1092
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:22,055
Earlier today, when I was
watching footage of the team,

1093
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:26,593
it was fairly obvious to me
that we had been set up.

1094
01:34:26,595 --> 01:34:28,595
Excuse me. What?

1095
01:34:28,597 --> 01:34:31,131
The Chechens knew
that we were coming.

1096
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:33,667
You have this on tape?

1097
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:38,838
Well, it's not so cut and dry,
but yeah.

1098
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:42,509
I went to Colonel Harding
with what I had, and...

1099
01:34:42,511 --> 01:34:44,411
And?

1100
01:34:44,413 --> 01:34:47,213
And he didn't...
And he didn't believe me.

1101
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:52,686
After we found out
that Mercy was alive

1102
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:54,421
and we were planning
the extraction,

1103
01:34:54,423 --> 01:34:56,222
I went to him again.
Why?

1104
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:59,092
Because I was worried that
if we did have an informant,

1105
01:34:59,094 --> 01:35:01,628
then the extraction
would also be compromised.

1106
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,498
Colonel Harding assured me
that was the only one

1107
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,100
that knew the exact details,

1108
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:09,903
and that he alone would
relay the information.

1109
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:12,605
I just spoke with Mercy.

1110
01:35:12,607 --> 01:35:14,774
He said the Chechens
arrived at the extraction site

1111
01:35:14,776 --> 01:35:18,011
at the exact time he did.

1112
01:35:18,013 --> 01:35:20,113
Kyle, it wasn't a coincidence.

1113
01:35:20,115 --> 01:35:23,516
Look, these are photos
of the troops' movements.

1114
01:35:23,518 --> 01:35:27,787
They were making
a bee line for Inferno,

1115
01:35:27,789 --> 01:35:29,122
but then all of a sudden,

1116
01:35:29,124 --> 01:35:30,890
for some reason,
they changed course,

1117
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:33,993
They went straight to
Martin and Mercy.

1118
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,297
And you think Harding told them?

1119
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,268
I know that it sounds crazy.

1120
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:46,339
I mean, God, I've known
this man my whole life.

1121
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,409
It's just...

1122
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:58,651
I think he blames the military
for misdiagnosing his son.

1123
01:35:58,653 --> 01:36:01,521
Enough to commit treason?

1124
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:05,625
I know how it sounds.

1125
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:12,866
It's just, he was the only one
who knew the exact details...

1126
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:17,937
I'm going to input the cell, and
track it through the GPS.

1127
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:21,374
How do you do that?
Really? CIA spy stuff.

1128
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:24,377
I can check his texts,
read his emails...

1129
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:26,946
<i>even listen to his music</i>
<i>if I want to.</i>

1130
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:28,648
Natalie?

1131
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,484
You all right?

1132
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:36,689
Yeah. I'm fine.

1133
01:36:58,212 --> 01:36:59,813
Sergeant.

1134
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:49,028
Now you have made
one hell of a mess.

1135
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:55,401
You shouldn't have gone and
got yourself captured, Victor.

1136
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:04,978
Can I see him?

1137
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:12,852
Hey, what's going on?

1138
01:38:15,155 --> 01:38:16,456
Kyle?

1139
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:26,766
It's not what you think, sergeant.

1140
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:30,003
Your clearance only goes so high.

1141
01:38:30,005 --> 01:38:31,704
I'm just following orders.

1142
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:38,378
Come on now, Mercy.

1143
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:59,832
This is not what I wanted.

1144
01:38:59,834 --> 01:39:01,834
For you or for the team.

1145
01:39:12,246 --> 01:39:14,080
Drop the gun, Agent Black!

1146
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:48,514
You look like shit.

1147
01:39:48,516 --> 01:39:50,116
You're one to talk.

1148
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:55,355
I've met him before.

1149
01:39:55,357 --> 01:39:57,557
He works for Martin's network.

1150
01:39:57,559 --> 01:39:59,726
Why was he trying to kill you?

1151
01:39:59,728 --> 01:40:03,997
Because I know
how to get to Martin.

1152
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:09,168
My real name is Victor.

1153
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:15,441
Mercy Callo.

1154
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:18,978
Of course that's your name.

1155
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,913
You laugh it up.
Hey.

1156
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:25,018
It suits you quite well.

1157
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:36,562
You're all set, sergeant.

1158
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:38,231
That's it?

1159
01:40:38,233 --> 01:40:39,799
Is there anything I need to avoid?

1160
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:42,335
Getting shot.

1161
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:53,312
Sergeant Callo.
Yes, sir.

1162
01:40:53,314 --> 01:40:54,914
At ease, sergeant.

1163
01:40:57,451 --> 01:40:59,652
Have you given any thought
to what's next?

1164
01:40:59,654 --> 01:41:02,321
No, sir.
I've never been given

1165
01:41:02,323 --> 01:41:04,557
a choice of assignments
in the past.

1166
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:07,560
And what if that changed?

1167
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,796
I've been asked
to put together a new team.

1168
01:41:09,798 --> 01:41:11,397
I'd like you to be a part of it.

1169
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:13,900
Doing what, sir?

1170
01:41:13,902 --> 01:41:15,835
What you're good at.

1171
01:41:15,837 --> 01:41:20,706
This life,
it's not for everyone, Mercy.

1172
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:23,743
It wasn't for Natalie.

1173
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:25,778
It wasn't for my son.

1174
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,580
They paid with their lives,

1175
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:29,462
and there's a good chance
you'll pay with yours.

1176
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:33,686
No one would blame you
for getting out now.

1177
01:41:33,688 --> 01:41:36,422
I understand the risk, sir.

1178
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:38,858
But there's something worse
than losing my life.

1179
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,526
What's that?

1180
01:41:40,528 --> 01:41:43,763
Living with the knowledge
that I could've helped,

1181
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,398
but chose to get out.

1182
01:41:49,903 --> 01:41:52,038
Then what are we waiting for?
