Bounty Hunters aka Bail Enforcers (2011) BluRay 720p
Edit and Resync by Bajingan, Toa Pek of Yuna

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,000
WOMAN: Well, isn't thisjust peachy?

3
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,462
Another fine day in the life
of being a bounty hunter, l guess.

4
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,567
Let's see, what have we got here?

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:37,898
A mob boss. Check.
Gun pointed at my head. Check.

6
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,520
We're in an abandoned warehouse. Perfect.

7
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,431
And, oh, yeah...

8
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,501
l'm wearing a schoolgirl uniform,

9
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,110
so it must be Friday.

10
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:52,334
ls it Friday already? Plan A is obviously in effect.

11
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:58,131
Man, l really gotta find a new way
to pay the bills. Thisjob sucks.

12
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:00,023
Speaking of things that suck,

13
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,896
that guy on the ground is Chase.

14
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,500
He's my partner.

15
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,598
l'm sure if he wasn't unconscious,
he'd be saving me right now,

16
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:09,449
or at least saying something funny.

17
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:11,808
This is Ridley. He's our boss.

18
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,048
He's not as funny as Chase,

19
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,868
but right now he's my best chance
of me not dying today.

20
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:25,891
So either we all start shooting -
until one of us maybe crawls out of here alive -

21
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:28,932
or you do the smart thing, take the money.

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,524
Like l said, l can't do that.

23
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:34,145
- l can.
- What?

24
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:38,059
Either way l end up in jail or dead.

25
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,735
So l'm walking out of here
with that bag of money

26
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:43,773
and letting you guys shoot each other,
that's what l'm doing.

27
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:47,616
Mario! You try to take that bag and l'll kill her.

28
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,049
Go ahead, shoot the bitch.

29
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,233
Mario, you're making the situation worse.

30
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:56,159
Please don't.

31
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,117
Watch me.

32
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,743
(Chase grunts)

33
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,871
- What are we at?
- Four.

34
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:15,162
- Four?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:19,143
- Oh, my God. lt feels like l'm at 20.
- No, it's been a minute.

36
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:22,150
l'm just gonna tell people l did 20.
How's that?

37
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:25,827
- Well, l'll back you up.
- My wrist hurts. l'm letting it go.

38
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,868
- Ah, God.
- That it?

39
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:34,014
Yeah. Probably gonna be
putting on a hitting clinic.

40
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,559
- lmpressive, impressive, impressive.
- Hurt my hand, hurt my hand.

41
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:39,737
- You ready?
- You're up. Let's go.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,713
- You're coming close to my face.
- Well, watch it.

43
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:46,072
- Hey, how you doing?
- Oh, hey. Good. how are you?

44
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:47,726
- Very good, thank you.
- Good.

45
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,478
l was looking at your fitness packages here

46
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:52,864
and l was interested
in possibly working out here.

47
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:54,001
Yeah?

48
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:57,782
He's right there.

49
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:01,527
CHASE: What do you wanna do? Do you want
me to handle it or do you wanna do it?

50
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,162
- You got it?
- l think l got it.

51
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,342
- You can keep hitting the bag.
- l don't care.

52
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:10,318
Why don't you go get him distracted?
l'll come from behind and choke him out.

53
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,891
- Hey, nice set.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:20,594
- Are you Matt Plant?
- Who wants to know?

55
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,711
Jules Taylor, bail enforcement agent.

56
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,266
You're gonna have to come with me, Mr Plant.

57
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,216
That's funny. Really?

58
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,334
Mm-hm. Really.

59
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,604
- No. Nice try.
- Mm-hm.

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,949
- And who are you?
- l'm with her.

61
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:45,175
Wow. What, are you gonna help?

62
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:47,506
What are you here for?
What are you gonna do?

63
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,084
- l'm gonna take you in.
- (Laughs)

64
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
Funny.

65
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,387
Really? Wow.
So you're here to help basically?

66
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:02,454
lf she wants me to, sure, why not?

67
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,606
l don't think you're gonna help.

68
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,548
Ow! Shit! Fuck!

69
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:13,224
- Give me two seconds? Do you hear that?
- Actually, no. l have to go.

70
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,861
- l just really need to... l'm sorry.
- lt's OK.

71
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,418
Real helpful. Real helpful.

72
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,350
What is this?

73
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,625
You think this is gonna help you?

74
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:20,087
- l'm thinking of six months.
- Are you a member?

75
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:21,839
- No, l'm not.
- l'll be right back.

76
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:25,791
But, honestly, l just got
a few more minutes is all.

77
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:29,678
- The fitness assessment for $26.23...
- Do you hear that in the back?

78
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:33,191
Nothing really. That just sounds like
some weights to me. Anyways...

79
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,672
(Groaning)

80
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:46,914
(Grunting)

81
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,015
You're coming with me.

82
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,803
- And there's no locked-in contracts?
- No, no contracts.

83
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:25,447
And no banking information required,
which l really like. That's awesome.

84
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:29,037
We just need lD. l'm gonna go check
on this, so l'll be right back.

85
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,480
Good job.

86
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:44,595
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, thanks for helping out.

87
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,386
Could have grabbed a weight.
They're all over the place.

88
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,341
Good job, Chase.

89
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,769
OK, we'll talk to you later.
Everything go OK?

90
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:57,362
- Yeah, boss. Here's the paperwork.
- lt's good.

91
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:00,311
Good news.
We got another bounty that just came in.

92
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:02,068
Some guy named Peter Wallace.

93
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:04,540
He's at his girlfriend's house.
l got the address.

94
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:08,282
- Oh, good.
- Bring it on. lt's gonna be a good night after all.

95
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:11,839
- Two bounties in one night.
- Tonight? Guys, l gotta work tonight.

96
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,668
That's fine. We'll drop her off
and split it two ways.

97
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:16,859
- That's really fair.
CHASE: l think so.

98
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:18,903
That's not how we do things around here.

99
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:21,869
- Yeah, Chase.
- All of us or none of us.

100
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,235
You're gonna get fired from that place anyway,

101
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,253
so why don't you come with us
and make a few hundred bucks?

102
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,977
Well, he has a point.

103
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,204
Of course l have a point.
l always have a point.

104
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,094
Let's get you guys changed
and go get that bounty. Let's go.

105
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:36,252
- All right.
- Done.

106
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:40,320
Peter Wallace, bail enforcement agents!
Open up!

107
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:43,912
Just once l wanna see one of these pricks
open the door. Just once.

108
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:47,779
Yeah. Probably not gonna happen.
That's why l brought a key.

109
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,109
Peter Wallace, bail enforcement agents!
Come out!

110
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:55,314
Peter Wallace?

111
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,747
- Get the fuck out of my house!

Got it!

00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:15,582
(Gunshots)

115
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,159
- What have we got in here?
- Shooter down the hallway.

116
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:25,747
- And her?
- She's... She's under control.

117
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:28,968
Kind of.

118
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,304
She's under control.

119
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,594
- You OK?
- l'm good.

120

l said get the fuck out of my house!

121
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:36,878
- (Gunshots)
- Not cool, Peter!

122
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,627
Hey, cheesecake,
that gunshot sounds a little funny.

123
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,425
- What's your boy packing?
- A nine-inch dick, faggot.

124
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:45,142
Ow! Fuck! That's a little rude.

125
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,690
PETER: Hey, you let Mimi go!

126
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:50,833
Hey, there's three of us with guns
and one of you! Guess how it ends, huh?

127
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,721
MlMl: Don't hurt him!
- Time's up.

128
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:55,038
- l'm gonna shoot your boyfriend.
- No, wait!

129
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:59,170
PETER: Mimi, shut up.
Don't you say nothing to these assholes.

130
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,506
Three, two...

131
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:05,396
lt's a BB gun!
lt's just a BB gun. Don't shoot him.

132
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:07,083
- l knew it.
- You bastard.

133
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:09,020
Peter, this is how it's gonna work.

134
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,665
Put the toy gun down, come out with your
hands up or l'm gonna have to hurt you.

135
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:16,253
- Your choice.
- ''Put the gun down...'' Fuck you!

136
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:18,440
You fucking bitch!

137
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:22,129
- (Mouths)
- Oh, no.

138
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:30,828
RlDLEY: Duck, Peter.

139
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,956
Damn it! No! No!

140
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:42,576
No!

141
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:44,323
No! No!

142
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,632
No! What the hell?

143
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:50,128
RlDLEY: Can't say l didn't warn you.
MlMl: Stop it. You're hurting him.

144
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,956
Mimi, shut up. l have this under control.

145
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:56,184
- Baby, they were gonna shoot you.
- Shut up.

146
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:57,481
- (Handcuffs click)
- Ow!

147
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:00,214
RlDLEY: Let's take Peter to lock-up.
PETER: OK, yeah.

148
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,405
What size shoe do you have?

149
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,895
- What about his girlfriend?
RlDLEY: Leave her here.

150
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:09,717
Peter can find a new girlfriend in jail.
Hey, Peter?

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,677
(Laughs)

152
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,438
Fuck you, you piece of fucking shit.

153
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,673
- Holy shit. You work at a strip club?
CHASE: Yep.

154
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,370
- Get back in the van.
- Oh, come on. One beer.

155
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,530
Get back in the van.

156
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,559
Actually, l'm a bartender here.

157
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:46,303
Some of us choose not to sell drugs
to make extra money.

158
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,939
What a novel idea, huh?

159
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,008
- Night, guys.
- See you, Jules.

160
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:55,011
And you, you have yourself
a fine evening...in jail.

161
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:58,734
''You have yourself a fine evening...''
Fuck you!

162
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:05,869
CHASE: Can't we just go for one?

163
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,790
- Drive.
- lt's on me.

164
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:15,189
- l said drive.
- (Chase sighs)

165
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,610
(Funky music pounds)

166
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:23,484
Hey, check my lotto tickets.

167
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,840
Just give me a minute.
l'm doing his paperwork.

168
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:28,010
PETER: Guys?

169
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:34,523
Hey, guys. l'm really sorry
about the whole BB gun thing.

170
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,630
You know, that was really stupid of me.

171
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,182
Can you guys please let me go? Please.

172
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:45,894
CHASE: Come on, man, the numbers.
- Come on.

173
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,238
CHASE: l could be rich right now.
- Please don't take me to lock-up.

174
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,413
l can't go back to jail. You understand
the freaky shit they do in there?

175
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:55,941
Ridley, the numbers!

176
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:59,051
There you go.
ln the garbage where they belong.

177
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,257
- (Tyres screech)
- Ow! Fuck!

178
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,343
What the hell, man?

179
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:09,403
Fuck. Come on, guys. l'll pay you.

180
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:12,524
Enough all ready.
We're fucking busy up here.

181
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,843
No good. All losers like usual.

182
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:19,280
Damn it. l thought l would have won
on these ones.

183
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:22,511
Seriously, what if l made you guys an offer?

184
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:24,573
Like we haven't heard that one before.

185
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:26,583
l've been doing this for years.

186
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,745
What could you possibly have
that would make it worth our while?

187
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:34,357
1 00 grand. ls that worth your while?

188
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:37,386
What the fuck are you talking about?

189
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,425
l know a huge bounty,
and your cut would be like 1 00 grand.

190
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,913
Exactly 1 00 grand.

191
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,053
And if you guys. um, if you guys let me go,
l'll tell you where he is.

192
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:51,024
What are you doing?

193
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,540
l'm checking it out, to see if his story makes out.

194
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,616
Yeah. Yeah, his name's, um, Mario Antonio.

195
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:59,772
You drive, l'll look.

196
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:04,677
- What's it say?
- Yeah, yeah, what's it say?

197
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:06,390
lt's coming up, it's coming up.

198
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,941
Huh. He's telling the truth.
What do you know, Peter?

199
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,806
And don't bullshit us on it.
You got two blocks until the station.

200
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:20,727
lf you can't convince us by then,
you're going back in.

201
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:25,447
OK, there's this girl l know
and, um...we fool around sometimes.

202
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:28,917
l give her some smack and she gives me
a little something in return.

203
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:32,416
- You're a better man than l am, Pete.
- Yeah, thanks.

204
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:38,763
Anyway, um... Anyway, the last time
we get together, she's all pissed off.

205
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:42,032
She works at this rub-and-tug
right outside the city,

206
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:45,400
and she tells me that there's this guy
laying low there, right?

207
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:49,369
And she's all mad because he gets all drunk
and scares off all the clients.

208
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,817
But she can't do anything about it
because he's all chummy, chummy

209
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:54,519
with the chick who owns the joint.

210
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,828
One more street, Peter, and speed it up.

211
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:59,801
OK. The guy, uh, he's got a tattoo.

212
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:02,405
lt's Crazy Calabria or something.

213
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:05,195
lt's the place where
all these wops' parents are from.

214
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:08,230
Hey, watch your fucking mouth.
l'm quarter ltalian, dick.

215
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:10,991
OK, anyway, the tattoo, it's on his, um...

216
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,379
RlDLEY: On his left forearm.

217
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:16,677
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Yeah, boss, how did you know?

218
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:19,480
lt's right here.

219
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,431
- Ridley, it's a shit load of money.
- Yeah.

220
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,829
l know that, but what do you think
would happen to your application

221
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,803
if the force found out about this?

222
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:37,439
Don't worry about my application.
We're not gonna say anything.

223
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,625
No.

224
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,596
Peter isn't fucking gonna say anything.

225
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,757
No, l won't say a word. No.

226
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,121
See? He's not gonna say a word. We're gold.

227
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:49,514
This better not be a fucking trick, Peter.

228
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,367
No. l swear. l swear.

229
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:56,178
Come on, guys. What do you say?

230
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:59,960
Come on, Ridley. What do you say? Come on.

231
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,448
lf we're gonna do this, Jules has to be in.

232
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,614
That's fine.

233
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,597
- Drive.
- Yeah!

234
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:20,819
Gentlemen, don't forget
that all these lovely ladies you see on stage

235
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:24,450
are available for private lap dances
in the VlP area.

236
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,084
Hey, guys. l got a rye and coke here.

237
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:43,738
Guys, tip your waitresses well.

238
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,589
- Putting up with you clowns isn't easy.
- Jules, you OK?

239
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,139
Yeah. Just probably gonna get fired again.

240
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,966
l know it's bad timing, but we need to talk.
- Everything OK?

241
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,688
- lt's fine.
- Let me go change.

242
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:56,437
Let me hear you make some noise
for Mercedes.

243
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:57,787
(Cheering)

244
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:02,045
Shit.

245
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:07,114
Hey, um, so do you think your friend's
gonna be able to convince her?

246
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,984
Well, if anybody can, it's him.

247
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:14,026
They've kind of got a bit of a thing going on,
if you haven't noticed.

248
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:18,115
Maybe we should, um,
go in there and help him?

249
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:21,201
Dude, you're not going anywhere.

250
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:24,078
And if l find out
you've been bullshitting about all this,

251
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:27,956
the only place you will be going to
is lock-up with no fucking teeth.

252
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,508
- You all set?
- Yeah.

253
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,461
Wait. l love this finishing move.

254
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:38,106
JULES: Yeah, they all do.

255
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,978
Here it comes.

256
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:41,848
(Cheering)
- You good?

257
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,692
Don't you wish your wives were that flexible?

258
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,001
A trade? For 1 00,000?
Are you guys crazy? He's fucking with us.

259
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:50,826
- We hear this shit all the time.
- His story checks out.

260
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:54,531
- lt does, Jules.
- So what are you thinking here?

261
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,614
l think we should talk about it.

262
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:59,012
Well, who is this guy?
He's worth $1 00,000?

263
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,432
He's some mob guy
who's cashed in all his money

264
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:04,089
and now he's broke and staying
at a massage parlour.

265
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,203
- ls that about right?
PETER: Yeah, yeah.

266
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,799
And we're supposed to believe this fuck-face?

267
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,350
Some girl that he knows
works at the parlour, saw Mario there.

268
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,859
Ridley won't do it unless we're all in it together.

269
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:18,862
That's great.

270
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,475
Jules, what's up?

271
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:24,315
lt's not fair to put this on me, Ridley.

272
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:27,902
Not to mention that it's illegal to let
a bounty go in exchange for something.

273
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:32,256
- You know that.
- l know, Jules. But think about it.

274
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:35,793
lf this works out,
think what this could mean for all of us.

275
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,695
You could put money away for Sophia

276
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:42,462
and you wouldn't have to do this any more.

277
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,928
Listen, we'll just check it out,

278
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,594
and if we can pick this guy up
easy enough, then why not?

279
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:01,733
Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

280
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:04,449
JULES: Sure?
This place looks a little classy for you.

281
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,511
- l think l've been here before.
- Surprise, surprise.

282
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,565
- Looks like it might be busy in there.
- Yeah.

283
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,279
Are you kidding?
This is the busiest time of day.

284
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:19,081
- Jules, get your gun out and reload.
- Reload?

285
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:22,918
Yeah, some of us don't like the idea
of innocent people getting hurt.

286
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,234
Unless you have a BB gun l can borrow.

287
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,964
When we go into a place
with a lot of bystanders around,

288
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:30,035
one of us loads our gun with blank bullets.

289
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,397
That way we can make a shit load of noise.

290
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,184
- (Gun clicks)
- lt's good for crowd control.

291
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,174
CHASE: And if need be,
l'm standing by with the real deal.

292
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:43,655
OK, you two, l want you to take
a good look at his face and tattoo.

293
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,759
- Got the plan down?
- Yeah, we'll have this done in a flash.

294
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,930
RlDLEY: Let's do it.
- OK.

295
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,771
Welcome to the Lounge.
How can l help you?

296
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:05,862
Here's the deal. This is what l want.

297
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,908
l want three to four, young,
hot non-English speaking women,

298
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,721
Asian preferably if you got 'em.

299
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,553
My girlfriend here
gets a little nervous around people.

300
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,225
So she's gonna sit there and watch

301
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,048
while l wear a werewolf mask
and masturbate. We cool?

302
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,455
What my boyfriend...
He's just nervous. Sorry.

303
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,790
We were interested in having someone join us.

304
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:28,005
We can do that. Were you thinking about
adding another man or woman?

305
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,422
- A woman.
- He likes men.

306
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,794
You weren't supposed
to say anything about that.

307
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,774
When l have six or seven beer,
l kind of get off with men,

308
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,778
but l just call it junior hockey,
where we all sit in a room and we tug our dicks.

309
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:42,380
You wanna join in the mix too?

310
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,366
- l got coupons.
- Follow me this way, please.

311
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,557
God, l love Asians.

312
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,103
- Please choose.
- Um, we'll just...

313
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:59,294
We'll go with her, please. Thanks.

314
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,257
You didn't even look at that one.

315
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,502
- OK, you done now?
- Can we bring them both?

316
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,631
- No.
- This is for room eight.

317
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:08,042
lt's through that door, down the hall on the left.

318
00:21:08,186 --> 00:21:10,905
Go get comfortable.
l'll send the girl to you shortly.

319
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,054
Great, thank you.

320
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:24,445
All right, let's get moving, OK?
And stop thinking of threesomes.

321
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,689
Especially with me in them. That's weird.

322
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,184
Peter said there's an office back here.

323
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,991
- (Woman moans)
- Bingo.

324
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:37,163
- (Slap)
WOMAN: Ow!

325
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:18,311
Looks like somebody's
been calling this place home.

326
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:21,344
- Guess Peter was telling the truth.
- Don't celebrate just yet.

327
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:24,344
Let's look around for some lD or something.

328
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:26,506
(Toilet flushes)

329
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:36,136
Hey, who are you guys?
What are you doing in here?

330
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,309
Mario?

331
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:43,087
Hal sent you, didn't he, huh?
Well, you ain't taking me.

332
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:45,275
No fucking way!

333
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:49,544
Mario, what's going on?

334
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,701
- Hal fucking found me.
- Get out of the way!

335
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:53,905
- Fuck you.
- A little help here.

336
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:10,509
Back up! Yeah.

337
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:11,873
Nice.

338
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,514
Bitch!

339
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:08,649
OK, time! Time out!

340
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,383
You freaking dick!

341
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,456
- You ever play hockey?
- What?

342
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,145
Hockey. Yeah, exactly.

343
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:22,528
That's it, bitch. Just close your eyes
and go to sleep, huh?

344
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,915
l'm gonna show you the punch
that made me famous.

345
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:27,047
(Gun clicks)

346
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:31,082
You try throwing that punch
and the last thing you're gonna remember

347
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:33,785
is your face spraying all over the place.

348
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,310
You're free to go now.

349
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:43,598
You're a beautiful man!

350
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,710
(Phone rings)

351
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,623
Hal, the phone's for you.

352
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:15,607
Didn't l tell you not to bother me
when l'm doing my Fu Manchu?

353
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:17,807
You're just as bad as my wife.

354
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,265
WOMAN: They said it was about Mario.

355
00:25:21,406 --> 00:25:25,365
- A vacation with my daughter.
- Down payment on a condo.

356
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:28,091
l got it. A new van.

357
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:30,521
Come on. This van's been good to us.

358
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:32,223
MARlO: Fucking bounty hunters.

359
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:36,088
You guys got no idea
what you're getting yourselves into.

360
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:38,571
l'll tell you what, hey, you guys let me go now

361
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:41,593
and l'll just pay you the bounty myself, huh?

362
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,070
- Oh, yeah.
- l'm serious.

363
00:25:45,264 --> 00:25:49,052
lf you had any money left, you wouldn't
be sleeping on a couch in a whorehouse.

364
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:52,385
You know what? Breakfast is on me today.

365
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:54,679
Let's go to Marty's.
They have a new pancake.

366
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,647
- They serve it with pure maple syrup.
JULES: Let's go.

367
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:01,334
You idiots have no idea what you're doing.

368
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:06,320
OK, you're in a cage and we're trying to
figure out how to spend 1 00 grand.

369
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:08,010
Yeah, Mario, we're the idiots.

370
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:11,431
There are people out there
who won't let me go back to trial.

371
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:17,700
l know too much stuff. They'll kill me
or anyone who stands in their way.

372
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:20,122
Who are these people?
Do they like pancakes?

373
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:22,249
Cos Chase is buying, so maybe, you know...

374
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:24,376
(Phone rings)

375
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,956
- Who's calling you so late, buddy?
- Unknown caller.

376
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,259
lt's him.

377
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:34,670
Hello?

378
00:26:34,774 --> 00:26:37,652
ls this one of those small-time bounty hunters...

379
00:26:39,235 --> 00:26:41,954
..who busted up a rub-and-tug
about 20 minutes ago?

380
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:44,265
Who is this and how'd you get our number?

381
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:47,445
lt's Hal Lambino.
Put me on speaker phone.

382
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,054
- Already done.
- Good.

383
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:54,036
Mario, are you there?

384
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:58,037
Can you hear me?

385
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:00,281
l'm here, boss.

386
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:02,213
lt's nothing personal, Mario,

387
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:05,779
but l can't wait to rip the tongue
out of your filthy rotten skull.

388
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,650
So long as it ain't personal, huh?

389
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:11,840
What's the price on that piece of shit?
1 00,000?

390
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:16,104
Listen, l don't know who you people are,

391
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:18,662
but tonight's your lucky night.

392
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:21,378
l will pay you one million dollars

393
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,125
to bring Mario to me
instead of taking him back to lock-up,

394
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:27,680
but l want him tonight.

395
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:30,297
l'm gonna give you an address and a time.

396
00:27:30,455 --> 00:27:34,334
You show up and l'll pay you a million dollars

397
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:37,216
in exchange for Mario.

398
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,372
- No deal.
- What do you mean, no deal?

399
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:43,951
Like l said, no deal.

400
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,689
lt sounds like you and your team
have something to talk...

401
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,840
(Ridley hangs up)

402
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,332
- What are you doing?
- What are you, crazy?

403
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:55,515
Me crazy? l didn't throw away a million dollars.
We need to talk.

404
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,488
- No, we don't.
- OK, don't fight, you guys.

405
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:10,358
CHASE: Where are you going?
RlDLEY: To think.

406
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:14,088
CHASE: To think about what?
lt's a million dollars.

407
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:18,384
Yeah, from Hal Lambino.
That mobster's gonna kill him.

408
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:21,700
Well, he is a mobster.
You ever think maybe he deserves it?

409
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:25,400
Come on, it's a million bucks
and all we gotta do is hand the guy over.

410
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:26,824
Can you do that?

411
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:30,685
Can you let a man die
if it means a million dollars in your pocket?

412
00:28:30,893 --> 00:28:33,646
JULES: l can't.
- How did l know you'd be on his side?

413
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,725
Look, l don't care what happens
to this guy once we bring him in.

414
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:40,098
But l won't have his death on my hands,
or yours or Ridley's.

415
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:44,430
- She's right.
- No, she's not.

416
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:48,810
This guy's a fucking mobster who probably did
1 00 things he deserves to die for.

417
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:52,029
- Why are we sticking up for him?
- We're not sticking up for him.

418
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,961
- We're just doing what's right.
- What's right? What's right by who?

419
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,923
By you? By me? By Jules?

420
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:01,284
l say we do what's right by us.

421
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:05,015
And what about your application
to the police force, huh?

422
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,851
What's gonna happen if they find out?

423
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:10,010
Don't fucking worry about my application.

424
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:14,256
Even if they can't prove your involvement,
the suspicion alone will kill your chances.

425
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,155
Kill my chances?
How about this for killing my chances?

426
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:23,194
''Dear Mr Thompson,
it is our regret to inform you

427
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,593
that considering your medical situation,

428
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:29,417
we cannot accept you
into the Metropolitan Police Training Academy.

429
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,373
We wish you all the best
in all your future endeavours...''

430
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,100
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

431
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,685
lf the mob doesn't get their hands on him now,

432
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:40,510
they will in lock-up or while he's awaiting trial.

433
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:43,870
Any way we look at it, Mario is a dead man.

434
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:47,045
lt's not that crazy of an idea.

435
00:29:47,222 --> 00:29:49,861
Our lives can get a whole lot better tonight

436
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:53,088
and all we gotta do
is speed up the inevitable.

437
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,261
lt's not that bad.

438
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:04,125
Tell me about these bounty hunters.

439
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:10,033
Well, there's three of 'em.
The kid comes from a family of cops.

440
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:12,358
He's tried again and again to get on the force,

441
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:15,854
but he had an accident or something
a few years ago playing hockey.

442
00:30:16,045 --> 00:30:20,084
He'd probably make a great officer,
but the force just won't take him on.

443
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:23,018
Hmm. The girl?

444
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:25,611
Don't let her good looks fool you.

445
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,792
She can kick some serious ass.
l've seen it myself.

446
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:32,973
Tell me about this, uh, Ridley.

447
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:35,537
Neighbourhood hero.

448
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:38,683
He gives away free karate lessons
to underprivileged kids,

449
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:41,327
organises midnight basketball tournaments,

450
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:43,364
anything to keep the kids off the street.

451
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:45,366
Why?

452
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,880
Don't know for sure,
but from what the guys tell me

453
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:51,471
is that years ago he was engaged
to his college sweetheart,

454
00:30:51,664 --> 00:30:53,894
Meagan something or other.

455
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:57,511
They were gonna get married,
but one night she was in a convenience store

456
00:30:57,712 --> 00:31:00,272
when some punk decided to hold the place up.

457
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:03,336
lt turned into the OK Corral, she died,

458
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,707
and apparently
this guy had jumped bail a week earlier.

459
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:10,365
Hmm.

460
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:12,830
But they're just fucking bounty hunters.

461
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:16,178
l don't know what else to tell you, sir.

462
00:31:58,358 --> 00:31:59,837
When and where?

463
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:03,175
You've made a very wise decision,
my bounty hunter friend.

464
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:18,227
Let me see if l understand the situation.

465
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:24,161
l can explain, OK, Mr Lambino?

466
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,337
Let me see if l understand the situation.

467
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,426
These bounty hunters came out of nowhere.

468
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:30,831
Shh, shh, shh.

469
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:36,640
Mm-hm.

470
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:43,841
You got caught selling a couple of lousy
dime bags to some kids in a mall.

471
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:48,475
Then you jump bail,
which l suppose l can understand,

472
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:51,773
cos if l was stupid enough to get caught,

473
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:54,866
well, l'd be stupid enough to jump bail too.

474
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,678
No, l... No, l...

475
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:02,808
And then, on top of it,

476
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:06,481
you go and get caught
by these bounty hunters.

477
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,194
But, no, you don't go back to lock-up.

478
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:12,462
ln your infinite wisdom,

479
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:18,359
you decide to tell them
where my ex-associate is hiding.

480
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:21,447
l had to.
They were gonna take me back. l...

481
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:23,602
Shh, shh, shh.

482
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:30,529
So now l have to go pay a million dollars
to these bounty hunters

483
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,664
to get Mario back,

484
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,227
cos if l don't, they're gonna take him
straight to the cops

485
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:40,419
and that little piece of shit will rat me out.

486
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:43,737
ls that about right?

487
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:47,630
Everything's gonna be OK, though.
Your guys are gonna take care of it, right?

488
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:51,920
Do you know what, uh,
diffusion of responsibility is?

489
00:33:55,353 --> 00:33:56,866
No, no, l don't.

490
00:33:56,981 --> 00:34:01,657
lt's a social phenomenon...
where in a group of people,

491
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:05,451
no one person will take responsibility
for doing the right thing.

492
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:08,534
They just assume somebody else is gonna do it.

493
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:16,016
Like, for example,
a guy breaks into the apartment of another guy.

494
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,172
Jesus, is it hot in here or is it just me?

495
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:26,400
OK, so this guy starts to beat him up,
l mean, really beat him up.

496
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:31,426
All the neighbours can hear everything,

497
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,231
but no-one decides
to pick up the phone and call 91 1 .

498
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:39,514
Why, hmm?

499
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:45,724
Diffusion of responsibility.

500
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:50,065
lt's a beautiful thing.

501
00:34:54,665 --> 00:35:00,820
OK, so in this little scenario,
two things can happen.

502
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:06,762
One, either no-one lifts a finger
and the guy gets beaten to death.

503
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:13,454
Or...some Good Samaritan - slim chance -

504
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:19,324
some Good Samaritan decides
to pick up the phone and call the cops.

505
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:32,326
So, tell me...

506
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:40,573
..in this scenario, who am l?

507
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:48,559
l don't know, man.
Like...the guy who picks up the phone?

508
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,795
No.

509
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:54,600
l'm the guy who broke
into the apartment in the first place.

510
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:03,726
Oh, God.

511
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,203
He sent Francis.

512
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,281
CHASE: Let's go, dick-nuts.

513
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:31,189
FRANClS: All right, people,
this is how it works.

514
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,422
Bag of money out of the trunk,
this bag of shit in the trunk. Let's go.

515
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:38,522
- Why do you want him dead?
- What?

516
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,045
Why do you want Mario dead?
He didn't rat you out.

517
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:44,071
Let's just say my boss is big on insurance, OK?

518
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:47,987
My old man says insurance
is a real whore's business.

519
00:36:48,158 --> 00:36:49,432
Your old man is a smart guy.

520
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:52,765
Now, grab your fucking money
and toss this fucker in the trunk.

521
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:54,388
No.

522
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:58,013
Back off, honey. l would really hate
to blow that pretty face off your skull.

523
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,928
You don't point a fucking gun at her.

524
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:03,241
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys! Guys! Whoa!

525
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:07,685
Oh, fuck!

526
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:09,835
My nuts! Fuck!

527
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:15,985
Yeah, l'm OK. Go after Mario.

528
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,270
Mario, game's over.
Get in the fucking trunk.

529
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:33,559
Fuck you, Francis.

530
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:36,947
Fuck! Jules.

531
00:37:40,629 --> 00:37:42,620
Don't fucking move, dick-nuts!

532
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:53,123
- l need some help here, please!
MAN: We need a gurney up here!

533
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:55,300
She was hit by a car.

534
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:01,791
You're gonna be OK, Jules.
They're gonna take good care of you.

535
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,735
Sir, l'm sorry. You need to stay here.

536
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,579
Here's her stuff.
All her information's in there.

537
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:10,209
Sir. Sir, you're gonna need
to fill out these forms.

538
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:13,526
Sir.

539
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:17,093
Here's my card.
Call me as soon as you know anything.

540
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:31,294
(Music and chatter)

541
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,661
FRANClS: Fuck off.

542
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:06,544
This is my sleeping and shitting place.
You fuck off.

543
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,316
FRANClS: Suit yourself.

544
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,539
You a cop?

545
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,562
You either fuck off or shut the fuck up.
l'm trying to concentrate over here.

546
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,820
- Hello?
- lt's me.

547
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,959
You have any idea how long
l've been waiting for your fucking call?

548
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:53,608
Well, deal went bad. Mario got away.

549
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,080
Don't tell me this, Francis.

550
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,553
Well, one of those fucking bounty hunters

551
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:04,888
decided at the last fucking second
to grow a fucking conscience.

552
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:06,872
lt was that bitch.

553
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,946
l still got the cash, but they have Mario.

554
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,873
On the bright side of things, though...

555
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,870
l think l may have put
that fucking broad into the hospital.

556
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,629
lf you think l actually care about the money,

557
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:24,227
then you clearly don't understand
the fucking situation.

558
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:30,416
lf anybody in the organisation finds out
that we had a chance to bring him in

559
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,117
and that we fucked that opportunity up,
guess what?

560
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,148
We're dead.

561
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,782
(Grunts)

562
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:39,932
Shit.

563
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:43,298
Jesus, Francis.
Am l interrupting a blow job or something?

564
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,276
Wouldn't that be nice? lt's nothing.

565
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:51,811
Hey! Your friend's hurt!

566
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,799
You shut up.

567
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:57,949
He's bleeding all over my sink.

568
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,240
What's going on, Francis?

569
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,369
Hold on a second, Hal.

570
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:09,011
(Gunshot)

571
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:16,452
- Sorry about that, boss.
- What the hell is going on?

572
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:20,114
l got shot. l'm just patching myself up.

573
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:29,581
Listen, send everything you've got
on these fuckers to my cellphone.

574
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,655
l'll take care of it.

575
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:35,254
No. l want you to meet me back at my place.

576
00:41:35,455 --> 00:41:39,687
With all due respect,
l don't think we have time for that.

577
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:44,116
- Francis, back here now.
- As you wish.

578
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:56,204
Let's go.

579
00:41:58,102 --> 00:42:00,058
Who the fuck was the guy that ran over Jules?

580
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:02,749
Francis, Hal's right-hand man
and a fucking nut case.

581
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:05,288
lf it's so important to get you back,
why send one guy?

582
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:08,357
Usually if that guy's Francis, that's all you need.

583
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:11,284
Besides, Hal would wanna keep this quiet.

584
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:14,521
Great. A mob boss that has a hit man after us.

585
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:18,172
So the fact that we found you and that
you're in the back of our van means...

586
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,888
You're fucked, huh?

587
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:23,914
Then fuck it, we hand him back to the mob
on a silver platter.

588
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,520
All the more incentive
to collect the million bucks.

589
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:29,708
What do you wanna do?

590
00:42:31,804 --> 00:42:33,203
We wait.

591
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:36,378
You heard him. Get in the van.
Get in the fucking van.

592
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:40,762
Yes, l'm sorry.

593
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:45,202
Yes, l'm very sorry, dear.

594
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,479
l... You're ab...
You're absolutely right.

595
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:50,648
lt was my fault.

596
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:57,502
Yeah, of course you can stay
another week in ltaly.

597
00:42:57,707 --> 00:42:59,504
Yeah, l love you too.

598
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:03,633
The wife?

599
00:43:03,754 --> 00:43:05,267
(Sighs)

600
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:08,134
She's staying another week in ltaly -
with her friends.

601
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:11,930
Do you have an idea
how much shoes cost in ltaly?

602
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:17,451
ltalian-made shoes cost more over there
than they do over here. l don't get it.

603
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,719
(Door opens)

604
00:43:20,688 --> 00:43:24,363
You remember Deacon
and his associate Ruby?

605
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:30,874
- Competition?
HAL: No, Francis.

606
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,069
Replacements.

607
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:46,524
- What time do you have?
- l don't know.

608
00:43:46,673 --> 00:43:53,112
lt's either really early or really late,
depends on how you look at it. Why?

609
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:58,716
lt's been a while. l thought we would
have heard from the hospital by now.

610
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:05,647
So you think we can get this resolved
without Hal cutting our nuts off?

611
00:44:07,487 --> 00:44:10,559
RlDLEY: Just be cool and it'll all be good.

612
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:43,512
OK. Keep an eye on those two.
l'll check the van for Mario.

613
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:03,409
Officer.

614
00:45:06,924 --> 00:45:10,234
Evening, Officer.
Can l get you a coffee?

615
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:19,443
OK. l'll be over there if you need me.

616
00:45:43,502 --> 00:45:45,493
OK, l gotta take a piss.

617
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:16,234
Good evening, Officer.

618
00:46:19,915 --> 00:46:21,906
Excuse me, sir.

619
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:25,274
Can l help you with something?
This is my van.

620
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,211
This is your van?

621
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:36,729
Yeah, it is. ls there a problem?

622
00:46:38,977 --> 00:46:41,969
l just heard a bit of a disturbance in there.

623
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:45,503
Just a rowdy bail jumper.
We're just taking him to lock-up.

624
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:50,784
Listen, l'm just waiting on my partner.

625
00:46:50,948 --> 00:46:53,542
Like l said, we're just taking him to lock-up.

626
00:46:57,036 --> 00:46:59,675
So you decided to take him to lock-up?

627
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:02,107
Yeah, that's what we do.

628
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,970
l'm afraid l can't let you do that.

629
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:06,801
Why's that?

630
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:10,359
Cos the boss wants him dead.
Give me the keys.

631
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:13,668
l can't do that.
My partner has them inside.

632
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:20,123
Get the keys from the partner.

633
00:47:21,396 --> 00:47:23,466
- (Door opens and closes)
- Oh, shit, Ridley.

634
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:27,565
What's going on with that hot Asian porn cop?
She's awesome.

635
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:31,248
You know l'm a sucker for Asians,
let alone in a cop outfit.

636
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,884
You know how tough it is
to take a piss with a hard-on?

637
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:42,198
Sorry about that, Officer.
l think you got the wrong room.

638
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:45,607
This is a men's room
and you're obviously not a man.

639
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,185
You're a fantastic-looking Asian girl.

640
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:52,288
OK. There's a woman's bathroom down the...

641
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:57,377
Give me my fucking...

642
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:02,951
Obviously you have a white belt.

643
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:06,913
Now quit flirting and give me my keys.

644
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:09,229
Yes.

645
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,312
Shit.

646
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:37,630
Pull that fucking thing out.

647
00:48:40,311 --> 00:48:43,781
So l guess it's safe to assume
that you're not on the force.

648
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:56,860
What the fuck?

649
00:48:58,163 --> 00:49:03,032
Everybody knows Asians can't drive.
lt's ridiculous.

650
00:49:07,673 --> 00:49:09,789
- They're not cops!
- Chase, watch out!

651
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:13,252
(Siren wails)

652
00:49:32,656 --> 00:49:34,567
- You OK?
- Yeah, boss.

653
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:37,169
- Put you hands down. Let's go.
- All right.

654
00:49:43,209 --> 00:49:45,677
OK, Mario, who the fuck was that?

655
00:49:45,837 --> 00:49:49,796
Ruby and Deacon.
l haven't seen those two characters in years.

656
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:53,841
Hal only ever calls them out
when he wants something done...really quietly.

657
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:55,533
That was real fucking quiet.

658
00:49:56,514 --> 00:50:00,302
This is bad. Me, l'm already dead.

659
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:04,228
But you two, huh?
You two are in some serious shit now.

660
00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:07,112
No, it's fine,
because you're going back to lock-up

661
00:50:07,277 --> 00:50:09,711
and the cops are gonna be on Hal's ass.

662
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:15,334
Hey. Hey! You guys give me up
and Hal's gonna be gunning for you.

663
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:18,336
Mario, give it up.
l can see the station now.

664
00:50:19,164 --> 00:50:21,917
Dead man walking.

665
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:24,439
CHASE: Actually, dead man driving.

666
00:50:25,378 --> 00:50:27,892
You're an idiot.
You're back there for a reason.

667
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:30,926
So shut your cocksucker
and let us do our job.

668
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:44,048
- Yeah.
- (Ruby yells)

669
00:50:44,146 --> 00:50:46,819
Cops busted the place
before we could get Mario.

670
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:48,622
- What's with Ruby?
- She...

671
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:50,292
(Yelling)

672
00:50:50,404 --> 00:50:52,360
She hurt her foot. She's fine.

673
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:54,241
(Yelling)

674
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:55,924
What the fuck is she saying?

675
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:59,548
She's just a bit angry.
She wants to get even with them.

676
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:02,306
OK, it's time for plan B.

677
00:51:03,586 --> 00:51:06,146
l'm gonna send some information to your cell.

678
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:09,916
- l'm sure Ruby's gonna make good use of it.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:29,759
(Phone rings)

680
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:32,542
- ls it the hospital?
- Unknown caller.

681
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:35,609
Oh, shit. We're in trouble now.

682
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:37,775
CHASE: Hello?

683
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,667
You know, in ancient Roman times,

684
00:51:40,788 --> 00:51:44,098
it was considered a major offence
for a man to go back on his word.

685
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:46,090
Yeah, things got a little fucked up.

686
00:51:47,087 --> 00:51:48,964
Yeah, you could say that.

687
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:54,880
l suggest that you get into that pretty little van
of yours and leave the station right now.

688
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,773
What? How the fuck
do you know where we are?

689
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:01,479
Well, a guy in my position can make a few calls

690
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:05,679
and use that little device you have on your dash
to trace your exact location.

691
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:11,053
That's how my friends found your little tea party.
Aren't those things amazing?

692
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,470
See, mine's got a lady's voice

693
00:52:13,614 --> 00:52:17,084
and she tells me when to turn left
and when to turn right.

694
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:19,401
And if yours had a lady's voice,

695
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:22,689
she be telling you to turn Mario
over to me right about now.

696
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:26,947
Fuck you. Mario's gonna be in the care of
the real metro police in less than a minute.

697
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:30,366
Yeah? What's your girlfriend gonna say
when l tell her you threw away

698
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,984
the only bargaining chip
that could save her life?

699
00:52:33,136 --> 00:52:36,173
You stay away from her, Hal.
l swear to God, you touch her

700
00:52:36,347 --> 00:52:39,259
and l'll put you through so much pain
you'd never have imagined.

701
00:52:39,432 --> 00:52:42,583
Yeah, l doubt it. You bring me Mario!

702
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:43,963
Fuck you.

703
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:50,497
(Door slams)

704
00:52:51,488 --> 00:52:52,682
Let's get to the hospital.

705
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:11,766
l need you to check on a patient.
Jules Taylor.

706
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:15,474
- She was just admitted tonight.
- Are you the one who dropped her off?

707
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,389
Yeah, yeah, that was me.
l need you to check on her. lt's a security issue.

708
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:21,395
Please hold.

709
00:53:28,066 --> 00:53:31,024
- What are they saying?
- They got me on hold.

710
00:53:31,196 --> 00:53:34,233
Fuck it. Don't even worry about it.
We're almost there.

711
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,464
Ridley, they're in the ambulance!
Go, go, go!

712
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:43,419
RlDLEY: Jules!

713
00:53:50,382 --> 00:53:52,657
- (Door opens)
RlDLEY: Go, go, go!

714
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:12,943
RlDLEY: Go left, left, left.
- l'm going, l'm going. Fuck!

715
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:24,784
- Go, go, go, go!
- l am, for fuck's sakes!

716
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:41,544
- Get up beside him.
- l'm getting close. Wait.

717
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:54,884
Pull over! Pull the fuck over!

718
00:54:55,032 --> 00:54:56,909
Shoot him!
Shoot him in the fucking head!

719
00:54:57,034 --> 00:54:58,228
Pull over, motherfucker!

720
00:55:02,205 --> 00:55:04,002
Shit!

721
00:55:04,123 --> 00:55:06,114
Fuck!

722
00:55:52,175 --> 00:55:55,372
- This van's a piece a shit. Shit!
- Step on it!

723
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:05,071
What the hell's going on back there?

724
00:56:08,817 --> 00:56:10,489
Hurry the hell up!

725
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:31,405
Jules! Jesus Christ,
the back door's open. Fuck!

726
00:56:40,182 --> 00:56:41,171
(Siren wails)

727
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:43,655
RlDLEY: Fuck! Fuck me! Got to catch 'em.

728
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,551
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

729
00:56:52,737 --> 00:56:54,375
Fuck!

730
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:57,686
- Go to the left.
- l can't! There's a car there!

731
00:56:57,867 --> 00:57:00,176
RlDLEY: Jules! For fuck's sakes!

732
00:57:00,328 --> 00:57:02,478
CHASE: Fuck! Fuck!

733
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:08,335
RlDLEY: Fuck me!

734
00:57:27,732 --> 00:57:31,122
Fuck. lt's all my fault.

735
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:36,354
l should never have convinced Jules to do this.
She knew it was a bad idea.

736
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:41,156
- lt's not your fault.
- Yes, it is. lt's all my fault.

737
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:44,806
l'm the oldest.
l should have known better. l'm the boss.

738
00:57:44,998 --> 00:57:46,989
(Phone rings)

739
00:57:50,547 --> 00:57:52,981
- Jules?
- Guess again.

740
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:56,011
- Where is she?
- Well, she's not here just yet.

741
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:58,646
But if you wait a few minutes, she will be.

742
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:02,797
- Where do we go from here?
- This time you listen to me.

743
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:08,337
We're gonna make a trade,
Mario for your little friend.

744
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:09,680
Where?

745
00:58:09,774 --> 00:58:12,971
l have a warehouse.
Mario knows about it.

746
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:17,305
lt's on the corner of Markham and Johnson
just outside of town.

747
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:21,605
You can't miss it.
Meet me there in an hour with Mario.

748
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:24,548
lf you're not there in an hour, the girl dies.

749
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,843
Please, guys, you can't turn me over.
They're gonna kill me.

750
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:35,840
- Shut up.
- They'll kill you too.

751
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:38,244
- l said shut up!
- lt's true, Ridley.

752
00:58:38,388 --> 00:58:40,982
We're just a couple of loose ends
to this fucking guy.

753
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:44,497
What would you rather do? Let them kill Jules
and cash in a $1 00,000 bounty?

754
00:58:44,686 --> 00:58:46,597
- That's not what l'm saying.
- What are you saying?

755
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:50,360
l'm just trying to figure out
this fucked-up situation.

756
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:55,197
Chase, if anything happens to Jules,
l won't be able to live with myself.

757
00:58:55,447 --> 00:58:58,359
What do you wanna do?

758
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:02,765
l got a plan.
Basically, l think l can get us all out of this.

759
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,874
But l can't do it alone.

760
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:07,307
What is it? l got your back, you know that.

761
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,610
l haven't worked it all out yet,

762
00:59:09,753 --> 00:59:13,871
but basically we save Jules,
and if Mario lives, bonus.

763
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:17,401
Hey, l don't like this plan.

764
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,586
Shut up.

765
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:26,005
l'll tell you, those friends of yours
better be smart people.

766
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,747
- They have their moments.
- This better be one of them.

767
00:59:28,897 --> 00:59:30,774
You know my friends are gonna fuck you up.

768
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,097
What's that? You trying to scare me?

769
00:59:35,487 --> 00:59:39,765
You have no idea
the things l've done to people in my life.

770
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:43,270
You put the fear of God into me?

771
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:48,210
lf l were you,
l'd start saying my prayers, just in case.

772
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,849
Your colleagues better show up soon.

773
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,713
Watch where you point that.
You wouldn't wanna kill your bargaining chip.

774
00:59:54,927 --> 00:59:57,839
Don't worry about me, honey.
This isn't my first dance.

775
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,765
l took out insurance.
Now get the fuck going.

776
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,931
Hands off, bitch.

777
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:15,450
You slap like a girl.

778
01:00:15,572 --> 01:00:18,644
When l get these cuffs off,
l'm gonna show you how a real bitch slaps.

779
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,815
Come on, knock it off!

780
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:42,506
Fucking girls. Come on.

781
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:46,509
Hallelujah!

782
01:01:05,748 --> 01:01:07,739
Mario, out of the van.

783
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:13,200
Look, this is the best l can do.
All l ask is that you don't use it till Jules is safe.

784
01:01:13,424 --> 01:01:15,619
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, and don't use it on us.

785
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,750
- All right.
- Now walk.

786
01:01:26,312 --> 01:01:30,146
lt's good to see you, Mario. Real good.

787
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:32,713
- Fuck you, Hal.
- Oh!

788
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:35,327
ls that any way to talk to an old friend?

789
01:01:35,488 --> 01:01:39,401
You been trying to kill me,
so l'd say the ''fuck you'' is in order.

790
01:01:39,617 --> 01:01:42,131
OK, fair enough.

791
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:45,914
l don't wanna break up your little reunion,
but let's do this.

792
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:50,439
You like to get right down to business.
Good man.

793
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:55,064
Jules, you OK?
Take the fucking cuffs off her.

794
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:09,982
RlDLEY: l wouldn't do that!
HAL: All right, Mario, get over here.

795
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:13,906
l never talked to the feds, Hal.
l swear l never told 'em anything.

796
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:19,230
We're gonna know for sure after Francis
works you over for a couple of days.

797
01:02:19,492 --> 01:02:22,609
Now shut up and get over here.

798
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:34,187
(Whispers) Get down.

799
01:02:38,928 --> 01:02:40,919
Shit!

800
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:46,462
l'll get Hal, you get the other guy.

801
01:02:46,604 --> 01:02:48,879
- What about Jules?
- She can handle that bitch.

802
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:50,898
- And Mario?
- He's on his own.

803
01:02:51,024 --> 01:02:52,742
We've done all we can for him. Let's go.

804
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,054
Go!

805
01:02:55,904 --> 01:02:58,338
# BETTY MOON AND NORMAN ORENSTElN:
Mean Girl

806
01:04:25,496 --> 01:04:26,815
Ah, fuck!

807
01:05:12,338 --> 01:05:14,932
Sorry. My Cantonese is a little rusty.

808
01:05:55,257 --> 01:05:56,690
Shit!

809
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:08,146
Fucking piece of shit.

810
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:19,896
OK, get up.

811
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,200
You're lucky we found you so easy.

812
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:27,102
Otherwise l would have gotten your daughter.

813
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:16,524
You have no idea the things
l'm gonna do to you when this is over, Mario!

814
01:08:18,946 --> 01:08:21,176
lt's over. Come on.

815
01:08:27,497 --> 01:08:29,488
Put the gun down.

816
01:08:33,003 --> 01:08:36,075
Mario, you can come out now. lt's OK.

817
01:08:40,302 --> 01:08:42,293
Your friends all right?

818
01:08:42,763 --> 01:08:46,073
Jules, Chase, are you all right?

819
01:08:46,266 --> 01:08:48,575
CHASE: Yeah, we're OK.

820
01:08:52,188 --> 01:08:54,782
Jesus, Chase, are you OK?

821
01:08:54,942 --> 01:08:56,933
No, he's not.

822
01:08:58,571 --> 01:09:02,769
- lf Chase dies, so do you.
- Maybe, maybe not.

823
01:09:04,244 --> 01:09:05,233
(Gunshot)

824
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:15,536
- lt's about time you showed up.
MARlO: Francis.

825
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,750
Mario.

826
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:30,008
HAL: Like l told your little friend here,
this isn't my first dance.

827
01:09:30,228 --> 01:09:33,584
l brought backup and insurance.

828
01:09:34,566 --> 01:09:38,718
- l can see that.
- Francis there, he's my backup.

829
01:09:38,946 --> 01:09:41,824
And his duffle bag, that's my insurance.

830
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,265
RlDLEY: Yeah, how so?

831
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:49,006
There's a million dollars in it.
l'm still willing to pay you for Mario.

832
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:52,964
No deal. We know you're just gonna kill him.

833
01:09:53,127 --> 01:09:56,722
Come on, look around you.

834
01:09:56,923 --> 01:09:59,835
There are four people
pointing guns at each other,

835
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,524
and your buddy here is bleeding to death.

836
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:06,740
And this pretty girl, well,
she's got a gun pointed to her head.

837
01:10:06,933 --> 01:10:12,724
So either we all start shooting
until one of us maybe crawls out of here alive

838
01:10:13,022 --> 01:10:15,855
or you do the smart thing, take the money,

839
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:18,096
and you leave that piece of shit for me.

840
01:10:18,236 --> 01:10:20,352
Like l said, l can't do that.

841
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:23,764
- l can.
- What?

842
01:10:26,036 --> 01:10:29,312
- Give me the bag, Francis.
- What are you doing?

843
01:10:29,497 --> 01:10:33,809
Either way l end up in jail or dead.

844
01:10:34,044 --> 01:10:36,512
So l'm walking out of here
with that bag of money

845
01:10:36,673 --> 01:10:39,870
and letting you guys shoot each other,
that's what l'm doing.

846
01:10:40,052 --> 01:10:43,522
Mario! You try to take that bag and l'll kill her.

847
01:10:44,597 --> 01:10:47,873
Go ahead, shoot the bitch.

848
01:10:48,059 --> 01:10:51,449
HAL: l'm fucking serious, Mario.
l'm gonna shoot her.

849
01:10:52,814 --> 01:10:57,410
And l'm gonna shoot Francis here
unless he gives me that fucking bag.

850
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:00,804
RlDLEY: Mario, you're making
the situation worse.

851
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:05,380
Francis, l'm gonna put
every bullet of this gun into you

852
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:09,133
unless you give me
that fucking bag right now.

853
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:12,322
Please, they're gonna shoot her.
You can't do this.

854
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:17,779
Watch me.

855
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:26,722
Blanks. l'm sorry.

856
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:29,675
l'm not.

857
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:45,902
You guys are un-fucking-believable.

858
01:11:46,078 --> 01:11:47,670
What now?

859
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:52,923
lt's easy.
You take the money, l walk out of here.

860
01:11:53,127 --> 01:11:56,642
- l can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

861
01:11:56,838 --> 01:11:59,875
OK, l'll just shoot the bitch

862
01:12:00,051 --> 01:12:04,647
and then l'll use her body as a shield
as l make my way back to my car. How's that?

863
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:08,961
You're gonna put the gun down
and we're gonna take you in.

864
01:12:09,185 --> 01:12:11,824
- What's in that for me?
- You get to live.

865
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:16,178
lf l go to prison, l'm finished.

866
01:12:16,401 --> 01:12:19,199
Finished?

867
01:12:19,362 --> 01:12:21,717
- Finishing move.
- What?

868
01:12:21,864 --> 01:12:23,695
Yeah, finishing move. Why not?

869
01:12:25,787 --> 01:12:28,620
Chase, you know it?

870
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:30,744
l love the finishing move.

871
01:12:31,875 --> 01:12:33,786
Everyone loves the finishing move.

872
01:12:33,918 --> 01:12:35,510
Now!

873
01:12:42,176 --> 01:12:44,610
Jules, you OK?

874
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:53,121
Finishing move, huh?

875
01:12:53,313 --> 01:12:55,349
l told you l love that finishing move.

876
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,771
Hey, guys.

877
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:06,149
l think l'm dying over here.

878
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:13,935
Oh, yeah, l'm dying. Oh, God.

879
01:13:18,965 --> 01:13:20,956
RlDLEY: lt's over.

880
01:13:23,554 --> 01:13:25,351
CHASE: Oh, fuck.
JULES: You all right?

881
01:13:25,471 --> 01:13:28,861
- Fantastic. Doesn't it look like it?
RlDLEY: Come on, buddy.

882
01:13:32,896 --> 01:13:35,774
- Fucking gangsters.
- You're not hurt that bad.

883
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,329
No, not at all.

884
01:13:38,484 --> 01:13:41,362
A million dollars, guys.
Not bad for a day's work.

885
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:43,565
Not bad at all.

886
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:49,600
Peter Wallace, bail enforcement agents!
Open up!

887
01:14:49,767 --> 01:14:52,884
Just once l wanna see one of these pricks
actually open the door.

888
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:55,053
l brought a key.

889
01:14:56,733 --> 01:14:58,212
- lt doesn't work.
MAN: Cut it!

890
01:14:58,318 --> 01:15:01,993
- OK! Cut it.
- You fucking tramp.

891
01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:14,283
Want a French fry?

892
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:17,011
MAN: All right, cut.

893
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:23,208
All right, cut!

894
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:28,671
- Why is he going fast?
- Slow the fuck down!

895
01:15:28,849 --> 01:15:30,077
(Laughter)

896
01:15:31,769 --> 01:15:35,239
Peter Wallace, bail enforcement agents!
Come out!

897
01:15:36,773 --> 01:15:38,764
Peter Wallace?

898
01:15:42,656 --> 01:15:45,409
- Get the fuck out of my house!
- Get the fuck off my back!

899
01:15:45,576 --> 01:15:47,646
MAN: Cut!

900
01:15:47,785 --> 01:15:49,855
(Sighs)

901
01:15:49,997 --> 01:15:52,557
Oh, look who it is.
l was just talking about you.

902
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:56,860
l've actually been worried sick.
Looks like you've been worried sick too.

903
01:15:57,087 --> 01:16:02,115
l'm an idiot. l apologise.
l didn't know you'd be in this washroom.

904
01:16:02,385 --> 01:16:04,945
Officer, let's just rewind this whole situation,

905
01:16:05,095 --> 01:16:08,451
take it back like five minutes and then
maybe l could take you out on a date.

906
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,471
We could go for doughnuts. You like them.

907
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,114
You probably don't eat them.
Your figure's fantastic.

908
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,420
l could play with your hair, we could cuddle.

909
01:16:15,564 --> 01:16:17,555
MAN: OK, let's go back this up.

910
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:22,402
You obviously heard that,
so l'm not gonna pretend to take it back

911
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:24,050
and l'm kind of glad you heard it.

912
01:16:24,157 --> 01:16:26,830
So what l wanna do is maybe
ask you out on a date, be polite.

913
01:16:26,994 --> 01:16:28,746
l could take you go-karting or golfing

914
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:32,146
or Chinese food or Japanese food
or whatever you are,

915
01:16:32,332 --> 01:16:35,369
but, l don't know, l like it, and l like you.

916
01:16:35,544 --> 01:16:38,456
And l wouldn't mind taking you out on a date.

917
01:16:38,629 --> 01:16:42,668
We both have badges. Why don't we
rub 'em together, like our genitals?

918
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:52,843
(Yells)

919
01:16:54,438 --> 01:16:56,429
(Mutters)

920
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:58,556
Jesus Christ!

921
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:07,816
(Laughter)

922
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:15,293
Peter, put the toy gun down
and come up with your hands out.

923
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:31,790
Were you thinking about adding
another man or woman?

924
01:17:31,977 --> 01:17:33,251
- Woman.
- Man.

925
01:17:33,353 --> 01:17:34,342
No, a woman.

926
01:17:34,437 --> 01:17:37,076
lf l want the sensation of a man's lips
around my genitals,

927
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:40,304
l'll take out two of my ribs
and suck myself off there, sweetheart.

928
01:17:41,612 --> 01:17:42,601
Semen.

929
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:44,926
And what l also want,
l wanna be respected.

930
01:17:45,073 --> 01:17:48,110
When l pull my junk out,
l don't want any laughing like last time.

931
01:17:48,285 --> 01:17:50,958
- lt's hilarious.
- l don't think it's cool personally.

932
01:17:51,121 --> 01:17:55,512
l demand respect even though l'm not gonna
respect this establishment or the chicks in it.

933
01:17:55,753 --> 01:17:58,392
- Cool?
- So are you good with all that?

934
01:17:58,546 --> 01:18:00,104
- Yeah.
- Can you do that?

935
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:03,729
We can do that. Were you thinking about
adding another woman or...?

936
01:18:03,927 --> 01:18:05,838
- lt doesn't matter.
- Man, two of 'em.

937
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:08,279
- Men.
- Follow me, please.

938
01:18:08,432 --> 01:18:10,343
Perfect.

939
01:18:10,475 --> 01:18:12,466
Let's go, sweetheart.

940
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:15,556
Welcome to the Lounge.
How can l help you?

941
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,123
l want about half a dozen chicks.

942
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:21,224
l don't give a shit if they're Asian, black, foreign,
as long as they don't speak English.

943
01:18:21,445 --> 01:18:24,517
l wanna get an eight ball
with about three shots of whisky.

944
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:28,487
Three shots of whisky is key because
l'm gonna have one, she's gonna have two.

945
01:18:28,702 --> 01:18:31,421
When we're all buzzed up,
l'm gonna get a steaming erection

946
01:18:31,579 --> 01:18:35,174
take a Viagra and then hang
hockey equipment off my dick.

947
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:37,970
And while l do it,
you're gonna take 'em off and put 'em on.

948
01:18:38,129 --> 01:18:40,689
Then l'll fuck you in the ass
because that's what l like.

949
01:18:40,839 --> 01:18:44,514
l like fucking hockey players in the ass
and she likes to watch and diddle herself.

950
01:18:44,718 --> 01:18:46,674
- High five, bitch.
- Yeah, let's do it.

951
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,956
Welcome to the Lounge.
Were you thinking about...

952
01:18:51,142 --> 01:18:52,860
l want a man, she wants a woman,

953
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:55,411
but l also want a clown in a werewolf mask.

954
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,555
(Laughter)

955
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,975
MAN: Still rolling!

956
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,025
MAN 2: Cut, cut!

957
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,630
- Look at that.
- Wow.

958
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:07,380
Huh? Watch this.

959
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:10,848
Don't get trapped into buying it
when you can try it for free.

960
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:15,668
That's brilliant. That's so, so funny.
Can you do it again?

961
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,397
That's so funny. Wow.

962
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,733
l like that.
Maybe we could have a happy ending.

963
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,791
- Thanks.
- High five?

964
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,323
THE END
