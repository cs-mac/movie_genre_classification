1
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,864
In an unprecedented meteor shower,
falling off the coast of Tokyo.

2
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:18,391
The entire city is mesmerized
by this incredible sight...

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,017
An unidentified enemy have
breached our coastline.

4
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,167
Right now one thing clear.

5
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:35,089
The world is at war.

6
00:00:47,644 --> 00:00:50,464
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time,

7
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:53,637
12 different locations across
the globe was breached.

8
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:58,312
In what appears to be a coordinated
attack by an unknown enemy.

9
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,170
All breaches were along the coastline.

10
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:04,718
In what is a campaign
of rapid dominance.

11
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,314
This is a textbook military invasion.

12
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,782
With massive casualties in New York.

13
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:14,118
Defensive lines are been setup in Boston.

14
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:16,947
and at 13:15 ZULU time,

15
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,158
we lost communication with
San Francisco and San Diego.

16
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:22,252
Their status is unknown.

17
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,587
What we do know is that

18
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,542
we're the last offensive force on the West Coast.

19
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:31,406
We cannot lose Los Angeles.

20
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:47,608
All ... abort!
- Unable to dismount...

21
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,739
Enemies at positions of fire, Over.

22
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:23,437
Good Wednesday morning.

23
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,882
Natural 25 with these surfers'
foundations surfers news report.

24
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:27,337
Surfers!

25
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,013
Hard northeast conditions blowing out there
with the ocean slopping and chopping things up.

26
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:34,020
There is some size starting to earthquake...

27
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:03,799
Good morning, Staff Sergeant!
Morning Staff Sergeant!...

28
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:30,212
You know what they say,

29
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,180
You're only as old as you feel. Staff Sergeant.

30
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,991
That's what I'm worried about.
I can't feel a damn thing.

31
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,956
Now down pacific for out next report:

32
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:46,717
Where what appears to be a small cluster of meteors,

33
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:51,982
is predicted to enter our atmosphere sometime
the early hours of tomorrow morning.

34
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:57,743
They're expected to strike miles from land.
Far into the Pacific Ocean and with the rock...

35
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:01,231
John.
- God.

36
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:04,020
What's up, Mike?

37
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,206
Hey!

38
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:09,849
What happened to that picture of us in
Iraq with that camel? I mean your girlfriend.

39
00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:11,530
Hey, is that for real?

40
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:14,712
It's got your signature on it. I
said that's got to be a mistake.

41
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,878
He can't write.

42
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:18,597
No mistake, John! I did my 20.

43
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:19,506
I know when to get out.

44
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:21,302
C'mon you've got a box full of medals

45
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:24,606
And file full of commendations.
- Well, you can have them.

46
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,647
Seems you like interior decorating.

47
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:28,638
Marines got a shelf life you know.

48
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:30,239
After that!
- What?

49
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:33,334
It spolits...
- Something like that.

50
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,204
I'll finish my training assignment with these Marines,

51
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,798
Get them combat ready.

52
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:41,932
Then I'll be on my merry way.

53
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:45,026
You know we could always use
another lean mean typing machine.

54
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:46,946
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

55
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,980
Ugly, slow, soft.

56
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:57,601
Have to make some tough
calls... That right?

57
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,961
Especially that last one.

58
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,560
We all wish your men made it home.

59
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,667
Here we go.

60
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:20,190
You're expired.

61
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:22,052
Clear the shelf.

62
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,537
Staff Sergeant.

63
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:39,494
Everything I know is in here, John.

64
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,060
What typically would have been
detected months if not years before,

65
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,106
surfaced in less than four hours.

66
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:06,214
These images giving you some idea of the rate,
at which these meteors are traveling.

67
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:10,317
Scientists are advised scrambling 
to try to understand it.

68
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:16,064
You know what? There's something just extremely
uncomfortable well about a man your size sniffing a flower.

69
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:18,034
What you want is some 
hydrangers.

70
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:21,250
Popular wedding flower 
come in green and blue.

71
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:24,130
What color are bridesmaids' 
dresses?

72
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:25,128
Good question.

73
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:28,461
You're amazing... 
Just take a whiff.

74
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,690
Yes, pretty girl?

75
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:35,183
For 300 more, she said we
can have a sprays of lilies.

76
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:37,518
And I know it's a lot, 
but it'll be so beautiful.

77
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:38,651
What do you think baby?

78
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,893
$300 dollars... Goodness gracious...

79
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,053
Well I think it's a no brainer.

80
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:43,722
You're only gonna get 
marry once.

81
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:46,449
Why you gonna worry about 300 bucks.
- Thank you, Stavrou.

82
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,797
Thank you.
- Yeah, no worries.

83
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,175
You know what? It's your day.

84
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:53,113
Do whatever you want.

85
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,853
I'm gonna hit you with something
really heavy. What are you doing?

86
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,584
Busting your balls.
- Tomorrow, we shop for cakes.

87
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,500
And I can't wait
- I love cake.

88
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,733
Yo Doc! What you doing?

89
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:21,221
Skyping back home.
- Is that your girlfriend?

90
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:22,289
Damn! She fine.

91
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:27,215
Doc, my boy.

92
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,067
That's my sister.

93
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:36,402
God damn...

94
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:39,604
Aw, shit I'm just speaking objectively here.
You know what I'm saying?

95
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,770
I think a 20...
Alright! Alright! Stop playing! Stop playing!

96
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,636
Doc? Is it alright if I have one of those roasters?

97
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:53,003
Eat it at your own risk.

98
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:57,416
They're very old.

99
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:04,336
So do you feel that you're making progress?
- Yeah, yeah, yup.

100
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,646
I'm sleeping a lot better.

101
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,159
And then also around the firing range and everything...

102
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:12,171
when I first came back...

103
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,206
I get very jumpy and it would,

104
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:16,236
it would mess with me a little bit...
A little bit of setback.

105
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,930
But now you know...

106
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:20,413
It didn't bother me.

107
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,347
So I think that's progress.

108
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:26,061
So what's the story with my status, Doc?

109
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,797
Are you going to clear me for combat?

110
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,904
Ya, I feel good.

111
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,453
Let's meet again next week and the...

112
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,494
we'll discuss it. Okay?

113
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,725
Alright, Thank you. Thank
you very much, Doc.

114
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:59,435
Here's a girl is making a dude organizes his
entire wedding two weeks before we deploy.

115
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:03,387
I'd say this chick is busting his
balls like nobody's business.

116
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:08,575
Well, he's got two weeks to get
it done cause we're outta here.

117
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:11,579
So I just came by to visit you one
last time before we leave.

118
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:14,381
And I have brought dad's 5 iron with me.

119
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:16,838
You know what that means.

120
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,548
Me and the boys are going to go out
tonight and continue the tradition.

121
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,443
Have a good time, you know.

122
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,558
I'll see you soon, bro,

123
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:35,506
See you soon.

124
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,970
Motown! Give me my boots, I'm going skiing.

125
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,370
Oh, that's how you do it baby.

126
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:45,844
Here they come.

127
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:49,117
Don't mess this up. They cannot
know that you're a virgin. Alright!

128
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:50,268
How do you I...

129
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:51,668
Who say's I'm a virgin?

130
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:55,302
We know you're a virgin.
- What are you telling her?

131
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,440
Telling her what!?

132
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:01,477
C'mon you guys! 
You're killing me!

133
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:05,619
That dawg got hunt!
Damn Doc, you can play man!

134
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:07,579
We've have courses 
in Nigeria. Imlay.

135
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:10,730
Sham! How am I suppose to know that.
This is an American game man!

136
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:14,443
This dude is our naval
corpman. It's like a medic.

137
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:16,513
No! Not like a medic. 
Medic is the army.

138
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,884
And I'm a navy corpman. It's different.

139
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,566
Well, save it and give us the bullshit.

140
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:22,514
I came here to become a doctor.

141
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:27,984
Hey! Slow down.

142
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:30,475
It's like number five!

143
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,290
How many had you've had?
- No, I'm good.

144
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,776
Now this guy over here, Mr. Lenihan!
- Hey!

145
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,094
His mom signed, so he
can join up at 17. And a...

146
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,380
I look after him because this boy
don't know his ass from the hot rock.

147
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:52,439
Not on my trunk! Dude!

148
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,278
A toast to Lenihan.
- To Lenihan!

149
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,873
Good luck, rookie.

150
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:01,219
Retreat Hell!

151
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,453
An emergency developing throughout NASA
and the space community.

152
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:09,653
We now know that the meteors will land
off the coast of eight different cities.

153
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,574
And that number could keep rising.

154
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:14,785
Evacuations now underway
in Southern California.

155
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:17,122
Moving the population
back from the coastline.

156
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:20,352
But a lot of curious people are
clamouring for views as...

157
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:21,693
Why are you doing up so early?

158
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,169
Lieutenant, still gonna get used to that.

159
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:31,484
This thing right?

160
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,348
Here...
- It's shaking.

161
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:35,794
It's gonna be parallel to the deck.

162
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,037
That's the whole thing with these bars.
- Okay...

163
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,149
I'm gone. Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam. Okay?
- Okay.

164
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:43,432
I'll call you later.
- Call you later.

165
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,260
That's my baby. Alright...

166
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:10,211
Let's go! Move!

167
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,734
Quick charge! March!

168
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:25,705
Marines! Into the trucks and
report to your company. Let's go!

169
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:27,406
Move it!
- Let's move!

170
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:28,434
Move it!

171
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:29,834
Load ém up!

172
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:31,652
Move it!

173
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,378
What's going on, First sergeant?

174
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:38,699
Meteor's hitting off California now but...

175
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,092
They've got the whole god damn base being mobilized.

176
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,271
I'm bringing you back to the company. Mike.

177
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:45,559
I need you.

178
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:51,657
First Sergeant.
- All hands on deck, Staff Sergeant.

179
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:59,147
Take it you heard we maybe mobilizing?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:00,857
Moving you up to squad leader.

181
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:03,371
It's a big responsibility.
You can handle it.

182
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,524
Thank you, sir.

183
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:08,595
Staff Sergeant Beck is replaced
by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

184
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:15,096
What do you know him?
- He's a very dedicated Marine.

185
00:13:15,096 --> 00:13:16,426
Don't bullshit me, Corporal.

186
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:20,626
What'd did you hear
about his last tour?

187
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,556
Just the grimy details that
everybody else knows.

188
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,846
But at the end of the day you're our lieutenant

189
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:29,435
and we take our orders from you. Sir.

190
00:13:33,497 --> 00:13:37,824
So you're gonna be assigned to 1st. platoon
under the second Lieutenant Martinez.

191
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:42,262
His platoon sergeant's on leave,
So you're gonna have to suck it up.

192
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,043
So here's the lieutenant,
right up here at 1 o'clock.

193
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,951
He's a kid, Mike.

194
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:51,679
Right out of Officer training school,
he's only with us a month.

195
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,052
But I think he's sharp.

196
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:57,209
It's just an evacuation, buddy.
He's in charge.

197
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,129
Just keep an eye on him. huh?

198
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,132
Just don't lose my paperwork.

199
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,680
Afternoon Lieutenant.
- Good afternoon, Staff Sergeant.

200
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,995
Happy to finally meet you.
- Thank you, sir.

201
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,614
We've been called in, to help
with evacuation, Lieutenant.

202
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,857
Because of these meteors?
- I assume so.

203
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:18,922
Whatever it is, I'm just happy to finally
get out in the field with the men.

204
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:23,083
At approximately at 4:42 am pacific
standard time. The meteors impacted...

205
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,664
Who the hell took my tortelini?
You got tortelini?

206
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,035
Think, this is some kinda drill or what?
- Get ready, man!

207
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,350
Get ready. This is serious. Okay?

208
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:36,504
Meteorites continued to fall off
the coast of California ...

209
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,676
Ireland and the Bay of Bengal.

210
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,470
Corporal.
- Yes.

211
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:43,469
Probably just a training exercise, right?

212
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:46,355
No, man... they shifted Nantz into our unit.
Something must be going on...

213
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:49,870
That's great, the guy wants out of the
Marine Corp. And now we're stuck with him.

214
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:52,697
Stav! You'd got tortelini's?

215
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,988
Well, I heard Nantz kicked asses his last tour.

216
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:58,071
I mean he went into that compound alone
and killed like about 10 insurgents... Didn't he?

217
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:00,457
That's what you heard Lenihan, huh?
That's what you heard!?

218
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:01,276
Yeah!
- Chill out...

219
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,822
Johnson and Foxtrot told me,
- Hey...

220
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:04,839
he was going on like some...
- Don't worry about it...

221
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:07,753
The hell did I do?

222
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:10,602
Nantz got a couple of guys 
killed on his last tour.

223
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,842
What are you talking about?
- Well, that's the story.

224
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,359
Lockett's brother was one of them.

225
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:15,053
So! Now, I know you didn't know about this...

226
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,466
Lockett, man! I'm sorry!
- Man, don't worry about it...

227
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:20,720
Looks like we're getting 
into some heavy shit.

228
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,077
It's been my experience Lieutenant...

229
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,856
heavy shit is highly overrated.

230
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,960
Look, Staff Sergeant.

231
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,360
Let's just be clear.

232
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,949
I know your rep, I know 
what'd you've done.

233
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,040
This is my platoon, these are my men.

234
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,045
Not gonna have a problem, are we?

235
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,128
No problem, Sir. She's all yours.

236
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:40,598
It appears our inital assumptions were wrong.

237
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:43,762
Alright! Listen up!

238
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:44,928
I want you to get your weapon!

239
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:48,162
Get your gear! Get your
muntions! Move outside!

240
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:54,072
White chocolate wrap for my men and
that should finish the new mix, right?

241
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:54,577
Good

242
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:56,222
No...!
- National Guard troops have flown into...

243
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,338
evacuate surrounding meteor areas.

244
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:00,653
And we have word the military is now deploying.

245
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:04,758
Aw, that's us...!

246
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:08,335
Armed military for a meteor shower?
- I don't know why they're so happy?

247
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:11,537
Just a minute. A meteorite 
just hit the ocean,

248
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,034
Large plumes of smoke 
are coming up...

249
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,034
Visibility is getting worse.

250
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:19,611
These objects were completely undetectable
until they entered our atmosphere.

251
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:23,566
NASA estimates that they are not
hitting the water at terminal velocity.

252
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,910
They're slowing down before impact.

253
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,101
These objects in question...

254
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,702
are falling into the ocean in tightly packed clusters.

255
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:35,331
10 miles outside a major population centre.

256
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:38,149
Thermal imaging from the
Hubble telescope shows us that ...

257
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:42,510
within each cluster is a central
object much larger than the others.

258
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:45,688
And these central objects are
all the same geometrical shape.

259
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,981
They appear mechanical in nature.

260
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,089
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

261
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,781
We are in threat con Delta.
That's right!

262
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:56,178
C'mon! All units!

263
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,312
Gear up!

264
00:16:57,512 --> 00:16:58,712
Be ready to move!

265
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:03,343
Combat situation.
- That's what I've been training for.

266
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,862
And just now being told that one of the Coast
Guard cutters have issued a mayday.

267
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,079
It is difficut to see.

268
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,277
Oh my gosh!

269
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:15,006
There's just another meteor
that just hit the ocean.

270
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:16,991
And it's the closest one yet.

271
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:18,947
Right behind those cutters...

272
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,710
There are two or three
meteor's just impacted...

273
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,176
Do we have that information from the studio?

274
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,576
Oh my god.

275
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,712
Hey, hey! Are you hearing us?

276
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:34,058
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

277
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,463
Hey! Are you still hearing us?

278
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:37,749
Yeah. Jean, I can... I can hear you.

279
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,496
What is that...?

280
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,864
I can't really get a good look.

281
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,731
But It appears like there's something ...

282
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:49,835
I... I am looking for the people trying
to determine exactly what this is.

283
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:53,694
Maybe... I don't even know... like shadowy figures...

284
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,115
Maybe 5, 6, 7.

285
00:17:56,315 --> 00:17:58,701
I can make out... maybe...

286
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,186
What the hell is that!?
- holy shit!

287
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:03,586
Look at that!?

288
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,157
I think I'm gonna head back now!

289
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,319
Everyone needs to get
outta here, right now!

290
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:18,174
I think I'm gonna leave, Jean.
I'm gonna head back.

291
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:21,637
Oh my god.

292
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,492
Corporal Grayston and Corporal Imlay
are both expert marksmen.

293
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,468
As well as strong Fire team leaders.

294
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,308
We also have PFC Lenihan
who is our second best marksmen.

295
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,449
Just behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.

296
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,169
Yo! What's your take on this, Specks?

297
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:43,081
I don't know. Extraterrestial?

298
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:46,597
You mean like from space?
- No, Imlay! From Canada.

299
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:48,146
Oh! You've always got jokes. Don't you...

300
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,269
Alright! First squad! Line it
up! Bring it in! Let's go!

301
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:54,191
As you may have heard already!

302
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:57,322
Staff Sergeant Nantz will be
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck!

303
00:18:57,598 --> 00:19:00,064
We're lucky to have him aboard!

304
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,842
Alright! Here's the situation, Marines!

305
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,812
We're facing an unknown enemy!

306
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:08,389
We don't know how strong they're
force is, or what they're capable of!

307
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:10,082
But one thing we do know!

308
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,085
Is that we're fighting for our land!

309
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,791
Our families! Our home!

310
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:15,765
And our Country! God dammit!

311
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:18,676
So whatever those things are!?
Let's go show them how Marines fight!

312
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,022
Retreat!
- Hell!

313
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,704
25!
- Shake Hell!

314
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,909
Let's go!

315
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:36,462
First it. Last out! Marines!

316
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:38,462
Breathe Lenihan!

317
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,739
Breathe! Your training will kick in!
- Thank you! Staff Sergeant!

318
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:45,380
Got something to get off
your chest, Corporal?

319
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,103
No... it's cool Staff Sergeant.

320
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:50,281
You got a Silver Star, my brother
came home in a box. I get it.

321
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:56,566
All stations, stand by for sitrep.

322
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:59,049
Enemy elements have
advanced beyond the beach.

323
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:00,569
Aliens!?

324
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,508
That's not possible? Right!?

325
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,417
We'll know soon enough! Brother!

326
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:15,001
It's in case his head gets blown off,
so that they can identify his body...

327
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:25,772
Yo! Staff Sergeant!?

328
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,523
Promise me you won't let
me be taken alive

329
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:31,395
by some godless predator from
another world. Staff Sergeant!

330
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:35,646
No promises in combat!

331
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:40,014
Stop screwing around and
keep your head in it!

332
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:53,612
My dearest wife.

333
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,290
We're not evacuating civilians fast enough.

334
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,695
I say again: We're not evacuating
fast enough. All units be advised...

335
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,819
There are friends behind enemy lines.

336
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:45,847
You gonna take me to dinner first lady.
- Boys, better hold on to something.

337
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,167
Things are about to get rough.

338
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:33,967
Let's go...!

339
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:49,274
Form it up!

340
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:59,951
What have we got , sir?
- Right. The situation is as follows ...

341
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,512
Most of Santa Monica's been cleared of civilians.

342
00:23:02,593 --> 00:23:06,232
We've got a defense line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

343
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:09,977
Air Force has got Warhogs and B52's on deck.

344
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:15,658
At 19:30 hours, they will pound the
entire area at Lincoln to the ocean.

345
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:23,607
We're leveling Santa Monica, sir?
- We've got a infestation and God knows what!

346
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:26,816
But they are not of this earth! And we
gotta hit them with everything we got!

347
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:28,509
We got to hit ém hard!

348
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,632
They are ground force enemy only.
They have no aircraft...

349
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:34,096
so the airforce will tear them a new asshole.

350
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,736
And we WILL rule the air.

351
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,223
You said, MOST citizens, sir?
- That's a firm.

352
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:40,323
Get a distress call,
sending squads out.

353
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:43,277
Golf: you take Santa Monica to Olympic.

354
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:47,662
Foxtrot: Olympic to Peaco,
Echo: Peaco to Ocean Park.

355
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:49,302
Lieutenant Martinez,

356
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,803
I want you to break off a squad
and a machine guns team.

357
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:56,056
Proceed west from Lincoln to
a police station located here.

358
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:57,953
Venice and Amarosa.

359
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:59,327
Venice and Amarosa.

360
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:03,844
Police were overrun. Got a distress
call that civilians are still there.

361
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,328
We don't know how many?

362
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,736
Just gather survivors and you radio in.

363
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,601
We'll have helicopters in the
area to evacuate you out.

364
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,914
But be advised! You've got exactly
3 hours before our bombs drop.

365
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:16,264
Make no mistake they will DROP.

366
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,877
With or without you.

367
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:20,594
So you get those civilians and
you get the hell out of there.

368
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,942
And you kill anything
that is not human.

369
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,054
Let's go! Let's get it done!

370
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,497
Captain, this is not a drill.

371
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:30,614
You hold that line. You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

372
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:39,268
10,000 moving inland,

373
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:42,019
they are advancing east from
the coastland into the suburbs.

374
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:43,784
Golf company is overrun,

375
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,404
Lema company is requesting immediate air support.

376
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:49,855
Civilians are been stranded
behind enemy lines.

377
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:54,052
Take on 1!
- Fire in the hole!

378
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:10,656
Troops are amassing on every coast,
along every major coastline.

379
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:14,014
The U.N. has called an emergency sitting in an
attempt

380
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:16,448
to establish a means of sharing resources...

381
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:20,821
Watch out! Go!

382
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,345
Which is? This way?
Where we supposed to go?

383
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,797
Jesus Christ.

384
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,610
Marines.

385
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,755
Anything beyond this point.
Considered to be hostile.

386
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,759
Nice and easy.

387
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,506
Okay.

388
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:01,360
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship, right?

389
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:02,394
Shit!

390
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,038
I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

391
00:26:05,004 --> 00:26:07,493
How many civilians you'd think we
gotta get out of that police station?

392
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,822
I have no idea, Guerrero.
Just stay focused.

393
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,047
Hey, what the hell is that?

394
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:19,938
What is that?
- This is insane.

395
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:24,242
Ya, it's open.
- Unidentified enemies has reached our coastline.

396
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:27,137
In a swift and military sneak attack.

397
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:30,647
At this point, there are many
more questions unanswered.

398
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:32,624
Right now one thing is clear,

399
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:35,985
the world is at war.

400
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,725
See something, Simmons?

401
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:44,995
Can't see shit.

402
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:48,730
Kerns! You see across the street?

403
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,955
Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

404
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:53,861
Police station's about 1
click northwest of here.

405
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,913
12 o'clock!
- 100 meters front!

406
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:34,868
Turn the radios down...

407
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:43,422
It's just a dog.

408
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:45,623
Just a little doggy!
Come here, come here.

409
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,401
It's just a dog.
- Dog! Dog! Dog!

410
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:49,417
What's his name?

411
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,982
Glenn. You're kidding me.

412
00:27:50,982 --> 00:27:52,930
Who's the idiot names his
dog these days, Lieutenant?

413
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,891
What'd you want to call him? Friday?

414
00:28:04,364 --> 00:28:07,439
Where's it coming from!?
- I don't know!

415
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,729
On the roof!
- Watch your head!

416
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,516
Enemy fire!

417
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:17,956
Out on the roof! On the roof!
- Cover me!

418
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:25,365
25 meters...!

419
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:28,915
Left flank on the roof!

420
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:33,381
Cover me, Cover me!

421
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:35,086
We got to move now!
- Lockett!?

422
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:35,927
Yes!

423
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:38,075
Get me an exit down that alley!
- Roger!

424
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,029
Kerns! Motown! Let's go!

425
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:47,160
Get up! Falling back...!

426
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
C'mon!

427
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,591
Watch your head!
Keep your head down!

428
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,193
Where did they come!?
- Move it!

429
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:55,597
Enemy fire!
Keep your head down!

430
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:57,286
They're all over the damn place!

431
00:28:57,515 --> 00:29:00,372
What do you see?
- I dont know man! I don't see shit!

432
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:03,918
How do we get outta here!?
- Lieutenant! Where's the exit at!?

433
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:05,800
We're working on it!
- Shit! We're boxed in!

434
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,286
Go take positions by
the wall! Go! Go!

435
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:09,686
Ambush!

436
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,063
Cover me, Lockett!

437
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,229
Man down! Man down!

438
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:36,312
Shit!

439
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:43,861
Medic!

440
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:45,101
Lieutenant!

441
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,859
Lieutenant...!

442
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:56,857
We have an exit!
Everyone move out!

443
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:58,084
Move out! Move...!

444
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:02,112
Staff Sergeant, we got an exit!
C'mon! Go! C'mon! Go!

445
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:05,475
Move back Move back!

446
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:11,273
Move back Move back!

447
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:17,789
Go! Go! Go! Go!

448
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,803
Go! Keep moving! Keep moving!
- Get outta here!

449
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:24,831
Move it!

450
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,703
Lorenzo!
- Move! move! move!

451
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,873
Keep moving...!

452
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:32,761
I can't see shit!

453
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:38,001
Shit! shit! shit!

454
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:39,509
Imlay!

455
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:40,901
Oh god! oh god! oh god!

456
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:47,074
Coming in!
- U.S. Marines! Anybody here!

457
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,661
Kitchen's clear!
Kitchen's clear! Lieutenant!

458
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,085
Get on that window! Are we clear!?
- Put the wounded in the kitchen!

459
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:56,892
Kerns, Lockett! Secure the back of this house.

460
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,733
Yes! Staff Sergeant! We're on it!

461
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:05,299
Doc? How long do they're able to move?
- 10 minutes!

462
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:07,522
10 minutes! Staff Sergeant. 10 minutes!
- You want me, man!?

463
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:10,755
You want me? Try and get some!
I'm right here!

464
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:11,525
What have we got? Imlay?

465
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:14,270
I got nothing, Staff Sergeant.
I can't see a god damn thing!

466
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:16,511
This smoke is zero visibility.
- You're dead!

467
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,681
Stow that shit, Simmons!

468
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:20,801
You're gonna get shot before
you're able to kill any of them!

469
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,514
Your orders, sir?

470
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:25,585
I led us right into that ambush.

471
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:29,466
Mottola, any word on command?
- No, sir.

472
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:31,189
Well, we need to find answers
on how to get out of here!

473
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:32,477
You're in charge, sir.

474
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:35,617
Your orders?

475
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:40,759
Let's radio that evac.

476
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:43,245
Civilians or no we need to get these wounded out.
- Roger that.

477
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:45,601
Hey! Hey! You guys.
Where's Lenihan?

478
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,787
I didn't see him come in with us.
Where the hell is he?

479
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:48,840
Lenihan!?
- Lenihan!?

480
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,260
Anyone got eyes on Lenihan?
- Lenihan!?

481
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:54,316
I'll go for Lenihan, sir.
- Imlay, Harris on me.

482
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,250
Let's get this shit out of here.

483
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,191
I'll package the wounded, 
we're rendezvous on 10th Street.

484
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,971
Roger that.
- Be prepared to move. We're moving out soon.

485
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:15,821
Mottola? Mottola?

486
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:19,298
Oh! C'mon!

487
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:21,452
Mottola, you copy?

488
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,705
Lenihan, where are you?
- Staff Sergeant?

489
00:32:24,663 --> 00:32:24,882
Jesus Christ!

490
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:28,402
I had to take off my radio,
these things are everywhere.

491
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:30,127
We'll coming for you,
what's your location?

492
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:33,844
I'm in the laundry room of
some apartment complex. It's...

493
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:35,715
It's like three stories...

494
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:48,958
Lenihan? Lenihan?

495
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,553
Lenihan... Lenihan...

496
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:22,654
Shit...

497
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,796
Lenihan! Lenihan!
- Lenihan! Lower that weapon!

498
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:44,618
The hell you...

499
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,668
Keep firing!

500
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:59,435
Jesus Christ!
- Shit!

501
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:00,635
What the hell is that thing!?

502
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,962
They're not dead, they don't die.
Hit it a 100 times and they don't die.

503
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,947
You get separated from the unit again.

504
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,347
I'll find you and
shoot you myself.

505
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:11,148
Imlay, drop a grenade in that pool.
Let's move!

506
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:15,896
Frag out!

507
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:29,393
Street's clear.

508
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:32,469
Get down, get down, get down...
- What's happening?

509
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,986
Doc, what's going on?
- Come on...

510
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,097
It's Lenihan.

511
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:43,217
Lockett!
- Huh?

512
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:46,653
You owe me five dollars boy. I told you the
virgin ain't gonna die til he get em some.

513
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:49,951
Move to the police station?

514
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,923
Alright! Let's move, let's move!

515
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,142
Where did they come from!?
- I can't see!

516
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,885
Take care of him.
- Where that shot come from?

517
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:13,823
Kerns! Go! Before they
detect us move!

518
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:17,203
C'mon let's go!
Move! Move! Move!

519
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:20,704
Stavrou, you got front!
Stavrou cover front!

520
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:22,138
Harris, cover front!

521
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,799
Room's clear! Room's clear!

522
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:25,907
I got... I got it covered.

523
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,376
Harris! Find me where
that shot came from, guys!

524
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:31,183
Imlay! Get eyes on that roof! Alright!
- The rooftop. Cover the roof.

525
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:33,274
Roof's clear...!

526
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:34,504
Lockett! On me!

527
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:36,869
Anyone even see where
that came from!?

528
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,352
Doc! How serious?

529
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,890
Third degree thermal burns
on his neck and face, Staff.

530
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,480
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

531
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,274
Hostiles, 11 o'clock!
- Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

532
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:55,367
Staff Sergeant!  Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

533
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,984
Prepare to fire!

534
00:36:59,064 --> 00:37:00,385
Hold it! Hold it!

535
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,482
Friendlies, sir!

536
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,712
Shit...

537
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,133
Friendlies...

538
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:07,821
Let's get them in!

539
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,334
Get over here...

540
00:37:15,373 --> 00:37:16,606
Move! Move to the back! Let's go!

541
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,107
Get in here, get in here.

542
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:22,103
What's your unit?
- 40th I.D.

543
00:37:22,444 --> 00:37:23,882
Where's the rest of your unit?

544
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,762
Everyone else is either 
dead or missing.

545
00:37:27,886 --> 00:37:29,958
I picked up the Air Force here.

546
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:33,482
Tech Sergeant Alena
Santos, Air Force. 61st. Wing.

547
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:36,200
Intel surveillance, recon division.

548
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:38,724
Tech Sergeant, what the
hell you doing here?

549
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,006
We were tracking enemy transmissions,
about 12 clicks south of here.

550
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:46,091
They ambushed us. Like they
knew our freaking address.

551
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:47,431
I'm the only one left,

552
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:50,687
I found these guys on the way to
the safe zone at the Santa Monica Airport.

553
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,952
You ready to use that
weapon? Tech sergeant?

554
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:56,229
With all due respect, Staff Sergeant.

555
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,225
I didn't get this far off
on my good looks.

556
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:01,195
I'm ready for payback.
- Outstanding...

557
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:06,513
Lieutenant, we're burning about 25 minutes, sir!
- Roger that.

558
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:08,889
Let's get to that police station.

559
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,681
Alright! Let's get Simmons to move!
Let's go!

560
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:11,951
Here we go!

561
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:19,742
Into the right! In that building!
- Watch your feet!

562
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:21,003
There's the Police Station!

563
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:23,990
Let's get those civilians and
get back to the F.O.B.!

564
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:32,295
Go ahead!

565
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,876
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

566
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:39,331
Alright. I'll stay with our wounded and wait for Medic vac.
- I'll go for the civilians.

567
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:39,809
Roger that.

568
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:43,292
Kerns, Deaver! On me!
- Mags! Mags! Mags!

569
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,726
Alright, Santos! When that bird arrives.
I'm gonna need your help on this stretcher.

570
00:38:49,898 --> 00:38:51,922
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

571
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:55,443
Open the door...

572
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:56,848
Elevator right...
- Clear!

573
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,248
Elevator right!

574
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:00,480
Second elevator clear!

575
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:02,078
No pulse!

576
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:04,096
Door left.

577
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:06,157
It's lock?
- Door lock.

578
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:07,824
Hey! What's your name?
Harper.

579
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:09,829
Harper, I'm gonna need you on this stretcher...
- Roger that.

580
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:11,911
Bird incoming, sir!
- Roger that!

581
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:15,227
Imlay, pop the smoke!

582
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:20,782
Door lock...
- Door left...

583
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:25,457
Radio's on.

584
00:40:04,806 --> 00:40:06,893
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

585
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,706
How many people?
- Five of us. Three kids.

586
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,869
Kerns, kids!

587
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:18,288
Let's move!
- Let's go! Let's go!

588
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:24,755
Here we go!
- Aye, sir!

589
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,869
I've got room for four!
And that is it!

590
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:30,799
Get your wounded on!

591
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:35,139
Hey! Guerrero!
- Ya!

592
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:35,469
Yo!

593
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:36,975
I'll work on that mix for you!

594
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:40,318
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're
gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!

595
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:42,969
Get ém out!
- Go!

596
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:46,707
Shit!
- C'mon, man...

597
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:49,554
Shit!
- You just had to get out of this shit.

598
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:52,477
You take care of yourself!
- I will.

599
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:53,656
I'll see you soon, buddy.

600
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:57,356
Alright, that's it!
- We have civilians coming out!

601
00:40:57,356 --> 00:40:58,492
Can't take ém! We've got no room!

602
00:40:58,677 --> 00:40:59,879
Make some god damn room!
- I can't!

603
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,389
Now get back, sir!

604
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:04,880
Fall back...!

605
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:12,536
Wait! Kids...!

606
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:36,754
Backup! Everybody! C'mon! Back!

607
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:47,157
I say again: Enemy has air support.

608
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:49,589
We have a burned down...
- Dammit! Dammit!

609
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,982
We've disengaged and pulled on
back to the old police station.

610
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:57,665
We have civilians!
I say again: We have civilians.

611
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,063
Lockett, Kerns! Secure this door.

612
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:02,422
Nothing gets in!
You understand!?

613
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,071
We've got a body.

614
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:08,937
Do you think you can get rid
of it so the children don't see it?

615
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,787
What you want? What you want us...

616
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:10,662
Where should we go?
- Just back up.

617
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,292
Deacon!
- Setup back there, okay.

618
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:19,410
Come on, you guys.
Take the back.

619
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:21,305
Stay away from the 
window, alright!

620
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,219
Are there gonna be more copters?
Did you guys call any in?

621
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:29,732
I'm sure they're gonna come for us.
They know where we are.

622
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,514
Shit...

623
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,189
You okay? You alright?
- Ya, I'm good. Sure!?

624
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:37,082
Yeah!
- You didn't... didn't get hit?

625
00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:39,340
I'm good, man!
I'm good...

626
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,104
They're gone! They're gone!
Everybody's gone!

627
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:47,010
Lenihan, Guerrero, Grayson!

628
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,097
Grayson... the kids...
he didn't deserve that.

629
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:51,523
He didn't deserve that shit!

630
00:42:51,723 --> 00:42:52,923
He didn't deserve that...!

631
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,526
You hear me!

632
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,460
You're gonna make it thru this!

633
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:00,045
Alright! You're gonna get out of here...

634
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:01,818
You're gonna marry Cherise!

635
00:43:02,018 --> 00:43:03,661
And you're gonna be her
problem from now now.

636
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:06,530
Cause... cause. I'm done taking care
of your sorry ass! You got that!?

637
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:17,368
Enemy aircraft No:4 ... at this time.
Be advised...

638
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:25,031
... bearing 29750.
- They got air support too.

639
00:43:25,776 --> 00:43:27,814
Knocked our bird right outta the sky.

640
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,138
So much for ruling the air.

641
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:35,318
There's no time for 
that Lieutenant.

642
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:36,718
Those bombs are gonna drop.

643
00:43:38,229 --> 00:43:41,084
We're in the blast radius.

644
00:43:41,394 --> 00:43:44,201
Top of my god damn class...

645
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,926
And I get out of combat 
in the middle of that shit...

646
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:48,027
God dammit!

647
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:51,080
I already lost four 
god damn men!

648
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:56,067
Four good men.
- I'd go to hell and back for you, sir...

649
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,189
Have you?
- Yes...

650
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,363
You're not the first to lose
men and you won't be the last...

651
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:08,180
Now, put that away.
You understand me?

652
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:11,184
Right now, your men 
are awaiting orders.

653
00:44:12,036 --> 00:44:14,849
You go left, you can go right,
I don't give a damn.

654
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:18,529
Just make a decision.

655
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:20,881
Lieutenant.

656
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,618
There's no go on the helo, sir.

657
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:25,886
Enemy aircraft's slicing it up.

658
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,303
Command says it's nothing
they ever seen before.

659
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:32,265
We got to find a way out.
We got to get to that F.O.B.

660
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,058
You're right. We gotta move.

661
00:44:36,178 --> 00:44:37,989
Let's get these people safe.

662
00:44:38,322 --> 00:44:39,282
Lockett, Kerns!

663
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:41,741
I need you to setup an observation 
post on the roof!

664
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:43,259
We gonna move by foot
so we got to move fast!

665
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,552
I want you guys to scan for hostiles.
And find the best ride outta here!

666
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:52,069
Lieutenant.

667
00:44:56,986 --> 00:45:00,531
Officias are now saying: any civilians
within 10 miles of the coast,

668
00:45:00,723 --> 00:45:05,715
should try to make their way to a
military Forward Operating Base (F.O.B.).

669
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,942
It's the safest place you're
gonna be right now.

670
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:13,137
Now the military has set up a line of
defense to try to protect civilians.

671
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:16,513
Authorities...
- Just look at you and make sure you're alright. Alright?

672
00:45:17,772 --> 00:45:20,651
Just look at this... Here you go.

673
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:24,373
Our Staff's just there, Mr. Rincon.
- Okay, thank you.

674
00:45:24,573 --> 00:45:25,773
No problem.
- Thank you...

675
00:45:28,732 --> 00:45:31,258
Joe Rincon.
- Staff Sergeant Nantz.

676
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,337
This is my son Hector.

677
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:36,516
We... we all wanted to thank 
you for coming to get us.

678
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:39,389
Yeah?

679
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:40,288
Hey, Hector.

680
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:42,360
We leave no man behind.

681
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:45,266
So you're here when 
the police got overrun?

682
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:51,786
Right, well as long as 
you're both okay.

683
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:57,181
Are you alright, man?
- Ya, ya. I'm good.

684
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,768
Okay. If...

685
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,512
If you need him to 
do anything.

686
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,942
You know?
- I'll let you know.

687
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:10,011
Aye aye, sir.

688
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,901
Alright.

689
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:15,947
Thank you.

690
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:21,387
We've got 2 dozens hostiles. 
About 300 meters out.

691
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:24,362
Lieutenant, we've got 2 dozen 
hostiles. 300 meters north only.

692
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:30,042
Those things are on 
overwatch. Just like us.

693
00:46:32,074 --> 00:46:34,631
That one out front looks like a leader.
So now they've got leadership.

694
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,999
Yeah, so do ants, Kerns.

695
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:39,728
You think those things 
get scared too?

696
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:44,528
They're probably just like us.
Grunts just told to go fighting.

697
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:46,306
C'mon...

698
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:48,006
Just find us a way 
out of here, marine.

699
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:49,546
Cause we're sitting ducks.

700
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:51,612
They dragged him outta the house.

701
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:52,898
And they brought him outta the street

702
00:46:52,994 --> 00:46:55,681
And they put him in perfect
order before they shot him.

703
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:59,715
They shot him right in the head.
Do you have any idea? Why this is happening?

704
00:47:00,087 --> 00:47:03,333
Well, it's clear that there's been
no attempt at any kind of communication.

705
00:47:03,497 --> 00:47:05,295
No demands, nothing like that.

706
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:09,008
So! Obviously, they are 
here for our resources.

707
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,947
When you invade a place 
for it's resources.

708
00:47:11,948 --> 00:47:16,661
You wipe out the indigeous population.
Those are the rules of any colonization.

709
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,005
And right now. 
We are being colonized.

710
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,648
Brave kids.
- They're my nieces.

711
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:27,298
My sister and her husband 
are on vacation.

712
00:47:29,442 --> 00:47:33,916
The thing is... they live in Arizona.
I see them once or twice a year and...

713
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,673
Now maybe I'm the only
one they have left.

714
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:41,169
You have children?
- No.

715
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,683
Neither do I.

716
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:47,405
Used to regret that.
Maybe... it's for the best.

717
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,354
And of course our planet's is 70% water
and so again I have to stress this

718
00:47:52,355 --> 00:47:58,124
without certainty, the leading hypothesis remains. 
Their objective, their target is our water.

719
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:02,335
There ain't gonna be nothing left.

720
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,166
I think I got a way outta here.

721
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:06,504
What'd you say?
- Right here. Look.

722
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:07,607
200 meters out,

723
00:48:07,607 --> 00:48:09,479
What's that. Right behind 
that backside there?

724
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:11,801
Bus.
- Lieutenant, we've got a bus.

725
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:14,477
Roger that.
- So the men on the roof saw bus.

726
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:16,232
I think it could be operational.

727
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,307
Maybe we're be better off on foot.

728
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:22,589
It's miles to the 
Forward Operationing Base.

729
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:25,200
Those bombs are gonna 
drop in a little more than an hour.

730
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,582
We gotta move fast.

731
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:29,327
A bus is a big target.

732
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:31,570
I'd made the call.

733
00:48:31,904 --> 00:48:33,377
It's my responability.

734
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:35,258
Stavrou, Harris!

735
00:48:35,331 --> 00:48:38,147
Lieutenant, needs recon on a bus.
If it runs. Get it back here.

736
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:40,286
Either of you know how to hotwire a bus?

737
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:43,737
Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir!

738
00:48:43,737 --> 00:48:47,154
Ladies first.

739
00:48:48,123 --> 00:48:49,221
200 meters.

740
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,233
You go down. There's cars parked out.

741
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:53,427
There's a pickup truck, right... 
right back behind that.

742
00:48:56,168 --> 00:48:59,123
We have a situation.
Ya'll need to follow me.

743
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,605
Harris found it out here.
Ya'll got to see this thing!

744
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:16,477
Weapon looks like it's 
been surgically attached.

745
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:18,946
Talk about commitment to cause.

746
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,248
Shit...

747
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:31,149
You got to be kidding me.
- Corporal. Hold it.

748
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,350
Let me shoot this damn
thing Staff Sergeant.

749
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:36,184
That weapon's still hot.
Let me just shoot it.

750
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,917
Doc?
- Yes, Staff Sergeant!

751
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,338
God have mercy.

752
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,543
We need to know exactly
where to hit this thing?

753
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:45,641
So we don't waste 
our own ammo.

754
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:49,809
Maybe I can help.

755
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:51,209
I'm a veterinarian.

756
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,273
Sure you want to do this?

757
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:09,028
I was more sure when I
was standing over there.

758
00:50:09,811 --> 00:50:11,858
We got to figure out how
to kill these things

759
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:14,737
Otherwise we won't last another
five minutes out there. Okay.

760
00:50:16,823 --> 00:50:19,848
Peel this back.

761
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:23,209
Staff Sergeant, look at this.
We've got our organ. Right here.

762
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:25,116
Look at that.

763
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:26,789
I got another one right here.
- Yup.

764
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,705
It has some sort of cognitive
mechanism, anything?

765
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:32,185
There's no frontal lobe.
No temporal lobe.

766
00:50:32,186 --> 00:50:33,130
No parietal lobe.

767
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,716
The cranial vault is unlike
anything I've ever seen.

768
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,434
Oh, Shit... Shit!
- What'd  you see?

769
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:39,454
You see what I'm seeing?
- what?

770
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:41,194
The ones just on the roof weren't
on the roof right now anymore.

771
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:43,164
And there's a dozen more coming
out the door down there.

772
00:50:43,364 --> 00:50:44,087
Shit.

773
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:45,941
Gosh! Dammit! They're on the street
and they're heading this way.

774
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:47,586
They're headin'this way? Lieutenant, 
we've got movement out here.

775
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,470
Roger that.

776
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:51,044
We have contacts 300 meters out.
We got to cut quick.

777
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,768
Lieutenant, we got to move!
What do we do!?

778
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:02,399
Shit's hitting the fan.
We've got to move.

779
00:51:02,528 --> 00:51:03,286
Staff Sergeant?

780
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:05,853
C'mon, how do you 
kill this thing?

781
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:16,254
God dammit... Stavs.

782
00:51:16,357 --> 00:51:18,332
We lost them.
- We lost them.

783
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:20,989
Lieutenant, they've gone out.
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

784
00:51:21,974 --> 00:51:23,167
What's the hell's that!?

785
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:24,432
We've got a breach.

786
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:26,071
Lieutenant! We got a breach
down at north entrance!

787
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:27,322
They're inside the building.

788
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,398
I'm gonna gather everyone by the door
at south side of the building. Okay?

789
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:32,874
We're right behind you.

790
00:51:33,744 --> 00:51:35,912
Adukwu! You go with her.
- Yes, Staff Sergeant.

791
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:38,567
Imlay, you've got a HE
grenade round?

792
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:40,933
Never leave home without it, Staff Sergeant.
- You cover that hall to the rear!

793
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,389
Buy me some time.

794
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:44,663
They start coming. You
blast the hell outta them.

795
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,769
Hey, Harris? Where's
that god damn bus?

796
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,573
Stav? Stav? We've got enemy
scouts. C'mon let's go!

797
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:54,835
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby!

798
00:51:55,035 --> 00:51:56,734
New York represent!

799
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,452
Lieutenant? Got the
bus. Heading back.

800
00:51:59,508 --> 00:52:02,098
Okay, guys! The bus is enroute!
Bus is enroute! Guys!

801
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:04,834
30 seconds til we move out!

802
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:13,070
Imlay, give me a sitrep.
I need an update on the breach.

803
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,108
Report back over.

804
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,670
We're running out of time.

805
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,739
Move!

806
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:40,499
Contact!

807
00:52:40,629 --> 00:52:44,575
They've breached.

808
00:52:47,526 --> 00:52:48,947
This is our last shot.

809
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:50,689
Got it.

810
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:52,685
Right here...

811
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:03,227
That's got to be it.
It's dying.

812
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:10,280
That's how we kill this thing.
To the right, where the heart would be.

813
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,520
Got it.
- I got three more!

814
00:53:16,214 --> 00:53:19,080
Let's get outta here.

815
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:23,962
Get onboard that bus!
Get up on that bus!

816
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,652
Let's go...!

817
00:53:30,823 --> 00:53:33,683
Get underneath fellas!

818
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:43,462
Cover your sector's of fire!
Head's up!

819
00:53:46,504 --> 00:53:47,663
Marines!

820
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:50,734
Concentrate all your firepower
to the right where the heart would be.

821
00:53:50,942 --> 00:53:52,137
Yes, Staff Sergeant.

822
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,369
That's how we kill these things.

823
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,544
Alright! Remember your training.
- Hostile warbird, a 1000 meters out.

824
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:03,332
Everybody keep your eyes up.

825
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:12,263
All buckled back there, Lieutenant.

826
00:54:12,263 --> 00:54:13,463
Roger that.

827
00:54:14,479 --> 00:54:17,246
It should be about 
6 miles to the F.O.B.

828
00:54:17,317 --> 00:54:19,647
I don't know...  25 to 30 minutes.

829
00:54:19,847 --> 00:54:21,047
Cruising down these side streets.

830
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:24,682
Air Force is gonna level
this area in 40 minutes.

831
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:34,092
Gonna setup a Forward Operating Base. Fast.

832
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:50,895
What the hell's that?

833
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:52,899
Stavrou, stop the bus.

834
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:10,514
Everyone, get down.

835
00:55:26,107 --> 00:55:28,708
Foxtrot to November.
Sitrep is as follows.

836
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:30,372
Go ahead Foxtrot to November.

837
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:32,811
Enemy impact, all over the sky.
They're lighting up the sky.

838
00:55:32,815 --> 00:55:35,776
Heading... heading east towards
downtown Los Angeles.

839
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:36,882
Copy that.

840
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:43,028
They're tracking our signals.

841
00:55:45,218 --> 00:55:47,315
Turn off that radio!
They're tracking our signals.

842
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:48,920
Turn it off! All radio's off!

843
00:55:49,184 --> 00:55:50,346
Cell phones! Everything!

844
00:55:52,377 --> 00:55:54,917
Radio.

845
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,864
100 meters!
- Give me your radio.

846
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,490
Where's he going?
- Staff Sergeant.

847
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:05,890
Where the hell's he going!?

848
00:56:15,236 --> 00:56:17,133
Be prepared to get off this bus, alright!

849
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,417
10 o'clock, Lieutenant! 10 o'clock!

850
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,735
Yeah! I see it! 8 o'clock!

851
00:56:23,502 --> 00:56:27,485
It's getting close.
There's some my 6!

852
00:56:33,752 --> 00:56:36,255
A 100 meters!

853
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:43,637
Oh my god...

854
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:03,885
Shit...

855
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:44,435
Woah!
- What the hell's that!?

856
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:46,487
Staff, is he alright?
- Make it out?

857
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:49,536
Staff Sergeant.

858
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:07,645
There he is.
- Staff Sergeant's alive!

859
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:10,184
He's alive!
- There he is.

860
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,882
Their craft was unmanned, Lieutenant.

861
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:50,392
Drone.

862
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:58,868
That was real John Wayne shit, Staff Sergeant.

863
00:59:07,954 --> 00:59:09,154
Hey...

864
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:13,711
I can't afford to lose you.
And neither can these men, alright?

865
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:18,829
They're your men.

866
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:21,783
Alright, Staff Sergeant!

867
00:59:23,868 --> 00:59:25,545
That's how you do it.

868
00:59:26,172 --> 00:59:27,808
That's retreat hell!
- That's right.

869
00:59:29,018 --> 00:59:32,115
Who the hell's John Wayne?

870
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:45,311
Everybody, eyes open.
Stay alert!

871
00:59:46,422 --> 00:59:49,502
Thank you for that.

872
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:54,906
It's nothing...

873
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,992
What's that mean,
Retreat Hell?

874
01:00:01,522 --> 01:00:02,987
During World War I,

875
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:05,870
an officer from our regiment
was ordered to retreat.

876
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,568
He said,

877
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:09,351
Retreat Hell.

878
01:00:09,456 --> 01:00:10,656
We just got here.

879
01:00:15,175 --> 01:00:17,230
Should have the doctor
take a look at that.

880
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:19,921
I thought you were a doctor?

881
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,340
Animals and Aliens only.

882
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,935
I'll put it on my to do list.

883
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:27,335
Thank you.

884
01:00:38,297 --> 01:00:39,497
Excuse me. Staff Sergeant?

885
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:42,509
Did you say that was an unmanned drone?
- Correct.

886
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:45,794
They must have a helluva
commanding control system.

887
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,795
If Northcom didn't agree with
you, I wouldn't be here.

888
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,598
Why?

889
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:57,195
My mission was to provide A.I.S. 
with a strike package.

890
01:00:57,298 --> 01:00:58,603
A strike package?

891
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:02,257
Yeah, the coordinates for a missile strike
on a Command and Control Center.

892
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:03,905
But the acid fell 
off the grid.

893
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,613
And we lost them.

894
01:01:16,509 --> 01:01:20,135
All side streets are blocked.
Why don't we stick to the freeway.

895
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:23,495
Alright. Well, it's your call.

896
01:01:23,495 --> 01:01:25,749
Stavrou, get us on 
the freeway.

897
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:30,864
Don't wanna be in this area.
When these bombs start to fall.

898
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:56,334
Try to miss at least
one of the car, Stavrou.

899
01:01:57,984 --> 01:01:59,866
Just keep driving.

900
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:02,260
All friends, a mile ahead.

901
01:02:09,328 --> 01:02:10,528
Jesus.

902
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:20,362
Eh, the ramp.

903
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:21,762
It's gone, Lieutenant.

904
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,494
Alright! Robertson Exit. 
Half a click away.

905
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,126
Look out!

906
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:34,996
Incoming! 12 o'clock!

907
01:02:44,959 --> 01:02:45,389
Corporal!

908
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:55,418
Tank's drawing enemy fire!
It's a good time to move!

909
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,373
I'll suppress firing front! You should
take the civilians out the back!

910
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:01,686
Secure this exit, Imlay!

911
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:07,514
Imlay! Give me a defense
line on that vehicle!

912
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:10,389
Keep firing on that bridge!

913
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:11,841
Move...!

914
01:03:11,841 --> 01:03:13,618
Cover your eyes!
- Let's go! C'mon! Let's go!

915
01:03:13,818 --> 01:03:15,267
C'mon! Settle down!

916
01:03:21,317 --> 01:03:22,572
Just keep everyone calm.

917
01:03:22,772 --> 01:03:23,972
Be right back, alright?

918
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:27,608
Alright! Safety first, buddy!

919
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:30,170
Lieutenant Martinez!

920
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,477
If we could get those
civilians, into that Helo.

921
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:34,086
They'll take cover
and repel down.

922
01:03:34,341 --> 01:03:36,547
I got a dozen up on the
bridge! They're moving down!

923
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:38,572
Lieutenant!

924
01:03:38,772 --> 01:03:40,983
Tank's out! Nothing's 
stopping them now!

925
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:46,843
Staff Sergeant! Civilians won't make
it to that Helo without cover fire!

926
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:50,444
Lockett, Kerns! On me, let's go!

927
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:52,180
Let's move...!

928
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:58,528
Get the civilians down! Alright!
- Yes, sir!

929
01:03:58,728 --> 01:03:59,928
Move!

930
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:11,076
30 foot down. C'mon,
c'mon. let's go!

931
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:13,788
Get behind the bus! Now...!

932
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:14,413
Get back!

933
01:04:16,181 --> 01:04:17,235
Kids first! Around the body!

934
01:04:17,435 --> 01:04:19,110
Bring ém down, one
at a time. Got me?

935
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,310
Roger that!

936
01:04:22,553 --> 01:04:23,526
Imlay!

937
01:04:24,284 --> 01:04:26,253
Get your first team up
on that gabbage truck!

938
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:27,162
Move!
- Yes, Sergeant!

939
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:29,806
Cover us out front!
Stavs! On me! On me, now!

940
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:34,451
We're gonna run behind the helicopter
and we're gonna rope down, alright?

941
01:04:34,651 --> 01:04:35,964
Do you understand!?
- Yeah! Yeah.

942
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:38,881
Again! The girls will go first! I promise
you, nothing's gonna happens. Okay!

943
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:42,136
Stay down!

944
01:04:43,309 --> 01:04:45,781
Lieutenant! A dozen
hostiles maybe more!

945
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:47,866
400 meters and closing! Fast!

946
01:04:49,027 --> 01:04:50,020
Cover! Cover!

947
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:51,690
The hell are you doing?

948
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:53,523
You guys need another gun.

949
01:04:54,095 --> 01:04:55,335
3 o'clock, c'mon.

950
01:04:55,388 --> 01:04:57,341
Top one on the bridge!
There's something on the bridge!

951
01:04:57,654 --> 01:05:00,407
Incoming!

952
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:08,216
1 o'clock!

953
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:16,943
Reloading!
- Aim for the leader!

954
01:05:19,351 --> 01:05:19,742
Hell!

955
01:05:19,942 --> 01:05:21,607
You can take all
the room you want.

956
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,483
Move...!

957
01:05:24,483 --> 01:05:25,056
Yes! Staff Sergeant!

958
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:27,593
C'mon! Let's go...!

959
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,576
Right now, run! Keep running!

960
01:05:39,494 --> 01:05:41,720
Get in there!
- Cover me!

961
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,869
I'm going for the 50 cal!

962
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:47,404
Hurry up!

963
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,333
Get some! Lockett!

964
01:06:06,113 --> 01:06:06,798
Shit.

965
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:09,754
What the hell is that thing?
- I'm engaging!

966
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:17,076
Alright!? It's okay. Listen.
You're going to be okay.

967
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,477
I got you. I will not let anything
happen to you. Alright.

968
01:06:26,994 --> 01:06:28,194
Shit!

969
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:31,515
Man down!

970
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,581
You'll be okay.
Hold on! Kirsten, hold on!

971
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,061
Keep looking up.

972
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,790
Kirsten!

973
01:06:46,908 --> 01:06:48,151
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.

974
01:06:48,252 --> 01:06:50,702
Get the ass that's
controlling that thing!

975
01:06:54,692 --> 01:06:57,975
Imlay! Get off you ass!

976
01:07:02,534 --> 01:07:03,374
It's turning this way!

977
01:07:03,967 --> 01:07:05,192
About to hit the fans, guys!

978
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:06,592
Get out now!

979
01:07:09,703 --> 01:07:12,663
Come on!
- I'm stuck!

980
01:07:14,086 --> 01:07:15,286
I'm going!

981
01:07:17,691 --> 01:07:19,875
Incoming!

982
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:34,237
Where is Stavrou?

983
01:07:36,479 --> 01:07:38,903
Mottola! How many down?

984
01:07:39,678 --> 01:07:41,673
Two down, Staff Sarge!
One to go!

985
01:07:42,148 --> 01:07:43,643
Look...

986
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,554
Be good, okay. It's
gonna be fine, okay.

987
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:46,393
Get ready to go down.
- You ready?

988
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,951
Lieutenant, C4!

989
01:07:51,236 --> 01:07:52,726
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

990
01:07:52,774 --> 01:07:53,255
Hoo-rah.

991
01:07:53,474 --> 01:07:54,674
Alright?
- Let's do it.

992
01:08:04,233 --> 01:08:05,433
Covering!

993
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,928
Alright! It's good to go!

994
01:08:26,843 --> 01:08:29,341
Dammit! I've lost the detonator.

995
01:08:30,164 --> 01:08:33,063
Alright?
- Yeah, got the wind knocked outta me.

996
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:42,837
Mottola!
- Dad!? Dad!

997
01:08:48,864 --> 01:08:50,340
I need the bandages from
the first aid kit.

998
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,483
Sir! Sir!

999
01:09:01,015 --> 01:09:02,291
Oh my god!

1000
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,500
Shit.

1001
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:21,316
We got to get you
to a medic vac.

1002
01:09:21,816 --> 01:09:23,016
Doc!

1003
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,097
Shit, man.

1004
01:09:29,348 --> 01:09:30,659
We need some cover!
- Dammit! I'm out!

1005
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,135
Get another mag lucky!
- Hey! Take an eye out!

1006
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:34,894
They get them pin 
down, Staff Sergeant!

1007
01:09:35,895 --> 01:09:37,617
Our Marines! They 
get 'em pin down.

1008
01:09:39,076 --> 01:09:39,995
I'm not leaving you, Lieutenant.

1009
01:09:40,074 --> 01:09:41,419
Staff Sergeant! You need to
get them outta here.

1010
01:09:41,482 --> 01:09:42,402
Lieutenant, I am not leaving!

1011
01:09:42,427 --> 01:09:44,363
You gotta get them outta there!
- No, I'm not gonna leaving you...

1012
01:09:44,364 --> 01:09:45,629
You gotta get them outta here!
- No!

1013
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,857
Not again!

1014
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:52,978
I've a bag of C4 on the bus.

1015
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:55,609
Give this to my wife.

1016
01:09:56,305 --> 01:09:59,756
And get them off this
god damn freeway.

1017
01:10:02,919 --> 01:10:05,907
That's an order.

1018
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:11,042
Yes, sir.

1019
01:10:12,356 --> 01:10:15,935
Right behind you.

1020
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:25,115
Cover the Lieutenant!

1021
01:10:33,642 --> 01:10:36,818
They're closing in!

1022
01:10:39,195 --> 01:10:41,969
Here we go.

1023
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:51,043
This is Lieutenant William Martinez.
Echo Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines.

1024
01:10:51,404 --> 01:10:52,604
Hoo-rah!

1025
01:11:57,263 --> 01:12:00,535
We're still half a click
inside the bombing zone.

1026
01:12:02,516 --> 01:12:05,507
Move to live, Marines.

1027
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:11,162
Did he just leave the lieutenant
back there to die?

1028
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:14,025
Sure looks that way.

1029
01:12:14,225 --> 01:12:16,090
And this is the guy in
charge of us now?

1030
01:12:17,638 --> 01:12:20,119
Let's move.

1031
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:23,932
Hey! Those are our jets.

1032
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:25,732
We're still in the fight.

1033
01:12:27,996 --> 01:12:30,502
Alright, clear the bomb zone.

1034
01:12:31,168 --> 01:12:32,833
Let's tighten this place down.

1035
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,658
Bombs drop in 6 minutes.

1036
01:12:34,824 --> 01:12:36,759
Santos, Kerns. On me.

1037
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:39,507
See if there's any comms. Alright?

1038
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:40,658
Hard wired only.

1039
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,214
We're clear?
- Yeah! We're clear!

1040
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:05,039
Do you have a hardline in here?
- Over there.

1041
01:13:09,604 --> 01:13:12,207
Now my son's a optimist.

1042
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:14,066
When... when this first happened. He said

1043
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:16,690
Why don't we try to
go talk to them.

1044
01:13:17,891 --> 01:13:19,549
Maybe they wanna be friends.

1045
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,180
Hector?

1046
01:13:24,222 --> 01:13:28,040
Hey, we're gonna get some
food and water for your dad okay?

1047
01:13:28,884 --> 01:13:30,224
It's okay.

1048
01:13:31,445 --> 01:13:32,645
What'd you tell him?

1049
01:13:32,994 --> 01:13:34,392
I said the...

1050
01:13:35,165 --> 01:13:37,420
you know. If they're
chasing and shooting us.

1051
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:41,021
They're probably not
good friends.

1052
01:13:43,592 --> 01:13:46,732
Should've followed directions
and gone to the F.O.B.

1053
01:13:47,014 --> 01:13:50,238
I should've never stayed at the
police station. But I was scared, man.

1054
01:13:52,145 --> 01:13:54,799
I... I made all the wrong decisions.

1055
01:13:54,984 --> 01:13:57,290
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

1056
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,115
You made a call.

1057
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:02,845
I'd do the same thing
to protect my Marines.

1058
01:14:09,346 --> 01:14:12,884
I had a situation on my last tour.

1059
01:14:13,676 --> 01:14:16,754
There was no angle.You want left,
you go right. It didn't matter.

1060
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,907
But you're alive.
- Yeah, I survived.

1061
01:14:26,222 --> 01:14:29,432
I wasn't suppose to.

1062
01:14:30,124 --> 01:14:32,611
Staff Sergeant Nantz?

1063
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,428
You promise to save my son?

1064
01:14:51,364 --> 01:14:51,786
Staff Sergeant!

1065
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:54,211
We have a hardwire connection!

1066
01:14:56,703 --> 01:15:00,093
Doc, keep him warm.
The sun's going down.

1067
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,627
This will keep you warm.

1068
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:07,013
We estimating that 20 cities in
17 countries are now into full attack.

1069
01:15:07,573 --> 01:15:09,178
It's obvious the enemy is

1070
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:11,301
attempting to cut us off from one another.

1071
01:15:11,502 --> 01:15:14,780
Is there anymore information
at this time, Professor Stavert?

1072
01:15:14,804 --> 01:15:17,216
New data shows that their
using our water as their fuel...

1073
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:19,918
and our ocean levels are
already decreasing.

1074
01:15:20,118 --> 01:15:21,829
They're using it to power their ships,

1075
01:15:21,829 --> 01:15:24,414
their machinery. Possibly
even their own bodies.

1076
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:26,873
It's the composition of our
water that's unique.

1077
01:15:27,073 --> 01:15:27,993
It's in a liquid state.

1078
01:15:27,993 --> 01:15:31,517
No other locations in our 
known universe have liquid H20.

1079
01:15:31,717 --> 01:15:33,498
Anywhere near their surface.

1080
01:15:33,635 --> 01:15:35,050
I just saw a field report that said...

1081
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:37,276
they would use our sewer
system to follow...

1082
01:15:37,276 --> 01:15:40,615
our water back to their ships.
- How the hell did you get that to work?

1083
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:42,675
These things are everywhere.

1084
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:45,129
There's one off the
coast in 20 countries.

1085
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,501
They're calling it the
Command and Control Center.

1086
01:15:49,217 --> 01:15:51,941
It is who you were tracking?
- Yeah.

1087
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:55,798
So you're saying. That's the
thing controlling the drones.

1088
01:15:56,304 --> 01:15:58,401
Yeah. And if we wipe it out.

1089
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:00,443
We take out their air power.

1090
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:05,201
These bombs better work.

1091
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:07,756
Move it! C'mon!
_ Put him into a safe spot.

1092
01:16:07,756 --> 01:16:08,448
Set him down.

1093
01:16:09,141 --> 01:16:10,651
How much time we got?

1094
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:13,991
1 minute.

1095
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:19,166
Air Force better lay some pain on
those extraterritorial bastards.

1096
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:24,054
Alright! 25! Retreat!

1097
01:16:24,055 --> 01:16:24,619
Hell!

1098
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:26,346
Retreat!
- Hell!

1099
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:30,234
Here we go.
- C'mon.

1100
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:32,018
Let's fry these son of a bitches.

1101
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:34,851
We're get to the F.O.B. after these
bomb drop. Get some ammo.

1102
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:36,253
And some god damn reinforcements.

1103
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,383
God damn tanks!

1104
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,101
10.
- You gotta be strong, okay.

1105
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:46,501
9

1106
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,410
8

1107
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:50,023
7

1108
01:16:50,546 --> 01:16:51,746
6

1109
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,617
5

1110
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:55,455
4

1111
01:16:56,743 --> 01:16:57,943
3

1112
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,575
Bloody brace!

1113
01:17:22,272 --> 01:17:23,966
Hey! They should've dropped!
- Shit! What the hell?

1114
01:17:24,324 --> 01:17:25,396
We've felt them from here 
if they'd had dropped?

1115
01:17:25,596 --> 01:17:27,974
If they'd had dropped by now.
We would've felt from here, wouldn't we?

1116
01:17:27,974 --> 01:17:30,077
Should've felt them from god damn
Nevada with that much joyness!

1117
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:33,223
That clock right?
- That's what I got.

1118
01:17:33,224 --> 01:17:36,010
Maybe it's a good thing, right? Maybe
we've turned the tide. I mean...

1119
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,067
I mean that's a good thing, right?

1120
01:17:37,067 --> 01:17:39,393
You're damn straight, Imlay!
We were kicking some ass out there.

1121
01:17:39,851 --> 01:17:41,737
Could they have taken out 
the whole air force?

1122
01:17:42,604 --> 01:17:44,145
This isn't happening.

1123
01:17:44,778 --> 01:17:47,309
Let's move... Everybody up, up.
Let's move. C'mon.

1124
01:17:48,426 --> 01:17:50,185
Home stretch... home stretch.

1125
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:11,551
Now we know why 
those bombs didn't drop.

1126
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,183
They wiped the Forward 
Operating Base right off the map.

1127
01:18:17,618 --> 01:18:18,914
All clear, Staff Sergeant!

1128
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:22,294
Alright, Let's bring ém 
back here.

1129
01:18:28,186 --> 01:18:30,371
I feel like it's a million to one odds,
we'd get here in the first place.

1130
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,123
We'd get here and 
ain't nothing!

1131
01:18:32,569 --> 01:18:35,825
I knew Nantz would 
never get us out.

1132
01:18:36,556 --> 01:18:40,419
There were thousands of Marines here.
- Now there's just seven of us, Imlay.

1133
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:45,515
You remind me of my older brother.

1134
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:47,439
How's that?

1135
01:18:48,469 --> 01:18:49,669
He never smiles either.

1136
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,485
Secure the front with Harris.

1137
01:18:57,973 --> 01:18:59,681
Imlay, anything?
- Nothing, Staff Sergeant.

1138
01:18:59,881 --> 01:19:01,434
We'd only got maps of Santa Monica.

1139
01:19:01,664 --> 01:19:04,024
We need something further
east. They're all burnt.

1140
01:19:04,772 --> 01:19:07,705
Follow me, Imlay.

1141
01:19:10,849 --> 01:19:11,867
Alright.

1142
01:19:11,867 --> 01:19:13,683
This is the battalions 
command for hooch.

1143
01:19:13,683 --> 01:19:17,018
We're looking for maps, Anything with an extraction point.
- Yes, Staff Sergeant.

1144
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:30,357
I'll be right back.

1145
01:19:35,586 --> 01:19:37,282
Find a tactical map, Staff Sergeant.

1146
01:19:37,795 --> 01:19:39,987
Shows where all the units 
were deployed.

1147
01:19:40,449 --> 01:19:43,309
What the hell's all these red marks here?
-  It means they're gone.

1148
01:19:43,888 --> 01:19:47,475
Well, you mean units that got moved?
- Wiped out.

1149
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:50,155
All of them?
- All of them.

1150
01:19:50,616 --> 01:19:51,816
Shit...

1151
01:19:51,852 --> 01:19:52,864
Alright.

1152
01:19:52,864 --> 01:19:55,209
One alternate extraction
site is still operational.

1153
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,525
Eight clicks.

1154
01:19:58,525 --> 01:19:59,725
Staff Sergeant?

1155
01:20:00,668 --> 01:20:01,868
Staff Sergeant!

1156
01:20:03,294 --> 01:20:06,541
Adukwu, plenty of weapons around.
Find yourself an M16.

1157
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,391
Mr. Rincon is dead.

1158
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:35,675
Please get up, dad?

1159
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:44,246
Please, don't leave me.

1160
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,985
Don't leave me.

1161
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:57,713
I'm so sorry, Hector.

1162
01:21:00,446 --> 01:21:03,366
I'm sorry.

1163
01:21:03,914 --> 01:21:08,209
Your father tried so
hard to stay with you.

1164
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:12,326
I don't want to be here.

1165
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:22,519
It's okay, bud.

1166
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:31,626
Your father was a 
brave man, Hector.

1167
01:21:40,247 --> 01:21:44,798
Hector, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

1168
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:48,008
It's okay to cry.

1169
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:55,310
He loved you very much.

1170
01:21:55,346 --> 01:21:58,280
Listen to me, Hector.

1171
01:21:59,074 --> 01:22:04,600
I need you to be brave for me,
I need you to be my little marine.

1172
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:07,325
Okay?

1173
01:22:09,879 --> 01:22:13,247
We gotta be brave for 
the others.

1174
01:22:15,076 --> 01:22:17,778
You know why?

1175
01:22:18,098 --> 01:22:20,641
Why?

1176
01:22:22,825 --> 01:22:25,993
Because Marines don't quit.

1177
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,717
Do you believe that?

1178
01:22:32,112 --> 01:22:35,150
Say it for me.

1179
01:22:36,249 --> 01:22:38,718
Marines don't quit.

1180
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:42,359
Good. I want to get you
out of here.

1181
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:44,157
I promise.

1182
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:49,242
Let's go see the priest, okay.

1183
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:52,744
Come on.

1184
01:23:08,701 --> 01:23:12,598
We're not losing one more of
those civilians, understand?

1185
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:17,344
You getting us out
too, Staff Sergeant?

1186
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:21,046
Or are we expenable?

1187
01:23:21,295 --> 01:23:22,495
Hm?

1188
01:23:30,749 --> 01:23:31,999
Alright, Lockett.

1189
01:23:33,396 --> 01:23:34,827
You want to go
there. Let's go there.

1190
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:42,505
I commanded men.
And men died.

1191
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:43,864
Kids.

1192
01:23:44,064 --> 01:23:45,264
18 years old.

1193
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:47,489
Best men I ever led.

1194
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:50,412
Do you think that 1 second.

1195
01:23:50,824 --> 01:23:53,375
That I'd rather trade 
places with them?

1196
01:23:59,288 --> 01:24:02,506
I know you think I 
got my men killed.

1197
01:24:04,617 --> 01:24:07,200
They're dead.

1198
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,585
I'm here.

1199
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:13,282
Like the punchline of 
some bad joke.

1200
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:14,482
You think I like that?

1201
01:24:15,591 --> 01:24:18,827
You'd think a minute goes by 
that the faces are right here.

1202
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:21,309
Seared into my brain.

1203
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:28,891
Dante, Thomas D. Corporal.
156509386.

1204
01:24:29,165 --> 01:24:34,804
M Brewster, William R. Private - 876662354.

1205
01:24:35,532 --> 01:24:39,520
Warden, Geoffrey H.
Lance Corporal.

1206
01:24:39,564 --> 01:24:43,490
874273993.

1207
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,159
Lockett,

1208
01:24:51,694 --> 01:24:53,354
Dwayne

1209
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:54,554
Dwayne G.

1210
01:24:56,657 --> 01:24:57,857
Corporal.

1211
01:24:59,914 --> 01:25:04,745
1568709

1212
01:25:04,745 --> 01:25:07,391
55.

1213
01:25:08,262 --> 01:25:11,464
Your brother was an
outstanding Marine.

1214
01:25:14,162 --> 01:25:15,325
He was my friend.

1215
01:25:16,426 --> 01:25:18,793
And I miss him.

1216
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:22,146
Everyday.

1217
01:25:24,115 --> 01:25:26,960
And you remind me of him.

1218
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:36,884
None of that matters right now.

1219
01:25:38,695 --> 01:25:42,012
Because our duty is keep
moving forward. Keep fighting.

1220
01:25:44,285 --> 01:25:46,062
That's how we honor your brother

1221
01:25:46,535 --> 01:25:47,735
and Lieutenant Martinez.

1222
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:50,941
Corporal Stavro,

1223
01:25:50,941 --> 01:25:52,141
Lance Corporal Mottola.

1224
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:55,741
Hector's father.

1225
01:25:55,741 --> 01:25:57,822
Who picked up a weapon and
did what needed to be done.

1226
01:25:57,822 --> 01:25:59,040
Civilian did that.

1227
01:25:59,236 --> 01:26:01,232
So we better damn
well step it up!

1228
01:26:01,929 --> 01:26:03,676
Discard any lingering doubt!

1229
01:26:04,382 --> 01:26:05,230
Work fast!

1230
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:05,912
Work as a unit!

1231
01:26:05,928 --> 01:26:07,319
and we will prevail!

1232
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:09,781
Let's figure out how to
get out of this mess.

1233
01:26:09,781 --> 01:26:11,902
Imlay, you come with me
and get to higher ground.

1234
01:26:12,031 --> 01:26:14,845
Rest of you! Find some
ammo. Some vehicles.

1235
01:26:14,845 --> 01:26:18,545
Gotta be a few LAVs or armoured
humvees still operational.

1236
01:26:18,867 --> 01:26:22,760
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.

1237
01:26:25,704 --> 01:26:28,016
You went down fighting.

1238
01:26:34,384 --> 01:26:35,584
Holy shit.

1239
01:26:35,781 --> 01:26:38,414
No one expects to see all this.

1240
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,720
Now that don't look good.

1241
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,920
Reinforcements.

1242
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:48,734
Holy shit.

1243
01:26:51,197 --> 01:26:53,876
They already set up a B10.

1244
01:26:54,094 --> 01:26:55,282
Alright.

1245
01:26:57,449 --> 01:27:01,469
If that evac site is still operational.
I think we can get behind the line.

1246
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:05,262
That's gonna be a hell of a ride, Staff Sergeant.
- Yeah, that's what we get paid for.

1247
01:27:05,779 --> 01:27:07,193
Everybody move to the LAV. Now!

1248
01:27:07,393 --> 01:27:09,347
Follow me!
- Go...!

1249
01:27:09,916 --> 01:27:12,252
Any station, this net.
This is Foxtrot 2 November.

1250
01:27:12,252 --> 01:27:13,431
We have 11 passengers.

1251
01:27:13,432 --> 01:27:17,531
Requesting evacuation at alternative
extraction point, Charlie.

1252
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:19,655
Are there any birds
in the air? Over.

1253
01:27:20,173 --> 01:27:22,611
Foxtrot 2 November, this is Sierra 25.

1254
01:27:22,811 --> 01:27:23,949
Orders are to pull back.

1255
01:27:23,949 --> 01:27:25,455
Get to evacuation point: Charlie.

1256
01:27:25,655 --> 01:27:27,126
By 0300.

1257
01:27:27,126 --> 01:27:28,218
Or we'd be gone. Over.

1258
01:27:28,553 --> 01:27:31,747
Roger that. At 0300 and not
a minute more. Out.

1259
01:27:33,922 --> 01:27:35,971
Imlay? You ever seen what
a Bushmaster Chain gun can do?

1260
01:27:35,971 --> 01:27:38,984
Aw shit, Staff Sergeant.
- Get on it, son.

1261
01:27:39,177 --> 01:27:41,068
Let's do this!

1262
01:27:44,889 --> 01:27:47,463
No lights, Kerns.
- Roger that.

1263
01:27:47,655 --> 01:27:52,085
Let's move.

1264
01:27:52,085 --> 01:27:54,022
Bushmaster's locked and loaded.

1265
01:27:54,022 --> 01:27:55,441
Give ém hell.

1266
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:57,278
Damn right.

1267
01:28:08,542 --> 01:28:11,253
Two minutes til the Helo drops.

1268
01:28:13,417 --> 01:28:15,983
Everybody okay?

1269
01:28:17,911 --> 01:28:19,119
Alright, Kerns!

1270
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:20,519
Take a left.

1271
01:28:21,722 --> 01:28:23,400
So you go over 3 blocks,

1272
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,733
Then you go about five blocks.

1273
01:28:24,907 --> 01:28:26,154
Hang a right. And straight.

1274
01:28:26,533 --> 01:28:28,084
That should get us to the evac site.

1275
01:28:28,325 --> 01:28:29,525
Yes, Sergeant.

1276
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:35,903
Better hold on if I were you, Lockett!
- Copy that!

1277
01:28:37,154 --> 01:28:39,387
We've got hostiles, Staff Sergeant?
- What's going on?

1278
01:28:39,507 --> 01:28:41,175
Let's not wait around and find out.

1279
01:28:41,175 --> 01:28:42,344
It's gonna be okay.

1280
01:28:42,345 --> 01:28:45,001
Got about 250 rounds, Staff Sergeant.

1281
01:28:53,842 --> 01:28:55,634
You know what they say
if you're gonna hit a deer!

1282
01:28:55,635 --> 01:28:56,415
Speed up!

1283
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:59,197
Damn straight!

1284
01:29:03,288 --> 01:29:04,288
C'mon!

1285
01:29:04,296 --> 01:29:08,413
You all hold on. We have to
gonna go right through ém!

1286
01:29:12,823 --> 01:29:13,648
Saw that!

1287
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:15,410
They're going down like bowling pins.

1288
01:29:39,528 --> 01:29:41,335
Take it out!

1289
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,893
Run that fucker over, man!

1290
01:29:46,786 --> 01:29:47,795
Santos! You okay!?

1291
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:52,102
I'd got that nasty stuff all
over my mouth, man!

1292
01:29:54,311 --> 01:29:55,267
Not funny.

1293
01:29:55,467 --> 01:29:57,168
You let him do you 
on your first date.

1294
01:30:12,017 --> 01:30:15,290
Everyone, okay!?
- Yes!

1295
01:30:16,121 --> 01:30:18,841
Let's get us home.

1296
01:30:23,597 --> 01:30:26,031
Cease fire!

1297
01:30:30,367 --> 01:30:31,891
Stay close...!

1298
01:30:31,891 --> 01:30:36,257
We do it!

1299
01:30:36,257 --> 01:30:37,291
Load ém up!

1300
01:30:37,491 --> 01:30:39,454
Their flight path won't
be clear much longer!

1301
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,699
You're in the middle of
that shit, Staff Sergeant!

1302
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:43,117
What happened to all our air!?

1303
01:30:43,128 --> 01:30:47,189
Fall back to save our asses!
They were blowing us out!

1304
01:30:47,249 --> 01:30:50,071
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

1305
01:30:58,773 --> 01:31:00,635
Let's go, Imlay!

1306
01:31:01,146 --> 01:31:02,408
Sir, you okay?

1307
01:31:03,033 --> 01:31:05,417
Alright, sir.

1308
01:31:07,132 --> 01:31:09,633
Let's move! Move...!

1309
01:31:10,894 --> 01:31:13,019
C'mon, let's go!

1310
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:52,430
Come on.

1311
01:31:59,559 --> 01:32:02,437
You alright? Everybody all good?

1312
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:06,083
Everyone Okay!?
- Hold on tight!

1313
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:08,463
What happened!?

1314
01:32:08,584 --> 01:32:11,799
Pilot says something was
playing hell with our power!

1315
01:32:12,148 --> 01:32:13,328
Staff Sergeant!

1316
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:14,728
9 o'clock!

1317
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,523
Santos, you said you were
tracking massive RF signals!?

1318
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,229
Could a concentration of
them knock out power!?

1319
01:32:29,948 --> 01:32:32,231
Yes, definitely! Why!?

1320
01:32:32,234 --> 01:32:34,878
Could be their Command and Control Center!

1321
01:32:37,033 --> 01:32:40,043
Get me down there!
- What?

1322
01:32:41,866 --> 01:32:43,970
I got to recon that area!

1323
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:46,478
No way! It's suicide!

1324
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:50,505
Dammit! We're the only ones left!
All the other forces have fallen back!

1325
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:54,924
We can't land! We may not
have power to takeoff again!

1326
01:33:02,387 --> 01:33:05,037
This is a letter for Martinez's wife!

1327
01:33:06,268 --> 01:33:09,199
Would you give it to her?

1328
01:33:11,447 --> 01:33:13,816
Yeah!

1329
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:20,494
Hover at 40 feet!

1330
01:33:21,408 --> 01:33:24,212
20 seconds!
- Roger that!

1331
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,927
Come on Adukwu!
Let's get these off!

1332
01:33:29,031 --> 01:33:31,955
Staff Sergeant!? what
the hell are you doing!?

1333
01:33:32,339 --> 01:33:35,476
We're in the clear!
We're almost home, Imlay!

1334
01:33:35,597 --> 01:33:38,412
You 're in charge now!

1335
01:33:38,565 --> 01:33:41,903
You get these civilians home safe!

1336
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:49,149
You're the bravest Marine,
I've ever seen, Hector!

1337
01:33:49,334 --> 01:33:51,364
No!

1338
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:37,037
Everyone take cover...

1339
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:43,031
Thought I told you to stay in that helo?
- Civilians are free and clear.

1340
01:34:43,249 --> 01:34:45,053
We were worried about your ass.

1341
01:34:45,632 --> 01:34:48,257
I think the Command and
Control asset is nearby.

1342
01:34:48,378 --> 01:34:50,831
Harris? How many clicks 
is that blackout?

1343
01:34:50,871 --> 01:34:52,797
It's about 5 clicks, Staff Sergeant.

1344
01:34:52,989 --> 01:34:55,017
5 clicks. Alright.

1345
01:34:55,217 --> 01:34:57,208
We'll use this overpass 
for cover.

1346
01:34:58,089 --> 01:34:59,995
If we can take out those drones.

1347
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:03,029
Our military might have chance
to get back into this fight.

1348
01:35:04,271 --> 01:35:05,471
Santos?

1349
01:35:06,329 --> 01:35:09,913
Where would you put a Command and
Control asset, if you want to protect it?

1350
01:35:11,137 --> 01:35:14,031
Underground!
- Let's go.

1351
01:35:16,621 --> 01:35:17,821
Move...

1352
01:35:43,448 --> 01:35:44,648
Move.

1353
01:36:38,758 --> 01:36:41,147
They must've gone back up.
It just leads back to the street.

1354
01:36:41,723 --> 01:36:44,561
I thought they were leading us to
the Command and Control Center.

1355
01:36:45,246 --> 01:36:46,446
Dammit!

1356
01:36:51,065 --> 01:36:53,940
Let's go.

1357
01:37:22,088 --> 01:37:25,120
They know we're here now.

1358
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:37,861
That's the Command and Control.

1359
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:44,183
Everybody out now! Move...!

1360
01:37:44,362 --> 01:37:45,808
Follow me!

1361
01:37:45,808 --> 01:37:46,679
Up here!

1362
01:37:46,879 --> 01:37:49,964
Up that ladder! Move...!
Up that ladder!

1363
01:37:50,415 --> 01:37:51,422
Let's go! Move it up!

1364
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:52,822
Blow that tray! Imlay!

1365
01:37:53,022 --> 01:37:55,725
Move...!

1366
01:38:02,403 --> 01:38:05,792
We're right over their Command asset.
- That it, alright. Okay.

1367
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:08,131
Let's move to that concrete slab, 1 o'clock!

1368
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:08,911
Let's move!

1369
01:38:11,165 --> 01:38:12,739
Fire in the hole!

1370
01:38:12,739 --> 01:38:13,939
That should give us a couple of minutes.

1371
01:38:31,682 --> 01:38:33,070
Laser target, Staff Sergeant?

1372
01:38:33,078 --> 01:38:34,539
We don't have any more planes, alright.

1373
01:38:34,594 --> 01:38:37,519
Hopefully, they can still fire ground to
ground missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

1374
01:38:37,749 --> 01:38:38,930
So we'll radio in a strike.

1375
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,695
Paint the target with the
laser, guide them in.

1376
01:38:40,895 --> 01:38:42,049
Aye, Staff Sergeant.
- Hoo-rah.

1377
01:38:42,139 --> 01:38:45,560
Our best chance of radio
reception is on top of that building.

1378
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:47,000
But it's the most exposed.

1379
01:38:47,182 --> 01:38:48,779
I'll do it, Staff Sergeant.

1380
01:38:48,979 --> 01:38:50,082
I'll make the call.

1381
01:38:50,082 --> 01:38:51,871
Santos, you got those codes?

1382
01:38:52,003 --> 01:38:54,032
Air Force straight package coming up.

1383
01:38:54,989 --> 01:38:56,094
Get to high ground.

1384
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,560
Alright, once you radio in,
they'll track that signal.

1385
01:38:58,816 --> 01:39:00,016
They'll be coming in real hot, real fast.

1386
01:39:00,029 --> 01:39:02,742
So once you make that call.
You get the hell out of there. Alright?

1387
01:39:04,026 --> 01:39:05,655
You know what that means.

1388
01:39:05,969 --> 01:39:09,066
Means, we gonna have to hold
those things off till the strike gets here.

1389
01:39:09,066 --> 01:39:10,114
Bingo.

1390
01:39:10,314 --> 01:39:11,514
Marines?

1391
01:39:12,678 --> 01:39:14,453
We make our stand here.

1392
01:39:14,653 --> 01:39:16,929
Let those bastards know
who they're fucking with.

1393
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:18,103
Retreat
- Hell!

1394
01:39:18,303 --> 01:39:19,503
25.

1395
01:39:30,572 --> 01:39:33,453
Right to the heart, right?
- Right to the heart.

1396
01:39:33,454 --> 01:39:35,672
They'll be coming up from there.
I need you to take two of these.

1397
01:39:35,672 --> 01:39:36,618
Plant one right there!

1398
01:39:36,818 --> 01:39:38,368
And another one on the other
side of that rubble, alright.

1399
01:39:38,421 --> 01:39:41,391
Keep your head down, get down fast.
- Doc!? Watch your back! Doc!

1400
01:39:41,391 --> 01:39:42,591
Watch your head...!

1401
01:39:51,186 --> 01:39:54,231
Any stations! This is Foxtrot
2 November. Do you copy!?

1402
01:39:57,372 --> 01:39:59,369
Any stations! This is Foxtrot
2 November.

1403
01:39:59,569 --> 01:40:00,455
Do you copy!?

1404
01:40:00,456 --> 01:40:02,772
Foxtrot 2 November.
This Yankee Tango! Over.

1405
01:40:02,772 --> 01:40:04,047
We've a priority fire mission!

1406
01:40:04,226 --> 01:40:06,199
We located a major Command and Control center.

1407
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:09,904
At the grid 8885342.

1408
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:12,855
We will be lasering. Code: 120.

1409
01:40:13,282 --> 01:40:15,716
I say again, we will be lasering Code: 120.

1410
01:40:15,821 --> 01:40:18,675
Copy that. Time to target. 3 minutes.

1411
01:40:20,493 --> 01:40:23,221
Staff Sergeant! We got 3 minutes!

1412
01:40:23,337 --> 01:40:24,962
It's coming in 3 minutes!

1413
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:28,656
Alright. Let's paint this target.

1414
01:40:40,579 --> 01:40:44,111
Helluva shot, Kerns!
Get your ass outta there!

1415
01:40:44,775 --> 01:40:45,975
Get outta there, Kerns!

1416
01:40:46,092 --> 01:40:47,292
Shit.

1417
01:40:51,244 --> 01:40:53,140
Shit.
- Kerns!

1418
01:40:56,024 --> 01:40:58,171
Shit...!

1419
01:41:02,863 --> 01:41:04,753
Doc!? Doc!?
Get to cover now!

1420
01:41:04,953 --> 01:41:06,716
Move...!

1421
01:41:10,217 --> 01:41:12,115
Contact!

1422
01:41:16,631 --> 01:41:19,402
Get in there!

1423
01:41:19,402 --> 01:41:20,639
Fire left! C'mon!

1424
01:41:22,137 --> 01:41:23,337
Right there...!

1425
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:31,373
Got it!

1426
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:32,790
60 seconds left!

1427
01:41:42,927 --> 01:41:44,993
Got cha!

1428
01:41:44,993 --> 01:41:46,193
Shit!

1429
01:41:48,931 --> 01:41:50,131
Who's got...

1430
01:41:58,490 --> 01:41:59,690
Back in the fight! Santos!

1431
01:42:01,152 --> 01:42:03,198
Stay down!
- Covering!

1432
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:06,447
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!
- Got it! Doc!

1433
01:42:15,494 --> 01:42:18,007
Where's that god damn artillery!?
Should've hit by now.

1434
01:42:19,832 --> 01:42:21,470
Doc! Let's go.

1435
01:42:21,985 --> 01:42:23,185
Imlay!?

1436
01:42:25,788 --> 01:42:27,624
Imlay!?

1437
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:38,455
Incoming!

1438
01:42:43,662 --> 01:42:44,862
Yes!

1439
01:42:45,518 --> 01:42:46,576
Missiles! We got ém!

1440
01:42:46,776 --> 01:42:47,976
We got ém!

1441
01:42:50,314 --> 01:42:52,599
Direct hit. Direct hit!!

1442
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:54,777
Staff Sergeant! You did it!

1443
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:57,503
You did it!

1444
01:42:58,085 --> 01:42:59,644
Yeah! We got it!

1445
01:42:59,986 --> 01:43:02,917
We strike back. It went through?

1446
01:43:03,726 --> 01:43:05,083
You did alright, Kerns!

1447
01:43:24,962 --> 01:43:27,452
It's coming up...

1448
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:42,353
It's trying to get around.

1449
01:43:46,099 --> 01:43:47,579
The god damn thing could fly!

1450
01:43:47,779 --> 01:43:49,303
Staff Sergeant! It's flying now!

1451
01:43:49,992 --> 01:43:52,711
Get you out!

1452
01:43:59,238 --> 01:44:00,420
We got to protect the laser. C'mon!

1453
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:01,820
C'mon!

1454
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:05,171
Santos!

1455
01:44:15,747 --> 01:44:16,947
Son of a bitch!

1456
01:44:19,845 --> 01:44:22,853
That hurt!
- Cover me, Lockett!

1457
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:31,388
The drones are pulling it away!
We got to take it out, now!

1458
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:37,944
Incoming, Copperhead!

1459
01:44:42,252 --> 01:44:44,979
They're using the drones
to protect the ship.

1460
01:44:48,097 --> 01:44:51,495
I'm running low on ammo!
- Santos!

1461
01:44:55,728 --> 01:44:59,122
How is he?
- He's hanging in there, Staff Sergeant!

1462
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:02,456
Crazy bastard, you should
have leave me there.

1463
01:45:06,105 --> 01:45:07,305
Covering!

1464
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:10,110
Grenade!

1465
01:45:16,433 --> 01:45:17,205
Staff Sergeant!

1466
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:22,606
We are not dying here, Lockett!
- You damn right, we're not dying!

1467
01:45:23,209 --> 01:45:25,009
It's getting outta range!
I'm gonna take it down!

1468
01:45:25,423 --> 01:45:27,832
Doesn't have enough
punch! Save that shot!

1469
01:45:37,226 --> 01:45:38,426
Staff Sergeant!

1470
01:45:38,768 --> 01:45:43,497
Lockett! You okay?
- Harris, You're gonna to be okay.

1471
01:46:06,945 --> 01:46:10,201
That's the last Copperhead!

1472
01:46:13,147 --> 01:46:16,994
Santos! Take out that drone!

1473
01:46:17,982 --> 01:46:20,686
Firing!

1474
01:46:36,542 --> 01:46:38,598
Yeah!
- We did it!

1475
01:46:40,628 --> 01:46:44,812
We did it...!

1476
01:46:47,371 --> 01:46:48,571
I can't believe we did it!

1477
01:46:49,809 --> 01:46:51,861
I can't believe it worked!

1478
01:46:58,765 --> 01:46:59,965
Yeah...!

1479
01:47:01,026 --> 01:47:04,342
Staff Sergeant, you did it!

1480
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:07,123
There's nothing controlling
the drones anymore.

1481
01:47:14,122 --> 01:47:17,105
Marines, on me!

1482
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:32,271
They're retreating! Advance!

1483
01:48:41,738 --> 01:48:43,963
You guys saved our lives out there!

1484
01:48:43,963 --> 01:48:45,963
Semper Fi! 25!

1485
01:48:46,005 --> 01:48:47,205
Alright! 25!

1486
01:48:48,045 --> 01:48:49,245
Retreat Hell!

1487
01:48:49,393 --> 01:48:53,102
You kicked ass, Staff
Sarge! Welcome home!

1488
01:48:53,965 --> 01:48:55,903
Good work, Marines!

1489
01:48:56,042 --> 01:48:56,731
Outstanding.

1490
01:48:56,793 --> 01:48:58,514
The civilians are safe!

1491
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:01,824
Why and how you brought
their ship down,

1492
01:49:01,541 --> 01:49:04,159
it's going out to every
army and every city.

1493
01:49:04,499 --> 01:49:07,129
We're mustering up whatever
troops we can get.

1494
01:49:07,345 --> 01:49:08,545
Going back in.

1495
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:10,609
So get outta that gear!

1496
01:49:11,812 --> 01:49:13,334
Get some chow in ya.

1497
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:15,099
There's breakfast in the tent.

1498
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:16,499
You earned it!

1499
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:17,866
Hoo-rah, 25.

1500
01:50:07,335 --> 01:50:08,735
For smoking light.
- Got'd you.

1501
01:50:08,741 --> 01:50:10,146
Got grenades over here, anybody need?

1502
01:50:10,223 --> 01:50:12,170
Yeah, flat rounds coming down.

1503
01:50:13,071 --> 01:50:15,992
Imlay, I think you could use this.
- Got it.

1504
01:50:16,224 --> 01:50:18,100
HE rounds.
- Hey! I need a couple of magazines.

1505
01:50:18,781 --> 01:50:21,083
Very nice. Very nice.
- Everybody got ammo?

1506
01:50:21,174 --> 01:50:23,186
Yes.
- Yes, Staff Sergeant.

1507
01:50:23,116 --> 01:50:26,049
What'd think you're
doing, Staff Sergeant?

1508
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:29,087
We've already had breakfast, sir.

1509
01:50:37,952 --> 01:50:39,325
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

1510
01:50:39,525 --> 01:50:40,744
Carry on.

1511
01:50:45,756 --> 01:50:47,636
This is Knoll Pet 23. Who's with me?

1512
01:50:48,004 --> 01:50:48,782
Morning, Knoll Pet.

1513
01:50:48,982 --> 01:50:50,282
Dog Pad 21, on your left.

1514
01:50:50,345 --> 01:50:52,598
Hear a friendly voice. Dog Pad 21.

1515
01:50:53,453 --> 01:50:54,688
This is Snake Eyes joining the fight.

1516
01:50:54,688 --> 01:50:57,617
Hiya, Foxtrot 2. We're on your 6.
- Morning, Dog Pad 21.

1517
01:50:57,924 --> 01:50:58,826
People on your right.

1518
01:50:58,826 --> 01:51:00,630
This is Foxtrot 2 November.

1519
01:51:00,657 --> 01:51:02,308
Let's take back Los Angeles.
