FORMER CIA AGENT WANTED
DEPRIVATION AND FOR MURDER

2
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,718
Driving.

3
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,798
Well done.

4
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,278
Come on. Continue.

5
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,311
Good game.

6
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,068
Stay on the right path.

7
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,151
Another pot.

8
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,633
Until Sunday, guys.

9
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,118
Good morning.
What can I do for you?

10
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,031
The question is
what I can do for you.

11
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,518
I do not understand.
Is something wrong?

12
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,758
I saw you play basketball with youths.

13
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,395
There is much poverty here, huh?
- Many poverty.

14
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,394
Want to confess?
- Confession?

15
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,398
I have not done a long time.

16
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,716
No Father,
I can not be saved.

17
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,078
Just you, me and God are there.
And I have a duty of confidentiality.

18
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,791
What have you got to lose?
Come on. Sit down.

19
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,271
Take your time.

20
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,396
Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned.

21
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,035
Forgive me Father,
for I have indeed sinned.

22
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,512
Go on.
Air your heart.

23
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,510
All they in the newspaper
writing about me is true.

24
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,077
I'm undercover for the CIA.

25
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,319
Continue.

26
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,993
I am ... a murderer.

27
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,592
Previously I believed that something was.

28
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,836
Not anymore.

29
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,034
Good work you're in New York, Mark.

30
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,909
Now Zarahoui dead,
walk the Iranians miss their mission.

31
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,834
Okay?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,753
And with your team?
- No problem.

33
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,072
I swore my country
against all its enemies to defend ...

34
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,555
... But the world is complex
to be.

35
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,237
We are at war with an enemy
faceless.

36
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,630
He is often among us.

37
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,274
The Redvale Corporation
Detroit is a large hedge fund.

38
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,797
They have over 10 billion U.S. dollars
invested in oil production in Africa.

39
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,396
Because they are unsatisfied
the local government ...

40
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,233
... They dealer
Frank Smith hired.

41
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,030
He must arm the rebels.
That Smith is a huge asshole.

42
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,029
You will make contact with him,
work for him and infiltrate.

43
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,149
And when the time comes,
Smith and disable Redvale out.

44
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,191
Agreed.

45
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,398
Marcus?

46
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,038
This may not be returned
to the CIA.

47
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,795
I understand completely.
- Maybe you'll get a medal ...

48
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,190
... Maybe you'll be sued.

49
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,871
This is for you.
Success.

50
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,116
SIX MONTHS LATER

51
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,715
I do not care. We have
2 million invested in this deal.

52
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,348
I can not help it if it's too late.

53
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,997
Tell him I cut off their balls
if they do not pay.

54
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,358
You're my lawyer,
I pay you $ 800 per hour.

55
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,071
No longer wasting my time.
Put batter in the belongings of that jerk.

56
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,436
Jane, how are things?

57
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,235
The money for Mr. Smith
African transaction is completed.

58
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,877
Fucking Wall Street.

59
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,830
Acorns that create the greatest
economic disaster in 80 years.

60
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,113
Millions of people lose their homes,
their jobs. The country is almost bankrupt.

61
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,792
And what happens?

62
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,513
They are rewarded with
a financial injection from the government.

63
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,956
Here we go.

64
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,034
The suspect left the airport.

65
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,958
Not too close. We do nothing
before he grabbed the money.

66
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,191
Mark gives us the sign.

67
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,758
With the bakery?
Is the oven preheated?

68
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,793
We are on schedule.
- At the minute?

69
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,518
On the second.

70
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,351
Everything is ready, sir.

71
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,399
"Punctuality is the politeness
of rulers. " You know who said that?

72
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,030
No, sir.
- King Louis XVIII.

73
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,033
He was a slimy bastard.
Obsequious klutz.

74
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,115
Mr. Smith and his team are on their way.

75
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,718
Everything is ready.

76
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,839
Would you even turn on the aircon?
It's hot.

77
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,833
That is all, sir.
- What louder, please.

78
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,399
Zander here.

79
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,271
Dietrich does not anymore.
I'm now in charge.

80
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,000
Christ.
Jesus.

81
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,188
What is this?

82
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,876
Is everything ok there?
- Jesus ... my chest.

83
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,198
Hold on.

84
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,475
To the hospital.

85
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,833
What happens?

86
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,878
It leaves its target rate.

87
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,072
How far yet?
- Five minutes. We're being followed.

88
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,832
Have you swallowed something?
Have you swallowed something, boss?

89
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,717
They do not lose touch.

90
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,234
I ask permission to shoot.

91
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,594
Smith should at all costs
live.

92
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,631
We get rid of him.
He goes to the hospital.

93
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,759
Backward.
- I'm his head of security.

94
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,957
Let the doctors do their work.
- I Can not count?

95
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,831
No, it's best all data
the patient register at the desk.

96
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,468
It only takes a few minutes.
Thank you.

97
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,029
Would you fill this out?

98
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,435
I'm Dr. Brown.
What happened?

99
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,591
My boss has a heart attack.

100
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,957
What's his name?
- Frank Smith.

101
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,554
Has he had previous heart problems?
- Not that I know.

102
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,076
Stay here.
- He's my client.

103
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,310
We will take good care of him.

104
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,440
SECURITY

105
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,796
Agent 1 covers the stairwells,
Agent 3 emergency exits.

106
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,829
Agents 4 and 5 take the elevators.
Make sure everything is searched.

107
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,550
We see something suspicious.
Will you make an emergency call?

108
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,596
We got him.
- I know. The emergency number is called.

109
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,478
We have to plan accordingly.

110
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,354
Here station. Ignore the call
the Detroit Medical Center.

111
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,398
It is an operation
of security.

112
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,634
There are undercover agents on the spot.
Do not touch. I repeat: Do not touch.

113
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,111
Do you wear a gun?

114
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,317
Yes. I'm bodyguard.

115
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,876
Want to give your gun to the agent?

116
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,999
Hospital Policy.
He will be safely stored.

117
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,551
How is it, doctor?

118
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,837
He is stable, he goes to the ICU.

119
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,956
Smith is in ICU.

120
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,235
Are you okay?

121
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,273
No. Do you have some orange juice
or a bar or something?

122
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,392
I have diabetes.
- I'll get a nurse.

123
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,870
Sit down, then a nurse
you test.

124
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,673
I will direct someone to fetch you.

125
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,479
But as you walk with me.

126
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,110
Thank you.
Why the fuss in the hospital?

127
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,637
We have a new wing. Today
patients are transferred.

128
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,234
Your timing is not so good.

129
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
Pardon?
You may not come here.

130
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,995
Has anything ever happened to you,
Mr. Smith?

131
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,596
We'll go testing.
Nice.

132
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,715
May I have the results of
enzyme analysis have directly?

133
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,516
We are inside.

134
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,515
Marcus is alone with the nurse.

135
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,957
What do you do for a living?

136
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,072
I protect important people.
- That sounds exciting.

137
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,680
Are you from Detroit?
- No.

138
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,079
Is it dangerous?
- Sometimes.

139
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,510
Then you will not feel the needle down.

140
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,636
I've always wanted to go out
with a bodyguard.

141
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,072
Thank you.

142
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,072
I worry about the man
I brought in here.

143
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,949
He had a heart attack.
Where are they taking such a person?

144
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,353
To ICU. That has not moved.
ICU is on the fourth floor.

145
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,715
Can you bring me there?
- Sure.

146
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,556
Marcus did you disabled?
What is your status?

147
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,917
Mark is in the stairwell
on the third floor.

148
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,873
Understood.
Kill him. Now.

149
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,754
I've dreamed about you.

150
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,757
I've dreamed about you
and now you're real.

151
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,399
Get me outta here.

152
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,033
From me, from me.

153
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,716
Take me with you.

154
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,153
Can I touch you?

155
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,714
One time only.

156
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,878
I will be careful.

157
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,028
I can show you how to get out of here.

158
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,318
I have never gedatet.

159
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,392
Dr. Green?
- Buy ice cream for me?

160
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,433
You know that red? And that pink?
- He looks.

161
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,993
The blue I find delicious. Dr. Green?
- I know how to get out of here.

162
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,073
Dr. Green, I need those pills.
- He pushes.

163
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,992
Above.

164
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,874
He pushes.
He points.

165
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,035
He points.
- To the wall. Against the door.

166
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,237
Are we the door game?
- You, there.

167
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,157
Where are the doctors?
They said they would come back.

168
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,239
Take me with you.

169
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,591
Agent 3?

170
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,315
Agent 3, answer.

171
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,877
Go to the third floor
and see what's going on.

172
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,388
You may not come here.
Want to go?

173
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,031
This patient is a threat to
national security. He calls.

174
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,475
Really.
He just had a heart attack.

175
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,031
We probably need a stent
artery in his place.

176
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,432
He may not be carried.
Marie, would you call the security guards?

177
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,830
I would not do.

178
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,073
You have no choice.
Your opinion is not sought.

179
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,156
We are now security.

180
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,950
Good morning, Mr. Smith.

181
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,756
We go to your buddies.
- Easy, Mr. Smith.

182
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,955
Give him something that gives him strength,
it makes me no matter what.

183
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,079
Do I need a man like a heart attack
epinephrine had it?

184
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,800
This is his death that I do not allow.

185
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,396
That you are.
As said you have no choice.

186
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,399
How long will this take?

187
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,519
He will almost definitely be a heart attack
get.

188
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,558
You ask me life
of my patient's risk.

189
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,909
I ask nothing. You give him a shot
or you get one yourself.

190
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,789
Floria.
Are you?

191
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,238
What's going on?
- The plans have changed.

192
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,994
Oh yeah?
Where's Dietrich?

193
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,915
Dietrich is dead.

194
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,871
What happened?

195
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,350
It's complicated.
Can we talk?

196
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,956
No, you want me dead.

197
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,319
I will deal with you.

198
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,836
Mr. Smith that we both want to live.

199
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,072
I will go through the procedure
he needs.

200
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,997
If he is not alert after stent
was successful, I give him epinephrine.

201
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,232
Calm down, Mr. Smith.
Quiet.

202
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,752
Demerol.

203
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,996
If he gets epinephrine,
he did not survive.

204
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,470
Why not just tell me
what's going on?

205
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,959
Where is Zander?

206
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,079
Zander has the lead.
- What?

207
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,875
This was my mission.
- Like I said: Everything has changed.

208
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,794
How long will this take?
- At least one hour.

209
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,757
You get 30 minutes.

210
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,275
Why do not you tell me
what the new mission?

211
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,678
We take the money and we lubricate 'm.

212
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,676
You can join or die.

213
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,958
Do not be a fool,
We know all your tricks.

214
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,598
There we are each other's opponent.

215
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,750
Would you no longer focus on me so
I care for my patient?

216
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,110
100 million U.S. dollars.
Come on.

217
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,074
You can lead a good life.

218
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,193
We have this whole place in our pocket.
You are in the minority.

219
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,514
The police will not save you.
You have no support.

220
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,077
That's us.

221
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,432
This is not about Smith.
That bastard should be killed anyway.

222
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,511
What is this about?

223
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,837
The system is corrupt. We risk
our lives every day and why?

224
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,268
We protect traitors and monsters.

225
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,999
We do have long
and that does not change.

226
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,508
This time they can get the fuck.
We grab the money.

227
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,315
Go see what's going on.

228
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,237
Ensure that patient survives.

229
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,878
If you're smart,
You can still come out the winner.

230
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,918
I'm going to a great new life.

231
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,433
I've always liked. I thought
you probably ever would hit me.

232
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,399
Say something.

233
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,430
I would like to talk to you.

234
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,189
I am the only one who is speaking.
Not very polite.

235
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,759
Got nothing to say?

236
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,357
I 'm
- I want him alive.

237
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,752
Hi, Mark.

238
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,078
You will soon feel better, Mr. Smith.
- Marcus.

239
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,872
My good friend.

240
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,352
My teammate.

241
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,750
Did you think your bodyguard
you would save, Frank?

242
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,479
He's with us.
I will briefly introduce you to him.

243
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,470
Agent Mark Jones.
CIA.

244
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,872
You are the mission.
We go off you and Redvale.

245
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,797
Look at him.
The perfect scout.

246
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,716
You've made the wrong choice.

247
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,194
But you know what?
I had expected.

248
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,318
You have killed Dietrich.
- Yes. Your beloved mentor.

249
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,313
He was like a father to you, right?

250
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,712
He would not support our plan anyway,
so we have him eliminated.

251
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,557
When this is over ...

252
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,671
... I will kill you.

253
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,793
For now you kill anyone.

254
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,871
We should go.

255
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,794
Time's up.
Put him in a wheelchair.

256
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,549
If I go too fast,
that is fatal.

257
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,680
Hurry up, we have no time.

258
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,552
Put medication in his pocket.

259
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,835
Hurry the fuck up.

260
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,630
Get that thing away please,
that's not faster.

261
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,314
When he was in the wheelchair.

262
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,712
Pick a wheelchair.

263
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,954
Come on Frank, we go to your friends.

264
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,392
He's behind you

265
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,712
Come on, Frankie.
And sweetheart ...

266
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,429
You go along.
Belongings, so.

267
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,080
Grab what you need.
We go.

268
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,878
Smith and have Redvale
revolutions unleashed more than Karl Marx.

269
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,270
And more blood on their hands
than many a dictator.

270
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,715
Yet the law protects them.

271
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,995
This is my life, Zander.

272
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,230
I've wasted a country
that do not give a care about me.

273
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,148
So yes, I am disappointed.
- Listen to me, Flor.

274
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,675
I'm busy with something.

275
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,239
Something would be good
for you and me.

276
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,438
Betrayed by my team
by the people I trusted.

277
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,316
We were like a family.

278
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,239
Do you regret your life?

279
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,995
Do you think God forgives you?
- No, Father.

280
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,712
I would not be forgiven
for what I did.

281
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,159
I sat all night in the car.
Then I realized ...

282
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,793
... I had nothing left.
My enemies had won.

283
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,875
When I was this morning with that young
saw play, I thought: Wow.

284
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,795
Life would be so simple.
I just wanted ...

285
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,990
... To follow you here.
But ...

286
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,391
... I realized that the world
would be better off without men like me.

287
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,955
I had to get going.
I would not waste your time.

288
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,238
Tell me what happened with your team.

289
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,709
That's exactly what I say.
Got it?

290
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,674
All agents: There is a murder
the Detroit Medical Center.

291
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:10,439
The suspect is a former
CIA agent. He is armed and dangerous.

292
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,758
What's so funny?

293
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,196
You're a jerk.
- What did he say?

294
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,833
That you're a jerk.

295
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,470
I'm not the one who dies.
- Yes, you do.

296
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,759
True.

297
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,436
Once he Redvales building canopy and
he is dead.

298
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,673
Once you walk into Redvales building,
you're dead.

299
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,874
He must still live?

300
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,593
It's just about your money.

301
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,149
It's about power Redvale do.

302
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,630
He is like the mobsters in Sicily.

303
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,588
They have billions of dollars,
but live in a ruin.

304
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,479
Rather, the power also.

305
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,950
It's about power.

306
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,591
What's he saying?
- Nothing.

307
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,069
Babblings of a dying man.

308
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,074
He will never give a penny.

309
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,310
We'll see.

310
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,118
Welcome to the Redvale Corporation.
What can I do for you?

311
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,670
This is Mr. Frank Smith.
We're here for John Redvale.

312
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,469
Do you have an appointment?
- We're a little late. He expects us.

313
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,949
I call his office some time.
One moment.

314
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,716
Thank you.

315
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,759
Would you like Mr. Smith and his guests to
the office of Mr. Redvale bring?

316
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,757
Follow me.

317
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,630
Hello, Mr Smith.

318
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,354
Are you okay with you?
- Hi, Jane.

319
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:49,272
I am Mr. Smith's bodyguard. He has
burden of his heart and not feeling well.

320
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,512
We had an appointment
with Mr. Redvale.

321
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,478
Of course.
He is on the phone ...

322
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,589
... But requires you to sit
in the conference room. This way.

323
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:37,275
Mr. Smith is there, but he does not
good and has many people with him.

324
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,836
I'll go look.

325
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,477
How are you?

326
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,078
What do you look like.
What's going on?

327
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,391
Mr. Smith suffers from his heart ...

328
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,394
... But wanted to
complete the proposed transaction.

329
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,272
Heart problems? You look like shit.
You would lie in the hospital.

330
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,112
John ...

331
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,515
... Let's close this deal.

332
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,835
It is now not so good.
I did not do it here.

333
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,673
I wanted to celebrate with a dinner party.

334
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,231
Mr. Smith wants to make
Handling today. Now.

335
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,512
Right, Mr. Smith?

336
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,956
Excuse me,
but who were you again?

337
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,553
Do you work for Frank?

338
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,556
You are much to speak
and I do not know you.

339
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,958
Where is Marcus, Frank?

340
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,271
Which was removed from his position.
- Is that so?

341
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,635
Well, gentlemen ...

342
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,712
... I do not like this.

343
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,874
I do not know you and I do not like
strangers walking into my office.

344
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,391
Spend some time relaxing.

345
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,230
Come back in a few days,
we talk about it. Okay?

346
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,155
There are no injuries to fall.
- What do you want?

347
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,312
The money.
Very simple.

348
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,070
Only Frank's share.
- Do you think right, Frank?

349
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,119
Unfortunately I can not grant your request.
- Unfortunately, you have no choice.

350
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,952
No choice?

351
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,152
Any idea who you are facing you?
I'll tell you what will happen.

352
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,869
Suppose you come alive here
with the money.

353
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,511
Over ten years, if you completely trust
your new identity ...

354
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,558
... And you think back with pride
what you have accomplished here ...

355
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,352
... You go jogging. When you return,
are your wife and children dead.

356
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,114
Then I wait another ten years.

357
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,909
If you still have not hung
of remorse ...

358
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,511
... I'll kill you.

359
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,835
That will not happen.
- Get it fast to the idea.

360
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,152
Imagine a room.
A room like this ...

361
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,677
Full paper trail ...
all your illegal transactions.

362
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,310
Now imagine me,
with the key to that room.

363
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,270
Who are you?
- CIA.

364
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,510
Is that so?

365
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,992
We love you and Mr. Frank Smith
long been in the holes.

366
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,788
In advance again.

367
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,794
I count to three and then we slowly
our weapons down.

368
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,159
One ...

369
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,398
... Two ...

370
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,877
... Three.

371
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,519
That was not necessary.

372
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,710
I do not like witnesses.

373
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,830
We go.

374
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,192
Run.

375
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,713
Call the safe and say that I am coming.
- Now, Jane.

376
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,150
It is good Jane, go ahead.
- I will do immediately.

377
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,119
Sam, Jane. Mr. Redvale is underway
to the vault with some guests.

378
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:52,469
He asked if you wanted it open
if he's there. Well, yes. Thank you.

379
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,712
Very good, Jane.

380
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,432
What is wrong with you?
- Walk.

381
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,037
Get out.
Stupid bastard.

382
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,998
Wrong CIA agents, so.
- Good CIA agents do not exist.

383
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,390
I totally agree.

384
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,439
This is your pension?
- Exactly.

385
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,794
Come work for me.

386
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,118
You would not trust me.

387
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,314
Hi, Sam.
- Is everything all right, Mr. Redvale?

388
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,237
Everything is in order.

389
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,198
Jesus Christ.

390
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,912
Open it.

391
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,556
Ment.

392
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,394
True enough.

393
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,588
Please.
100 million in $ 100 bills.

394
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,479
As we agreed, Frank.

395
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,119
This is your money.
Let your really happen?

396
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,629
Got a better idea?

397
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,674
They never come away with that money.

398
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,351
You think so, Frank?

399
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,910
Shall we bet?

400
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,873
What do you say?

401
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,195
I put $ 10,000 on.

402
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,557
Oh, that's your money, eh?

403
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:32,589
It does not look good for you.
I'm in favor.

404
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,632
I'm looking for Frank Smith.

405
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,433
Who has just gone to the vault.

406
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,593
Sir?

407
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,798
Damn.

408
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,756
I need your help.

409
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,912
Tell them that I feel weaker.

410
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,518
Fredo, bring that bag to the roof.

411
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,038
Make sure the helicopter is ready.

412
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,960
Tell us about ten minutes.

413
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,477
Is that you, Marcus?

414
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,313
You're trapped, Zander.
Surrender.

415
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,550
Have you not slain him?

416
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,508
Over there.
Run.

417
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,229
I had to listen to Floria
and you have to kill.

418
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,755
There is a lot of money.
Do not do stupid things.

419
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,479
Grab that bag and fuck off.

420
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,433
Is not that easy. There is
only one way and he goes past me.

421
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,352
You are in the minority.

422
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,473
You are alone.

423
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,315
Think you're in favor
with Smith and Redvale?

424
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,118
Now.

425
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:30,274
That interest me shit.
You can divert them from me.

426
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,513
I can not breathe.
- He has another heart attack.

427
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,399
Hold on, Mr. Smith.

428
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,391
Can anyone help me?
What is wrong with you?

429
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,198
Shut up.

430
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,956
He's dying.
- There goes another one, Zander.

431
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,430
I have something else.

432
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,238
Shut up.

433
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,111
Hear this, Marcus? Our doctor
try here the hero.

434
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,114
Surrender
I hunt or a bullet in her head.

435
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,316
I'll send you a packet to get you another
mind.

436
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,438
Last chance.

437
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,034
Take the money and fuck off.
That was it for you?

438
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,433
Throw away your weapon.

439
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,309
Throw down your weapon, I said.

440
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,192
On three counts
I shoot her head from her torso.

441
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,670
Let her out.
- Go on, honey.

442
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,639
One ...

443
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,116
... Two ...

444
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,956
Well done, Marcus.

445
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,435
Kick the gun this way, Rachel.

446
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,359
Come on, you can.
Now.

447
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,230
Come on, Doctor.

448
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,912
What do you disappoint me, girl.

449
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,158
Three.

450
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,599
When this is over, I will kill you.

451
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,676
Help her.
Call the police.

452
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,678
Thank you.

453
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,958
Gardian emergency in the building.
We need assistance.

454
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,350
Lock the elevator.

455
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,679
Come on.

456
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,152
Damn.

457
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,789
Zander?
Come on. Get the key.

458
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,237
Pick up the bags.
We go.

459
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,198
Come on.

460
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,799
Give me the key to the elevator.

461
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,116
Damn.

462
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,431
We're there, be advised.

463
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,754
Run.

464
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,516
Disabling Marcus Jones
has priority.

465
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,797
He is armed and dangerous.
Block the stairwells and elevators.

466
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,036
Inside.

467
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,591
I have spared your life.

468
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,391
You can half the money.

469
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,911
What more do you want?

470
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,838
I trusted you.
- I got the world to purify you.

471
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,070
That is always our mission.

472
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,789
No one still believes in.
Only you and Dietrich.

473
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,476
I was like you.
I believed in the mission.

474
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,872
I was blind, and now you.

475
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:38,875
I'm just a man who entered.
- Stop it.

476
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,152
I've saved your life once.
I will not again.

477
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:50,272
No sign of the suspect
on the upper five floors.

478
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,432
Continue to search.

479
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,869
There is here a corpse,
but it is not the suspect.

480
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,673
Where is he?
- We could not find him.

481
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,628
Why?
- We have searched every floor.

482
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,113
Is this the man you saw in the vault?

483
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,791
Yes, that's the man
who saved my life.

484
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,076
Take her to my office.

485
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,349
What a story.

486
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:58,549
Have faith in Jesus Christ
and He will lead you out of darkness.

487
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,952
Pray with me.

488
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,199
Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

489
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:13,593
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
as it is in heaven on earth.

490
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,318
Give us this day our daily bread ...

491
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:22,838
... And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

492
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,596
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

493
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,833
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and glory ...

494
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,073
... For ever.
Amen.

495
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,592
Amen.

496
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,110
Go with God.

497
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,196
You're forgiven.

498
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,232
Here.
